{"text":"Stopped by before a 17 hrs flight and what first caught my eyes was the decor and also they have a piano player and he was great. Nice relaxing ambiance before a flight for sure. 

Looked at the menu before walking in and saw a prosciutto salad so right away my mind was set on this place.

It was during a busy time 5pm a Friday so the food took a little while to come but not sure why because all I had was a salad with nothing to cook. 

Had a cocktail that was great and the service was good and very friendly. 

Got my salad after 30-35 min and it was good but not great. The portion was small for the price and very little dressing. It was disappointing but it did look good, much better than it's taste."}
{"text":"At the airport; we got here at 5am. After check in, near our gate, we decided to go to the first restaurant that comes to our view. 

It's a cute and modern restaurant. The service was friendly. I am used to big portion of breakfast serving in restaurants, so I was surprised with the small portion of my pancakes with fruits and Nutella topping. It wasn't savory unfortunately.

I guess it's reasonable place to spend time before our flight."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bit during a lay over and sat at the bar. 

This place has a great \"you're not at an airport\" feel to it.  The bar is very well lit and it comes with good music to create a trendier vibe to it.  It is a bit small and seating is very tight.

The young man at the bar was quick to greet and provide water.  I already knew what I was going to have since I peeked at the menu when trying to decide to stay or go.  

I order the Italian style chicken sandwich with fries.  It came out quick and it came out hot.  The chicken seem very patty like as opposed to a chicken breast and that was a slight turn off.  The flavor wasn't bad but a bit different than what I was expecting.  Fries are fries so not complain there.  They came out fresh.  

My server seemed to have taken a lunch break for a while which was fine but I became a little impatient along with another customer who left his cash on the bar to get to a flight.  He finally came back and paying and leaving was quick and easy.  

I would recommend if you are tight on time let them know you want to pay after getting your food.  For an airport establishment they could definitely improve on getting people's bill settled so they can leave when they need to for their flights. 

Overall it was a decent experience, better than anything else that you will find in the terminal."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and a salad at the bar from a blonde female bartender.  30 minutes went by.  We watched other parties get seated, order and get their food before us.  We asked our bartender to please check on the food.  She said we were \"the next table up.\"  We again watched other people get their food.  No apologies or eye contact from the bartender.  After 45 minutes we had to leave, hungry, to catch our flight.  Terrible service.  Can't speak for the food, as we never ate it."}
{"text":"Un incontournable pour moi lors de mes vols internationaux.

Surtout les matins entre 5h et 8h, ils servent de bon café, un bar impressionant pour shots et cocktails.

Un service rapide et courtois et des bons prix bistro.

L'ambiance feutrée et le contour et bar lumineux  vous fait oublier les gangs bleus d'il y a quelques minutes avant   :-)"}
{"text":"By Gate 53. Super great food and service. Especially good with Vicent as our server who gave spot on recommendations. Greek salad with chicken kebab, Med platter, poutine.... all were delicious! Def a great pick!"}
