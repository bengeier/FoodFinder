{"text":"Heard this was a good place to eat so went last night with two family members and had a good dinning experience.   It was St. Patty's day so the place was decorated in green, even had a green Christmas tree festooned with four leaf clovers!  My son got the corn beef and cabbage, my wife the shredded Bbq beef sandwich and I had the meatloaf.  Food was excellent, portions huge, prices more than reasonable and service very attentive.  Highly recommend it.  Everything is home made."}
{"text":"We've tried the summer salad, gyro deluxe, corned beef and pita and hummus. Everything was excellent. Generous portions, cooked great, good flavor. Very polite staff. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ate here on May 11th with a group of 5 people total.  We all ordered salads and all of the salads were good.  Big portions and dressing on the side.  The problem I had is that when I didn't like the ice tea the waitress was quite rude.  I nicely asked if I could switch to a diet pop.  I thought she would just say, \"sure\". But she asked why.  I then reluctantly said that the tea tasted like faucet water.  She said it was freshly made.  It took 10 minutes to get another drink.  Then my salad arrived with the green peppers and bacon that I asked not to have.  I felt that was done on purpose as did the rest of the table.  I don't go out to lunch to have a rude waitress.  Our entire table saw and felt her disposition change as soon as I asked for a different drink.  There are plenty of other restaurants in this vicinity that I will go to during my lunch hour.  This was my last trip here."}
{"text":"We Love The Greek House!! I work at a salon nearby and all the ladies order from here at least once a day! The food is always fresh, and they give you nice portions!! I am always greeted with a smile by the staff!! This place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant! WE (2 adults 2 kids) stopped by for late dinner. Excellent service and food quality. Fast service! Lamb gyros! We enjoyed full dinner for 4 under 50 bucks. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Always excellent! Never packed but busy. I've tried a variety of different foods here and have never been disappointed. Nice atmosphere, good waitresses, excellent music. Prices are fair and dessert is great. Your experience may be different and that ok. Mine has always been great"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast and got 2 eggs, 2 slices of toast, and potatoes with peppers & onions and it was $2.49! Delicious by the way! They were playing 80s music so my hubby loved it. Haha. Good service. Asked if I wanted a warm up on my coffee often. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This was my own personal review and comments that were provided by the owner. Definitely not too customer oriented and doesn't understand the concept that people don't have to like everything single thing they serve:

My review: (October 17, 2014):  The food that we ordered was bland. I ordered the country fried chicken dinner. The chicken itself was dry, the sausage gravy wasn't gravy at all (the consistency was thick and chunky, it didn't even pour out of the container). We also ordered corned beef which my fiancee said was not very good. We pre-ordered and gave another 5 minutes for the food to be ready for pick-up, a total of 30 minutes opposed to the 25 minutes we were told it would take. Upon arrival, I had to wait another 5 minutes for the meal. If we would have sat down to eat, I'm quite sure we wouldn't have had to wait 35 minutes for 2 dinners. We definitely won't be back, with or without a Groupon deal.

Hi my name is Dave and I am the owner. Really not sure how to address your comment but feel you must be really picky unreasonable people. We are known for our food and the sausage gravy is scratch made as is all our food We sell a ton of that dish and have regulars that order it regularly. . possibly you are used to the watered down canned sausage gravy served at the chain and most family restaurants and the chicken they serve that is injected with liquid to make it extra juicy but not natural. We are well known for our corned beef as well and cook it in house. The best I can tell you is that yours is the only negative comment on here and if you google the restaurant and check us out on ANY website that rates restaurants we have a fantastic rating.Sorry you were disappointed and thinking you probably shouldn't return. Dave"}
{"text":"Had been craving gyro for weeks and happened to be in the neighborhood, so I stopped in. So glad that I did, because this place is great. I paid $7.00 for a well stacked gyro with super thick gyro meat and a massive heap of fresh cut fries. Everything on the menu seemed to be a really good value too. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I have been to Greek House Grille four times for lunch and have never been disappointed. The gyros are authentic and carefully prepared with fresh Greek pita and homemade sauce. The French fries are delicious and plentiful. The Greek House has a really extensive menu with both authentic Greek dishes (moussaka) and traditional ones (fish and chips). I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is ok except their food.
I had the traditional soup with chicken, veggies and egg.  It was overly salty. I tend to eat more salt than others....and even I found it to be way too salty. 
The falafel wrap was horrible.  The falafel itself was mushy and pretty dry. It was just the opposite of the soup......highly under seasoned.  It just did not have the flavors and taste and texture of a falafel.   It had three small slices of tomatoes and 2-3 very small onion slices. These were casually put on top of the wrap......so u would get a mouthful in ur first few bites but nothing for the remaining wrap.  The sauce was also very sparse.  I had added green peppers to my wrap and those were chopped into tiny pieces unlike anything else in the wrap.
No consistency.  No flavors or taste. 
The only good thing about the food three is the pita bread. Nice soft and fresh.
That place needs better HVAC system. An hour later I still smell like fried food.
Needless to say I am not going again."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their Greek food. I also think I should add that the restaurant itself is really clean. The kitchen is open and I noticed the overall cleanliness in there as well. There was a lot of take out orders going on (which makes sense, because the service was slow).

I (should have) didn't order any of their breakfast items, burgers or gyro's. One in my party had the gyro and french fries (really good fries, I didn't try the gyro but heard it was good). The other did just a standard breakfast item, he felt everything was good. He stated he would be back for breakfast or a gyro again. 

Here's where it hit the fan... I had the spinach pie or spanakopita and the cheese pie or tiropita (just feta cheese filled filo dough). They were inedible. I took a bite of each, one I had to spit out, the other I was able to keep down, but it was just horrible. The server took them away and removed them from the bill, so good work there. The grape leaves were similar to what I have had at other Greek restaurant (never as good as grandma made) but same flavor profile. However, the rice was complete mush (not the right texture at all). The tzatziki sauce was just how I like it, just the right amount of garlic.

All in all, this is not the place to fulfill your Greek food craving. I don't like bad reviews, so I will probably go back for breakfast and update my review. Or maybe a gyro for lunch, who knows. Either way, I will stay away from their so called 'Greek menu.'"}
{"text":"Best corned beef in town, get it on a pita; I never had corned beef on a pita before and it was excellent. The corned beef itself was very moist and had excellent flavor, and the portion was plentiful, especially for the price. The pita was cooked perfectly and had a very good flavor, which complimented the meat and was not overpowering. Very nice! The waitress was very friendly, helpful, and attentive. I will be back again for sure to try more things!"}
{"text":"This is a real local place with very good food. The staff is very friendly. The gyros were excellent. The baklava little small."}
{"text":"So i made my third visit for lunch today and it was a great experience as usual.  The service was on point, greeted when we walked in and told we could sit where we wanted.  Asked what we were drinking when we recived are menus (which have changed since my last visit).  I went with 2 of my coworkers and we were all starving, myself and one other ordered a bowl of loaded chilli for a starter and im so glad i did.  The chilli came out hot with a good amount of melted cheader, sour cream and fresh minced red onion.  The chilli had good flavor not spicey at all which im okay with even though i usually like it spicy.  It had a good amount of gound beef chunks, kidney beans and crushed tomatoes, i could have eatin 4 or 5 bowls!  As far as my main courses i ordered a gyro per my coworkers recommendation since i turned him on to this hidden gem.  I am so so glad i took his advice, the gyro which is not over stuffed with meat like most let all the flavors shine, that amazing gyro meat flavor with that tang and freshness of the house tzatziki sauce (best i have had) fresh tomato and red onion with the warm fresh soft yet slightly toothsome pita made for the perfect bit while it lasted :).  There is no dought i will keep recommending this great family resturant but i will be a more frequent customer. ( but i still need to explore others to keep up with my yelp)"}
{"text":"Best place on the east side for gyros! The portions are huge and everything is home made and fresh. Service is fantastic and food is done really fast. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The gyro was amazing I got my food as a pick up order. even after not eatting it for 15 minutes the fries were still good which is rare. I got a pice of pie. it was cookies and creme or similar. whatever it was, it was delicious.When i go back they better have the same pie :)"}
{"text":"Cute, busy little place with good food and friendly service. I went right about noon, so the place was hopping and service took a little longer than I would have liked, but it wasn't bad. The Greek Burger with kalamata olives, feta, and a ton of roasted garlic was delicious. The prices were great and I'll definitely have to make a return trip to try the gryos and baklava."}
{"text":"My friends and I were getting near to our hotel but wanted to eat before hand.  Not knowing the area, I used the monocle feature on my Yelp app (try it out, it's super cool)  and I found Greek House Grille.  It's a smaller restaurant that's open in middle of the restaurant with a side room with more tables, probably made for bigger groups.  When browsing through the Yelp reviews, it looked like the gyro was the top choice....who needs menus!  Almost everyone in my group got the gyro and it was delicious!  A lot of gyros will add so much stuff that everything falls out.  This gyro had the right amount of meet, tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce and was gently wrapped in tin foil.  I was living on the wild side and got potato salad as my side.  I felt bad eating it as it was perfectly crafted, but my stomach thanked for gobbling it all up.  This was the perfect stop for our long trip."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place. It's very close to me. Gave the restaurant a call to place a take out order and they don't answer their phone. The hours of operation say, open until 9. This should be fixed. I am hungry.

Update: I still wanted to know what it's like to eat Greek. Well, it wasn't anything to hoot and holler about. Your average deli food with so so customer service. When falafel is on the menu it is hard to pass up. I wish I would have passed. Smushy, mushy, wishy-washy balls. Give me some crunch and seasoning. The food was forgettable and left me asking for more from somewhere else. I haven't even thought about going back for more."}
{"text":"Gyro was delicious. Fries were fresh and hot. I've eaten there twice and it's been amazing. Customer service is exceptional!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this restaurant a number of times.  I LOVE gyro for breakfast, so I thought that I would try Greek House Grille.  The overall experience and food, was just, OK.  I stopped on a Saturday, mid-morning.  The restaurant was maybe half-full with patrons.  I seated myself.  I ordered gyro, eggs over medium, breakfast potatoes, rye toast, juice and a side of Tzatziki, tomatoes and onions to go with the gyro meat.  The waitress seem a bit perplexed at my request for sauce, tomatoes and onions.  Once my order was placed, the wait began.  I waited at least 20 minutes for my breakfast, which I thought was a bit long based on the few patrons in the dining room.  Everything was hot and fresh except for the breakfast potatoes, which were well past stage at which they should have been served, as if they had been on the back of the grill, all morning.  Crunchy, dry and almost unrecognizable.  As I mentioned, it was just ok.  Not sure that I would rush back, anytime soon."}
{"text":"Gyro's are their specialties, and they were very good. Recline  the Gyro Salad for those who are carb conscience."}
{"text":"First time I have ever been here. Definitely a pleasant surprise in this quaint simple-looking diner. The atmosphere is relaxed, the service is good, and the food is delicious! Fries are hand cut and perfectly cooked. We had the Cheeseburger in Paradise (delicious garlic sauce and caramelized onions) and the gyro. Both amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Gyro salad and it was pretty tasty.  The service honestly wasn't all that great and our waitress forgot some of the items that the other individuals in my party ordered.  

I don't think this is somewhere I would make an effort to eat at again when I travel back to Ohio but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the very first time today.  Food was fantastic! This is the first time that my family have all ordered meals in a restaurant and all been happy, not a single complaint was voiced. Friendly staff, clean environment, great food and a friendly owner..... couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch. Each time it's been pretty good overall. The Gyros are good as well!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way from a customer meeting 
Found it on Yelp . 
Wow what a great find excellent food and service 
When I'm back in town I will be coming back !!"}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food. I've been here for breakfast and lunch. Both were wonderful. I'd suggest the gyro for lunch. It's the best in the Cleveland area. The pancakes are huge. You'll be lucky to finish one. One thing I really appreciate is the consistency. No matter if it's early or late, busy or slow, the service and food are great!"}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh, plenty of tables in the restaurant and the employees were friendly. 
We took it to go, and even after the short wait we smelled like the deep fryer..so next time we will call ahead and then pick up from the drive thru window. We are excited to try them for breakfast."}
{"text":"Was looking for some Greek food near Euclid and ran into this place. Had two great meals here and they've got a generous menu with nice specials.

The setting is cozy and comfy. My falafel was softer and sweeter than I'm used to and the grape leaves were soggy but I liked them. I liked the chicken skewers on my Souvlaki platter but the rice tasted like it came from a box and the corn it came with seemed out the can.

I have to say my beef stroganoff meal was so amazing and tasted like mom's (which felt good to eat being on vacation). Waitresses were nice and I didn't wait long for my food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came on a road trip out to NY. We both got the Gyro Deluxe with fries. The pita was nice and moist and the gyro meat was tasty. All of the toppings on the wrap were nice and fresh. The fries were also excellent. 

The atmosphere and service were both excellent. The price was quite reasonable, great lunch!"}
{"text":"Great for takeout on the way home. The fries are not good, but the coleslaw was delicious! It pairs well with the classic gyro."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at the Greek House for a year. Parking is easy and the service is nice. I always order a gyro with a side a fries. The gyro has a generous amount of meat and is prepared well.  The pita is warm and soft. The toppings include tomato, onion and Tzatziki sauce. The fresh cut fries are tasty and have a nice crunch. My order is always consistent."}
{"text":"Tried the gyro.  One of the best gyros around. The meat was thick cut and juicy, pita was warm and soft and the tzatziki sauce was just right.  The sauce has added dill which adds a great flavor. 

I also had their pita with Hummus and it is has a great texture to it.  Again, the pita really shines here as well.

Great staff, good menu selections too, and local owners!  Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL little HIDDEN GEM in Wickliffe Ohio!! From breakfast thru dinner to apps desserts and snacks this place ROCKS your WORLD!!! Greek is the specialty However it's American as apple pie! Sheryl takes excellent care of EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"Well, I walked in around 11 for lunch and two employees made eye contact with me, and continued their conversation. While I stood there waiting to order they discussed their weekend plans (attending a grandmother's 100th birthday party and a difficult catering order). After about 3 minutes one employee did greet me by saying \"Good afternoon\" while the other continued to ramble on about her weekend shift. Finally, after I set my purse  on the counter my order was taken. The gyro and the Greek salad were great but the customer service is a little shaky."}
{"text":"For a good place to find some authentic Greek food and dishes for those who aren't find of Greek, this is a great place. The staff is kind, they have great desserts, and the food is always adoptable and delicious."}
{"text":"We went there first time for late breakfast. I had the chicken soulaki over rice. It taste very good. The seasoning is a little light, could use a little more acid and garlic. My wife ordered the Greek yogurt with honey and walnut. It was so good. We ordered the baklava and I didn't like it at all. It was not crunchy and soggy. It was made with the traditional way with multiple layer. Service is ok. They really need to work on a waiting system. Friendly service. I will definitely go back to try some other menu."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was probably the worst food we've ever had. Our waitress was nice, but sadly that was not enough. The falafel we're nothing like real falafel; zero fresh herbs inside and the chickpeas were a paste. None of us could eat more than the initial first bite. Tzatziki was just sour cream with dill. Not actually tzatziki. We also got two gyros. The meat was grey and chewy. I choked down a couple bites, but ultimately we left our plates almost untouched. Fries were so greasy they were soggy. 

I hate to say it, but the food was disgusting."}
{"text":"At the top end of a three-star rating. The place is very clean and the service was friendly. 

We had falafel and gyros. The falafel was like none other -- and I've had falafel around the world. interior too mushy, but with whole garbanzos studded in like chocolate chips in a cookie. Not much taste.

Gyros was better, but I much prefer the meat to display the benefits of the vertical spit -- crispy on on one side. These slices were the same texture throughout. And while I don't want my gyros *too* greasy, they shouldn't be this dry, either. Gyros is street food, and it should retain some of that offbeat charm.

Overall, I'd agree with the tone of some of the other reviews that the food seems toned down from real Greek. 

It didn't help that there was a bigoted loudmouth who came in while we were eating, and the waitress and, I guess, owner, laughed at his crude jokes."}
{"text":"The hours listed on here indicate they are open until 9:00 PM. When we arrived at the restaurant at 7:53 PM on a Friday night, I noted that the sign on the door also indicated they were open until 9 PM.  A staff member was vacuuming; there were no patrons in the main dining area, and she informed us we could only place to-go orders because they were closing. Not a problem, but she was pretty rude about it. We went to the counter and we're told we could only order salads. We placed our order with a very distracted staff member who made it clear that we were ruining her night by existing. While we waited for our 2 salads to be prepared, I wondered around the dining room with my 3 year old and we admired the Halloween decorations. The vacuuming staff member proceeded to yell at us for 'touching the decorations'. We definitely did not. When our order was finally ready we inconvenienced the staff even more by asking for forks (we were from out of town, staying at a hotel. We didn't want to eat our salads with our hands.). It took longer to get the forks than it did to make the salads. We were followed to the door by the vacuuming staff member and she locked the door behind us. It was 8:16 PM. Don't count on them being open during their listed hours. The salads were alright.  The horrible customer service ruined our app"}
{"text":"Best   gyro   ever--with kalamata olives and feta cheese. Beer battered fish sandwich was good size and delicious. Both came with sides. Falafel was soft insides and lightly fried--very tasty with a cucumber dip. Extensive menu included daily dinner specials, Greek, Eastern European and German selections, sandwiches, and great looking desserts. Dining room is family friendly. Servers are kind and welcoming. Takes credit cards."}
{"text":"The Gyros are great I get them with double meat. The fries are good and the sauce on the gyro is like none other that I have had.
I have eaten here several times and I am very happy."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor to the Greek House Grille. I am a vegan, and always order the Deb's Special Gyro (vegetable gyro with hummus, I leave out the feta cheese). This is the best vegetable gyro I have found. Never grow tried of these delicious gyros. Very friendly, pleasant staff makes for a good experience. Give them a try."}
