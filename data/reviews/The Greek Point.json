{"text":"This fast-service restaurant opened up not too long ago near my place, and I've been there three times already. It's pretty much the same Greek fare you'll find in mall food courts, except they have a few tables for seating.   You'll usually find the friendly owner behind the counter dishing out the grub.  Their food is very fresh (they don't pre-plate their salads), and you get good value for your money. Pork/Chicken souvlaki dinners are only $6.99. The meat is well seasoned and tender, unlike some food court Greek places I usually go to.   It's great for a quick, tasty, inexpensive greek dinner!"}
{"text":"Order meal...answer a few questions about salad toppings...pay.  Out in 2 minutes flat.  This place is quick.  Not too bad for a quick take out meal.  Because of the speed, the food quality can suffer.  I ordered the pork souvlaki meal.  The meal comes with salad, rice, potatoes and a pork skewer ($9 including tax).  All decent but not exceptional.  Was asked if I wanted 'Ma Ma' sauce on rice/potatoes.  Yes?  No idea what it was.  Just seems to be some type of tomato sauce.  Pork souvlaki was soaked in a buffet pan of liquid.  The liquid kept the meat moist but also devoid of the 'fresh from the grill' taste.    Decent for a quick Greek meal but if I wasn't in a rush, there are many better Greek restaurants in area."}
{"text":"I placed my order online for pickup and received an order confirmation number (79b8bf60-2aa5), but the lady there said she did not receive the order.  However, I did see her throw away a piece of paper from the machine next to the cash register which looked like my order????  She said I must have sent the order to the other Markham store.  When I went home, I double checked the confirmation email and it was the correct store Markham West (8601 Warden Ave).  I hate being lied to!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible value.  I ordered lunch to-go and the container had barely anything in it.  The salad was small and sad. The food was bland and soggy. They are stingy and try to give you as little food as possible.  Stay away from this place"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night and they had no food left literally... Such a disappointment.. Not recommended  Went here yesterday... Night and day since last review... Food is good and lots of specials daily.  Add 2 more stars."}
{"text":"Greet place to have lunch or dinner for a good price, very fast service and healthy food . Like it"}
{"text":"It's decent, if you keep in mind that its a fast food place. Service is fast and friendly.  The food tastes very fresh. The food is very flavourful, and I especially like the rice, which is nice and soft. I can't say its the best Greek food I`ve had, but it IS fast food and pretty decent.  I shared a meal with a friend and still felt full-- the portions are pretty generous."}
{"text":"The Greek Point is pretty good but it is not filling. Gyros, souvlaki, etc does not really tastes as good as let's say ma and pa's restaurants. It's pretty decent fast food places but I wouldn't take my family their for lunch/dinner. I had their baklava too. Generally they are flaky and crunchy - there's was a little tough to bite into."}
{"text":"Bland boring food.  Shwarma is not real shawarma.  Tzaziki is tasteless.    It's cheap, but a few dollars more will serve you better at other Greek fast good in the area."}
{"text":"it's alright. Not bad but not exceptional. Freshness of the food could be improved. Sauce should be more improved as well. More vegetarian options would be nice."}
{"text":"Food is decent. I usually get the pork souvlaki. The pork part tastes really good. I have tried the chicken. Not my cup of tea, but probably because its too lean."}
{"text":"Not bad, they have daily specials but their food is mediocre.  i am kind of bias cause i live on the Danforth........ya so what can i really say here? LOL"}
{"text":"I just found this place and I'm very glad I did. It was open after 9pm on a Sunday and offers quick healthy Greek food. I ordered the chicken souvlaki meal and it was great. The sauces complimented the chicken and rice very well."}
{"text":"I purchased a daily special for lunch.    1 star for the volume of food for the price.  1 star for the salad that comes with the lunch.    Enough said."}
{"text":"FIrst greek place I tried in Markham.. wasn't impressed.  Place was dingy, server was surly and the food was average at best.  Good prices though."}
{"text":"This place is odd to review.  Honestly they have great food.  It's just the establishment itself that's a little iffy sometimes.  They invested in some booths which is great, but all their tables are wobbly and kind of dirty.  Today my tray had food juice and chunks on it.    I've never worried about getting sick though.  The food prep practices all look good.  I go here about 3 times a week and am always satisfied.  Just wish it was a tad cleaner."}
{"text":"Definitely will not be coming here again.   Came here with a friend, we both ordered the exact same meal, and she asked for a coke, so naturally hers costed more. She paid first with her debit card and I paid after, expecting to be able to pay with cash. The person working said that I needed to pay with exact change. She apparently didn't have any coins to provide change for a $20 bill, which made no sense to me, so I went digging for change in my bag. When we sat down, my friend realized she didn't get her drink so she told the employee and the employee told her to pay $2. Uh what? The worker was adamant that my friend hadn't paid for the drink and wouldn't give my friend her drink til she gave her a toonie.   Horrible service/experience. Mediocre food for a mediocre price. Dingy setting, it was bright and sunny outside and yet the place was dark."}
{"text":"Just remember that The Greek Point is just a Fast Food Joint...  Price is reasonable... they do have daily specials...and nothing really over $10  Chicken with Salad ($6.99) Saturday Specials - My chicken on a skewer is soaked in some warm broth waiting for me to order... I wondering how long it has been waiting for me to show up.... - no bbq taste... or just not much taste?  - Salad though made to order has mainly lettuce  Tables are dirty... the place is not even busy... why no one even wipe them down....  Greek Point is good for the students around the area if they want something cheap and quick during lunch break... but I don't think I will be back again...."}
{"text":"Salad basics: dry the veggies before adding dressing.  I bought a simple large Greek salad today for lunch. It started tasting flavor less and I realized when I got to the bottom that it was due to be fact that all the dressing washed off and was sitting at the bottom.   I paid $7.33 for this salad that had only about one heaping tablespoon of Feta.   This is the second time this has happened   Fail. I will never buy one there again."}
{"text":"As soon as I entered the door to this establishment, something came over me. Judging by the dirty tables, dirty floors, old sign and covered pots of food, I knew this wasn't going to be a good experience. BUT, being fair, I did not judge the book by its cover.   Greek souvlaki dinner it was. Nothing was fresh, as expected. chicken had been pre cooked and sitting in a metal pot with a cover on it, so it was very very well done. Dry and tasteless. Not fresh at all.   The food was honestly a huge disappointment. Place was dirty and dungey. It was in a prominent strip plaza but didn't look \"Fresh and new\" like the neighbouring businesses.   This place clearly doesn't get the \"point\" on Greek food. Won't be returning."}
