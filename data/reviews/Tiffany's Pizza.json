{"text":"I really love Tiffany's pizza. We order for work frequently and it's always been very satisfying!!"}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful. The food is always fresh and delicious. I eat here near daily and have never once had anything other than exceptional food and service."}
{"text":"On a mission to try every pizza shop in the Cleveland area.  It may take a long time, and cause me to visit every hospital in the Cleveland area as well, but dammit I have goals.  After trying this pizza, I think I will just keep on searching.  Don't get me wrong, not bad pizza, but the reviews  aside from Andrea just seem llike lies.  I haven't tried the subs yet, but next time I'm in the mood, I might have to give it a try.  They crust was ok, but the sauce didn't have much flavor to it, and there were barely any toppings on it either."}
{"text":"My work orders this pizza all the time and I LOVE it. Amazing pizza! No dine in, but that's fine, because it's just a small little place."}
{"text":"The girls and I at work always get Tiffanys grinders for take out at lunch!!  These subs are amazing!  I can never stray from the spicy Italian: ham, salami, pepperoni, cheese, hot peppers (banana peppers that are not hot...just the way I like them :o) red onion (no thanks) lettuce, tomato (hold please) mayo and italian dressing.  Their bread is made fresh daily and let me tell you these grinders are to die for!! Delivery is VERY quick and pricing is perfect! Grinders are $5.49 or they now have 2 for $10!!  I have also tried their pizza which is good, nothing to write home about........its their grinders that keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good food fresh. Just if you don't want your grinders too much sauce or dressing make sure you tell them easy on the sauce and they will cook it the way you want"}
{"text":"Love Tiffany's pizza! Not far, affordable, and great service. Try the pan size!"}
{"text":"Not very good pizza at all,  the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was it was so damn cheap.  But honestly I didn't like it at all."}
{"text":"My roommate brought back some Tiffany's Pizza today. He was working on a job site out in that area, brought a huge sheet pizza home. It was just sitting on the kitchen table, at cold, room temperature, so I tried some. I have to say, it was good. The crust was a little thick, sauce kind of sweet. I was a little hungover and this did me some good. I am very thankful and happy right now. I am back in the bed typing away with a full stomach."}
