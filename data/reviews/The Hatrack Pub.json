{"text":"While my knowledge of bars is very limited I am glad this place is near me. I had my 21st birthday party and Phillip set us up right, huge platter of food my friends and family could munch on, and a relaxed placewhere we could chat. They do not fry all of the food like you expect from other places, and it still taste great. My only complaint is sometimes they are out of a beer i want, but they make up for it with the others on tap."}
{"text":"The sign on the front says they have been locked out due to failure to pay rent. Sad to see the only well-rated place within miles of us go under."}
{"text":"Eagerly awaiting a new bar on the south side I was ecstatic to drive by and see the Hatrack had finally opened it's doors.   I went there the other night and it was a lot of fun. They currently serve wine and beer and offer meat and cheese plates. I met the owners Lorenna and Philip and they told me they were planning on expanding the menu to include more food items in the near future. The bar has a cool set up with an open feel. There are tables scattered about and also a big screen TV so everyone was able to get their Olympics fix on while downing a few brews. The bar tenders were extremely friendly (they even let me play my ipod :) and I was able to meet a bunch of people that live in my area. Cheers to the Hatrack, with Spokes being closed it's about time we got a cool bar in the area! Now if they would only put  in hooks under the bar.."}
{"text":"A decent little pub for a good beer, but last time I was there, they still didn't have a liquor list.  Also, as much effort as the owners put into creating a neat inviting space, it just seems a little too small and dark to be really inviting.  Maybe if I lived around the corner or if Hatrack had some sort of unique draw, I would be more excited about it.  I'll definitely give it another try, but in the mean time plan to stick with my other Laveen standbys."}
