{"text":"Good pizza. That aside, it's too pricey for the Champaign market and they close at 9 which is a terrible idea in that bar centric area. Also the hostess is to be frank, just rude. It's not Pizza Hut, really?"}
{"text":"Our group of 5 had great salads, pizza and italian beer.  This place has to be a rare pizza gem in Champaign."}
{"text":"We had visited Pizzeria Antica last week.  First of all, the food was fabulous -- all fresh ingredients, but I was a bit disappointed in the atmosphere.  The dining area was much too bright and uncomfortable.  I felt that I was sitting in a high school cafeteria with bright lights and larger tables.  I would highly recommend that they dim the lights and get more tables for 4.  The staff was very friendly, but needs to learn how to open a bottle of wine....and perhaps serve  the wine to the patron instead of handing them the bottle.  They had no wine glasses, just water glasses.  

Growing up in Chicago, I felt that the pizza was a bit soggy at the bottom.  If fact there was a puddle of liquid on the serving plate.  I would have like the bottom crust to be a little crispier."}
{"text":"It's not authentic pizza. Not thin enough, too much oil, the dough wasn't ready and crusty. The design of place is nice and they have very good equipment, but the cook definitely doesn't know how to make good pizza"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  My guess is the people who don't like it just aren't a fan of the style of pizza.   Because the quality is excellent.  But Wood-fired is obviously going to taste differently than deep dish papa dels :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town if you are looking for delicious wood fired,  Italian style pizza with great service!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard from many people that this place is hit or miss, and it was definitely a miss the night we were there. The service was pretty non-existent (our sullen teenage waiter spoke in a barely audible mumble, only speaking when required and barely answering our questions). My husband and I both ordered salads, drinks, and we split the margherita pizza. We both enjoyed our side salads and drinks, but the pizza was terrible. I expect wood-fired pizza to have a bit of char on the crust, but the crust of ours was overwhelmingly black. The toppings seemed to be good quality, but the tomato sauce left the pizza so wet that there was basically water sitting on it. It was just a sad soggy mess. Between that and the black crust my plate was covered in gray water by the end of the meal. I was excited about a new pizza place, but I doubt we will give this place another try after our experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh flavor. Pizzas come out quick and the service is great. It's also a nice, family friendly atmosphere, even on Friday nights when downtown is very crowded. The gelato is very tasty as well!"}
{"text":"It's been about two weeks since my wife and I ate there and I can't stop thinking about it. We each had expertly prepared pizzas. Just can't beat that wood fired taste. Keep up the great work. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this place a few times now and they've quickly become one of our favorite pizza spots in town. Their wood-fired pizzas remind me of those I have had on trips to Italy, which is pretty impressive. I love the crust and they use very fresh and traditional ingredients. They even have Italian beer for you to sip on.

The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is for the relationship between its price and atmosphere. You should expect to pay about $20 or more per person, which I consider to be a bit pricey for this type of food. Seating has a very open/warehouse feel that can get very loud and uncomfortable at times. For this price, I'd expect a bit more comfort in my dining experience. Even so, I definitely recommend you check them out. It's a great addition to downtown Champaign.

P.S. Make sure you check out their ovens, they are beautiful!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza i've ever tried. The flavor, ingredients, and the way they make the pizza is amazing. The service is great and the price too for the quality of the pizza. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Capricciosa, it was really good and the place had excellent and quick service! Pizza was too large for me and had to share with my dad."}
{"text":"Italian husband is so excited to find finally Neapolitan pizza in CU and they use quality ingredients, not the usual horrendous American cheeses and topics."}
{"text":"I love this style of pizza and I think they do a great job making it. I will say though that the pistachio pizza was incredibly over-salted. 

I give them three stars for ambience. There's a lot of underutilized space. The lovely brick wall is not emphasized at all. They're currently using their dining area as storage space. The lighting is very, very bright."}
{"text":"Reliably fast, good pizza that tastes like real food (as opposed to say, Papa Johns).  Perhaps a smidge expensive for what you get, but I'm never disappointed. I usually get carryout, so can't comment too much on the dining experience.  Overall, has a unique, family-owned feel that fits in nicely with the downtown Champaign milieu.  They will deliver if you place your order and decide to hang out at Quality next door."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after grabbing a post-work beer the week it opened. Given that the place had only been open less than one week, I expected a few hiccups or maybe some strangeness in the way things were working. For instance, we weren't allowed to sit outside because the cafe permits weren't put in yet. But no big deal, I'm here for the pizza. I walked in and at the \"front desk\" there was a guy at an ipad and two customers talking to him. I assumed this was some sort of host deal but it turns out you have to order at this ipad dude and then take your seat. Not my favorite, but again not entirely a hindrance to my enjoyment. I ordered a pretty simple pizza, something like a margherita, and a bread/infused olive oil plate. The bread and olive oil came pretty immediately, which was nice to snack on while we waited for the pizza. It was a little light on the bread, giving only three pieces between my friend and I, but it tasted pretty good. The pizza arrived soon after and I have to say it wasn't bad. It was a tad bit bland in my opinion but everything was really fresh and the crust had a good crunch to the outside. When I can go to a place like Manolo's or Pizza M and get a pizza just this size or bigger for about the same price it brings in a lot of competition. Then again both of those places are all the way over in Urbana and there isn't another pizza place in downtown Champaign, so maybe it doesn't matter for most people. All in all, not my favorite pizza place in town but definitely one I'll be giving another visit. One comment though, I really hate the inside of this place. It's extremely bright and there are just a number of large tables with chairs in the middle of the room. Not a very comfortable/interesting atmosphere and something I think could be improved. Just a thought.

P.S. I've noticed recently people sitting outside so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"This is it, Champaign finally has a legit, wood-fired, dine-in Neopolitan pizza destination. They've been up and running for a few months now. Who knew?! They need to get more word out in social media.

Anyway, they are rockin' two imported Italian-made pizza ovens, and the head chef knows what he's doing to make perfect, chewy, properly charred pies. These guys are on top of their game and know the rules (yes, there are rules to follow to make proper pizza of this type).

Special bonus: these guys pay a living wage to all employees, so no tips (unless you really want to leave some cash on the table which gets pooled).

Add these guys to the now three best pizza offerings in town: Papa Del's, Antica, Jupiter, with Timpone's, M, and Vinny's rounding out the honorable mentions."}
{"text":"I don't understand the mediocre reviews.  The pizza is delicious and the service is good."}
{"text":"Never even got to try the pizza. They wouldn't sell me a pizza to go. Who opens a pizza place and doesn't sell pizza to go? With two giant beer gardens right next door to them, you'd figure they would want to be delivering pizzas right to the beer gardens!  Nope. They just want to be snooty. Smart business plan!"}
{"text":"This is a great alternative for pizza in the Champaign area. The ingredients are fresh and high quality. The price is a little high but in exchange for non-greasy pizza with nice toppings. The bottom line is that when I want pizza in Champaign, I will certainly return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Crust:: soggy and chewy, definitely not crisp
Toppings: fresh and favorable
We did takeout and they \"delivered\" to Quality which was super fast.
Would totally eat it again buts it's a $20 snack.
Needs to be crispier."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Italian-style pizza in town.   I have been to Italy multiple times and if you want to experience an authentic taste of Italian-style pizza this is as close as it gets!."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times with mixed results.  Being a vegan, I have only tried the pizza listed as \"vegan\" on the menu, although they will gladly omit meat and/or cheese from any of their pizzas upon request.  On the vegan item, they are very sparing with the thin sauce. The olives and sweety drop peppers come from a jar, and the basil is generous and fresh.  I understand they source the best meats and cheeses and the prices may fluctuate based on the market, but this meatless, cheese-less, jar-based pizza jumped from $10 to $14 overnight.  (Who knows, maybe it was the flour.)  Maybe I seemed surprised at payment, because the friendly cashier then offered a $2/pizza discount and an itemized receipt. Thanks, Fabian!  

The dough is awesome when it is oven fresh, though it tightens up quickly as it cools.  This can be unpleasant when they forget to bring out all the pizzas at once.  During a dinner, they brought out 2 pizzas, and over the course of 20 minutes I had to ask twice on the status of the third one. From the confusion in the kitchen, it appears our pizza had been forgotten. I got an apology, but no explanation, and no follow up from the staff.  By that time, we had one fresh pizza and two cold, rubbery ones.  I'd cut them some slack at this time, since it was only their 2nd week in business.

Big eaters, don't expect to gorge on a big greasy Amurrican pizza pie for a small wad of cash.  These are dishes made with some skill and dignity, and we could benefit from employing these qualities in our eating practices.  I've eaten an entire pizza at each visit, but it's something to be savored and shared.

I really hope this place succeeds.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love pizza and after trying hundreds of pizza... I think I have pretty high expectations. We walked by this place when out one night to get a glass of wine. 

Returning a week later with our son, we gave Antica a shot. 

I can't say that I am thrilled we went. 

They have a nice atmosphere going on here, a well thought and organized menu. The whole place has its own unique and fresh vibe! 

But... the pizza was a disappointment. Both of us got the Bianca (4 Cheese) and my husband added sausage to his. Both were fairly lacking in flavor and the ricotta was cold in the larger chunks. This is a sauceless pizza, but the menu doesn't say that. With sauce, fresh oregano and more heat... it would have been stunning!  The crust is well executed and had a great balance of chewy/crunch. Perhaps one of the better crusts I have ever had (after Naples, Italy... but that's hard to match). 

This place boasts a authentic Italian theme, but this fell short in service. There was no serving staff. Just a cook and the owner. Neither of which sported a very friendly face... We never got checked on until we asked... our water ran out and we never got silverwear until we asked... even then, it was grabbed off another table for us (a table with people at it! #awkward). I think the table in the back was family of friends... because they got all the attention while the rest of the guest were slightly ignored. 
It would be a smart move to hire a super friendly server who will spend equal attention to all the guests, while fully explaining the menu. Smiles are worth more money than you would think. 
My last thought... all the tables here are for 6 people... this would make for an award date night... a few 2 person table would be a great idea. 

Just like the Bianca... this place is just a bit to sauceless for me. Spice it up all over and you'll have a winner. But with all the competition is CU... this place is short a slice. 

(**also note: this place pays its staff a living wage, so there is no tipping.)"}
{"text":"My review will be titled \"Nobody cares in Chambana.\"

I appreciate the occasional attempts at real Neopolitan wood oven pizza. 

But the owner is never here supervising the staff. 

The salads are sometimes great (tonight, for example), but often NOT. 

The pizza tonight is almost inedible. 

Either they changed the dough, or the oven is 400° too cold. 

As a result, the doughy mealy crust is unacceptable, not the blistered charred crust real wood oven pizza deserves. 

And nobody cares or notices. Blank stares responded to my questions as to whether the dough, the flour, or the oven has changed. 

Perhaps good enough to continue in Chambana, with its dearth of good food, but not worthy of patronage.

At least other local places are true to their style."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. I finally went on a Friday night. It wasn't busy, which I figured was because it was Cinco de Mayo, and pizza isn't exactly Mexican cuisine. We were seated right away, and the waitress took our order and was friendly, but that's the last we saw of her. She was busy playing host, gelato server, and dishwasher, too. Once our pizzas came out, no one ever checked on us to see how we were doing or if everything came out alright. Eventually I flagged down a gentleman who I presume is the owner. I asked him if we could have the bill and he said, \"We don't bring the bill to the table. That would be rude.\" I wanted to tell him that it was rude to never check on their customers again, or to not inform them that payment is made at the front of the restaurant. As far as the pizza goes, it was very oily and the ingredients slid right off the limp, soggy dough. Everything tasted ok, but it was pretty unimpressive overall. It's really too bad because the restaurant has a cool look and vibe to it. I'll need to be told by a trusted source that they had a better pizza experience for me to try Pizzeria Antica again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Champaign, Il. The crust is thin and tastes like pizza we had when we lived in Italy.  I like the basics so I recommend the margarita pizza. You might ask for a touch more basil. Maybe get some good Italian red wine with it."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Very friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere. I could, well I do eat here every week! From pizza to salads and gelato everything is always great and I am never disappointed.
As I was reading some other reviews, they do actually do carry out, although yes it is the best straight from the oven.
Ask about the chef's special..it is a treat for sure!
I would recommend this anyone who is a fan of pizza. Great location, amazing food and a great staff"}
{"text":"I really love eating here! The location is awesome. Been here many times, my favorites are the Antica Italiano Salad, Margherita Bufala, Pepperoni and their hazelnut gelato! The margherita (normal and special) are amazing, very fresh ingredients. Love the sweet pepper drops in the salad too."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I have had in C-U. Though the place is a bit hidden away and the entrance is a bit confusing, it is well worth the effort to to there. Went there on Super Bowl Sunday (maybe that explains why we were the only ones there when I got  there.) The interior is roomy and has a clean, open ambiance, (which is not captured well in the photos) Our waitress misinterpreted our order when I switched my original order to the special of the day and ended up bringing out one pizza too many, but gave us the extra pizza without charging us for it which I thought was pretty classy. The special of the day was indeed the best pizza (I think it was a four cheese mushroom and sausage) All the pizzas had great chewy crust, and very fresh ingredients. As mentioned in a previous review, you want to eat the pizza there at the restaurant hot-out-the-oven. DO NOT do take-out. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm picky on pizza...  This is fantastic Italian-style pizza with quality ingredients.  I will be back.  There is no equal in CMI for this style of pizza."}
{"text":"I'm new to town so I wasn't sure if this place would deliver, but boy did it ever. I spent a few years working New York at pizza places and I can tell you this place is the real deal.
If you're looking for a true Napoleon pizza this is the place.
The service was a little confusing as you order at the counter for pizza and then there is another counter for their gelato.
All in all it was a very cool little place I will definitely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday dinner on a Wednesday night. The decor was pretty minimalist, and the highlight of the space was the pizza oven. Personally, I did not appreciate the visible storage shelves showcasing supplies, but I could see they were going for a hipster-ish vibe. 

There wasn't a ton of people there, but it was more than the single server working could handle. The server was not over enthusiastic about her job and it showed. She would disappear for long stretches of time and she didn't seem to know the wine menu whatsoever. Additionally, she did not tell us that we had to pay up front, so we were sitting there for 20 minutes waiting for our checks and boxes for leftovers before we all decided to snag boxes from the shelf near us and go search for our server. 

As for the food, it was fine. The only interesting thing about the pizza was the oven it came out of. It looked like they tried to make the presentation nice, but there were things like plastic cups for sauces on our appetizer that made it look cheap. 

I probably wouldn't go back here because of the service and the fact the food was disappointing for its prices."}
{"text":"Adorable pizza place in downtown Champaign with great pizzas, Italian drinks, beer, wine and of course gelatos!  We visited our daughter at U of I during Dad's weekend and went there for lunch. We were extremely impressed, its very cute and staff is super friendly. The pizza's are amazing and do have the Neapolitan taste as another reviewer wrote as they are thin, bubbly and delicious!  We had the lemon and orange Italian sodas and of course espresso and gelato's.  The owner came by later to chat with us and we asked him about the tips after reading reviews here and he informed us his employees are on living wages and therefore you can add the 10% tip or you do have the option to choose custom and add your own dollar amount (just an fyi to other readers).  We really loved this place and will definitely be visiting there again when we next take a trip to Champaign."}
{"text":"Try Dragonfire!!! Cheese here is good, creamy and fresh...pizza not cooked (broke my 3 strike rule and still could not get it right)."}
{"text":"They never listen to any request of how you want your pizza . Service is slow , the pizza is decent only if you order there and it comes out at a reasonable time , when will you guys cook my pizza well done the way I ask ?"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and I was very impressed! There was no wait for a table on Saturday at 6pm, and the service was very fast. I love the rustic yet industrial vibe they have going.

I had the margarita pizza and my boyfriend had the pepperoni, we both felt they had really fresh ingredients and amazing flavor combinations. His only beef was that the middle of the crust was a little uncooked, but that comes with the cooking style they use (wood burning pizza oven). I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, but don't do take out. This pizza needs to be eaten fresh, even towards the end I noticed myself longing for the pieces I had eaten earlier in the meal"}
{"text":"First, the atmosphere is very nice. The owner and staff could not be nicer or more accommodating. We are hoping the food gets better. The pizza crust is too mushy, the tomato sauce is too sweet, and there are not enough ingredients on the pizzas. The salads are not as interesting or as fresh as they could be. Also, it would be good to serve wines by the glass and they could have a better choice of Italian wines. This place while not expensive is not cheap and therefore it is reasonable for customers to expect options. While we will not be going back for a while, we hope to try it again in a couple of months to see if they improve the food. We very much hope the food improves and that this very kind entrepreneur is able to make a go of it."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for authentic Italian wood-fired pizza. The ingredients are fresh and you can tell the owners are really passionate about the food they make. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and the pizzas come out fast! I highly recommend stopping in and getting the best pizza you'll find in Champaign."}
{"text":"Good, authentic-style neapolitan pizza in downtown Champaign.  The lamb sausage on the Chimichurro is amazing.  I'm also a fan of the wine and beer list.  House wine is affordable ($16/bottle) and they have a good selection of lesser known Italian beers-- though oddly enough, they no longer appear to be serving Peroni or Moretti.   

I'm not a huge fan of the dining space.  It's one of those big, open-concept rooms that just feels directionless.  But the outdoor seating is pleasant when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  They are pricey, but when the price is worth it, I will recommend it highly. I had a large gathering of twelve people and seven pizzas covered it perfectly.  They came out in waves, and people got to try different flavors.  

The idea is to have an Italian and locally sourced pizza that is delicious and wood-fired.  It is not your usual fare in the CU area, which thrills me.  

The owner appreciates the work in putting quality  food forth as well as the care for his customers AND employees.  Try to tip and you will find out how he cares for his employees.  He fully appreciated the small-town feel of CU and I hope that we show this place the same care.  

If you frequent Quality, they deliver there...but because of the way the pizza is made, yes...you will not want it delivered."}
{"text":"Really good authentic pizza di Napoli. My family is italian and I can say the pizza here is comparable to the one you eat in Italy. Additionally, the staff was great (mostly since we were a group of 20 people) and the gelato lived up to its expectations. 

The only negative thing I would mention is that I was a bit disappointed by the mozzarella di Bufala, it wasn't as light as the authentic one you get in Italy. However, I am sure it is because it must be hard to find here in USA. 

Highly recommend Pizzeria Antica!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. It aims at offering an authentic Italian pizza, something I think they've come pretty close to (and still cater to Americans who like a lot of toppings). The atmosphere was strange to me, very quiet and very brightly lit, but the staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"First, let me clarify my rating. It is an average of the food rating and the service rating.

The pizza is excellent here. I highly recommend the pepperoni and a limonade San Pellegrino. The food comes out quick, is freshly prepared, and tasty.

I've had mixed feelings about the customer service before and last night prompted me to write this review. I called in to order take out to be curtly informed that they don't do take out and then hung up on. Incredibly rude, but I still wanted pizza.

The ordering system is clumsy and there is only one terminal for the employees to put orders into. It's a little slow, but probably still faster than traditional waiters. It's frustrating to stand in line behind people perusing the menu once you've made up your mind. A second terminal could probably solve this.

Summary:

Highs: food - speed, taste, authenticity
Lows: there has to be a better way to do take out"}
{"text":"Delicious hand tossed, wood fired authentic pizza. We had one pizza pepperoni, one margarita and one vegan!  Wow. Delicious! Fresh veggies, great cheese and tomatoes, crust with just the right chew. Perfect. And the beer and beverage options are fantastic. I had a Genziana beer imported from Italy. Hints of chocolate and malt. Great pairing to the pies.
When they have gelato too. It brings back great memories of places I've been in Italy."}
{"text":"Upon first arriving at Pizzeria Antica, my expectations were high. I had just gotten back from studying abroad in Rome and eating pizza in Naples, so I was SO EXCITED to hear there was a Neapolitan-style pizzeria in, of all places, Champaign, IL. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The pizza crust here is amazing, the toppings are to die for, and the service is great. I have gotten the bufala mozzarella pizza all three times I have went and have loved it each time. They also have delicious gelato for all of you out there with a sweet tooth.

I really wish the ambiance was more intimate and that the service at the gelato bar was a little more efficient (there is no one manning the gelato area until you call someone over), but all in all this pizzeria is a great place to stop and eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular pizza. This is clearly the best option in town and already one of a very few restaurants that I will recommend to visitors as a must. The pizza pomodorini is currently my favorite. The crust is thin and crisp, the ingredients are high quality and fresh, and the ovens bring a dimension that you can't find anywhere closer than Chicago. Easy five stars."}
{"text":"Sadly, our take out experience was poor enough to warrant a review. The pizzas were completely different than in house-- undercooked, limp, sad, with raw dough. The toppings would have been good, but slid around on slick, soggy dough. They were sad but edible after reheating. Pick-up was slow and disorganized. The in house experience was a five star one, takeout was two, so I averaged the two and rounded up since they likely do more eat-in business that take-out, and it should stay that way."}
{"text":"Went for a second time last night and the pizza was not as good. Barely any sauce on the pepperoni pizza and the Caesar salad was very boring. We ordered two pizzas and by the time we started eating the second, the dough was too chewy. I also don't like the fact they don't have plates. Not sure I will return."}
{"text":"I can no longer eat Pizza anywhere else - I chose the Fungi with sausage, and the truffle oil, it's as good as it gets- plus, get it \"crisped\" with a little burn to the amazing fresh dough crust

We know he get the best of ingredients, primarily from Italy, and this is Old School - Old World Amazing

Occasionally, you see a really amazing Fuzzy Dog enjoying the food on the outdoor seating!

I love the Italian Sodas, and Gelato  - salads are great - place is super low key, with soft classic music, amazing place for a romantic date.  good for kids too.  buon appetito"}
{"text":"They've changed some things since the last time I came here. Now, you order at your table and you get plates / silverware to eat the pizza. I liked their previous quirky style more-- it was fun and different to have no plates!

But the pizza is still delicious. We had the Diavola, which is nicely spicy. The espresso is top-notch, and comes with a wonderful biscotti that they make themselves!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great- super fresh and authentic. The only thing they could maybe do to improve it is less oil on the Margareta pizza. 

The meat and cheese platter is also super fresh and authentic as well. They switch it up a lot which is nice! 

The service could be a little better- sometimes a bit slow on refilling water. However it's pretty crowded usually so that might be why! 

Overall it's a great casual-still nice place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is the best pizzeria in Champaign-Urbana! Their pizza is delicious and made from fresh ingredients. And the staff are super friendly and helpful. 

We were there for birthday of one of my friends with around 30 people and it went all great. This place is great for having your events with a selection of their wines to serve your guests."}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza.  Had the Diavolo, which was spicy but bright and not overwhelming.  The crust was chewy and firm and delicious with just the right amount of char. The pizzas are not cheap, but the quality is enough to justify the price.  Ordered at the front, and had my pizza within 5 minutes.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"They advertise gluten-free crust so my hubby and I walked downtown to give it a try.
Lo and behold, they were out of gluten-free crust. Argh! What a pain. And I've talked with others who have had the same frustrating experience.
We ordered the vegan pizza (not gluten-free) anyway. I took my trusty GlutnGo pill and took a bite. The dough was too chewy for my liking, it had the consistency of bubble gum. The veggies and sauce were ok, but nothing to write home about. In general the pizza was a little too thin and soupy/wet for me - I ended up rolling it into a taquito shape in order to get a good bite that didn't fall apart.
Our server did her best, but never came back after dropping off our drinks and taking our order. Someone else delivered our food, and no one asked us if we wanted more to drink.
I probably won't go back here, but I ain't even mad."}
{"text":"This restaurant has definitely gotten better since the last time I reviewed it!!!   If you want pizza in a sit-down restaurant, this is definitely a great place to go.   Heck, I think it's probably one of the best restaurants in the whole downtown Champaign area.   Everything on the menu is authentic.... they use 00 Caputo flour which is the best kind to use for pizza.   Everything is as if you'd find it in Italy --- the gelato is shipped in from Italy (via Chicago twice a week)... the olive oils they use are shipped in and even the tomatoes are San Marzano's!!!  The owner is super friendly and is great with the kids.   Rather than the traditional crayons and coloring pages, he gives them little balls of dough to occupy them while the pizzas are cooked (and they've greatly improved on this area --- we had our pizzas within 8 minutes of ordering!!!).   Once the kids were done creating -- he cooked them!!!!!  That was the icing on the cake.... my kids' faces lit up when he brought them their handmade dough creations!!    Even after inhaling their pizza (my 5yr old ate 4 slices in a matter of minutes), he was eating his bread!!!  And my 3yr old even inhaled 2 slices and still ate her bread!!!  Awesome.   As for us, my hubby and I ordered an Italian salad which was so flavorful --- the lettuce was great, the peppers were great and so were the tomatoes!!!  The dressing only enhanced everything else!! YES!    We also ordered the Cantalupo (?) --- it was tomato sauce, mozzarella, hot italian sausage and spicy olive oil --- it was fantastic!!! The crust and toppings came together beautifully!!!   And they even opened up a gelato bar --- which was heaven in frozen-form.   My son got the raspberry gelato which was so bright and fresh!  The chocolate gelato was my favorite by far!!!  My husband loved his salted caramel --- I thought that was too rich, but my husband said that there is no such thing as too much caramel.   

And for those who are complaining that they don't do carry-out.....you need to eat this type of pizza right out of the oven for optimal taste amd quality.   Eat a few slices here and take the rest home - you'll agree it won't taste the same as it did right out of the oven.  If you want pizza in a box, there's Papa John's or Little Caesars.....if you want great pizza in a box, find Dragon Fire.   So there you have it folks --- amazing, authentic pizza in a sit-down restaurant....in Champaign!?!!  Who would've thought??

We spoke with the owner as we were about to leave and he told us that he's competing in Las Vegas at the World Pizza Championships (!!!!)  with their signature pizza (the Pistachio -- I'll have to try that next time!!)  -- going up against Mario Batali and all the NYC pizzerias and other top places from around the country..... I'll be rooting for Pizzeria Antica!!!!"}
{"text":"After returning for a second time, noticed that the ordering and seating process is quite different. It's now in the form of a more traditional restaurant: wait to be seated, give order to server, etc. We were sat, given a number, and not approached for close to 10 minutes. The server (maybe owner) was super gruff with us, like visibly and audibly annoyed that we were unfamiliar with the process now, and came back to the table once during the meal. Not into it."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizza places in Champaign. The high quality ingredients make all the difference. I like that the owners are always on site and very personable. They're also in the works of adding a an espresso bar/Italian Gelateria as well. Score!

They're brand new so they are still figuring things out, but it's working. This is a perfect addition to downtown."}
{"text":"So I'm driving 85mpg down the highway and tell boy, \"Use that phone and find us some food in the next big city...in about 40 mins.\"   He says, \"Sham-pahg-nuh?\"   I say, \"Yeah, Champaign, home of the Illini.\"  He then spends a few minutes looking for food that I say can literally be anything, \"NOT BURGERS!\"  Dude lives on burgers and fries.  

So he says, \"Follow me for I am the Navigator!\"  Onward ho...he leads us to downtown Champaign and the whole town appears to be enjoying the amazing summer evening (Friday night).  There is a concert going on and there are hipsters a plenty.  I tell him, \"Wrong - those are college kids from the university. \"  He leads to me to Pizzeria Antica.

The minute we walk in I say, \"Oh - aren't we bougie!\"  (boo-gee for my lighter colored friends on Yelp. It a ghetto-fabulous word for fancy!)  Point of story - its not fancy...but I certainly didn't expect a 14 year old boy to pick a legitimately nice looking pizza joint.  

We are greeted several times by the college co-ed's running the place.  Nice girls...really great service and my 14 year old's eyes would tell you, \"nice to look at!\"  Point of story - the service was outstanding.  5/5....really, really, good.  

They have a fancy beer and wine list and I enjoyed an outstanding beer.  Can't remember the name but it was light like the Peroni's I usually enjoy.  (hat tip to the co-ed for recommending it.)   So we ordered a couple of fancy pizzas....about 14 bucks each for personal pizza's.  They were pricey, but they were WORTH it.  The dough was super fresh, and the vegetables seemed cut that morning if not that evening.  The pizza was fresh and fancy and amazing.  Not your typical pizza though, more of a European pizza...i.e. thin crust and cooked right there in these big red urns in the back of the restaurant.  Not quite a brick oven, but similar in function/purpose...point of story, damn good pizza.

Boy was a little thrown off because it wasn't his typical Godfather's (BLECK!) but he said, \"I actually enjoyed that.\"  Of course he said it with his pinky out because I had just said, \"Nice restaurant pick you big hipster!\"   

Definitely check it out and bring adults.  I.e. enjoy the wine and/or beer and stay a while.  The appetizers looked to die for.  I.e. antipasta plate of meats and cheeses looked really good on the table next to mine.  If only....  :)"}
{"text":"Love this place and we have been on our last two trips to Champaign.  The pizzas are delicious and the vibe is cool.  It is a pretty casual place so don't expect to be doted on by the staff.  If you want something just ask instead of waiting to be asked.  Get a couple pies to share, a bottle of wine and relax."}
{"text":"Deliciously authentic Italian pizza! The service could use some more work, but the pizza was how I remembered when I went to Rome. We ordered the margarita and pizza capriciosa. Both were made with fresh and quality ingredients. I felt as if I were transported to Europe as I devoured or pizza."}
{"text":"I first saw Pizzeria Antica, while visiting Cafe Kopi- which is right around the corner from it. The outdoor street side dining is very nice; I love the stained-glass and artisan stone that makes up their tables outside. Upon arriving at the eatery we noticed a large amount of people ordering and sitting, as we approached the kiosk we said we wanted to dine for three people and were told to seat ourselves where we'd like. As we sat a waitress came over to take our order; 2 Margherita pizzas. I love the minimalist decor and the contemporary atmosphere, it was very nice and gave the pizzeria a businessesque flair. We learned that they prepared their pizza in the Sicilian way and that they had to obtain a special permit in order to state this, needless to say the ingredients on the pizza were very fresh and delicious. The Margherita is my favorite anywhere. Yet the flavor was very very bland, the only taste was in the natural flavoring on the tomato sauce and the dough of the pizza itself- I didn't really care for it, yet I loved the freshness of the ingredients. Earlier, I'd sampled the chocolate gelato, which was so yummy. Indeed later as we left, I decided I wanted it. Though the scoop was extremely small, it was still equally as yummy. However, I wouldn't return. For what you pay, you don't really get in quality and I had higher  expectations. Delicious ingredients, everything else was just okay. Lovely ambiance though."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, Italian sodas were great! It's very authentic Italian crust/sauce. Service was good."}
{"text":"Went with wife and daughter and Champaign restaurant week was great reason to visit.  Unfortunately advertised special was not exactly accurate, the choices were basically pizza's that were $12 or under unlike the \"Any selection of Traditional Neapolitan Pizza or Italian American Pizza\" advertised on the Visit Champaign site.  Doing my math they did it so the total cost of the three course meal individually would not exceed the advertised \"special\" total 3 course menu price.  Booo!!!!!!  Minus one star.

We had the pepperoni, eggplant and sausage pizzas.  Quick turn around (good) although the pizza's were all watery. (minus another star)  I've had similar brick oven pizzas from other establishments and none of them have been watery.  Overall pizza was good and not significantly over priced, reasonable size for the price.   Seems to be a great place for a date or a quick meet and greet to chat.  The space was open and laid back.  I'm sure they could fit more tables, but can understand why they are keeping it the way they are.  Probably will not return as plenty of other pizza options and hopefully do not need to start dating again.  I think it fits well into the downtown Champaign vibe, which sadly is the same vibe I got from some of the Chicago area restaurants.  Sadly Champaign feels like it's becoming a suburb 140 miles away from Chicago."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but felt over priced for what you received.  The service was lackluster.  It was not busy yet our waiter did not find time to check on us throughout the meal.  We had to wait a long time for the bill.

Then it was frustrating because we couldn't just hand him a credit card and pay when we finally received the check.  Instead we went to the front register and stood.  Again, the restaurant was not crowded, but it took our waiter 5 minutes to come to the register. 

I would rather go to Blaze pizza and receive a similar product for less than half the price.  Will not return."}
{"text":"What a joy to discover this place. My wife and I recently returned from a month in Italy, and we ate at so many quaint little pizzerias like Antica. I'm a sucker for bufala mozzarella, so I paid the extra money to have it on my margherita pizza. It was delicious. The salads are great, and the gelato is really good. It was like being back in Italy for an hour."}
{"text":"Non-midwestern pizza - eurostyle emphasizing flavor not calories.  Fast service: 800 degree oven will do that for you.  Super good antipasti and salads.  Good wait-staff. Simple menu. 

Bad: no draft beer in a town with good breweries and around the corner from the Pig."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and every time it has been fantastic! Every different pizza we try is always awesome. The staff is always friendly. The affogato is out of this world. Don't leave without ordering one. We already have plans to return ASAP! Get over there, you won't be sorry. :)))"}
{"text":"Unconvinced.

I came in when there was no line and just one person waiting for his pizza ahead of me. Ten minutes into my 20-minute wait, I was asked if I was waiting for an order. (Yes.)

The gentleman who was boxing the orders showed the chef(s) the pizza before bringing it to me and showing it to me. He clearly knew something was wrong because before I could say anything, he took the pizza back to the kitchen. It was supposed to be a four-topping pizza that included greens and prosciutto. What I saw was cheese pizza with cherry tomato halves on it. 

The server went back to the kitchen and proceeded to dump half a pound of (cold) prosciutto on top of the pizza and then gave it to me to go. I was so exasperated from the wait and didn't have any more time, so I took it and left. In the end, the pizza was not cooked evenly and was lukewarm after having been handled quite a bit after coming out of the oven. It was not tasty.

While all the staff were courteous and polite, the service left much to be desired, not to mention the pizza, which was $15 wasted."}
{"text":"This is a must try.  The food was very good.  It is a salad and pizza place and both hit the mark. Sweet drops in salad were something new for me but recommend.  The atmosphere was very casual.  Almost take-out like, but the pizza was high quality.  Food more authentic than what you might expect."}
{"text":"This is seriously good stuff. We've had pizza in Napoli. The real stuff. And this unassuming little pizzeria does a really good job of getting close. The pizza is a tad oily. but delicious nonetheless. Go there. Taste real pizza."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Pizzeria Antica, but unfortunately their iteration of Margherita pizza was paper thin, soggy (nearly sopping wet and disintegrating in the center), and the top was somehow incredibly dry and bland. Service was apathetic at best. It's a shame, because they have a great space."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but that is all that they really have going for them. I was there some time ago, but sadly I think it will be my last. 

The service is extremly slow and terrible. We saw there was a meat and cheese dish on the starters. We asked our server what meats and cheeses were included. We were told \"well....meats...and cheeses are on the plate\". What? I wanted to leave at that wonderful description, but my parents were interested in trying the pizza. The pizza was actually good, but the service really soured me. 

Maybe doing takeout would be better!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Undercooked.  Looked like cooks threw handful of uncooked arugula on top of soggy, sauce-less crust."}
{"text":"I thought I'd never be able to enjoy pizza after having pizza in Naples and Rome over the summer. So I was pleasantly surprised when a friend mentioned the existence of this place in the heart of downtown Champaign. Tried the margherita for lunch and felt as if I'd been teleported to Italy. The crust was perfect, slightly burnt and chewy like how it should be. The mozzarella, along with the sweetest of hand crushed San Marzano tomatoes is just perfect and the pie is generously topped with fresh basil. Friendly service and great staff, I see myself being a regular here!"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here, and this time I ordered the same as the last time I was here. I ordered: the Merguez (back) - crushed San marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, merguez goal and the Diavola fresh Neapolitan pizza (front) - fresh mozzarella, Calabrese salami, Calabrese peppers, arugula, parmigiano reggiano. Both pizzas were phenomenal, just as I had remembered from the last time. Unfortunately, I have to give Pizzeria Antica only 4/5 stars. The pizza alone is a 5/5, but the set up on the inside of the restaurant was a little odd. Half of the restaurant seemed fancy, and the other half seemed unfinished, as there were boxes and ladders in the corner in which the wall wasn't painted. I also felt like the quality of this pizza exceeds the paper napkins that came out with the food. I feel like cloth napkins would have made a huge difference in the overall experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there because they have gluten free crust! The place was really clean and cool. We decided to sit at the bar to see the whole pizza making process, because the oven looked really cool. 

However, if you have celiac (like my girlfriend), or are sensitive to gluten then this place is not what you've been searching for in Champaign. The owner (earlier in the day) and the waiter assured us the gf pizza would be baked on its own pan. After seeing the awesome wood burning ovens we realized everything went inside without a pan. My girlfriend was willing to risk having her pizza in the ashes of wheat flour (she wasn't fooled by the waiter saying gluten burns up in the oven). Our bigger problem was the chef rolling out a wheat crust on the counter then using his same bare hands to top her gf crust. And the fact that it was impossible to retrieve her pizza from the oven using the \"pan\" it came on, the chef had to paddle it out with the usual instrument.

It's fine if they can't service celiac customers, we get that. But it was disappointing considering she had asked the owner ahead of time in person, and that the waiter was in denial. I, on the other hand, had the pleasure of eating the entire pizza all by myself. 

Finally, for the 99 in 100 this place had excellent, fresh ingredients and a nice menu selection. I can't say for the regular pizzas, but the non-gluten free gluten free pizza was good. :)"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Champaign. Real, fresh ingredients on amazing thin crust. I came here with a friend and we started off with a small Antica Greens salad which came with high quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the side. Although simple, it was full of flavor and very good. The small was just enough as a little appetizer before our pizzas arrived.

I got the classic Margherita pizza and although I probably could have finished it all in one sitting I only had half. It was very thin, light and overall just delicious. My friend got the Pomodorini and she said it was also very good. And this is coming from someone who had just spent the summer abroad in Italy having the best of the best pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty casual ambience, so it's really better served for a light date, maybe not the best option if you're looking for an intimate setting. Fully lit and has an interesting table arrangement inside. 

The pizzas are Italian style, so they focus on dough, oil, and fresh ingredients. The chef was nice enough to accommodate us since it was a quiet evening and split our pizzas up with an extra topping on half of both ($3 extra per pizza). However, there were original toppings missing from the \"accommodated\" half so I'm not really sure if I agree with the up-charge. Anyway, the chef made it a point to us that he is only doing this because it was not busy - so be forewarned that you may not be able to pull this off regardless. 

As for the pizzas themselves, they were quite tasty as a whole. Very droopy (largely due to the fresh vegetables) which is more so Italian style. The pepperoni and goat sausage was great, as were the other ingredients. The crust was pretty ashy towards the edges, which was not too pleasant. This is not burnt crispness that you may associate with other pizza crusts, this was literally ash from the oven that stuck to the pizza. 

The service was good today, which came as a pleasant surprise because I had heard otherwise from others. No complaints there. They also have a gelato station but we didn't check it out."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but prices were too high. No service at all and we didn't even eat on plates they give you parchment paper."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and each time was impressed with the level of sogginess and tastelessness of the pizza! I like a crispy pizza with salty cheese....The crust on my margherita pizza here was blackened on the underside, and uncooked on the top. Proved for a messy and unsatisfying eating experience. Also, service was slow and unattentive, but the ambience was great! If you take my review for a grain of salt and decide to come here, make sure you sprinkle it on top of whatever pizza you order! (It'll definitely need the extra flavor)."}
{"text":"I like this pizza! I've told all my friends about this place. Nothing fancy but very clean and upbeat! Phenominal tasting pizza with the best crust I've ever tasted. Very fresh ingredients. My new go-to place.  
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great place, wonderful service. It's the best place to get pizza, with top quality ingredients. The owner is very nice. By far our favorite restaurant in Champaign."}
{"text":"Could have been amazing - fresh, tasty ingredients of high quality are used -- but there was something really off about the pizza we ordered. I got the margherita pizza, which came swimming in a pool of liquid. The crust that wasn't touching liquid was really good but most of the pizza became super soggy. Also, part of the crust underneath had been burnt. I don't mean browned or a little bit of charring, I mean blackened and burnt to the point where that portion was not edible. The mozzarella on top was overcooked and rubbery. What a shame because with better preparation this could have been really good. Service and ambience we're good, just the skill level of the person making the pizza was questionable. We went during lunch time on a Saturday."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!! We had a cheese and meat platter, a couple pizzas, a dessert pizza, and then some gelato/sorbet! A very amazing place. A little pricey but for the stuff we got, it was worth it. The pizza had amazing crust (I got the vegan) and amazing flavors. I had never had sweety-drops, they're a little pepper, and this place has them and they are amazing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: Beautiful interior, friendly service, great beer & wine selection, authentic-style and tasty crust, and some pretty darn delicious pizza for carnivores.

Cons: Not enough vegetarian options (2 by my count?), menus given in person didn't match menu on the wall, which was confusing, and the price seemed a big high for what it was.

Side note... why did the payment system default to a 10% tip for an eat-in restaurant for table service?  It really should default to 15 or 18, like every other eat-in restaurant I've gone to."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is super fresh and good. The staff is amazing too. Stayed until well after they closed finishing up with no hassle at all."}
{"text":"I really love this pizza. It's more of an Italian style pizza. The ingredients are all fresh too. I was really surprised when I ordered their gluten-free crust how delicious it was. It definitely is the closest to actual gluten-y pizza crust that I've ever found. I think this is going to be my new favorite gf pizza place."}
{"text":"Don't call for carryout - they won't do that (\"wouldn't be hot enough\" or some crap like that.) Maybe these hipsters' pizza is any good, but given their authentically twee business model, I won't be finding out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the Antica Caesar Salad and a pepperoni pizza; both were great! The salad could have been a little be flavorful but 4/5. The pizza was amazing, full of flavor and the crust was perfect. We also shared the pesca iced tea-very good. The place is surprisingly large but we came in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday so there weren't many people here. We waited around a while for our check but then were told we pay at the register...not sure if they just do this during non-peak hours or not."}
{"text":"Their pizza is nothing like the pizzas you have had so far. It is a pleasant environment with great staff and food. Also, great place for big groups."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian pizza in champaign, it's also very quiet. The only shortcoming is parking."}
{"text":"We are really enjoying having this restaurant added to the CU scene. Only way better for us would be to have it in Urbana!!  Have been there  at least 4 times since opened. Love the pizzas,the salads and the people!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great (much improved from when they opened) and they use great ingredients. Give Pizza Antica a try. It is worth it. Informal and warm environment. Great if you have kids!"}
{"text":"A decent Neapolitan pizza joint, if not exceptional.  A spacious and open dinning area, with two of those Stefano Ferrara wood fired ovens.  There was nobody here during lunch, but oh well.  Service was on top of things, and the pizza came out quick.

I would rate the pizza here about a 3.5.  Good, filling, an well made.  Though I think I have had better from this style.  The dough was good, the toppings where fresh, but I felt it did not come out perfectly bubbly and piping hot.  Regardless, like I said above, good but not exceptional.  It is a good lunch spot downtown, though a bit expensive.  I am aware that this style is all about the quality of ingredients, which can be a bit pricey.  Stills seems up there though, and I hope they typically have a bigger lunch crowd.  I would assume so during the school year.  Anyway, well worth a shot, and a place I can see myself coming back to on occasion."}
{"text":"No line when we got here, but a few people sitting at tables inside. Ordering was easy, and we sat down at a half table half booth near the front. They are going for the industrial feel with cement floors and a brick wall. Food took 35 minutes to come out. One pizza was enough for 2, but if you're hungry, count on eating your own. I agree with other commentors about the \"drizzle\" of oil on top...too much."}
{"text":"A good pizza place is what downtown Champaign has needed and Pizzeria Antica definitely delivers. The crust is obviously the star here. Chewy, slightly burnt, great flavor. The food is five stars. 

Ambiance leaves a little to be desired. The open kitchen, exposed brick walls, and simple modern tables are nice, but it's far too bright. Ordering wasn't bad but if I wanted another beer I would've had to wait in quite a long line to get it. 

In previous reviews this place has gotten a bad rap for pricing, but I don't think it's bad. There was no option to tip so that alone saves roughly five to ten dollars depending on your order. This isn't a big chain joint so you can't expect those prices."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!! The pizza is delicious, the staff is phenomenal, the shop is too cool!!!! I got carry out yesterday and am back with friends dining in the afternoon! The vegan is so perfection! Sweetheart drops are the reason I exist!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice relaxing atmosphere and they had a vegan pizza option on the menu! The staff was super nice and my vegan pizza was good. The dough was delicious. They have bottled Italian beer, too. My gf loved her vegetarian pizza with cheese, as well."}
{"text":"Having not been to Italy I can't make a comparison but I can say the food we had here was wonderful. Great salad, pizza, and gelato! The waitress was friendly and helpful. Service was very quick - the pizza was out before we finished our salads. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"The poker group approves. Nice ambiance, old world smell, wood fired pizza, no tipping policy. We will return. We felt like we were in either Brooklyn or Italy. Nice urban industrial feel."}
{"text":"Champaign may not be known for its pizza, but any college town will breed it's own sort of pizza culture. In this town, there is a war of hand tossed, fresh ingredient pizzas with fairly normal hours vs conglomerate cheap pizza open late. Antica can be added to the former, with freshly made crust, wood fired pizza, and fresh toppings like artichokes and prosciutto. This combination sounds like a pizza lover's dream. However, Antica can't seem to deliver (no pun intended) on this revelry. Situated in the heart  of the bar district, Antica has a beautiful and bright open seating layout and cheerful staff. 11\" pizzas vary by toppings with options for salad, gelato, and wine. The pizza, coming to about $14-17, has a slightly charred crust with its bread being the star of the show. My toppings wet this magnificent yeasty treasure so I ended up swallowing a slightly soggy limp slice. The flavors were not particularly present and sauce was pretty much non existent. I so want for this establishment to do well but to satisfy my cravings, and compete with Esquire, Pizza M, and cheaper options, they will have to figure out how to present a slice to write home about. 

I wish them the best and will revisit once they're open for a while longer."}
{"text":"Craving pizza and here we came!! The restaurant is very roomy and has a modern chic atmosphere.

I got the pizza with spicy salami. It was topped with arugula which added freshness to the dish. Their pizzas are different in that they don't use marinara sauce, there's only cheese! The mozzarella tasted like it was very good quality. I also loved the thin crust. The salami was crispy and added some great meaty flavor to the pizza.

My bf's eggplant pizza was also delicious. Basically the same as mine but topped with veggies. Everything combined so well flavorfully.

One pizza for each person is enough to get you pretty dang full. I had 2 slices leftover. I love how their pizzas didn't make me feel too heavy afterwards. They also cook their pizzas in a wood oven so that made the crust taste rustic. The restaurant has a great and different take on pizzas that I normally eat!"}
{"text":"Hmmm let's see, I ordered the margherita pizza! It was ok it needed a bit more seasoning!  My daughter ordered a gelato which was pretty yummy only problem It was the size of a jumbo gumball !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! As an Italian, I could not believe that these guys are making every day delicious pizza in a perfect Napoli style. But the absolutely are. And it's not just that: the environment is friendly and relaxed, making you feel like at home. In summary: here you can find amazing Italian pizza and starters, without the useless formalism of other so-called Italian restaurants, which for me represents the best combination. A nice plus? The imported Italian beer and wine."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.
Honestly, it's average. 
I realize we don't live in Champaign and our Chicago based palate may be a bit biased but we LOVE pizza. All types. We were hoping for a lovely experience so even the scary prices didn't fend us off. $14 for a personal size pizza and $3 for a can of Italian soda? Ooof! 
The flavors were definitely bland. 
Of the four pizzas we ordered only the most standard satisfied- pepperoni! 
I will say their dough is very good, the only problem being it is served so hot on a metal plate so it doesn't have space to breathe and gets soggy so very fast :/ 
The steep prices aren't helped by the fact that this place is self serve. You grab your own plates and your own utensils as well as glasses. Cool cafeteria concept, minus the cafeteria prices.
If you live there and have few options plus are used to the oddly expensive food, I guess this is great. 
Or you could save your money and come up by Chi for the weekend and have something better :)"}
{"text":"Delicious in every way. Downside was that cheese kept falling off. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place.  Authentic wood fired pizza out of gorgeous ovens at 1000 degrees.  it's the real deal.  great wine selection and super kid friendly.  I hate to let you in on this secret but if you're looking for a place on friday night when everywhere is packed and you have little ones this is your place.  SUPER KID FRIENDLY!  they give each kid some dough to play with and there's wooden toys you can ride around the restaurant and no one bats an eye.  and gelato. there's gelato!"}
{"text":"Delish! Lovely little spot with the friendliest owner and staff! Perfectly fired pizza!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
As part of my quest to eat at all of the new restaurants in Chamabana, I found myself here for lunch early Sunday morning with my son. Don't get me wrong the pizza is very fresh with quality ingredients, but for the price you pay compared to Blaze and Pie Guys, you are paying almost double. So really this is a 2 star for value and 3 for the pizza for the reason below.
1. Entrance- Very confusing. It was an architecture office previously. There is a large door that faces the register that has a giant sign handicap. Only when you look around do you realize there is a side door to enter in
2. Ordering- you do this in a foyer area which the handicap door drops you right into this room. The menu is on the wall and you order from an ipad. If you know what you want this will be quick if not based on the other reviews you maybe stuck behind someone ordering
3. Tables- large cafeteria style tables except for a few in the back. Also seats to watch while your pizza is cooked. Again confusing there is a long hallway behind the register which you are suppose to take and then glass doors that empty into the back of the restaurant
4. Pizza- Yes the ingredients are fresh. I went with the pepperoni pizza to keep it simple. It will take more than the 90 seconds reported time to make your pizza. Second after the pepperoni heats up it curls up into a cup filled with oil which is quite messy. Third and the most important is that the crust is amazingly thin and crunchy, however after you take the first slice there was a gush of liquid coming either from the cheese or toppings that just fills up the bottom of the plate making the amazing crust now soggy and messy. 
All and all for 15 dollars for a small brick oven thin crust pizza is simply overpriced. Yes it is tasty, but it has many pitfalls as well.

Pros: Fresh premium ingredients, cooked to order, plenty of seating. No need for tip.

Cons: Very confusing restaurant layout, expensive, an amazing crust that becomes soggy from either the cheese or other toppings (happens after you take that first slice). Slow service.

Hidden deals:
None

Health code rating: A. Very clean and modern. No inspection report available online yet."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza place in town. The pizzas were delicious, the crusts were thin, crispy (you can tell their pizzas are baked in wood fired oven) and a bit chewy (in a good way). The tomato sauce was really juicy and fresh. The diavola pizza was our favorite. They have a good selection of wines and beers, too. The place is also spacious & kids friendly."}
{"text":"I finally gave this place another chance after the last time I came in when the hostess was very rude. I came in here and the lady who helped me was SO nice. My food was ready in about 10 minutes. I loved their salad and their fresh olive oils! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Are here with the family. Staff was nice, place was clean and new. Pizzas were ok - but the price was not. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Fine artisan pizza right here in Champaign.  Nice service, great crust and interesting fixings."}
{"text":"I had waited quite awhile before I tried this place out after hearing mixed reviews from friends. But after finally checking it out, I have mixed feelings too.

As far as the food itself goes, my pizza with burrata was super watery in the middle and made the crust really limp and doughy. It was not great, unfortunately. My fiancees was fine, but his had lots of meat, something I'm not a fan of. The vegetarian options were lacking, especially when the cheese option was so watery.

The pricing is also odd. I know they are raised to include tips for their staff and I know they're using premium ingredients, but it still seems like the value is off.

The atmosphere is nice enough, but I feel like it's too casual, especially in comparison with the prices and menu.

I'll give it another shot soon and see if anything changes, but for now, there are too many other pizza spots in town that would suit me just fine."}
{"text":"CONS:
Over promise, under deliver.
Way over priced.
Pizza tastes good, but falls apart.
\"Gourmet\" ingredients, but very very sparing.


PROS:
Nice music.
The pizza came out fast.

Oh, and I was brought here with someone else paying."}
