{"text":"Good Eats. I had the Jerk chicken, rice and peas, steam vegetables and stew chicken gravy."}
{"text":"Two years and it is still the same: more bone than meat. That $5.65 for rice and vegetables with literally two fingers worth of chicken meat.   Taste is really good authentic Jamaican and when locals and Jamaicans flock this restaurant you know its good.    My only qualm is the kiddy portion; note that I am a frequent customer of lunch specials and I know what a 'lunch special' portion should be like. I had to eat a ratio of one 'meat' to three scoops of rice.  Maybe I just got the 'lucky' portion but that is one wasted pilgrimage."}
{"text":"more bone than meat. small chinsey portions. the staff are more concerned with socializing with friends than patrons waiting to get their food on their 1 hour or 30 min lunches despite the restaurant being empty. There is better jerk to be had elsewhere."}
