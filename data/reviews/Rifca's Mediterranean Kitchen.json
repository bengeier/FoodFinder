{"text":"It was last lazy Saturday afternoon. Strangely we stopped at this corner dinner. Not very people inside the restaurant, and couple people was waiting in front of us.   First thing i notice that the food inside the counter is  very fresh and there's only a old man behind the counter. It seems like a family restaurant to me.   I ordered the lamb dinner and my partner ordered chicken souvlaki.   It's cooked right before our eyes, with flash salad, Mediterranean rice and cooked potato.   The meat, both lamb and chicken was grilled to the perfection. Very tender and taste is inside the meat. Delicious!   Both of us clear our plate like we never ate before. It was that good.   Later we got a rice pudding to eat at home. It taste just like it should, home made! Not very sweet, but plenty of rice. Very very tasty. Wished that we brought more.   All in all, it was 30 dollars in total. Since we paid at the counter after the meal and didn't even have a chance to leave the tip.   Right before we left around 5PM, the place started to get crowded.   No need to get to the greek town to get good greek food anymore.   Definitely going to visit again and again!"}
{"text":"Just finished ordering some tradeshow goods from Embroid Me next door and needed to grab lunch so decided with my colleague to hop in.  My bad for not knowing your protocol of ordering food, as most places I went straight to the cashier and paid and ordered who told me to go to the guy who was the cook I guess the owner? or a disgruntled looking employee. As I told him what I ordered he asked me again if i paid, then asked the cashier which I said yes. lectured me for not ordering first before paying. Sorry for wanting to pay first sheesh, then as my colleague ordered he was talking random bull shit.   Finally after making my shawarma decides he wants to speak to his daughter? while holding my sandwich in one hand, NO GLOVES, talking and talking or lecturing her too, before even bagging my sandwich with a this for you? lmfao   First experience, last experience, if you don't like running a business then don't especially one that is catered to the SERVICE area. Not the best shawarma especially since it was served to me with attitude and bull shit. If you are going to own a business, treat people with respect Mr. Cook in the kitchen. Much better Shawarma and AMAZING service such as Pitalicious by Woodbine & 14th area. They make amazing food served with amazing SERVICE. Service keeps people coming back, attitude and showing you hate what you do doesn't keep your clients.   Remember businesses: you are only as successful as how you treat your clientele and that is coming from someone who runs a SUCCESSFUL business!!  Will never be back for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to Rifca's to get my Sharwma's for a couple years now. Honestly the best place in the area. Owner and staff are all friendly and food is always fresh. Occasionally a bit of a wait but nothing not to be expected."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in the GTA by a long shot. Juicy meat, thin crispy pita, excellent sauces. It's the same guy making my sandwich every time.  Highly recommended over Hannah's or Joe's."}
{"text":"Wow, I used to absolutely love this place. I would come here at least twice a month. I haven't been back in the area for about 6 to 8 months and decided to pop in once again.   I'm not sure who the surly guy at the grill is (baseball cap, slim, s&p hair), but he needs some serious lessons on how to interact with his customers. Rude, gruff and disinterested. I ordered the large chicken shawarma, which used to be fantastic. He didn't ask me about sauces, and only threw bits and pieces of some of the toppings inside. I went to grab a drink out of the cooler and came back and my shawarma was ready to go. These things usually get grilled for a good couple of minutes. He didn't even heat up the meat on the grill! It also is about half the size of the ones I used to get here. They don't even taste the same.  I can't count how many people I've recommended this place to. I'll make a conscious effort to rescind those recommendations.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"Pricey and okay quality. I've been to alot of shawarma places in Richmond hill and this is my least favourite. Expensive with less meat than other places give you AND they charge you for toppings and sauces that are usually free at other restaurants. I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Girl serving the food was rude, had to repeat my order several times because it was unclear.... if you don't eat rice and potatoes and you want something else like a bean salad or humus it costs extra. Every topping is extra. On top if that the bean salad didn't taste fresh and tasted terrible."}
{"text":"Been to Rifca's 3 times for a quick snack.  You order at the counter and watch it made in front of your face.  They do not put enough meat for sure.  The chicken I got is dry and tasteless.  The place itself is clean and never too busy."}
{"text":"As I sit and write this review, I find it difficult to not think back and reflect on the many meals that I've had here in past for lunch that I've truly enjoyed. Today, however was nothing more and nothing less than a 3 star experience.   This takeaway or sit down spot has a great location just north of Hwy 7 and Yonge in Richmond Hill. It's simply put together and decorated and the staff are friendly and really relaxed about when you order and when you pay. I've always liked this place for a quick, inexpensive meal on the go.  Was this the best Shawarma I've ever had? No. What I was served was a small portion a top of my shawarma salad. The beef was slightly dried and crunchy and a little over cooked. This is not the norm for this place at all!  The salad however was good, I like the chopped tomato chuncks and cucumber and their tahini and tzatziki sauces make a great salad dressing. Yumm!  Not much more I can say here... other than...ummm Cornucopia!!!"}
{"text":"After having driven by Rifca's countless times, I finally decided yesterday that it was time to stop in for lunch. Right away upon entering the establishment I was impressed by the décor and the restaurant appeared to be in good condition. I liked the setup, the chalkboard style menus hanging in the kitchen and the black leather seating.  Specials of that day included a Kafta Burger combo (I saw the patty on the grill and it was rather gargantuan, would love to try this on my next visit), Lamb Souvlaki with rice and potatoes and lastly a Shawarma sandwich combo. I decided to go for the Chicken Shawarma as I felt it would be the best item to judge this restaurant on.   The large chicken shawarma was actually extra large. If you're a small to medium eater you would definitely yield 2 meals from this sandwich. It came with the option of standard shawarma toppings and sauces and the meat was a lil' crispy which I liked. Huge points to Rifca's for throwing down the shawarma's in a Panini press to seal and toast the wrap while also heating up the contents, I find this step to be so vital to the success of a shawarma/burrito.   Overall it was a good shawarma and I couldn't complain too much. Despite its size the contents were not greasy or heavy and I felt good after having consumed the whole meal. Did the shawarma blow me away? Negative. The sauces could have had more flavour, especially the garlic sauce. IMO the success of a shawarma is of course based on the quality and flavour of the ingredients inside of it, but especially on the sauces. The garlic has to be some of the best garlic sauce I've ever had for it to be an incredible shawarma, same goes for the tahini and hot sauce.   Will I be back? Sure, but I'm not in any rush.  Average meal $10 w/o drink."}
{"text":"Went there twice to order shawarma to go, both times the meat was too dry and the service was unfriendly. It is certainly not the best shawarma place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma I've ever had....crispy and juicy....hot sauce, potatoes and salad also great. Lentil soup also best in the GTA"}
{"text":"I've lived very close to Rifca's for a couple of years, but finally decided to give it a shot. It usually smells pretty damn good when walking by. My hesitation came from other 'Mediterranean' places that have turned me away (just lookup the health reports for Kako Kabob down the block), not to mention other places more north of Major Mackenzie that were horrible.   This place is pretty damn great! The first time, I had the chicken shawarma and could not be happier with it. My second visit, again had the shawarma and also tried a half dozen falafel, which were made right in front of my eyes. Crispy on the outside yet soft and a hint of hot inside."}
{"text":"I don't know what these bad reviews are really about. First off what do you want for 13 bucks? I got a soup and large felafel that was made fresh. I never have been a fan of felafel but this was amazing!  I think they are under new management but I have been coming here for ober a decade and still am in love with that lentil soup."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place for many years. I decided to go back tonight and order 2 large mixed shawarma sandwiches (this is actually an item on their menu). He starts off by asking if I want a 'wrap'? I said I don't want a wrap I want 2 'large mixed shawarma sandwiches' just like the menu says. He went on and on by asking the exact same question for at least 3 times. I asked what a wrap is cause this is the first time I was asked tho question. He says \"because the small shawarmas don't wrap, they're only called sandwiches. However the large ones are ALSO called wraps cause they actually wrap around.\" I said I don't want a large shawarma (as i said 5 times already).  Finally he agrees to make me my shawarmas. I noticed that the pita bread was ripped in half, BEFORE he put anything in it, and asked for it to be changed. Merely because I live 15-20 min away and this is going to get soaked and fall apart even more by the time I get home.  He refused!  His boss (the older gentleman) was standing aside and watching the whole thing. I called him over and showed to him what I meant. But even he said that it's fine and that nothing is going to happen!  Before I paid and left I told him that the quality of EVERYTHING has drastically dropped over the years and that I will make sure I won't rerun there again."}
{"text":"This place used to suck, but not anymore. I recently decided to give them a second chance and I have noticed a huge improvement. I ordered chicken shawarma and it tasted fresh and juicy. The employee was generous with the chicken. I was so impressed by the huge improvement. Price is pretty much the same at every shawarma place."}
{"text":"So out for a motorcycle ride with my queen and we were hungry so I asked Siri what was in the area that made souvlaki and Rifcas came up it was 9:00 pm and the place was pretty much empty, we ordered a lamb and chicken souvlaki dinner it was prepared fairly quick and served with baked potatoes,rice and salad topped with garlic and hot sauce , everything was prepared very well the lamb was delicious the rice and potatoes each had an individual flavor that complemented each other nicely and the salad with large chunks of cucumber. My only complaint was the portion of lamb was on the small size and that makes it 4 star instead of 5 other than that I was very happy with the staff the restaurant and the dinner I give this place 3 talons up out of 4 I'll give them a try again the next time in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Rifca's has been a long-time favourite simply because it is conveniently located near work for a delicious shawarma fix.  The go-to order is the Chicken Shawarma dinner ($11-12) which comes with a generous amount of juicy, tender chicken, Mediterranean rice, well-dressed salad and soft, savoury potatoes.  There is an option to take-out or dine-in and either is great, however, there always seems to be a bit of confusion for first-timers. While the cook (most likely owner) can come off as abrasive, I like to think that he just has a quirky kind of humor. Could be completely misinterpreting him but, hey, it really doesn't hurt to try to stay light-hearted and polite when dining at Rifca's.   The key is to order first, pay for your order and either grab a seat while waiting for its preparation or pick up your order to go when it's ready. If the procedure gets confusing, just ask but don't be surprised if the response seems blunt or curt haha.  PRO TIPS:  - Order first, pay and then wait for food (grab a seat if you're dining in) - Don't expect topnotch service but do expect a good meal - Stay lighthearted, maybe crack a joke (if its in your nature) - Don't hesitate to ask (nicely) for 'a little more' or your favourite topping!

{"text":"A staple in my gf's and I for when we want our shawarma fix, Rifca's is a friendly mom and pop shop that has been around for years.  One of the more underrated places in the area for sure!  I have particularly enjoyed their lamb kebab's dinner as well as their chicken shawarma dinner, topped with juicy potatoes and fresh vegetables.  The dressing they use for the salad is amazing, just thinking about it right now gets my mouth watering.   The portions are generous, you definitely get your money's worth at Rifca's.   They have a few tables for those that want to dine in, but we mainly get take out.    Definitely check it out for those that love shawarma!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It's a no frills, deliciously good, grill house. the staff is friendly, the food is delicious and the hot sauce is fantastic.   I highly recommend the chicken souvlaki dinner. The chicken is seasoned well and cooked to perfection. The potatoes are decadent and wonderful.   Tip: Get all the sauces. I don't know what is in the hot sauce, but it's amazing.   I always look forward to Rifca's for a no fuss, quick, delicious, meal."}
{"text":"Never again   This place is a joke... I'm surprised it's still surviving.  I'm writing this review, still hungry and pretty pissed at what I paid for.   I ordered the chicken shawarma salad to go, she started to throw about 7-8 large pieces of lettuce to cover the aluminum container and a few large pieces of tomato/cucumber... I looked over and saw a pile of cabbage and onion and other items that could be thrown in a salad and are at other shawarma places. I asked her to add the cabbage and onion and some pickles, she chinsed on everything and when I told her to add a few pickles, SHE PROCEEDED TO REMOVE OTHER TOPPINGS OFF... claiming it won't fit... BULLLSHIT lady! the whole container in my hand felt no more than 150 grams. she finally packaged it and the total is what make me laugh.. 14 bucks for something that's left me still hungry.  I told her seriously that's 14 bucks?? she smirked and said is this your first time here. Thanks for pointing out how cheap and shitty your service is.   I will never return."}
{"text":"Food was delicious..however the wait time is long. i understand its not fastfood, but even with people coming in it was chaotic, and they super long to cook the food. if you are in a hurry dont eat here, but if you have time you wont mind waiting atleast 15min for your food. this is why i gave it one stat less.. i also gave it one more star left because they tried to accuse me of not paying when I paid for the food before I even had it in my hands.. they need to have a better way of tracking who paid and who didnt.. because it can be embaressing to some people."}
{"text":"I went here for the 2nd time today. I had to go to the library nearby to do some studying so I decided to give this place a shot again. I came in during lunch rush hour but thankfully I didn't get caught in a long line up. I ended up getting my order of Kafta Kabob Dinner plate with potatoes, salad, and rice.   For those of you who don't know what Kafta is, it's basically ground beef meatballs seasoned with some herbs and spices. I thought it was pleasant. Not something I would come back for though, definitely not something I would show someone around to, but maybe something I would eat if I was around in the area. I'm generally not a biased eater too, so please don't take this review as being offensive.   I thought the meatballs were alright. They could've done with a little less cooking in my opinion. The potatoes were nicely seasoned, I think the potatoes were cooked in a stock that had a tomato purée base, which I personally never had. The potatoes broke apart with the fork, and was really well seasoned like I said. The salad, there was definitely plenty of it. It was alright, nothing out of the ordinary. No cheese, just some vinegar-based dressing, tomatoes, and lettuce.   All in all, it was a pretty average meal. Not something I usually like to purposely plan a trip for but efini"}
{"text":"Best place to have a falafel & shawarma! We usually order their chicken shawarma & lentil soup combo! Delicious wraps with fresh ingredients! The herbs used to make their food makes it flavourful but not overpowering!   Very friendly staff and the owner is a sweetheart! Had a chat with him about this family business! Every time we have a craving for shawarma we would swing by this family joint! We leave feeling satisfied with our bellies full! Great place to stop by for dinner or grab a bite for takeout!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Rifka's for over 10 years for their tastey Mediterranean dishes. I recently visited and noticed a possible change in management. The Kafta kabobs also seemed smaller than I remember, but are still packed with flavor. shawarma wraps here are delicious and best when toasted. Shawarma dinners are great paired with their signature rice and potatoes you can't find anywhere else. Make sure to get all the sauces including hot sauce to spice things up. I usualy opt in for the greek salad instead of the usual mixed salad since I find it a bit tastier."}
{"text":"If there was only a 0 star out of 5... The food was mediocre. The service was scary bad. They were rude to us and they were rude to other customers, except with their regular customers. We witnessed the servers arguing with a customer while waiting for our food, as they in the end, refused to serve them. Last thing, they are dirty: The cook grabbed dishes from under the counter and saw crusty things on the plate. Guess what he did... scraped that off with his finger (at least with a glove on!) and plated my sandwich on it. WOW. My friends and I are never returning to Rifca again."}
{"text":"I was told by my neigbors from the same building that I am living at that this location has the best falafels. I gave a try about a month ago, the service was good, friendly environment and they do have a lot of regular take out customers.   I found their falafel is good, but I have better with the price that I paid. I would return for take out for sure, but only on the falafel.. the shawarma seems too dry to me."}
{"text":"Great place with many options to choose from. We ordered the chicken souvlaki plate which came with potatoes, rice and salad. The rice was partially uncooked as we ate a few hard pieces. The rest was good however service was slow. Baklava looked pretty good but was too full to eat anymore. Want to come back and try it! Also hoping next time the rice is fully cooked!"}
{"text":"It's not a bad place to go if you live in the area. The premises are clean and the food it fresh and the quality of the food is good.  I got a Falafel with salad and Tahina and some form of Mango Carrot drink.  The atmosphere wasn't too loud and it was a good place to kill some time and have a meal with a friend.  My main issue though was the service. My friend ordered a shawarma and asked for Hoummous in her pita. The guy behind the counter immediately said that  it shouldn't be a spread in a shawarma but reluctantly added it to her order. I get it if you don't agree with how someone should eat their food.  And you are by far welcome to have and maintain the opinion. But don't correct a customer when they ask for something like that. It comes off as snooty and rude. Also, it was my first time there so I ordered a Falafel. Apparently that angered the woman behind the counter and she got a bit hostile when she asked what size I wanted and what I wanted it with.  I didn't realize there were different sizes for Falafels and if it came in a dinner plate or not.  I see her perspective, but don't get MAD at a customer if they're not clear enough.  Otherwise, decent food, good atmosphere.  Good meal."}
{"text":"Food is decent but wish the service was better because they were mopping the floor while we were eating. I wish they weren't cleaning around us when we were eating..."}
{"text":"I tried Rifca's this afternoon as I was in the area and figured I'd try another one of York Region's shawarma places. My first impressions upon walking in were very good. Two large beef and chicken shawarma grills and a clean/inviting dining area. You place your order at the counter and watch your food made. I opted for the small shawarma sandwich with water. My first clue to run away was seeing the chef take the meat out of a metal tray (yesterday's left overs?) while the actual chicken shawarma rotisserie spun and looked untouched. He placed the meat strips on the griddle to heat them up before finally adding the few measly pieces into my pita along with lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, and onions as well as tahini sauce. He then put the sandwich in a flat press (to try and warm it up?) which has always been a sign (to me at least) that the sandwich is cold/not fresh. As expected, there was a lack of meat and whatever meat was in the pita tasted bland and uninspiring. The vegetables tasted fine but unfortunately, they made up most of the sandwich. There was not nearly enough sauce and therefore the sandwich was not flavorful. For $6 I expected a little bit more meat and perhaps some babaganoush, eggplant salad, humous, etc. I think these were available by they cost extra.   Today's experience was definitely a turn off for me. Next time I'll give their falafel or kefta sandwich a try, or maybe not? To their credit, it looks like they fry their falafel balls to order.  If they cannot use freshly cut shawarma meat, where else might they taking shortcuts?"}
{"text":"Read some negative reviews. Total bs. Service was fast and friendly. Food was fresh and tasty. The falafel was freshly made. Absolutely no complaints and will be back."}
{"text":"Shawerma is one of my favourite food. This place is not the best I have ever had, however, there are not too many shawerma places in the area.  It's a great place for a lunch bite. Chicken in the shawerma sandwich was tasty, fresh, well seasoned. Soups tasted home-made and hearty.  It's a bit on the pricier side, but everything seems to be home made fresh same day.  Overall, I would recommend this place for chicken shawerma and soup if you're in the area and have a craving for shawerma"}
{"text":"My kid ordered a falafel sandwich and a soup. I ordered the shawarma sandwich. It took them forever to get the order ready - the cook and the owner was too busy having a major conversation with a customer in their own language. When they finally finished their conversation, the cook started prepping the falafel. Wow - he's cooking it fresh! Bonus right? My kid didn't think much of it. The shawarma spit wasn't even on. But the meat was cooked on it. Not sure what was going on here. The guy cut a few pieces off of it and collected some from the bottom ring and proceeded to grill the pieces! If I hadn't paid for it in advance, I would have walked away. Why 2 and one 1? The soup was OK. When located in a place with so many middle eastern food choices, one should bring their best game and not grill it!  Go Figure!!!"}
