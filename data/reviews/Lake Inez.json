{"text":"If you have not tried this place - you are truly missing out. I can't believe how amazing the food is - the dishes are all 10/10! So flavourful, and so unique. The service is great as well - I am planning a girls night here on August 25th, and can't wait! Here is what I ordered: ceviche, charred broccoli, sunchoke skewer, mushroom tagliatelle, Salmon Sinigang, Market Fish curry, rice, and roti :) You need to go!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Gerrard St E!  I had dinner here Friday night and ordered the honey garlic wings, roasted brussel sprouts and chicken congee. 
All of the dishes were great with the sprouts being the standout. 
Service was solid and they have an excellent selection of beers. 
I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is tops. Great feel, really interesting menu. Everyone I talked to was very knowledgable about the menu and the wide variety of beers. I was especially impressed with how they were able to adjust some menu items to account for allergies to fish and nuts.
 
I can't say enough great things about the place. They've even made me like brussel sprouts!!"}
{"text":"The people I was with really enjoyed the meal. Unfortunately, my dietary restraints prevented me from eating for the main meal. I am vegetarian, lactose and gluten intolerant. When I asked the waitress if the food was cooked with butter she said sometimes and didn't offer to ask"}
{"text":"The good...nice atmosphere, good service, sunchokes and the lumpia small plates.
The questionable..There is only so much you can overcharge for dishes like fish curry ($26) in Little India no matter how hip you think you are compared to the surrounding restaurants.  The egg noodles were fine. The two appetizers listed above were great. Have them with a beer or glass of wine and then assess other options.  The chiffon dessert was good but the coconut ice cream didn't taste like coconut.  In fact it tasted like cold \"nothing\", thankfully there were toppings.  Not worth a return as it didn't live up to the price point or really stand out in any other way."}
{"text":"One of the best new spots on the East end. Loved them since the Wren. :)  wings were amazing, salad was terrific but the best of all is their tremendous beer selection from Torontos top craft breweries. They've got lots of beers I can't find anywhere but the breweries. The atmosphere is terrific and the nondescript door and tile work inside is phenomenally done."}
{"text":"We LOVED the place! The decor, the music, the service and the food. The most amazing chicken liver mousse (we shared it as part of the meal, and I  took it again as my dessert!).
A great place to come to enjoy your company as well as the surroundings. With a fine food. Definitely going to be \"our\" hangout choice."}
{"text":"It's still early in 2017, I know, but the carrots here were the single best bite I've had this year. Seriously you guys: *carrots*. The beer selection is pretty great--tables full of young twenty somethings were drinking a sour beer in a restaurant on Gerrard Street east.  That is not something I would have ever predicted five years ago much less ten or fifteen ,back when you counted your blessings if they even had Tankhouse on tap anywhere in Queen West you know?  Sigh.  Oh how my generation suffered.  There's a good vibe inside this place mostly, I mean, it's not their fault that the one English guy and the three Canadians had a conversation comprised almost exclusively of quirky cultural differences.  Apparently Wolf Blitzer \"is *such* a North American name\" and there was some disagreement on whether or not we say \"take a leak\" in Canada.  Stuff like that.  God I wish that table had a button you could press that would drop them down into a Rancor pit.  The host initially sat us near the front door and then promptly left us in front of a barrentable with no menus or cutlery and our candle had long since burned out.  The host sat other tables after us and gave them menus.  They did look hungrier than us so I guess it makes sense. Similarly other tables were given water right away.  Perhaps the host saw us walk in, sized us up, and to him we seemed like two incredibly responsible adults who take hydration very seriously (we do, but that's not the point) so figured we didn't need any water.  I dunno.  It would have been nice if they served water in turn is all I'm saying.  But back to the food, the Brussels sprouts were very rich but very tasty.  I do think a hit of acid might have helped here.  The egg noodles had a funny taste to them though and are probably not going to win best in show at the noodle awards. They forgot to charge us for a bottle of beer we ordered, thanked us for the honesty, and said they would gift it to us.  But we paid for it anyway.  Guys, if you notice an item is missing from your bill and you knowingly don't pay for it, it's stealing.  Don't rationalize it as the restaurant's fault for making the error.  I mean it.  Anyway, so I liked this place okay??  It's a welcome addition to the burgeoning dining scene that is happening on Gerrard Street East of all places."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was perfection with the beer a perfect compliment. The service was friendly and not in a staged way. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in for a very late night dinner. Do recommend making reservations if going during the dinner hours. First time here and heard many good things. Menu selection wasn't too huge which makes ordering a bit easier. Dishes are meant for sharing so for the 2 of us, we ordered 1 starter and 2 main dishes.  We were hungry so it was the perfect amount..I was stuffed. We ordered the BBQ Pork Skewer to start..2 skewers and it was perfectly cooked with lots of flavours. Our main dishes were the Sichuan style Lamb Papperdelle and Fish Curry. The lamb was very tender, soft noodles and sauce had a hint of chilli. Loved it.  Wish they served more noodles to mix with the leftover sauce.  The fish curry was nothing special.  The fish was very plain but the curry sauce did taste like the Thai red curry sauce.  We ordered a bowl of rice to go along with the curry. Would love to go back to try the other dishes.  Service was great."}
{"text":"We have been there twice and both times the food was amazing and the service was exceptional! It fills up quickly so a reservation is needed."}
{"text":"Only been here once, on the mentions of Toronto folk and one local acquaintance.
I can't say I was initially impressed walking in, the place seems a bit dark and tavern-like and there was a bit of a 'fish smell.' Either the freshness of marine ingredients was not exactly coastal standards or else we're just not used to encountering much cooking with fish in this inland empire we call Ontario.
Those who dined with me there were less impressed with the food, which I, having grown up on good home cooking, honestly appreciated as fairly ambitious, original and well-executed. It's like Asian-inflected food that I think all Europeans could enjoy. The fish in curry was memorably tasty.  A few other dishes we had were at least very OK - Beef short ribs braised as kind of stew was good, a Mussels appetizer that turned out to be mostly bread was very light. The BBQ pork skewers were particularly great in unanimous opinion.
There's some awkwardness in terms of ordering portion sizes and sides & how to divvy and share assorted dishes in a group. The servers might not offer the best calibration in ordering for the table and I think we ordered some 'starches' sides twice but regardless it's perfectly fine to add dishes as you go & have a leisurely meal. The kitchen is reasonably fast and the service is attentive.
My group really liked the Jamaican-style Roti but generally expressed only muted enthusiasm for the evening's dining when we parted ways afterwards. I'd gladly go there again with perhaps other company to order another adventuresome spread, and for just a quick bite I'd pull up at the comfy barside seating at the back to enjoy the interesting Ontario craft beer menu alongside a few of the excellent Filipino pork skewers.
Nice atmosphere when you get used to it, homey. The menu keeps changing and this may be seasonal. It's a good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for a nice dinner!  Robbie is a dope chef and Zach is a great owner who has hired lots of great people.  Food is awesome, beer selection is huge and rotating.  The mosaic behind the bar is stunning.  Can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"When I first saw the menu for this place, I was a tad skeptical. There aren't many menu items, and frankly, most of the dishes just didn't stand out to me. But boy oh boy, was I pleasantly surprised!

My favourite dishes, and what I found to be the highlights of the meal, were the spicy charred brussels, market fish curry, roasted squash salad, and the Japanese deviled eggs. All beautifully incorporated Asian flavours in a very natural way. My companions loved the Sinigang wings, brussels, and market fish curry.

We came as a group of seven, and thus chose to order everything on the menu. We asked the server to decide for us, and he seemed a bit overwhelmed / nonplussed. 

I started with the 4am Birdsong and expected a lighter drink, given the lychee flavour. However, it ended up being a much strong whiskey drink. Next time, I should definitely order the Thai Gin Fizz instead, as it is their most popular cocktail product.

Japanese Deviled Eggs:
These were the first to arrive, and we had one half each. I was NOT expecting them to taste like wonderful bites of sushi, but they had the pleasant umami flavour of the ocean! It must have been the salmon roe, combined with the nori and furikake. The kewpie mayo and yuzu added a slight tangy note, but not overwhelming by any means.

Duck & Chicken Liver Mousse:
The server had initially proposed only getting one of these, but then after careful consideration, he came back with two orders. Good call on his part! The liver mousse was so wonderfully creamy and earthy, and paired perfectly with the housemade Filipino sweet bread (pandesol). The pomelo was okay - slightly bitter (obviously not in season), and the shallot jam was a sweet addition. The mousse killed it though!

Za'atar Roasted Cauliflower:
Out of all the dishes we ordered, I found this to be the most underwhelming. The Za'atar gave it a nice curry kick, but the flavour profile was weak and the edamame hummus wasn't very prominent. I still had seconds though, as I was trying to get some veggies in ahead of a protein-packed meal - though I regretted it shortly afterwards when everything arrived and was so delicious!

Roasted Squash Salad:
I don't think that my companions appreciated this dish much, but I absolutely loved it! The squash was roasted to be wonderfully creamy, and the arugula was coated in this umami-filled Thai dressing. You could really taste the dried shrimp and fish sauce, and I loved every bit of it. This dish has really inspired me to go home and experiment with these flavours, because the Asian fusion reminded me of home in a very modern way. I definitely consumed half the dish, but I'm not ashamed to admit it!

Sinigang Wings:
We ordered three dishes (15 pieces) to share among the 7 of us. Everyone at my table adored this dish - some even went so far to state that it was the \"best wings\" they've ever had! On my part, I found the wings very flavourful; the tamarind sauce with peanuts and chilies really shone through. However, it wasn't my preferred dish, as I thought the wings were too salty and saucy. Had to gulp down multiple glasses of water after consuming just one!

Spicy Charred Brussels:
Don't be fooled by the appearance of this dish... the brussel sprouts look blackened, saucy, and mushy, and they'rehidden under this fresh green bed, but are so delicious! The sprouts are coated generously in this very salty and spicy oyster sauce, but there's a very rich and earthy flavour coming from the anchovies. My companion kept asking incredulously, \"Is there meat in this dish?!\" but all the flavour definitely came from the crispy anchovies. We got two orders of this, and everyone really enjoyed it.

Rice w/ Mushrooms:
This was my least liked dish of the night - the taste was quite bland. Perhaps it would have been better to start with this dish due to the subdued flavours, as the richness and saltiness of all the other dishes probably overpowered the profile of this dish. The slow-cooked egg didn't really mix well with the rice (maybe they could consider a poached egg), and the porcini flavours didn't really come through. 

Market Fish Curry:
This came with Malaysian roti and jasmine rice, and was by far everyone's pick of the night (we ended up getting three orders!). Though I forgot what type of fish it was that night (some sort of trout) but it stayed warm in the hot stone pot. The curry was sinfully creamy (probably had a can of coconut cream in each pot), and I loved the hidden mustard greens. I did find that there were too many peanuts though - filled me up much too fast.

Grilled Bavette:
The steak was very well-marinated, and there was an unexpected spicy kick to it! A little chewy/tough, but still very delicious. Unfortunately, it paled in comparison to all the other Asian dishes!

Ricotta Donuts:
These deep-fried goodies resembled Chinese style donuts, but by then I was too full to have an entire one. Wasn't my favourite though...

To conclude - an amazing, indulgent meal!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this restaurant existed in the heart of Little India on the east end of Toronto. And boy was I glad my bf found it and took me here for my birthday! 
Being a big fan of food, I was not disappointed. I had the best tasting wings here, it was saucy with the right touch of heat! The brussel sprouts were perfectly charred and with the tight amount of crunch. The curry we had was probably great too but I have trouble remembering how it tasted (that's what happens when I decide to write reviews months later). Definitely get the donuts, they so soooooooooo good - three was enough for us but I secretly wanted it all to myself!"}
{"text":"I'm OBSESSED with the brussell sprouts and the snapper. Amazing!

They've also got a great craft beer selection as well, another girl I was with ordered a screwdriver and even though it's just a highball it came in the cutest little glass with an orange twist like she'd ordered a real cocktail. 

Service is very friendly, definitely this place is designed for sharing plates, so I would recommend going in with a group and ordering a bunch of different things!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place considering I'm Filipino and was hoping the dishes would do it justice. It seems like such a popping place from the parties they host with an interesting flair, however I tried booking a table for 2 for a special birthday and then the night of - they didn't have my name on the list. 

It was funny in a sense because on the one hand, prior to that day I had a \"weird\" feeling come over me that I should probably call them to reconfirm my reservation. But on the other hand, I was like nahh let me give them the benefit of the doubt.. Why would I need to call?? The lesson - Never discredit your gut instinct because they never included my name for that night. 

Anyway, upon recognizing their error, they apologized, sat us down as soon as possible, and served us 2 glasses of champagne for free or something of that nature, I can't remember the drink. We ordered a bunch of food, that we both felt missed the spot when it came to having that Filipino flavour we were hoping to taste so I was a little bummed about that. The tables are very close by so it's not a very intimate setting, other than the dimmest light setting possible. The crowd is loud during peak times so talking to each other is kind of challenging if you're not used to projection. Needless to say, my throat was hurting at the end of the ordeal due to shouting on different levels I'm not used to and left unsatisfied from the food. I will give them a thumbs up for having some hearty, marinated meats that fall easily off the bone, but alas my search for unique but comforting Filipino dishes are still out there, other than a few dime a dozen joints in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food and service were amazing! My friend and I shared Japanese deviled eggs, pork skewers, wings and Sichuan style lamb pasta. All of the dishes were flavorful and tasty, especially the pork skewers and lamb pasta. The lamb pasta combines western and Chinese elements perfectly and is hard to find elsewhere in Toronto. The ube cheesecake is also unique, earthy and delicious.
Location is a bit off and I think the indoor design can be improved. But will definitely return to try other items."}
{"text":"This Is My First Time At Lake Inez And The Food And The Dessert Is Great And The Service Is Great. ! ?"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past week. Not sorry. It's my new favourite restaurant and I'll be back again soon.

The food is amazing. I've had the wings, pork skewers, pasta, short ribs, roti, chicken liver, eggs...nothing was not great. The best part is the sizing of the plates: the small shared plates are small, medium are medium, and large are very substantial (Grey Gardens, take notes). The server is laid back but efficient, super friendly and professional.  Room is loud but in a fun way, and the bathrooms are excellent (I'm a sucker for a great bathroom!).  

Drinks are good, wish they had a bit of a longer cocktail choice, but I'm sure they'd make you whatever. Ugh. So far East but this place is worth a trek, trust me. Reservations suggested."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and really good drinks!! Have been here a few times already, each time brining someone new. Absolutely love it, so much thought has been put into the space, food and bar list. Thank you for brining some magic to the east end!"}
{"text":"This cozy and unique restaurant was highly recommended, and even though the expectations were high, my wife and I were throughly impressed. 

Stuff was all around professional and friendly. 

Long and careful selection of local beers. But the cocktails are from another world. You simply can't go wrong. 

We have tasted variety of foods, all were excellent but I must highlight the following:
1. Snacks: Filipino BBQ Pork Skewer
2. Smaller Plates: Spicy Charred Broccoli
3. Main: Market Fish Curry
Not to mention that personally I am not a huge fan of curry dishes, but this is something special. 

We will absolutely return. 

Lake Inez, what a pleasant addition to the east-end. And not just east-end, but GTA."}
{"text":"We love finding restaurants where the vibe is comfortable, but the food is 5-star, and the prices are reasonable for what you get. Furthermore, we are always looking for places that offer up dishes that look or taste like none we have ever had before. For us, Lake Inez totally fits the bill. We are taking a month of alcohol, but wow, the cocktail menu looked amazing, and they had 21 craft beers on tap, as well as a wine list. Tonight we had to settle for some VERY GOOD ginger beer :) As for the food, wow. We loved every dish. We started by sharing the Sunchoke Skewers (which were superb), the BC Snapper Kinilaw (a mixture of some \"slaw-like\" ingredients, snapper and spices with a kick) served with lovely chips, and the Brussel Sprouts, which were also out of this world. We then went on to share two larger plates...the noodles (solid) and the BC Snapper Curry, which was just fabulous. We didn't have room for dessert, but next time I really want to try the sorbet, which has some freeze dried durian on it. Apparently this fruit loses its awful stench when freeze dried so I am dying to try it! Great local spot for sure, and if you are from out of town, make a trip out to Little India in Toronto and eat here!"}
{"text":"A real gem, I'm disappointed I didn't discover this place sooner! The eggplant dip and fish curry were standouts. Had a really great unique bottle of red from the Czech Republic. The music was a tad loud, generally have no issue with loud restaurants, but it was genuinely challenging to carry on a conversation at times."}
{"text":"I don't often leave negative ratings but I wish I had known before going to lake Inez. I have no idea how this place has such high ratings. I've been wanting to come here for a while based on the reviews alone. It was honestly the worst meal I've had in a very long time. 

Pros: 
1)The mural on the wall is lovely and the place looks nice. 
2) It wasn't that busy on a Wednesday night and we were able to get a seat right away.
3) The crunch on top of the wontons. 

Cons: 
1) The food. It was dreadful! The deviled eggs didn't have a nice taste at all, it just tasted like sriracha. The sauce on the beef cheek wontons was not tasty at all and rather bitter, the eggplant was not enjoyable in anyway it tasted like fish food (even the server confirmed that a lot of people said that - why then is it still on the tiny menu?), and the cauliflower was actually inedible I couldn't finish eating more than one piece! 
2) The service. When the servers were actually on the floor were nice enough, but that's if we could find them. They didn't say anything when they noticed that we didn't have more than a bite or two of our dishes, and definitely didn't take it off the bill. 
3) The price. I don't mind paying for good food, but $6 for 1 egg? I would have loved to try the curry but  almost $30 for a bowl of curry seemed pretty steep, and after trying the apps I'm grateful that I didn't spend more money . If it was delicious I would have no problem paying that amount but not for the quality of food! It shouldn't cost $80 for 4 appetizers and 1 cocktail for food that is mostly inedible. 
4) The music. It was depressing and creepy sounding.

My friend and I ended up going out for food after because we were still hungry and couldn't end the night with a terrible taste in our mouths!

Don't waste your time or money. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to review this place so as to keep it a secret :p 

First - the only con - we were the first seating for dinner on a Sunday. When we arrived they were still unfolding the chairs and had no music on - the guys setting up and serving are laid-back, cool dudes with nice personalities. About 5 mins later, the music started blaring (we all literally jumped in our seats) and that's the only reason I'm giving this rating a 4 instead of a 5 as I think the volume of your music should be adjusted in accordance with the circumstances. With 4 people in the restaurant the music was way too overpowering. By the time we left (2 hours later) the restaurant was more than 50% filled and the volume fit in just fine. Just some food for thought to the cool guys running the show!

Now, the food and drinks - insert a few praise hand emojis here - we had the deviled eggs, pork skewers*, the lumpia, the kinilaw*, the brussel sprouts, the short rib*, snapper curry, rice and roti. The only things I wouldn't necessarily order again are the snapper curry and roti - they were fine but nothing special. Everything else, especially those I've starred were outstanding and I can't wait to have them again! We ended with the chiffon cake which was a perfect ending. See you again soon! Thank you Chef Hojilla and team!"}
{"text":"Nice spot on the east end of Toronto. Recommend getting the Thai winter salad, honey adobo wings, and the lamb pappardelle. We also ordered the fish curry but that was nothing special. It was definitely missing a kick to it. The atmosphere was nice, older crowd, but I found the music to be way too low though. The service was great and attentive."}
{"text":"OMG I went to the east end.... :D :D well worth it!

I'd skip the cocktails (was the only part that was 'meh' for me) and try a beer from their awesome list of craft brews...I had some sort of sour papaya one that was great. Loved the creative wine list and then shared an excellent bottle (Trousseau/France) of wine that was great with the flavours of the food.

We had: cauliflower, brussel sprouts, chicken liver mousse, pappardelle, and short ribs. Chicken liver mousse was by far my favourite dish - sweet, savoury, great hot sauce, smooth texture with added crunch from the toppings. Cauliflower was skippable IMO, but definitely dive into the short ribs (SO TENDER) and the pasta (cooked perfectly spicy, warm, al dente). 

Overall, one of my favourite experiences in Toronto. Really cute interior and chill/fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I may have tried every dish on the menu for a fabulous dinner experience.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE: Every staff was very helpful with our questions with the Menu, their attitude was very positive and upbringing. Waiter constantly checked if we were okay and refilled our drinks. 

FOOD: BC Snapper Curry, Beef Short Ribs, Thai Winter Vegetable Salad, and Ube Cheesecake. EVERY order was SOOO good. It was a fusion, yes, but it was so unique that I wish the serving size was bigger. The only downfall is the wait time was very long and the serving portion is too small. My most favorite part was the Ube Cheesecake. LIKE WOW. Words cannot explain that this is the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. Every bite I just had to close my eyes and imagine beautiful fireworks.

I WOULD HIGHLY recommend. Just be prepared for small portions. Order a lot of dishes in order to avoid longer wait time. And oh yeah, their beer was good too!"}
{"text":"Well, I have no complaints about the food. It was delish. Service was good, not great! Ssloow, but the place was packed. Great concept, but our biggest complaint was the music. Not only was it wahaaay too loud, but the sound system sucks, as did the music. The people beside us felt the same. We're all (5 of us) music lovers of many different genres. I almost got up to offer my Spotify music.  There's so much volume from the people in this place already..which is great/normal. The music was competing with the natural vibe of the place. It didn't mix At All! Back ground chill vibes would be perfect. We would suggest to crank the music after 11 to turn it into a club vibe possibly if that's what you're going for. I dunno..restaurant?  Or club? A little confusing.  I'm home now,  and my ears are still ringing"}
{"text":"Only had drinks but loved the vibe and decor. Will definately come back for dinner as the menu looks incredible"}
{"text":"After much research, I finally chose Lake Inez to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.  I went in with high expectations after reading about the restaurant on Toronto Life (not to mention almost all perfect Yelp reviews) and was not disappointed!

The menu is broken up into appetizers, snacks, and main courses.  We shared 2 snacks (chicken liver and roasted carrots) and an appetizer (cauliflower) and each got our own main course (both got pasta - one veggie and one lamb).  The food was varied and incredibly interesting.  My boyfriend also noted that there was a fabulous beer menu.  Sadly, I was too full to try dessert so I will need to come back.

I appreciated that the server took time to walk through various items on the menu.  I had a tough time narrowing down items to order, which is rare for me as a picky eater.  My only complaint (although they do warn you about this when placing the order) is that 3 things came out at once, which made us eat much faster and made the dining experience feel a bit rushed."}
{"text":"Loved my experience at Lake Inez. The food was fantastic - super flavourful - the broccoli dish is a must have! 

Service wise - everyone was super friendly and attentive despite it being a very busy night. The vibe of the place is great and laid back - excellent food and service without all the pretencious stuff. It's very welcoming with a focus on solid food. 

Do yourself a favor and leave room for the ube dessert. 

Tip: reservations are needed on busy nights."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite new spots. Worth the trip across the city. Amazing food, wine - very authentic yet unique Asian fusion cuisine"}
{"text":"Just a small update as we checked out Lake Inez this past Sunday night for dinner. They've completely upgraded/dramatically increased their wine list! Lots of tasty options, and apparently the plan is to keep changing it up. The very limited wine selection was really the only issue I had previously, so this was great news when I opened up the drink list. The meal was as always amazing and I will be craving that damn tasty lettuce wrap /beef rib dish (mashed KimChi - who knew that it would work so well). Keep up the good work Lake Inez- such a fun spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food, epic draft and bottle list, great vibe. Overall a great spot for dinner or just drinks. Menu was super unique and very tasty. Brussels sprouts & Snapper curry a must!

Great addition to the neighbourhood!! Expect many more visits in my future."}
{"text":"I have to admit I haven't ate the food here yet, but I felt compelled to write a review just to rave about their tap list. GLB Thrust!, Redline Clutch, Bellwoods Jutsu and Jelly King, etc. It was like an all-star team of Ontario craft beers last night. Probably the best tap-list I've seen in the city so far. At least in the east end. 

Only slight downer was the smallish pints. Think they were 16oz servings. Hate that. 

I'll be back. A lot."}
{"text":"My wife and i had a great time. Fantastic atmosphere. Japanese deviled eggs tasted amazing. Made both of our eyes light up with how yummy it was."}

A MUST IN THE CITY!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. Relaxed environment. Good selection of beer.
Literally everything on this menu is ridiculously good. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate friends birthday it was listed as one of Air Canada - Canada's Best New Restaurant 2017.  The restaurant is listed as Asian more like Asian fusion there were touches of Filipino and Asian aspects to the dishes ingredients I guess although I didn't drink I noticed a large selection of beer on the wall and a large drink list the menu is average size small large dishes to share can you could have rice on the side the server was very nice in the informative recommended a new dish for us which was the chicken he had never tried it but he said it's looks really good it's like stuff chicken with stuff sausage we had that it was delicious overall very interesting choices and dishes would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Okay, we went back because it really was such a nice space and the food we ordered this time was delicious! Didn't get anything we ordered before except for the Roasted Carrots and we were, for the most part, very happy. The sunchokes were definitely a standout. The steak or lettuce wrap we got with steak was a bit chewy here and there but so so flavourful. Service was perfect. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the neighbourhood. And very needed. This beautiful bar is perfect for drinks with friends or a special night out. Menu is more tapas style so lots of sharing to happen. It has an Asian twist to everything. The beer selection is amazing with lots of locals beers and bottles to share. The staff there was so friendly. They kept coming over to chat with our large group and have a laugh. It was the best. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A small group of us came here on a Tuesday night and had a marvelous experience with the dishes. Since this restaurant is located in Little Indian community, one would wonder about the concept and the style of the dishes served here. Even though the person who organized this dinner had already given us a brief idea of what dining experience would be like, most of us were still questioning about the type of dishes that were listed on the menu, curious expectation were definitely set on most of our minds.
Even the decor inside made the restaurant seem different why being set in the middle of the Indian and similar stores nearby.

Our group sat at a spacious and cozy booth which gave some of us a good view of the \"lack of\" street life on Gerrad Street.
And once our server with the character worth taking note of gave us the food and drinks menus, it did take awhile for some of us to decide on our choices. Many of the dishes involved different Asian cooking methods and some of them were familiar items that were given a different style of preparing them.
A lot of the menu items sounded tempting so four people out of the group decided to share the $45 tasting menu while the rest of us order individual plates.

For myself I picked the Dry-Aged Beef Lumpia, Chicken Liver Mousse accompanied by triangles of toasted Challah Bread and pairing of grilled Beef Short Ribs with the Malaysian Style Roti. I had been craving for most of these dishes so I wanted to see what the takes on all these items were.
The filling for the Lumpias were delicately wrapped in wonton wrappers and came with a dip of Banana Ketchup, something that I didn't want to try when I used to live in the Philippines but that day it was a good chance to see what it tasted like and it was also made in-house. The presentation for the Chicken Liver Mousse was interesting because it came in a small mason jar and a thin layer of fat sealing it made it look like a scented candle. The mousse and the Challah bread were also accompanied by a clementine marmalade and a Szechuan chili oil. Combining all four of these items together resulted in an interesting combination of flavors. I do wish that the flavor of the chicken liver had been stronger in the mousse because the flavor of the marmalade overpowered it. But it was fun alternating between slathering the three items onto the Challah bread getting a slightly different taste each time. The short ribs looked similarly prepared in the Korean style of cooking Bulgogi or Galbi but the presentation for the dish was very impressive. Each portion of the short ribs came placed on the mashed kimchi which looked like a spicy sweet potato mash. The visual point of the presentation was a hefty bunch of Butter Lettuce leaves on the side. And the two plates that came out looked like decoration that are fixed on a Picture Hat, that graces the heads of women in picture on those magazines like Royalty and Majesty. And for people who have experience Korean BBQ dining, you simple ate the ribs by wrapping them up in the lettuce leaves with a bit of the accompanying condiments. The entire dish was just heavenly.

Everyone in the group loved what they ate... until it was time for dessert and things took on a funny turn. The group who had the tasting menu also got to try the two desserts that were part of the courses: the Lemon Chiffon cake made with the Calamansi curd and the Coconut Meringue. Someone else also had the Lemon Chiffon cake and it was nice to see some specks of lime peel on the \"broken shards\" of meringue that garnished the cake pieces. The sorbet was served like a sundae with about four different toppings:caramelized bananas, pineapple chunks, roasted peanuts and chopped dried durian flesh. Most in the group tasted the cakes without much fuss. They either liked it or weren't so sure about the lemony flavors in the cakes and meringue. 
But it was the Coconut Sorbet that were got everyone taste buds shooting off on several different scales! While most of the other dishes were consumed alone by each person who ordered them, the Sorbet ended up being passed around the table so everyone could get a taste of it. It seemed that the flavors in the toppings sort of clashed instead of mingling well each other to result in one collective enhancing flavor. But the one thing that almost everyone agreed on was that the anticipated coconut flavor was absent from the sorbet and noone could really detect where the durian had ended up. So it was this dessert that got everyone just deconstructing and analyzing every flavor component in the entire dish. If it hadn't been for the lack of coconut flavor from the sorbet, this dessert would have probably saved itself from becoming an amusing disappointment.

Our Server must have been chuckling inside while he was listening to the several feedbacks about the sorbet alone.
I'd still go back to Lake Inez to share different plates with friends :-)"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 review not 3.
This spot is tucked away in a far off land I like to call east, east side Toronto.  

I had been dying to go and very happy I made the trek. It's a solid three for me for several reasons.  Although the food was good of the dishes that astounded me it was not what I anticipated for the cuisines influence. 

The chicken and duck liver mousse was incredible. Absolutely would order again. Flavour profile on point. Smooth, delicious yet not too rich. Paired well with the filipino bread of pandesal.  Another stand out was the sunchoke skewers. Usually not a big of fan of these but I am a believer if they could taste this good. Another fave was the roasted squash salad. An interesting combination of roasted acorn, pumpkin seed pesto, thai dressing and arugula. It had this spicy zing to it. Hard to explain but I almost would say this was a tie for my favourite dish.

The pork skewers I have today were disappointing. It made my eyeballs roll back from something in the marinade that was excessive. It was the one dish I was completely looking forward and let me down the most.

They ran out of the ingredients for the drink I had wanted so I settled for the Thai Gin Fizz. I couldn't finish it. Maybe it was the lime leaf infusion then more lime on top of it. Didn't seem to balance for me and somewhat turned me off drinking it. The ginger in it was fine but we definitely found it off.

I will say super knowledgeable server. She knew her beer and the technicalities behind them to impress someone like me that knows nothing.

Would I go back? Not sure. I'm glad I went but I can't say I'm dying to go back."}
{"text":"Calamansi Mojito: 
Muddled fresh calamansi.  Hells yes.

Kinilaw:
Fresh, accurate.

Pork Skewers:
Tender, but a touch too salty.  Still would've easily eaten 5 skewers to myself.

Adobo Wings:
Not enough \"adobo\" flavour to them, but they were cooked well and still very tasty.  More fusion than filipino.

Ube Cheesecake:
Ube flavour without too much ube texture.  Paired with rhubarb compote is a clever idea.  Good flavours.

Would eat again :)"}
{"text":"It's rare I give a place 5/5, I'd say 10/5 just to emphasis how off the charts this place is! A gem in little India, tasteful and subtle resto front, you almost don't know it's there. The decor inside is wonderful and cozy, the food is incredible!!! All the flavors completely eachother perfectly without being over powering, meats are cooked perfectly! I won't bother with specific dishes I had bc this resto changes it's menu periodically which I love!!! This is a place I see myself coming to all the time and makes me want to visit often to try something new and loving it!! 
I'm so glad this place come to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Consistently impressed with the ambience, the service and food. Every dish is exquisite. I savour every single bite. Love coming here with friends as the vibe is so great. The tile mosiac behind the bar of Kate Bush and Virginia Wolf is absolutely amazing. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lake Inez was recommended to me and reviews were great, so we decided to come here with some friends.

Food was flavourful but definitely overpriced.  The menu is limited with shared small and large plates.  With a group of six, we ended up ordering majority of the dishes (8 dishes in total).  Ambiance was very trendy, loud and many young adults.  The Asian decor and art gave the place a lot of character.  Service was mediocre and somewhat slow.  The waitress we had was not very attentive and she had forgotten to return to take our order at the beginning. She also didn't seem very informed about the menu. As for the food, I thought some of the dishes were very good, but I was still left a bit disappointed considering the amount paid. Some of the highlighted dishes were: Pork skewers, chicken wings, brussels sprouts, and ricotta donuts for dessert.  Striploin was good but too fatty which left very little meat; and the liver mousse was tasty, but the layer of fat was still hardened on top. Unfortunately, I likely will not return. There's potential for this place to improve on their dishes and service, but until then, will try elsewhere for Asian Fusion."}
{"text":"Lake Inez has a great selection of craft beer and to my surprise, an excellent menu selection as well.  Everything that we ordered was right on point.  I forgot to take pictures of everything because we ate it so quickly.  The adobo wings were sticky and delicious.  Their house made spam which comes in bite size pieces of sticky rice and slaw was super flavourful.  The watermelon salad with frisee and XO sauce was refreshing, flavourful and had so many textures (crunchy, watery, chewy). For the main, we ordered the fish curry.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the curry was good. For dessert the ube cheesecake was light with peach compote.  Their creativity in mixing different Asian  ingredients with western cooking made for a fun and flavourful meal!"}
{"text":"Saw some great reviews on yelp and was excited when I got the chance to visit this restaurant. 

Came here for dinner on a weekday with a few friends. We ordered multiple dishes to share - the Japanese devil eggs, honey garlic adobo wings, Filipino BBQ pork skewer, chicken liver mousse, seafood kaldereta, and the beef short ribs. Our favourites were the BBQ pork skewers and the beef short ribs. Both of them were very tender and juicy - highly recommend. The rest of the dishes were good but nothing exceptional for the price. It wasn't busy on the night that we went but it took us a while to get the attention of the server when we tried to order, have our water refilled and get the cheque, therefore we were a little disappointed. It was an alright experience but not sure if I'll come back."}
{"text":"Lake Inez is seriously yummy, and the staff is great.
Every bite is worth the money.
However, if you have any trouble with stairs, be prepared to potentially break your neck."}
{"text":"Ugghghghghg Lake Inez. Like, how are you this constantly delicious and WONDERFUL!?

I was here again (second time, though frankly it should be my 222nd time) to celebrate the upcoming wedding of my BFF (that was also kinda the reason we first went there as well, actually). Anyhoo, I had some requests, as you often do before a small bachelorette type thing, and the staff were so friggin' wonderful and awesome. So before I even stepped foot inside, and opened my mouth to shove food in it, I was reminded about how great this place is. The service is solid and exceptional!

So the food - SO GOOD. Not a single bad dish. Everything was ridiculously delicious. We ordered:

Japanese Deviled Eggs - so good, and I even hate roe, but I super did not care, it was DELICIOUS.
Honey Garlic Adobo Wings - I could live off these for months. Sticky, sweet perfection.
Summer Corn Fritter - I've been super into corn lately, and this was really, really, really good.
Housemade Spam \"Oshizushi\" - I think this was my favourite of the night. Everything was glorious, the flavours, the textures, all of it.
Spicy Charred Broccoli - Superb, and it made me feel like I was being healthy. Winning combo!
Salmon \"Sinigang\" - OMG the coconut polenta! SHUT UP AND GET IN MY MOUTH. The salmon was great too. BUT THE POLENTA.
Sichuan-Style Lamb Pappardelle - Really good, but maybe the least loved of all the dishes. I mean we ate it all and it was delicious, but we didn't scrape all the bits from the plate into our mouths. 
Mushroom Pasta thing - ugh, so cheesy and good and creamy and mushroom-y and delicious.
Roti - it was fine. Everyone else was all OMG THE ROTIIII, but I was all, meh it's tasty!

We also drank the Nicholas Pearce 2015 Brut, which was lovely! And the Southbrook orange wine, which was really weird and interesting!

Anyhoo, it was delicious, and I need to go back to eat there 507 more times. At least. And I live close by, so I'm not sure why I'm not there RIGHT NOW."}
{"text":"Great space, awesome customer service, and amazing food!

We went as a group, and we ordered couple of things to share. Hands down, the group really enjoyed the Japanese deviled eggs. We can easily eat 10 pieces per person. The duck leg congee was our second favorite, Lake Inez definitely elevated the concept of congee to another level.

These are the other dishes we had and they were all very good:
- charred Brussels sprouts
- lumpia 
- roti
- fish curry
- chiffon cake
- coconut sorbet

We'll definitely be back to try out their other dishes!!"}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review. 

\"Service was laid back and efficient. When it came to the food, our server was well-informed about the dishes and their ingredients. I was impressed that she could rhyme off the definition of \"arare cracker\" without sounding like it had been rehearsed. The menu had five sections: snacks, smaller shared plates, larger shared plates, starch and desserts. Chef Robbie Hojilla (Harbord Room, Hudson Kitchen) creatively profiled many regions and flavours of Asia in the menu--from Japan to Thailand. My guest and I were drawn to almost everything.

First to arrive were the Japanese deviled eggs ($6 for two pieces)--a mixture of creamy golden yolks, kewpie mayo and yuzu kosho. These were not the deviled eggs your mum would take to a potluck in the 90s. Nori and roe garnishes took this snack staple of the past into the present. One bite satisfied my appetite, as well as my nostalgia.\""}
{"text":"Sexy draft list and popping sultry eats. Highly recommend whether going for drinks or food. Hopefully both."}
{"text":"It's so difficult coming to a city where you have so many great places to dine. So I was referred to Lake Inez and was a bit skeptical at first because of the very limited menu and the service started out pretty slow. But service picked up and after the first couple of apps it became increasingly clear that this was one of Toronto's best kept secrets. We started with the amazing deviled eggs and chicken wings. The table next to us ordered the eggplant and grilled cauliflower and they both looked tasty. We shared the fish curry soup that was full of tantalizing flavors and was so delicious that was disappointed that we shared. I hated reaching the end of the dish still wanting more. I got a chance to speak candidly with Zac the GM who definitely appears very passionate about his restaurant and has a keen palette when it comes to flavorful good food. They have an array of local beers and tempting cocktails that are a must try as an addition before and during your meal. I rated this local neighborhood gem a five star because of the professionalism knowledgeable friendly staff and amazing dishes at a great price point  and smart management. Will definitely eat here again."}
