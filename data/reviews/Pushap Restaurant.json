{"text":"Horrible service, we ordered nans at 6:10 for take out, they said it would take 15-20 mins to get them ready! The guy got so mad when we went there to pick it up at 6:31, he's like it's been only 6 minutes, I said to come after 20 minutes, just gonna go next door to Kwality."}
{"text":"Nice place friendly staff and good quality, inexpensive meal for under 20 bucks.
I find the place could benefit from a decent makeover and a good sterilization"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place

If you're looking a delicious, quaint and very affordable vegetarian restaurant, this place is for you.

Growing up in the West Island this was a staple restaurant for me and my friends. It's very well priced and the staff are very friendly. Once ( when i was a teenager) having ordered my food for take-out and realizing that I had forgotten my wallet at home, the young woman at the cash told me  I could take the food home, and pay for it the next time, I was blown away by the fact that they trusted their customers and it is for that reason, that I will drive all the way from Downtown (where I currently resided) to this small restaurant just for their samosas lol."}
{"text":"Simple bon et pas cher.  Végétarien cuisine indienne ou les ingrédients sont soigneusement choisis et bons pour la santé."}
{"text":"Nope, just no way do you go here. Was concerned about hygiene all the time! Although the owners are great people and the food is homely, but still something is not right in the whole combination. The spoons were dirty, and just no no no. The samosa is just not authentic, jalebi is bad with a wired oil taste. Was so hungry so had all of my 'super special thali'. But nothing of the nature of its name at all!"}
{"text":"Mon thali était apprêté d'une main ennuyée. Il me semble que les épices étaient en bouquet que l'on accommode à toutes les sauces. Les deux currys se côtoient dans un même rôle peu corsés. 

Toutefois, je félicite l'attention du serveur, attentif et bien présent. Je préfère manger un repas       
qui peut être assujetti à une opinion moins délicate mais exceptionnellement servi."}
{"text":"You have to love their samosas, just go get a batch and chow down. Just don't forget those samosas pack quite a few calories."}
{"text":"Used to come here often a long time ago. Came back today to see that they had repainted the walls and changed all their tables and chairs which is a good thing. 
But that's like putting lipstick on a pig.
Our table seemed to have been wiped off with a dirty rag and the waiter never put any place mats like our neighbors had.

I am here writing this review in bed still feeling queasy from their lunch meal.

I had a super thali which started with a watery and oily lentil soup. Followed with a vegetarian thali which was nice and spicy and tasted good.
The worst was yet to come as the evening server had arrived and came to our table mumbling something which we figured out later: I will bring you your dessert, a galum jamun burning hot , probably from their microwave oven. 
She mumbled that it was very hot...how about fixing that heat instead of telling the client to watch out \"I hope you burn yourself with our dessert!\"
Then she comes with a cup of tea,  when I pointed out how extremely dirty the cup was, instead of agreeing she told me that it came straight out of the dishwasher!
OK so all of these stains must be from you having absolutely no idea how a proper restaurant must be run.
The cheap price is not worth it.
What a terrible server. 
She should not be anywhere near food. 
She should use her minimal talents as a server and go clean the toilet area which are a disgrace.
I later noticed CBC had come here to verify their cleanliness and the owner seemed absolutely clueless \"I am not in the business of cleaning\" Well it shows.
Dirty curtains in the front windows are a clue of what kind of people run this place.
I can just imagine what disgusting practices they have in the kitchen.
Too bad cause their tbali was good.
Please fire that horrible server and get a professional crew to clean this place up before something goes horribly wrong.
Another restaurant that can't focus on more than one thing.
Another great contender for an episode of Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmare."}
{"text":"I thought I would add to my first review, since it has been awhile. This is still my go-to for vegetarian indian food. I have to admit that I am a creature of habit and I pretty much always have the Paneer Korma when I go, but the other dishes are great too, like the okra and the potatoes and spinach. Their Samosas are really good and flavourful and cheap! Like I mentioned in my previous review of this place, the naan is really good as well. I have just tried their desserts for my first time, and they are excellent.

The decor is cute and the service was good the couple of times I ate in, although I usually order take-out. The prices are great and the food is super filling.
The parking lot can be a bit of a hassle, but generally it is easy to find parking. I recommend calling in your order if it is take-out, so you don't have to wait while they prepare it."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Indian food. I first came here roughly 2 years ago and cannot stay away. Their main dish, the thali, is the one I go for every time, including a samosa as an \"entree\". It comes with 3 different dishes, rice, naan and a small salad to clear the palate. The flavours are very rich and always comes out nice and hot. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, no matter if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in no way an upscale one. However, the prices are good and the food is delicious! It is a great place to go if you or your friends are vegetarian since it is 100% vegetarian and has tons of vegan options. The samosas are so cheap and are delicious and the sauce it comes with is the best. 
The restaurant is not the nicest place in the world but the owners are very nice and welcoming. I have eaten there and taken out food many times and am always wowed. Very recommended."}
