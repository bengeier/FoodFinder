{"text":"I went with my wife for a \"date night\" and was thoroughly impressed.   We had calamari to start which was excellent. I had lobster mac as my main and my wife had deconstructed chicken pot pie. Both were obviously made from scratch and very flavourful. The lobster mac in particular was fantastic.  The price was pretty much what I would expect from a good quality establishment.  Overall we were very happy and will be back."}
{"text":"We tried this place because we wanted a good burger and had heard this place was good.  We were highly disappointed. The burgers were impressive to look at but lacking any flavour. The topping were ok but the burger was not made of chuck not seasoned at all and overcooked with little to no juiciness left to it. And for fries, just ok.  The ambience at the place was depressed as it was mostly an older crowd, with no music playing.  I would have been happier to go to Five Guys, or M'Coys in Oshawa.  Or for the price, spend it on gas and go to The Burger Priest or Parts and Labour in Toronto.  The price for two burgers and fries (one sweet potato) and one beer was $43. Score tip.  The Selection of beer for a place that calls its self a gastropub was mediocre, at least they had a couple of local beers but not much and my draught was on the flattish side.  We noticed other patrons ordering pasta and overheard one couple request parmigiana to which they were told, sorry we do not have any.  Red Flag!!   Gastropub.....I do not think so."}
{"text":"Didn't know about this place - very new. A bunch of good friends took me there one night. Order a Guinness and see the owner work the magic on the foam ;-)"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! We had the burger special. YUM!!! Atmosphere is cozy, quant and comfy. Service is good. May I recommend that you upgrade to the beet salad? Way better than fries!  Also try the deviled eggs while you wait. I asked for no bun and he made me a lettuce as a substitute  brushed with aioli sauce. I'm leaving satisfied and not feeling any guilty tummy health regrets! Check it out! There's a few other things on the menu I'll be coming back to try."}
{"text":"We had the club sandwich and the Turkey burger - both were excellent. The waitress was very knowledgeable, very friendly and just the right amount of attentive. While not on the menu they do cater to children as well...I've seen reviews that might lead you to believe it's not for families but while it's not Boston Pizza that's kind of exactly what makes it so amazing IT'S NOT BOSTON PIZZA!! I had the Turkey burger mostly because I like to be disappointed and usually when I get turkey burgers they are nearly flavourless  - if a place can make a Turkey burger, I'm not too worried about the rest of the menu. OMG...the flavour was BURSTING out of this burger, I'm no gourmet but I know food that tastes awesome and this food TASTED AWESOME! I'd heard the fries were good and as far as fries go yes they were very good but I'm still not a fan of fries so...I'd try a different side unless you're a huge fry fan in which case you'll love them. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday. It was quiet but the owner/bartender was very friendly and helpful. Food was yummy (can't go wrong with any of the burgers) and they have a great list of beers on tap. Looking forward to coming back to try the pulled pork!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We decided to check The Vault out based on the reviews on Yelp. We had the Chef's Burger with beet salad on the side. Both were excellent, along with the beers. Everything on the menu looks appealing. Will definitely go again and give something else a try."}
{"text":"Love this spot!   I have brought my husband and my daughter here. We love their fish tacos!   The staff is super friendly and helpful and the prices are very reasonable.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome burgers and appetizers. Great little selection of food. Staff are all friendly and fast. Been a few times and will continue to go back. Only complaint is the parking situation. Ok if you luck out and get a spot out front on Brock."}
{"text":"It was my birthday and I'm a sucker for a gastropub. Wanting to stick around Durham, I found The Vault, former location of Marca. The interior had been updated, but the large dark wood bar remained. I liked the open concept of the kitchen; from where we were sitting, we could see the cook!   Our server was welcoming and attentive. We were seated immediately and our drink orders taken. They have a decent beer selection with a mixture of mainstream and local beers. She went over the specials and my mom chose the Curry Chicken Burger. My step-dad and I both went with the Steak Frites.    Our dishes arrived, hot, fresh and made to order. The steak was ok; a little chewy.The fries reminded me of a chip truck. The arugula salad was great. My mom didn't enjoy her burger; she said the patty was processed and probably frozen. Not exactly a crowd pleaser. The tempura pineapple on it was fantastic.   While our server was great, the manager seemed too busy with his phone to notice if anyone was there. He would give the server direction occasionally, but mostly just stood there with his eyes glued to his phone. There were only a few tables taken and he didn't walk around to see how his customers were enjoying it there. I know managers are busy, but I'm sure there's somewhere else you could be doing business rather than in plain sight of your customers.   It wasn't until we were leaving that we mentioned it was my birthday. Our server said we should've told her as they do a birthday shot! Damn!   I read the other reviews and had high expectations! Everyone else seemed to love this place, but we were less than impressed. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The Vault has amazing food.  I love the way hey always have 2-4 items not on the menu and their specials are just that special.  The burgers are outstanding and French fries are wow!  I don't even like club sandwiches but I do at The Vault!  Fresh food, nice atmosphere and great people."}
{"text":"I was really excited about eating lunch at the Vault after reading all the positive reviews from other diners, however the food was disappointing and was sub-par.   We had the Roasted Beet Salad, the Mac & Cheese Balls, and the Melted Brie Turkey Balls to share. Both the mac & cheese and turkey balls were lacking flavour and salt. There were no spices in the turkey balls and the mac & cheese was heavy and covered in ketchup. The beet salad came in a great portion size and was quite good, although the dressing was also lacking in flavour.   Overall, the ambiance and service were fantastic, and the portion sizes were a great value for the price. But the kitchen needs to seriously step up their game in terms of flavour; after all, this is a \"gastropub\"."}
{"text":"So this place just made my day!! The lobster and crab Mac and cheese with truffle oil with Brie was an amazing marriage of flavours!  My boyfriend ordered the jerk flavoured wings, the wings are a good size and the spice was good!  Service was extremely good energy and friendly with excellent recommendations.  The volt room at the end of the restaurant with the penny floors is definitely worth checking out.  For sure I will be back!"}
{"text":"It's a good option for the downtown area of Whitby. The decor is dark, not family oriented.  Food was fantastic all items: Carrot Ginger Soup Beet Salad Fish Tacos   Service: very friendly.  Parking: hassle, street parking at meter, lots of traffic  I would go back again, as it's hard to find food of this quality in Durham."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! We have been here many times. The food is always fresh, delicious and not overly pricey. Love sitting in the Vault too!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Turkey meatballs were fantastic. Service was great too. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Interesting place in Whitby.  Limited menu but what they have is good food.  Pretty busy for late dinner."}
{"text":"A-MAZ-ING!!!! Small pub in the heart of downtown Whitby. Staff are super friendly and accommodating.  Food quality of top notch!!  Absolutely amazing meat in their burgers!!  Mac and cheese balls are a must have!  Beet Salad is to die for!! Cheese Board is perfect for a casual night with a friend and a drink! Fries are amazing too!!"}
{"text":"I chose this place because it was recommended by Yelp and was surprised that it was as good as they said. We had the calamari and it crunchy and tasty. I did not enjoy the garlic bread as much.  It too creamy, needed more garlic. I had the salmon naan with the beet salad. The beet salad with feta cheese was superb. I totally enjoyed it. I recommend it.   I did not give it a five star because our server was pleasant but felt she was rushing us. Which I would have understood if there was a line up but my party wanted a relax time and we felt rushed.   Hopefully we will return."}
{"text":"I am no fan of the term \"gastropub\", I don't know why. It just sounds ridiculous and pretentious or something like that. My inclination to call this a four star review, but really thinking about it, I can't come up with anything that actually merits that.  The Vault wound up our destination to celebrate my wife's graduation from Durham College - and it was a popular place that night with graduates, so much so that we were lucky to get in without reservations.  The Vault's got a pretty good selection of beers, and a lot of small plates that are perfect accompaniment to those beers - mac & cheese balls and the meatballs were pretty nice, good gyoza as well. There's a number of different options that we just didn't get to, enough to make going back worth it I think. It's got a neat vibe, good service, and reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Nice atmosphere and the Mac and cheese balls are to die for! Will be back sooner than later five star yum!"}
{"text":"Just yes! Great little place with amazing food. Salmon is wild caught and they let me replace the sides with veggies. Dear Lord, the veggies should be a main course. Friendly staff, too. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried something new & loved it! Great staff & food! Coming back for sure! Garlic bread was great & beef cheek.  Fish & chips was great too!  Live music was an unexpected bonus!"}
{"text":"The reviews for this place aren't lying! The staff are wonderful the owner Steve is very accommodating. We were celebrating our daughters 19th  birthday Steve brought her a flaming shooter! The food is generous portions and delicious! It's not a quiet romantic nook so don't expect that - it was a perfect night!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been it's been amazing. The beet salad is awesome!! Burgers of the week are always so so good and freshly made in house. I will continue to go and recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Just got back from having an amazing dinner at The Vault. Our appetizers were delicious. Mac and cheese balls and a Caesar salad. Very generous portions. My husband's burger and fries was gourmet goodness and my tikka chicken was very flavourful. The chutney that accompanied it was my favourite flavour of the night. The owner is super nice and I must say everyone looked as if they were truly enjoying themselves. The great staff helps with the friendly vibe.  We will definitely return and bring friends. This is the best place we have been to in Whitby. The value for your money can't be beat. The charm of the building and carefully designed private rooms make The Vault a charming destination and the quality of the food and service are top notch. Too full to write anymore."}
{"text":"We tried this place last Friday and we absolutely loved it! The place has a very nice atmosphere, buzzing place. We shared their crab cakes appetizer and it was delicious! They have a good variety of choices and I ended up getting the lobster grilled cheese and my husband got the smoked meat sandwich (can't quite remember the actual name...). I am always hesitant to try grilled cheese since I have a very particular \"way\" of how I like my grilled cheese, (not too cheesy, not too salty... Bread not too thick, etc). I love their grilled cheese lobster! I can taste every single component in there. I wasnt able to finish the whole sandwich and had it the next day and it was still perfect! I like it even cold!! Their fries is absolutely delicious as well! We will definitely be coming back here"}
