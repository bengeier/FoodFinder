{"text":"We are loyal Tonio's Pizza fans. Whenever I visit my parents we get pizza from Tonio's and it is excellent. We think it's the best pizza in Medina County and we're of Sicilian descent, so we are picky. 

We recommend the sausage topping on the pizza. And the calzones are the best. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The pizza is very fresh, timely and the people are friendly! their toppings are plentiful and all of the specialty pizzas are delicious. I wish it wasn't so expensive, though."}
{"text":"Local pizza is usually all the same. I've seen this place change names and owners 4 or 5 times in my lifetime. The pizza here is pretty typical it's good enough to satisfy a craving if you want delivery where I'm from. However in my opinion I think it's over priced for what it is and the price for me is what makes it lack in stars. It tastes good yes, but I would rather drive for 30 minutes to get better pizza for cheaper. Some people swear by it, however I remember a time when D&K ( Mumfords restaurant, now the Hungry bear ) was the pizza place in town selling the best pizza in my mind to date."}
