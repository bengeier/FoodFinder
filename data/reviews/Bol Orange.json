{"text":"Bol Orange is an adorable family-run Korean restaurant beside Côte-Vertu metro station. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced (about 10$/dish).

We ordered a bowl of regular rice cakes which had just the right balance of spicy and sweet. The sauce was super flavourful and we even mixed some into the hot plate bulgogi bibimbap. We also had some seafood pancake which was chewy but missing a bit of taste (the sauce was a bit too salty).
We cooled down our tastebuds with some red bean shaved ice containing a decent amount of soft mochis 

Overall a lovely meal and very friendly service. Will definitely be back to try some more."}
{"text":"Another great addition to Saint-Laurent. The food is very flavorful and reasonably priced. The restaurant is simple. The service is super friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good quality korean food with very affordable prices. Portions are just enough. Nees to come back to try out the rest of their menu. There are too many delicious choices."}
{"text":"I have tried the bugolgi ramyun and ddukbokki ramyun and they were both delicious! The broth was mildly spicy, which made it easier to drink. The noodles along with the ddukbokki were perfectly cooked, and the bugolgi was seasoned well. The staff was very friendly and the service was very good! :)"}
{"text":"Bol orange jappelerais plus ca ta mere la pute. il te serve du vagin cuit dans une sauce au poire tout sa de couleur orange comme les regles de ta mere. Un soupcon de mousse a raser a ete etaler partout sur ma graine ce qui a fait de star wars le film le plus crade du monde. Le potage goutait la poussière et les serveurs goutaient la trisomie il font tous le signe de renaud et mette leur penis dans nos assietes."}
{"text":"I just recently started my quest of korean restaurant outside of dtown  so I decided to give Bol Orange a try. We tried the cheese ramen, the spicy fried chicken and brochette of rice cake. Everything was good with the right amount of spicy and very very tasty. I wish the chicken served didn't look like this frozen chicken wing we buy in bags in supermarkets. The restaurant seems like it's family run and they were very friendly despite a bit a of language barrier.
If you are looking for a fancy restaurant , this is jot the place for you. However, it's good enough for a feel good lunch or supper with friends."}
{"text":"Great prices for portion served, their takoyakis are the authentic \"must-try\" in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wonderful Korean food and really Great value.  One of the best I have eaten in the US.  Will come back here for dinner again.  Simple white tile decor, clean restaurant and small open kitchen on the side.  Large screen with Korean pop videos on back wall."}
{"text":"Amazing Korean food!! Hidden gem in Saint-Laurent. Super lucky!
I've tried many dishes here; ramyun, bulgogi, galbi, bibimbap, tteokbokki. All of them are delicious! :D
A must go!

It's also nice that it's a family-owned restaurants. The owners a such nice people!"}
{"text":"This place is so good at a very reasonable price! It definitely is a rival to Ganadara. Their spicy tuna roll is actually spicy- which I love. Definitely a must try place."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean cuisine, the ingredients are fresh every time I go. I'm very picky when it comes to tofu and their tofu never disappoints. I'm really glad that there's a nice authentic Korean restaurant in Saint-Laurent area. Don't get fooled by this restaurant's looks, it's worth trying if you like Korean food."}
{"text":"So happy we gave this place a try because it doesn't look like much from the outside but it's pretty awesome . The beef bim bim bap was delicious and fresh. The fried dumplings didn't taste frozen for once and they came with this herby dipping sauce that was amazing. Their sweet and sour fried chicken was so good I almost ate the whole container. Really addictive food. Staff was nice and attentive and the prices are reasonable. Bim bim baps are 12$ dumplings were 7$ and a portion of fried chicken was 9$. The clientele is mostly students from what I saw but I was only there long enough to pick-up food on a Friday. It's definitely busy though with a lineup starting to form around 7pm. It's worth whatever wait is necessary and we'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"Verry underrated. They have a good service and the food is really good with a lot of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see an authentic Korean place open in my neighbourhood. But sadly the food was ok. Portions were small for the price. I would not go back. And the service was slow and rude."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for a quick lunch.
We've been exploring this part of Montreal (Saint-Laurent) recently.
So far, Bol Orange was the most enjoyable Korean we had in this area."}
{"text":"Their ramen was fantastic it could have used a bit more beef but the broth made up for it.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other items. Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"I'm very happy i found this place. I went several times with my boyfriend, family and friends. 

The food tastes authentic and is very reasonably priced and the portion are generous. I recommend: 

- the bibimbap in the stone bowl 
- the seafood spicy soup 
- and of course, the fried chicken. 

They have a good varied menu, everything looks delicious honestly. 

The place is very casual, its really a place you go to just eat, not necessarily spend an evening. The only minus to this place is that the service is pretty slow.. expect to wait 30 minute before getting your order, but overall, its a good place to get your korean fix :)"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you are hungry and it's late. The restaurant closes at 10. However you may not eat in after 9:00pm. You are only allowed to take out which makes no sense. They said it would take too long to serve and for us to eat so we were not allowed to sit or order. 

If you post on the door that you are open till 10:00 and I get there before 10 I should be allowed to order and eat. Even if I go over 10 minutes after you are done with service you still have to clean the kitchen. 

I don't know how this place got 4.5 stars. Will not be coming back and will warn others to stay away as well."}
{"text":"This is a cozy family-run restaurant that serves some common Korean comfort foods. The few times I've been there so far, I've had the bimbimbap in the dolsot a couple time. Authentic and tasty! I've also tried their friend chicken (both pieces and the boneless types they make and sell). It's unfortunate the borough had converted the small nearby parking lot into what seems to be an under-utilized public space, otherwise, I'd swing by this place more often. I'll find a way though!"}
{"text":"Amazing hole-in-the-wall place in a neighbourhood that does not offer the most authentic ethnic foods! The bibimbap is as good as it gets and I love the small family-run kitchen, the focused menu options as well as the interesting K-Pop music videos."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they've opened in Ville St-Laurent! It is situated 1 minute from metro Cote vertu which is a plus! The place is small and has few tables but enough to welcome around 30 people. 
I've been there many times and I've never been disappointed by the food. The portion is pretty big and the prices are really reasonnable compared to other Korean places. For reference,  a plate of rice cakes is 8$+tax. 
The staff are so nice and courteous. 
It is definitely a hidden gem and I encourage people to try it if they feel the crave!"}
{"text":"Bol Orange has exceeded my expectations.

The location of the restaurant is semi-hidden, as it gets shadowed by \"Tecnic\", the driving lesson company, and Subway, whose signs are way bigger than \"Bol Orange\".

I don't even need to say much about this restaurant; it is affordable, it is delicious, and it is fast - great service!

Please pay a visit to this hidden gem right next to the Côte-Vertu metro if you have the time! If you don't, well, MAKE TIME because it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"La bouffe etait excellent, service raisonnable et se n'est vraiment pas  cher. Les prix sont etonnement bas et on aime ça.Tout le monde a adoré sont plat!!  The chicken wings werr so crispy  and juicy! Amazing lil place."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Korean food and let me say that this place is AMAZING! Fantastic food, healthy, full of flavor and simply excellent in terms of quality and service! Will definitely go back there and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"On business travel perhaps my favorite thing to do is check out the local food scene. I decided to drive around the area and stumbled upon this place and gave it a try. This looks like your typical \"hole in the wall\" family owned and run restaurant and I must say it was very good! Service was ok but the food was worth the visit. Everything on the menu is say was reasonably priced. I ordered the bibimbap and I side of veggie dumplings. They were out of the veggie so I ended up getting chicken instead. The main course was very good along with the spicy sauce served on the side. Next time I'm in town , I'd give this place another try. Seemed like a good neighborhood area and the food was worth the visit."}
{"text":"My favorite korean restaurant!!! Their food taste authentic and is flavorful, definitely better than GaNaDara in downtown guy & it's perfectly located next to the metro"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place to grab Korean food. The price is very decent for what you get and the owners are really nice. It has a family owned feel which I like. The food is also really good! One of my favorite dish is the green onions fried chicken which is great to share. Also, their lunch boxes are pretty worth it because you get to try different things."}
{"text":"Small place but the food is excellent. It's very authentic and the price is not expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I had an enjoyable Dolsot Bibimbap Bulgogi served in a hot sandstone bowl. The dish was well presented and everything was very tasty. I was however a little disappointed by the rarity of bulgogi in the bowl.

Service was friendly, small family owned resto that normally would have been easy to miss on a busy Decarie street. Worth the visit would come again!

Price-tag was decent."}
{"text":"Simple decor and clean. A bit noisy. Excellent food for the price. No complaints on their ramen (quite spicy), katsu or panjeon dishes."}
{"text":"I heard from friends that this restaurant is like Ganadara in Côte-Vertu, I would say... not even close. I have tried quite a lot of Korean restaurants in Montreal and I am not expecting much from Bol Orange, and I was quite right. The food is fine in general and the restaurant is quite cosy, it's just that nothing was outstanding. We ordered pork bone soup, tuna kimbap, seafood pancake and steamed chicken dumplings. The price is fair and the service was quick. Credit and debit cards are accepted."}
{"text":"This is an awsome korean restaurant. Very simple. Small menu. Food tastes delicious. The owner is very mild, doesn't talk much but is very attentive to the customers and is kind. It seems his wife is the cook (not sure though) But she's a great chef and give us a nice come back again goodbye. We ordered the bulgogi hot stone bibimbap. It came as the usual sizzling hot with a side of their spicy red sauce. It was delicious. Only negative would be we could barely tastes the meat since their was so little of it in the bowl. But for $10 we were still satisfied. Overall will definitely go back since we live in the area and dont always want to drive far for korean."}
{"text":"My first time ever trying Korean food and let me tell you it was worth it !! I first hesitated because it looks like a small random place but thank God I went with my gut feeling. They're bim bap plates are delicious. The chicken is what I took and it was flavorful, tender and healthy came with veggies and hot rice in a hot bol! I would surely recommend it to everyone & the people are so sweet and it feels like a family based restaurant."}
