{"text":"My new favourite place.

Such a cool vibe. Feels like your in the early 1900s. Good music and worker dressed accordingly and was friendly and cracking jokes at 9am Monday morning.

Latte was very good, well priced but was not as hot as I would like. 

All in all I can say I will be stopping here now on"}
{"text":"Mike and Tony are great guys, great conversationalists (and funny!) and the latt√© was smooth, subtle yet complex deliciousness. Also a great place to chat while getting your after lunch coffee (I even made a business contact while I was there!). Well done gents, well done..."}
{"text":"Rapido Espresso Bar is very good for a quick latte or snack on the go. The lattes are delicious and the service is very friendly. The decor inside is very cool. I would recommend the Oreo doughnuts, they are to die for. 
The only disappointment is that there is no place to sit down, if there was a place to sit I would likely be there more than twice a week since it is so close to the Concordia campus."}
{"text":"5-star recommend ! Good cafe with excellent service. I like their MISTO and Mocha very much. A very cozy environment! Really like the design. Two bosses understand cafe very well and respect the culture of cafe very well, therefore their Cafe is unique!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and very friendly service. So much better than Starbucks :). You can charge your phone while you wait as well (Android and iPhone). My only complaint would be that my latte could've been a bit hotter--it was right at a comfortable drinking temperature, but I had to walk in the chilly weather for a bit. Even so, I'll definitely be back soon!

Mini edit: never had the temperature issue again! Awesome :) 

I've got to say that their espresso is incredible! I'm usually a \"dessert coffee\" drinker, but one time I forgot to add sugar to my latte, and I absolutely loved it on its own, and I've had it that way ever since. That should speak to its quality!"}
{"text":"Donuts from Trou de Beigne every Wednesday!! But they are almost sold out by Wednesday night.

Excellent service and coffee!!!! Your 10th coffee is free, they give you a little stamp card. This card is only for coffee purchases though.

It's a little square room with a counter. No seating (or staying) inside. Sometimes it's busy but people do not become chaotic."}
