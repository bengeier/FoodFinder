{"text":"Très bon buffet Indien servi à la table à volonté. Tout est frais et servi chaud. Le service est bien et les serveurs/ses sont très polis. Le choix du midi est très économique soient 9$ végé et 11$ viandes. La place est propre et décorée sobrement avec goût. Je vais revenir certainement."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery which is a la carte so I can't comment on their buffet or service staff. We ordered 5 dishes: chicken korma, lamb biryani, shahi paneer, chana masala, and eggplant; as well as naan bread and poppadum. They included 3 gulab jamun for free, which I thought was a perfect intensely sweet ending. I found each dish had distinct flavors and some had a great kick of chili which I seem to crave. Indian food makes me love vegetarian food so I was particularly fond of those. The one glaring flaw was that a couple of the poppadums were a burnt, but it didn't deter  me. The order was about $65 with tax + tip and easily fed 3, although we found the chicken and paneer were on the small side because they were mainly sauce (really good sauce).  Since they deliver through Just Eat the wait time is a bit long. I think we will order through them again the future, I would love to try the chai another reviewer mentioned."}
{"text":"They get two stars for effort. Hubby wanted to try it out since it was all you can eat. Except it's not as they only have a small selection of items to choose from. We were there on a Monday evening so perhaps it's a shorter version of what's usually on? But I guess I'll never know. The place seems to be popular for their Thalia's as that's what the people that came around the same time were having. I mean it's definitely the best bang for your buck. We took the all you can eat like gluttons but didn't really enjoy what we got. The photo I took was of the lunch menu but it's the same for the dinner and the price is 17.96$. So I ordered a tandoori, butter chicken and naan. The tandoori was chewy and not made in a clay oven. The butter chicken was okay and I think the naan was best of the 3. Hubby ordered the pakoras which he enjoyed, along with palak paneer and beef vindaloo which he didn't enjoy and suffered through. They don't include tea in their \"a volonté\" which I think is a shame. Overall we paid 50$after tax and tip and literally had food worth 10$. So not worth it at all! Probably won't go back here"}
{"text":"A recent addition to many existing restaurants in the Parc ex area. They have typical Indian decor with typical menu. We ordered there butter chicken thali and vegeterian thali. The food was okay, nothing innovative or impressive. Service was average. For the price of thalis though it was good enough.  They offer both a la carte and buffet options. To be noted: their chai was authentic, tasty, fresh. I might just revisit for the chai only :)"}
