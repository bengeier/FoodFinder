{"text":"I would give the food 5 stars but the place is not ideal for sitting down with small chairs and no washroom, thought its kept very clean..   They serve subs/salad/soup. The subs are amazing and much more valuable than subway.. They are what you would call FRESH and HEALTHY (of course if you choose your toppings wisely).  I usually get the roasted chicken on wholewheat bread and just love how fresh and good it tastes.   I also tried the chicken salad which had plenty of chicken slices on it and was a great portion.   They also do catering for parties and the platters look very good on picture, thought I've never actually tried them.  Overall, I highly recommend you give them a try.. I've heard good things about the stake as well!"}

{"text":"High quality food. Resembles home cooked food. Philly cheese steak is amazing. They do a lot of catering they tell me. People are super nice and not stingy. Even their plastic containers and knives and forks are nicer sturdier quality too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a co-worker. Talise has sub type sandwiches with lots of toppings on them. See the website for selection. But if you're not in the mood for bread, you can also have those sandwiches in a plate version without the bread & with a side of salad, roasted veggies ,or fries. I had the roasted veggies with fish on top to go. Seating is very limited. Just a bunch of chairs & small tables with no washroom. So this place is probably best as take away unless you live/work nearby. When I first saw my take away container I thought I might get hungry later. It seemed kinda small. But for 8.25 I got two fish fillets along with the roasted veggies which consisted of cucumber, mushrooms, & onions. For the garnishes I chose lettuce, parsley & tomatoes. I ended up pleasantly full. The food is fresh & tasty. The lady who took my order didn't seem to be fluent in English, but she knew just enough to take my order. Still, she was quite charming with her big smile & \"I bring your food now\" comment as she packed my order up. Just an FYI, you may have some wait time as they seem to make their food on demand, like a restaurant & the guy before me had been waiting 10 minutes."}
