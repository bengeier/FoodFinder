{"text":"Delicious! Just tried vegetarian (sweet potato) burrito with majority of the topping offerings (rice, refried beans, roasted corn, edamame, pineapple salsa, pickled onions, salsa, pico de gallo, gauc, and the burrito sauce)....and it was heavenly. So glad there's a quality place like this nearby!"}
{"text":"some good burritos and good service.  so much options and for a fairly decent price considering how big the burritos.  the people working there are friendly and patient."}
{"text":"Friendly service. I ordered a small Fish Burrito to go, $11 after tax - Big portions for the price. Tons of interesting fillings to choose from - thumbs up for the Apple Slaw, Grilled Corn, and Pineapple Salsa. The ordering process is a little more laborious than I would have liked for  a lunch takeout, but I really appreciate the effort. I waited about 25min from order to pick-up, so time your pickup if you are in a rush for lunch.   Nice addition to the Annex. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried out Bloor location yesterday. I got the 4 tacos for $13 ( 2 steak and 2 chicken). Price is great considering they stack the tacos with whatever toppings you like. Service was great too, and they don't overcharge for Jarritos like a lot of other places. My buddy did the quesadilla and it was huge! He loved it too. All in all, great experience. My only complaint is that it sits quite heavy for a little while. Next time I will go for veggie or the fish"}
{"text":"the guy threw away my receipt and sneezed while making my burrito. But it's open late and tastes ok so I'll maybe go back."}
{"text":"This Queen street location is the grand opening day today. I am loving the energy here! We ordered 4 different tacos, the chorizo has an amazing flavour. Usually, I am not a huge fan of meat, I've always just order fish taco, but this burrito place, you can flavour the different level of spice. All the meat are so flavourful!  I did order a beer battered fish burrito. Afterall the name is called \"bang bang burrito\" so how can I step foot here without ordering a burrito. The pineapple salsa adds a nice kick to it, along with the crush chips. You can customize what you want to add in it.   They give you a sticker to put your name on it and you can stick it anywhere to mark that you were here! I thought that was kind of fun, especially when I love sticking things on walls. After I try this place, since my hubby works out on the east end, I was thinking to myself, how come we didn't find out about this place earlier as the first location started in Oshawa."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I got it because nothing else was open (they get the second star for being open), almost couldn't eat it but I was very hungry.  I won't come back unless extremely desperate."}
{"text":"I liked this place, will return.  The product is definitely very solid - I had a regular burrito which was a reasonable serving even at a price of $13.  Their toppings are great and it greatly simplifies things to just have one price for the burrito no matter what you get on it.   I did find it was a bit slow because it allows for so much customization, so brace yourself for that if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"If you like super nice people and GIGANTIC burritos, this is the place for you. I got a \"regular\" and it was more than enough to feed a small family. I couldn't finish it, even with help from my husband. The ingredients are fresh and all homemade, and they do not skimp on anything. They're super generous with portions, perhaps to a fault. Next time I'll have to ask to make mine small or get the small. I feel like there needs to be a prize for anyone who can eat the \"massive\" size. Some highlights are: interesting toppings like pineapple salsa, green apple coleslaw, and a really nice dry toasted corn salsa; prices include tax - you pay what you see; whole wheat tortillas available in the regular size; and you get two meats (I had chicken and beef, it was tasty). Go check it out, and go hungry!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! The pineapple salsa has chunks of pineapple so when they say they make everything themselves, believe them. Absolutely amazing, all the spicy, sweet and savory flavors--I suggest having all the toppings together. Even the sweet potato is seasoned. Support this local burrito joint!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Annex! Very nice staff, and fun twists on standard burrito toppings!"}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday for the first time and it was amazing! I had the small burrito for 11$ (including taxes) and it was already a big meal. The owner and the staff are really friendly and welcoming! They explained me the concept : You can choose any meat, and mix different meats if you want to! Then, you can add anything you want (no extra fees, even for the guacamole). They have so many different ingredients (like Pineapple Salsa), much more than any other place I've been. They also have a loyalty card, so you can get one for free after 9 visits. The burrito was delicious, the best one I had so far! Great atmosphere, I highly recommend Bang Bang Burrito and I will go back for sure :)"}
{"text":"I was with a group of friends walking by Bloor st last night hungry and tipsy at 3:30 am in the morning.  We saw their was still open for service. We knew right away this was a new store so we decided to walk in and try it out . I order their pulled pork Quesadillas, and I must say this was the best Quesadilla I've had tried in this city after a very long time. I love these hidden Gems you get to find in this very diverse city. And what really surprised me was that they did not charge me for Guacamole lol. If you ever get here then make sure you try their Apple slaw and Pineapple salsa. At first I wasn't sure if I should make my food taste fruity, but I was glad I tried them . They just blended so well with their pulled pork. Unbelievably delicious.  Were all Definitely going back"}
