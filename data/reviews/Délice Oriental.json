{"text":"Located besides the much adored Kazu Japanese restaurant Delice seems to serve quite authentic chinese food of a specific region who eat spicy food - schezuan, hubei. 
A first timer there,  asked for suggestion. The server was very helpful with honest suggestions even discouraging me to take a specific fish dish. Went with suggested chicken pepper n potato and schezuan noodles for side. Not for mild palate or the sugar coated saucy ones . It's fiery perfect blend of spice n oil but not throat burning and chicken succulent. Will be back again to explore more.
Overall: Service friendly, portions pretty good, better if you in a group as they serve the big portion dishes like whole grilled fishes. Food authentic though not claiming to be an expert in Chinese cuisine. Ambience acceptable"}
{"text":"Loved the grilled fish on my first visit back in July. So decided to come back again today with some friends and my daughter. The service could have been better: we SPECIFICALLY asked for 2 plates to be prepared non spicy (a winter melon dish and a sauteed pork dish), when the pork dish came, we all digged in to eat some and when my daughter realized the dish was spicy, I looked into the plate and found lots of hot pepper!!! When I asked the waitress to change it, her answer was \"sorry, you already ate a quarter of the dish so we cant take it back, since the dish cannot be sold to other customers, if you have eaten less I could have taken it back. REALLY UNACCEPTABLE!! First, as a restaurateur, if you make a mistake you take back the dish and do it again, second you ARE NOT supposed to give a dish that has been eaten to other clients.... DISGUSTING!!!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant ever!!!!!! horrible ambiance, over rated food.TOOO expensive for low quality menu.
Shrimp fried rice is 13 $(+tax 15$) which includes a few frozen beans a few baby(really baby smaller than beans)shrimps and then a big plate of bland,boring rice. I can make the same dish with 3 bucks at home in few minutes.
Never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"I've had better experience in this restaurant before. The food is decent. But the service is so bad. 

We went in on a saturday night, around 8 pm. The place was busy and the service is a bit slow. After we finished ordering we sat there for more than half an hour waiting for the food to come. I was starving at the moment so I called for the waitress and asked how much longer do we have to wait. She had the most crappy attitude and went like\"you just have to wait, see these two customers? They came in before you and have waited for an hour without a complaint\". I was astonished by how rude she was since I was quite polite to her. And having customers waiting for their food for an hour is really unacceptable. 

Would not come back again."}
{"text":"I went in having loved what the past restaurant was. 

I was having a craving for hot & sour soup. We were sited then I make my order, to which the waitress insists on having me order more food. I politely decline then she pushes for another plate to which i didn't want to cause a scene, i ordered the General tso.

I mention my food allergies to the waitress, to which when i receive my soup has contains what I am allergic to. I remind her about mentioning my allergy to which after insisting with her, she brings back a soup I can eat. 

We get the General Tso, It was mostly breaded and less meat. Ihave about 3 pieces since I only wanted the soup. I excuse myself from the table, which a co worker asked me how I was enjoying my visit, and I asked if there was a minimum amount of food one could order in a sitting because the waitress is insistent, the co worker says she'll talk to my waitress. I sit back down to have the waitress come argue with me asking if it really was too much food, to which I said yes. She insisted again that I was wrong and that i should try harder. At this point, having worked in another customer service I decided I had enough but was respectful enough still to not cause a scene & demanded my bill. I paid and left very upset with my dining experience. Terrible. what a shame."}
{"text":"I have been twice with friends and once solo.  The food, which is very authentic and from Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces, was excellent all three times.  Many, though not all, of the dishes are quite spicy (as they should be), so be sure to ask the waiters if you cannot handle the spice.  They'll be happy to modify it for you.  

Dishes to try include the braised chicken, potatoes, and green peppers (spicy), sizzling black pepper beef (not spicy), as well as the lamb dishes, the noodle dishes, and the charcoal fish.  The General Tso/Tao's, for those looking for something more familiar, is also quite good."}
{"text":"The service wad very prompt even though we visited this place on a busy Saturday evening. Also, out dishes all arrived fairly quickly and tasted quite authentic.

I have to say, if you truly want to enjoy real Chinese food, ask your server and he'll tell you what's best. Sometimes you just have to go out of your comfort zone and be wowed by what other cultures have to offer. That being said, I ordered some of the stuff that I've had in China and it truly took me back there."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the mood for steak.

Look around and it's the wrong neighborhood for steak.

Second craving was Asian food.
Not knowing a whole lot about Chinese cuisine, we relied on which of the 10 or so restaurants in this area had the most clientele from that part of the world.
It kinda lets me know how authentic something is


I pass by here a lot and never saw this place that opened about a year ago.

Don't tell the language police but there are almost no signs in French or English, a pretty good sign it caters to ex-pats.

This place specializes in cuisine from the Hubei province in China, the waitress said they eat pretty spicy, which is an understatement.

Lordy lord is this food spicy, and I love spicy.

The general Tao was the least spicy, sauce not too sweet and the breading was perfectly crisp.

The beef schezuan was pretty savoury and had a peppery kick.

The one dish that was over the top was the spicy fish swimming in a chili pepper broth.

The fish was perfect,  the seasoning very strong and a couple of teaspoons of the soup helped to warm up very quickly.

The service was OK, not amazing but in line with other similar places.

The prices are from $9 for the chicken to over $15 for some dishes.
There are some dishes that are way out of my taste palate like duck blood cake and beef tripes, but if it's your thing, this is the place."}
{"text":"A single vegetarian dish made me wait for over 20 mins. (I ordered for to go)

They promised to be 5-10mins. 

Employees were having snacks while working, so I'm worried about the hygiene. 

I'm NOT gonna be back here again!!!"}
{"text":"We went to eat in the afternoon.,,only us one table...the food was good...but the service is not fast.,.it's not busy,,,but we waited a little bit long....I like de spicy bamboo ,and xinjiang chicken....when we are eating.,.some people look outside,but they don't coming to eat...they need some English or frensh publicity..."}
{"text":"Their signature fish dish was the most delicious and spicy roasted fish ever! Also ordered a small spicy cucumber appetizer dish, both very authentic and flavourful (spicy). Would come again just for the fish! Too bad we are leaving montreal in the morning."}
{"text":"I went to Delice Oriental for Dinner on a saturday night. 
We ordered the authentic Szechuan cold dish Fuqifeipian (lungs), the pan grilled beef, and a spicy chicken dish.

The lungs and the chicken were spicy, and my non-Chinese friends required a lot of water to swallow. Nevertheless, we all found it tasty and personally, I think it does justice to the traditional Szechuan dish. Definitely recommend.

As for the pan grilled beef and onions, the sizzling sound makes my mouth water as I write this review. Very tasty. Recommended.

If only there was less oil in all the dishes.

Overall, we appreciated the experience at Delice Oriental, and would definitely return, when the Kazu next door is full."}
{"text":"My boyfriends favourite Chinese restaurant in Montreal. The service is the typical Chinese restaurant style, nothing over the top but they do bring everything you need when you ask them to. 
The food here are very good, a bit expensive comparing to others, but good flavours and authentic. 
Don't miss this restaurant if you like spicy Chinese food."}
{"text":"best traditional Chinese food in Montreal!i love spicy!the Fish in the charcoal Pot is sooooooo good!i will come
back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 dishes and absolutely love them all. Really spicy and fit my taste perfectly."}
{"text":"Their food is excellent but the service is so unsatisfactory. 
We would go their once a month ordering the roast fish which is a fish marinated, pan fried, grilled and boiled in the spicy soup, served in a big plate over small charcoal. You can order different kinds of spicy. 

I also recommend the pork/lotus root soup. The dishes with lotus root are all worth a try. 

The service was slow every time I went there. Their waiter and waitress can't do multiple tasks. We would like one cup of water and one empty glass. He did that by coming twice. He also forgot my order of one of two dishes. This happened before probably not the same waiter. What I dislike most is they don't give you receipt and only accept cash. That is so convenient for them..... Not us."}
{"text":"Giving this a 3 for the moment. We had king po chicken and also the dry spicy chicken with two portions of rice. Should probably have gone for the fish in the pot so will review this next time. Service was good, really nice waitress. I would say it was a bit on the pricey side"}
{"text":"Came with my friend. He invited to here because of their grilled hotpot fish.

Without any doubt, almost every table is ordering this dish. Very nice. 10/10 enough for two persons."}
{"text":"\"???\" ou Maison la Grue (l'oiseau) Jaune ... n'est pas \"délice oriental\". 

Bon! À Montréal, tout ça est très authentique; saveurs fines et plus subtiles que ce qu'on goûterait ailleurs. Les prix sont bons et enfin...! On peut y manger un ?? ! (poisson en cocotte) Le décor est on ne peut plus simple et l'ambiance décontractée, mais vivante! 

Si au service on ne s'entêtait pas à décider du niveau de chili selon son interlocuteur, j'aurais probablement donné 5 étoiles. Ah et prenez-pas le plat de maïs. Pour le reste c'est vraiment pas mal!"}
{"text":"I went there on a saturday night with 2 other friends. We had the Szechuan cold dish Fuqifeipian (lungs), the pan grilled beef, and a spicy chicken dish.
The service was efficient, and our dishes arrived quickly. 
The dishes were all really spicy, but good. Really enjoyed eating there, would return."}
{"text":"Finally found a decent (authentic) place! The service is decent, the wait time for food can be up to ten minutes depending on your order, but their portions are very hearty. The fish in hot chili oil can easily serve four or five people (and it is very delicious!). The sizzling dishes and meat skewers are also great!"}
{"text":"great fish, one of the best roasted eggplant in montreal, everything could use less oil but flavour is there."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and can finally say we have a decent chinese resto. All the dishes I love in china they have though its still not 100% its a close 90% to the real mcCoy. Spicy beef soup and chicken are excellent and esp their organic cauliflower, beans and everything else just great. Be prepared to cough while in there from the spice in the air but I love it. I will back again and again."}
