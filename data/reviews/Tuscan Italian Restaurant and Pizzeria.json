{"text":"Tuscan Italian Restaurant and Pizzeria is a really nice addition to the neighborhood. The emphasis here is on fresh ingredients and speed of service. I am particularly fond of the white pizza which is made with a variety of cheeses including fresh motzrella and ricotta."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a surprising little gem in an old shopping plaza. I went for lunch on a Wednesday with my mom and sister. We were promptly greeted by the wonderful and handsome Simi. He even held the door open for us on the way in. 

The interior has been completely revamped to look like some sort of village in Tuscany. It was pretty impressive considering that this location has undergone many tenants in the past with some pretty drab decor. 

We all started with the simple salad and house dressing. It was actually very good and had nice presentation. It was served with some fresh garlic rolls which were excellent. 

Then our entrees arrived. We ordered the eggplant Parmesan, eggplant rolletino and chicken Parmesan. The presentation was great and the food was outstanding. They give very large portions even for lunch. You do get a lot of food for your buck there. And their menu is pretty extensive to boot! So, do yourself a favor and pass up the Olive Garden and go here for authentic cooking!"}
{"text":"Everything I had was delicious!!! The focaccia bread and the garlic based olive oil to dredge the bread in was one of my favorites. I had the lasagna which was so good!!! Everything is fresh and made to order. I topped it off with the limoncello truffle for dessert, fabulous!!! The atmosphere is casual and relaxing. The staff is friendly and the service was excellent!!! I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"A surprising find in a tired shopping plaza.  Food was wonderful, service was on point.  Skip the Garden, and get here!!"}
