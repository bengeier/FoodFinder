{"text":"If you're in The Beaches and looking for a great little take out place, you can't beat Delina's. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at - it is pretty spartan, but is clean and has a couple of tables to eat at. The food, however, is great and reasonably-priced. A wide variety of middle eastern dishes are prepared freshly on the premises. As a vegetarian I am thrilled at the number of yummy salads and vegetable dishes they have to offer. And the rest of my family quite enjoy the different shwarmas and other meat and fish dishes they have on the menu. The serving size on their mixed plates is pretty generous. The owner is a lovely, friendly, hardworking lady who creates all her dishes from scratch. I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Ordered through justeat.ca and the food took 1.5 hours to arrive. My 2.5 year old was starved at this point. Unfortunately we didn't check the order when the delivery guy came and we just gave him the cash and away he went.  Of 9 items we ordered, we only received 4: a soup, a salad, chicken rice, and the beef plate with cabbage rolls. The rice in the cabbage rolls was completely uncooked so we could not even eat them. Definitely Not enough food to feed a family of 3...  I called the restaurant directly and they said the delivery guy had forgotten the drinks and samosa there. When I asked about the falafel plate and grape leaves that were also missing they gave me a vague explanation that they don't have some of the side items in our order (grape leaves (which they substituted with cabbage rolls) and spinach)...so I guess they just decided to not send us the entire falafel meal...with no plans to refund us for the food that was never sent...?  The person I was speaking to was apologetic and offered to drive the missing food and drinks to our house after the restaurant closed but I declined the offer because by then it would be bedtime already, probably. So I asked for a refund of the items we didn't receive and was told that the restaurant doesn't get the money--Just Eat gets it--so I'd have to take the matter up with them.  Truly not how I wanted to spend my Friday night...  The Just Eat phone rep was great, empathetic and listened well. In the end they offered a Just Eat voucher for an amount greater than the value of the missing food. I am conflicted about this because while it's a nice gesture, I still didn't get to eat dinner tonight and had to go through the hassle of it all. I am not convinced I would use Just Eat again, but they sort of force you to by issuing a voucher instead of a refund in your method of payment.  All in all, an epic fail."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy choices with excellent service. It can't be beat. Our neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"Had their falafel plate (comes with 3  falafel balls and 3 veggie sides). It was huge and delicious for $10. The service was fast and super friendly. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were in the Beaches area and wanted to grab some take out with us to eat at the beach. We ended up going to Dalina's and I'm so happy that we did.  All the food is prepared by Dalina herself ( who is the restaurant owner) . After having a short conversation with her it was easy to see that she loves what she does and prepares the food with passion and love.  The food is middle eastern, the ambiance is very simple and casual. And when I say simple I mean V-E-R-Y simple....it's more like a casual eatery sort of place.   I was happy to see that most of the food is vegetarian, so we had plenty to choose from. We ended up getting cabbage rolls, tabouleh, beet salad, delish lentil rice, and so much more. The food was unbelievable! So homemade and delicious. I literally can't wait to go back and have more of Dalina's delicious cooking ! :)"}
{"text":"Love Delinas as our quick go-to shawarma shop! Always friendly, heaps o toppings and authentic flavours.  Looking at the pop selection I feel like I am back in the Middle East - same brands but slightly different cans & flavours.  We get the chicken shawarma, falafel wrap and quite often the cabbage rolls. Del-ish!"}
{"text":"Until I had stopped in a few days ago, I had forgotten how amazing the food is at Delina Restaurant! As a very long time vegetarian, I love the huge selection of veggie food. The food is healthy, very fresh, and definitely home made. In talking with Aviva there I understand the great effort and work that goes into cooking every day. Cant say enough of how good the food is. I particularly like the lentil soup, and the lentils and rice. Also love the falafel when craving it. There are several selections and I have tried a mixed platter when wanting it all. The portions are generous and the prices are very inexpensive. Great place to get great food made with love! I think this is a small gem that has been missed! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place because of the great service, large portions but especially due to the large assortment fun salads for Vegans alike !"}
{"text":"Very nice service. They were super patient with us while we decided on what to get, which was hard because there were so many awesome options! This place is really good for vegetarians. Lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Cabbage rolls are the best I've ever had. Seriously-cabbage Rolls.  This is not a cookie-cutter middle-eastern falafel joint. It's different and better. They prepare the food with love. Best take-out in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best Shawarma in the city. Very good food here. Everything is fresh and they take pride in what they offer. I have had most things on the menu and it is a go to place when I want something quick. The fish sandwich is really good."}
{"text":"I went here to have a falafel on the basis of the previous reviews on here.  At the restaurant, I asked them if they prepare their falafel fresh and they said \"yes\". When they were preparing it, they took the falafel out of a Tupperware.  Perplexed, I asked her again if it was fresh and again she said yes.  Then after she finished assembling it she walked over to a grill press and put it in.  I told her I don't like it in the press and they said that's the best part.  What she meant I guess was that the grill press is what makes it tastes good.  All I can say is:  \"\"how sad...\"....  In any case, I gave her the benefit of the doubt.  I took one bite and it was cold.  I also don't think their falafel was made with chickpeas.  The falafel was on the white side inside. I returned it for my money and I had a keen sense that they were \"foul mouthing\" me in their language.  Can you blame me for returning it?  You decide if you want to eat at place like this."}
{"text":"Pardon me while I rave. This place is just a notch above a hole in the wall in size, so i missed it for the five years it's been here. Worth the wait! I had perhaps the best kale salad ever (spiced with garlic, red pepper, lemon and mint), + really good baba ghanouj + lima beans + quite good bass + very good hummus for under $12. Everything is well spiced--not too hot, but interesting. The seating is humble but could be chic cheap if they put as much effort into seating design as goes into making the food beautiful as well as tasty. Give us something that feels Beachy!  Bringing presentation into food isn't phony, as I argue in my ebook, Food for City Building; it's part of the environment we live in and the culture we create around good food. It's worth a little time to make it special -- worthy of the food that's eaten. I like to see this place as a perfect illustration of the fusion going on in Toronto. The food is said to be Middle Eastern. But the owner and chef is Ethiopian. There are many Ethiopian dishes, and much Ethiopian inspiration -- which is lovely.  Toronto isn't just multicultural; it's intercultural; we're all learning from each other.  Pardon me while I rant. The owner and cook works hard to cook everything fresh each day, right there behind the counter. Other nearby restaurants order in their food ready to heat-and-eat from huge monopoly distributors. We as consumers have no way of knowing which is which -- until we taste, which is too late. I told the owner that France has a law requiring restaurants to say if food is cooked on premises, or subcontracted to distribution companies. She thought that was a terrific idea. That would help small self-starter entrepreneurs like her, and clear the phonies out. It would also create jobs right here in Toronto, instead of outside the city, maybe outside the country."}
{"text":"Everything here is freshly prepared and you can definitely taste the difference. Extremely friendly service and reasonably priced.   Highly recommend the cabbage rolls and lentil soup!"}
{"text":"Tried this joint couple of times. They had good options for vegetarians. Food is very good and well balanced. For 8-9 bucks you can have sumptuous food. The lady at the counter is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Worst falafel I've had in ages. Not freshly made - came out of Tupperware. Dry, luke warm and tasteless. Vinegary hot sauce. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Pretty consistently good over the years. Good vegetarian options but my favorite is the chicken wrap. Family run business the lady who runs it is very nice and hardworking. Not much seating but it is never crowded so if you want to eat in you can. The portions are generous and we go there regularly."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma, with rice, beans, and more.  Super delicious, and portions so big that i had half at work the following day for lunch.  Great food, portions, prices, and super fast service.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Awesome shawarma. Good clean food. One of the best shawarma in the city. Their other dishes are also very good and fresh. The falafel Is also superior to any place else."}
{"text":"So the fact they're still in business is very telling.... other similar restaurants in the area have come and gone like the changing of the seasons....  If you're a fan of Lebanese/Mediterranean food you won't be disappointed with the offerings @ Delina... and we're not talking just falafel and shawarma here.. they have a wide assortment of options.  Not a lot of seats, so plan on taking your food to go....  If you do decide to stay the environment is basic, but very clean, you may end up sharing your table though....."}
{"text":"Ordered some Uber eats from this place (beef with vegetables and humus) and it was super salty and chewy and didn't taste good at all.  I was happy to not leave my house so I appreciate the deliverdness of the meal."}
{"text":"MUST TRY Chicken shawarma plate was tasty, healthy, and a great portion. Had lima beans, rice as side options.  Recommended: Samosa was solid  OK: Cabbage roll. For me, I didn't like this because it has no meat, and it was a bit too spicy  I like how Delina herself was there behind the hot table, taking orders and talking to friends.   Good budget option for the area, especially if you have a great companion with you."}
{"text":"The best falafel I've had in Toronto. It has a wonderful crusty exterior and soft inside. Nicely seasoned. The woman running the place is also incredibly friendly and hardworking. And for the price, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Ordered a ton of stuff through Just Eat! Everything was really tasty.   - falafel sandwiches - lentil rice - potatoes - tabbouleh - bean salad - lima beans - eggplant  The falafel balls were freshly made and not prefried. Super tender and fluffy on the inside and perfectly crisp on the outside. Great seasoning too. Favourful and not too salty.  They were out of a few things (okra and cauliflower) and replaced it with salad and rice. While delicious, I would have appreciated a call so I could choose my replacements. Having said that, I'll still order from them again!"}
{"text":"It's my go-to every week for delicious, healthy and fresh take-out when you're too busy to cook... Love it!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! So much great, healthy, and nutritious food for such a good price. And.... The owner always has the most pretty smile on her beautiful face. How could I not want to come here??   Plus, I can't eat gluten or dairy, and here I have lots of choices, so I can have lots of different things, rather than always having the same meal."}
