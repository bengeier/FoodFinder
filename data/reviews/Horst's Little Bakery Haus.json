{"text":"Excellent \"home cookin\". In town for volleyball tournament... Would definitely recommend, prices unbelievable. Donuts looked amazing too."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast and bakery goods. Famous for his donuts. Best spot in town for breakfast. Eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Great little place for inexpensive pastries.  If you like cuckoo clocks and nutcrackers this is the place for you! Germany decorations throughout. The staff is friendly and around noon you can get the pastries at a lower cost get one free buy one get one free. So sweet!"}
{"text":"If you are in Madison and you need breakfast/brunch, you need to immediately seek out Horst's. 

Their biscuits and gravy are my lifeblood. I devour a plateful every time I'm there. The staff is quirky and friendly, just like the decor. You can't beat the prices either! Sometimes, you have to wait for a table, which can be awkward because there simply isn't enough room inside to do so. Most times, the staff will let you wait outside and come and get you when a table is ready - keeps you out of their way :)

Also, whatever you get to eat, please get a glazed donut on the side for your table to share. This is the most important part of this review. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by this brunch place during our recent visit to Madision, In. 
I had the farmer's omelet with a side of bacon strips. The omelet was delicious! 
The highest point was their brewed coffee! I ended up having 3 cups :D
The couple who own the place were the sweetest people ever! 
They were very warm and great to chat with. 

I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best little bakery in Madison -- we're partial to the apple fritters & the caramel iced cinnamon rolls, but the chocolate chip donuts and filled long Johns shouldn't be missed either! Basically, you can't go wrong with any of them. Get there early to avoid the best donuts being sold out!"}
{"text":"On our way back home (Syracuse,IN) we stopped at Horst's Little Bakery Haus to eat breakfast. Ate here last year while visiting. Very good food, great service!! Would come here again on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Paul and I experienced an interesting breakfast here after expecting to dine at a local bistro that turned out to be closed during breakfast hours for the winter. The bakery was quite busy when we walked in, which we took as a good sign, but what we quickly realized was that the crowd  was due to slow service and kitchen issues.

Our server, a young woman, appeared to be quite depressed. Her mouth was frozen in a chronic frown and she moved at the pace of a snail. I got the impression that she was in need of a hug, but since that would have been inappropriate, I gave her lots of appreciation when she stopped by. 

We were told that the cook was out and in the hospital. Although whoever was filling in was struggling to keep pace, the food actually tasted good. We both had biscuits and gravy (the biscuit was the star) with scrambled eggs. We also got a donut to go. I went with a simple glazed one, which was very good.

But for painfully slow service, this would have been a four star review."}
{"text":"Horst's is an establishment in Madison, and donut lovers should rush to try their perfectly made dough delights! In a quaint, always decorated for the holidays location, Horst's serves up fresh donuts made in the Madison hilltop location, as well as made-to-order breakfasts. Love traditional goetta?! They have a delicious goetta platter (or you can order as a side). 

This place is quite small, which makes it so welcoming and home-y, but that means you may have to wait a minute or two for a seat, if you're eating in. 

The coffee is hot, the food is delicious, and the wait staff is sweet as can be. This used to be a no-tipping establishment (all tips went to charity and staff was paid higher than tipping restaurants) but this has recently been whited out on the menu."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison and stopped for breakfast. Highly recommend Horst House. Food was good. I had biscuits and gravy. My husband had an omelet. Service was fast and very friendly. Atmosphere is cute and quaint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"had the goetta platter. it was very good. damned good B's and G's. great breakfast spot in madison. get here early for the doughnuts. they are amazing."}
{"text":"This review is for the coffee and donuts. I feel bad with a four star rating, really because the donuts were six stars and the coffee was just a sad little cup of coffee. The had a good variety of donuts from pecan rolls to coconut creme to those cream horn things and a bunch of other stuff. I was quite surprised at the selection when I went and had a difficult time deciding. Their yeast donuts can hold their own against any other. I was intrigued by the decor with Christmas houses and coo coo clocks but I'm guessing that this goes back to the owners German heritage. I didn't really check out the menu but I'd guess they have other stuff.
Maybe just walk a few blocks down and get a better quality cup of joe."}
{"text":"I am a resident in the Madison area and have heard all kinds of good things about this bakery. For months now I have been trying to figure out when they are open since they don't seem to consistently follow the hours they have listed online. Today I finally saw that they were open! After originally stopping at three other stores for doughnuts and was unsuccessful I was excited to see this place was finally open so I could get some doughnuts to bring home to the family. Upon entering I was immediately greeted by the lady at the counter saying, \" We're out of doughnuts. But we have cookies\" .... the amount of disappointment I felt was so much so that I feared I would have caused a scene so I just turned around and left..... I think I'm done trying to be a customer at this establishment for a while."}
{"text":"After Mom's awful Harrison's breakfast, the Little Bakery Haus was pleasant.  Eggs, bacon, the usual.  I had corned beef hash, hash browns and a (requested) well done English muffin.  Three trys in they finally got well done.  Mom's bacon and eggs with hash brownes - also requested well done but not - were okay.  The staff was cheerful if a bit clueless.

The place is cute.  Really cute.  There is a village, rather a city, of small buildings from 19th century to a modern Lowe's store on shelves all over the restaurant as well as a long wall of nutcrackers.  I have a mild fear of nutcrackers but seeing them lined up by color and type makes them seem pretty silly.  Unless you are there at night.  Alone.  Naked...

ANYWAY.  The only bakery goods in evidence are the donuts not made on site.  Coffee was decent and if you are not picky about getting food the way you request for $13, Horst's is okay."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy here are amazing!  The staff is super friendly and this is definitely a local favorite.  Most of the customers are known by their first names and everyone greets everyone.

The yeast doughnuts are good, but their specialty baked goods are even better.  My personal favorite is the apple fritter.

Make sure to bring additional cash if you are paying with a card, or you will not be able to tip the server."}
{"text":"This place is the tops.  I went here twice on my recent trip to Madison, IN.  The owner and his staff were super friendly and helpful, and on my second visit everyone remembered me and treated me like an old-timer.  It was great!  I got to talking with the owner, who does all the donut-making himself by hand.  He was super nice and I'm glad Madison has him to call their own.  He has a great story and is an asset to the community!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place where it seemed all the locals go.  It's decorated with tons of lit up Christmas houses and coo coo clocks.  Different but I like different.
Horst, don't know his first name, but he gets up every morning and starts making doughnuts by 4am.  This place is opened only until noon.  So get there early, especially on the weekends because I imagine it fills up.
Breakfast was simple, bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast.  It was good but nothing I would go ra ra ra about.  I did have to get a doughnut because that's what they're really known for.  I got a round cake doughnut that had chocolate on top.  It was good, moist, and hit my doughnut craving.  I would go here next time just for a doughnut and a cup of coffee.
If you are ever in Madison hit this place up.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.

The End."}
{"text":"Decided to drive out to Madison for breakfast while we were staying at General Butler State Park. After reading about their biscuits and gravy, I wanted to try it. This place is quite small and is filled with interesting and quirky decor. The bf had the smoked sausage special with a coffee and I had the half order of biscuits and gravy with sunny side eggs and country ham. The bf didn't like the coffee, he ended up not drinking it. He had no complaints about his food. Even though I didn't think the biscuit and gravy was that amazing, it was still decent and the biscuit was pretty damn good. I liked the salty country ham, but my eggs were a bit too undercooked for me. Lol, see for yourself. Fyi, the half order of biscuits and gravy is more than enough for one person. We picked up an old fashion glazed cake doughnut on the way out and it was quite good, too. Service was friendly. We will keep this place in mind when we are in town again next year."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here on a Saturday and were pleasantly surprised by this little cafe. I had the biscuits and gravy topped with two eggs and they were perfect. The waitress couldn't have been better and even gave our three old son a couple of cream filled doughnut holes. This is the perfect place to stop by and have a nice quiet breakfast."}
