{"text":"I had been driving past this place for months on my way to and fro the off Leash. Something about dead cooked animals hanging upside down always draws a carnivores attention. On this particular day severe winds and rains put my ribeyes ready for the BBQ to the back-burner and I succumbed to my canal urge. My experience was odd...but delicious and well worth grilling another day. The interior had a butcher shop shop feel. Sterile white and stainless with the aforementioned meat dangling under heat lamps. An old lady of oriental decent behind the counter immediately begins my order....without me or her saying a word. She's dressed elegantly but covered in meat splatter and clearly speaks limited English. Somehow, we come to the understanding that I will have BBQ duck and pork accompanied by rice. She piles the rice out of a steamer high into a take out container and get to work on the duck. Using the largest knife I've ever seen a human wield outside of game of thrones she chops with fury. The duck will have bones included, a point to keep in mind. Than she chopped up the pork. All done with surgical precision without the loss of any digits. The meat is piled high on its bed of rice, the portions are amiable. She asks me (i think she did at least) while holding a spoon full of something. Out of confusion and fear of not wanting to offend I accept said spoon full, which is then deposited on some of the pork. With my order complete I make out the word pop as she addresses me and points to a fridge. I declined. At this point I'm not informed as to the cost of my order so hand her a $20. A $10 is returned without a word. I thanked her and returned home to eat my styrofoam encased meal.  The food was fantastic. Both pork and duck were well cooked and seasoned. The mystery spoonful turned out to be some kind of ginger pur√©e. It worked well with the other flavours. All in all I'll head back. Great little gem in forest lawn. Cheers."}
{"text":"Asian BBQ ..... If you haven't been you can't miss the hang meet. Typically there's whole BBQ pork with crispy skin, sweet BBQ pork, pork sausage, roast duck and soya sauce chicken. My favourite is all over them!!!!   They sell them by the pound but you can get a meal for 1 with rice and two types of BBQ for $10 plus a can of pop. They also sell Vietnamese subs for $6.  The owner doesn't speak English good but fluent in Chinese and Vietnamese. Service is okay taking in mind the language barrier. There's a small table with two chair if you want to dine there. But the shop looks a bit run down.   Overall good price and excellent BBQ."}
