{"text":"A very friendly neighborhood place filled with a good mix of locals.  Food is solid, but what really prompted me to do this review is the level of service I have consistently received.  I've eaten here about 5 times and done pick up twice.  All 5 times I was with my wife and our toddler daughter. Every single time the friendliness of the waiters, waitresses, greeters, bartenders, etc...was excellent. Super friendly, genuine, and thankful. Very happy that you chose to dine at 3 Spot. Most restaurants, especially sports bar type places, that is extremely rare.  I like to support local businesses so I will continue come here and will bring my out-of-town visitors here as well. Whoever is running the place kudos to you!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good and the prices are reasonable. It gets crowded but they know what they are doing and we don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings around!  Excellent selection of beers on tap.  They bring in new beers often so there's always something different to try.  Philly cheese steak is delicious and the pizza is very good.  Nice to see the owners around and interacting with their guests.   Don't see that too often!  Definitely the best sports bar and bar food in the southwest suburbs!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to the 3 Spot it is packed (in a good way)! This is the place to go for some delicious wings or to watch a big game! I really enjoy coming here and would recommend it for its service and food!"}
{"text":"We are from out of state and decided to see what local restaurants were nearby and saw the high reviews..let me tell you they deserve each and every star! 

The food is outstanding! I had the chicken kabobs and it was so juicy and flavorful! We also had a Philly cheesesteak which was easily the best one I ever had! And to top it all off..the service was outstanding..nothing you would expect from a sports bar. 

Will definitely come out of my way next time I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"This place delivers on value. The food is good and the prices are excellent for your typical bar menu.  The menu is a bit crowded at first glance with everything from waffles to wings to burgers but stick with the standard bar food and it will not disappoint.  The wings with Route 3 ranch sauce are delicious. The pizza is also very good. To top it all off, the beer selection is one of the best in the area. 

The service was a bit disappointing but forgivable for how busy they were. They were apologetic and friendly despite look overwhelmed.  On previous visits the owner actually stopped at the table to chat and it really shows how invested in the business they are. 

The patio is a bit disappointing but being landlocked and stretched for parking as it is, it is understandable.  Overall this is a great place and an overall great value."}
{"text":"1 word--Kabobs!!  Healthy food and a beer when you're feelin it!"}
{"text":"just curiosity but how they can handle those many draft beers? looks like more than 20 tabs I mean it's North Royalton! Btw, beer selection can be better!

omg wings price are in somewhere 1990 era and compare to that price it's acceptable 

if you order a lot then 50 cents per wings you can't beat that 

lots of TV around so watch baseball football with wings and pizza makes me happy 

btw bama over osu decision was bad"}
{"text":"The 3Spot has become a favorite for my wife and me. Excellent food, great beer selection and attentive staff. We have been there with all types of crowds and service always tends to be the same: fast and accurate. 

One of the things we really like is that their owners actually understand it takes more than 1 bartender behind the bar on certain shifts--they staff accordingly.

It is near North Royalton High School and the 3Spot seems to host events and such associated with the school, which is really great. We don't have kids attending NRHS, so this observation is not influenced by any personal affinity other than recognizing that they seem to \"support\" the local HS and kids.

Pricing is very reasonable. 

They have Keno and plenty of TVs.

Last thing: we frequently order take-out food from here as well--it is always ready promptly and the bartender or waitress that checks your order out always double-checks to make sure that your order is in fact what is in the bag. It's nice to see they care. This seems to be a focus of the training, I suppose, because it has happened with 3 different people."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is always top notch. Lauren and Haley might be the best bartenders I have ever experienced. Food great, awesome venue to watch any sporting event. Come out and have good time."}
{"text":"Visited April 17, 2014.  Awful service.  Unless you enjoy paying $7 for a 16 oz. beer, be sure to ask about the price!  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best wings anywhere and good size! I had the Philly cheese steak, delicious. Hubby had the Gyro, huge and also delicious. He couldn't even finish the whole thing it was sooo big! I Like the service there too, everyone is so friendly and efficient. Try it, I think you'll really enjoy the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wings are excellent. We get the hot and the buffalo ranch. Another favorite is the fried green beans. The accompanying sauce is great."}
{"text":"There just isn't any explanation why the cook/chef at this place doesn't follow directions. I specifically requested my \"to go\" wings extra, extra crispy (yes I say it twice) and extra \"sloppy\" (with extra sauce).  Not only were they pink in the middle, but the absolute minimal amount of sauce you can put on a wing to change the taste was applied.  And this is not the first time. More like the fifth.  How many times does a person have to call and complain? Our society is no longer customer-oriented...almost as if to say \"I will make your order the way I want to whether you like it or not.\" How hard is it to leave the stupid things in the fryer longer and to slap more sauce on them?  And, of course, did not notice all of this until back home when I'm ready to eat my food that I have been looking forward to devouring.  I really dislike leaving bad reviews, but when it comes to my hard-earned money and eating something that is ordinarily delicious, have to speak up and let others know.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday at 5:30.  Sat right down at the bar, although tables were open.  Service was splendid...had 3 people asking us if they could get anything.  

Read the reviews here and wasn't interested in wings (had them for lunch), so I went with what looked like it was well rated:  Philly Cheesestake.  OUTSTANDING.  Hot as blazes (not sure how they did that), but it was delicious.  Juicy, tasty, great roll (melted through the bottom by the time I got done with the sandwich).  Had to use a fork to finish.

Came with fresh cut fries...the only thing holding this 4 star review back from a 5.  They were not crisp.  If I wanted mashed potatoes, I would have ordered mashed potatoes.   Bartender asked what I thought, told her my disappointment with the fries, she recommended next time we order the tots or the waffle fries, as they are crisp.  Would have been appropriate for her to offer those to us now.

Beer selection is crazy good, 38 beers on tap.  Met the owner, Diane.  Very nice. Amanda was our main bartender..she is very good at what she does...and personable to boot!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went out on a day date, the bar tender Karen made us the best bloody Mary's and the wings were awesome! The owner walked around talking to patrons and was very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Large, brightly lit sports bars aren't usually my thing.  The two reasons I like to come here is the extensive beer list and GREAT food!    Especially their wings.  I love how you can order a half dozen wings instead of a whole dozen.  The only thing that irks me about this place is that it is ALWAYS crowded on weekends.  And there isn't much parking.  It also seems like every single weekend some charity group is having some kind of fundraising benefit there.  So, on the rare occasion you can manage to find parking and actually get inside the door- order some wings.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to have a late nite bite. We were on our way back from Southpark. Found this place on Yelp and it had some good reviews thought I would try. Menu looked cheap too. Always a plus. 

Place was slammed on a Saturday nite around 9p. I think there were some parties there. I saw gift baskets and name tags... but because of the draft list (tons of choices) good list! From the crowd it looks like it is a popular spot. 

Anyway. Big menu with lots of choices. A bit overwhelming to choose. Server was nice. She recommended the Travelers Christmas Ale. Got a cinnamon sugar rim and it was delish! 

To eat I got a side salad and 6 wings. Side salad was big. Only downside was no cheese. Otherwise it was big portion and not bad. Also got the 6 wings of sweet and spicy. They were good! Crispy! Just not that spicy I thought. My companions got 12 wings mild, and Greek salad. Portions big. They both enjoyed their diners. Cost is cheap. Overall thought the food was good for the price. With drinks and dinner it was $35. Not bad! 

I left full and discovered a new spot if I am in the area again. Cheap good eats. Crowded but service is good and friendly. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Try the Ranch 3 Wings - best wings around.  Love this place. Service is friendly. The owner is always walking around saying hello and seeing if you're okay. Really cares about the business."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, service and prices. Tons of beer on tap as well as bottled. Great wine selection as well as lunch and dinner specials. Worth your time to come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Mexican pizza was amazing. A bit of heat to the pizza but loved it. Wings are amazing. Service is exceptional. Beer selection was great"}
{"text":"Fantastic wings, fantastic service. Great drink selection. If you're looking to drink and watch sports, this place is one of the best around. Get the loaded french fries with ranch dipping sauce. One thing I can't go without is their ranch dipping sauce. I don't know if they make it in house or what but it's the best I have ever had. Other than the wings,  I've had a burger and a grilled chicken dish and these dishes weren't spectacular(hence the 4 stars). Get the wings if you want great food. This is my go to place to watch sports, it should be yours too."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet friends for reasonably priced drinks and food. One of the main reasons I like this place is the large draft beer selection. A friend of mine got a margarita and stated that she would never make that mistake again because it was poorly made. When it comes to the food I've had the dry-rub Cajun wings and friend pickles; the Cajun wings are the best around."}
{"text":"Visited on a busy Friday night. 

Unfortunately, we were sat less than two feet from the main server station. I'm not sure why they have a table that close. We sat on the opposite side of the table--this is the only option if you don't want to get in their way. So, for the entire meal, you're up close and personal with the entire wait staff (and, honestly, in their way). 

The oddest moment happened with, I would guess, is the manager or owner. He sweats, a lot, and is constantly wiping his face with towels/napkins, etc. Which is fine, he's working hard running the place, I get it, make that money, I'm sure he's a good boss. This would be fine except we're only a foot or two away at all times during our meal. At one point, he's standing by our table, REACHES OVER OUR TABLE WHILE WE'RE EATING, GRABS ONE OF THE NAPKINS FROM THE DISPENSER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE, AND WIPES HIS FACE ... WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO US (even after standing next to us for another minute or two).  

Super. Awkward. 

Service was attentive (which, it should have been, considering we were within two feet of a server the entire meal), and our server was nice. 

The food was bland. 'Jumbo' wings weren't 'jumbo' and the Chipotle BBQ sauce didn't have much taste. I also had the Route 3 Crunchy Dog--it, literally, was a boiled, grocery store item, with a thin later of batter (I didn't hold this against them, but they completely misuse the word 'tempura' in the description). It was about average for bar food, but, there are two bars a few miles north on the same road that have much, much better food. 

In terms of ambiance, food, and overall staff interaction, there's a few better places a few miles away."}
{"text":"Every time I have been in this establishment the service is less than mediocre. Given them at least 5 different visits since they are local. You can sit at the bar in front of a bartender for 15 minutes before before they even say hello. Don't expect them to check back with you once you get your original order. Bartenders are too busy talking amongst themselves or flirting with specific individuals at the bar to notice you are clearly and obnoxiously trying to wave them down. 

The food is pretty good though, I'll give them that. Not bad. But if you get frustrated easily with poor service, this is not a place to go."}
{"text":"I was surprised on how many wing sauce flavors they have here. Food was not bad and priced well...I will return"}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed a healthy lunch. Instead of hitting up a drive thru I hopped on Yelp to try to find a local place to grab take out! I was almost scared off by the fact that it's a bar type but when I saw the berry chicken salad on the menu I was surprised! Plus the positive ratings from fans helped. I'm glad I called them! 

Place: Remember I just stopped in to pick up so I'll have to come back to sit in. It felt like a local/regulars place so I was unsure if I would feel super welcome at first but all the ladies that greeted me and served me were super friendly! Saw what looked like 65,393 beers on tap and a little dance floor: I need that in my life so I'm definitely going to come back and sit on the patio and enjoy myself sometime.

Food: I always forget how local, quality places that care about their people have way better food than fancy trying too hard to be cool new joints. My salad was heaven. Don't let the bar look fool you, this was fresh stuff. I loved the pineapple chunks, feta, and the balsamic dressing was delicious too! I'll be back to try more food, but glad a good salad is in the area for me to grab on the regular! Did I mention it was ready in no time? Like 10 min? 

I'll update as I come back and try other items-see you again soon 3 Spot!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar, plenty of TV's and great food! Local North Royalton hangout for college kids coming back for the summer or holidays to see if there friends are successful, hilarious."}
{"text":"An excellent place to hang out for food and beer. My friends and I agree that their wings are the best around for the price. And their wings are 35 cents on Tues and Wed. Service has always been fantastic, never had to ask for a refill. 3 Spot has the honor of being my first yelp review!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. They really made sure you didnt go thirsty. The food was fantastic. And the food was all good portions and they even made me a special drink, it was SO good! We will definantly be back,  best place I have personally ever been to for service."}
{"text":"Slower service, but good food."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Cheers...Great people and food!
When Owners Diane & Bill, are there they are always going from table to table making sure your Happy! 
The Bar Maids are are fast and friendly and not bad to look at! Kids are welcome!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game with a huge beer selection and fantastic food and service!  They will put your game of choice on one of the dozens of TV's, an have plenty of space...packed, but found room at the bar and tables. Food is exceptional for the price. Loved the clam chowder, sweet potato fries and buffalo dip. Boyfriend loved the rueben.  Fresh cut fries were wonderful too!"}
{"text":"Food, Staff, Drinks, everything is good. Have my favorites, as do many of my friends. It is a Bar, but a family bar, good place to meet with friends, family reunions, and Birthday parties. It is a noisy FUN place, so if you are looking for a dark, quiet, romantic place, keep looking and don't come here and complain. It's the \"Cheers\" of North Royalton."}
{"text":"Great beer specials and wings! Quality staff and service as well. They also have dartboards and Keno to keep you occupied in between sports games."}
{"text":"My friends and I meet here monthly. It's a great place to get wings and beers. Prices are cheap. The route 3 ranch wings are incredible. I highly recommend 3spot."}
{"text":"wow, what a gem. you can miss it driving by, but this place is cool. Great service and tasty wings. Very budget friendly and laid back. Wings, Stella, and side salad for $10. They have all packages for all games."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I had a buffalo chicken wrap and a beer. Everything was above the quality you would find at a \"chain\" sports bar. There was some charity event going on while we were there and we did feel like we might have been getting pushed out a little because I wasn't asked if I wanted another beer. However, I wouldn't let that keep me from returning I doubt anything was meant by it. This is an excellent place to go watch an important sporting event."}
{"text":"Beer, good, cold and great specials.
The food....gross. 
Everything is frozen. Just sent second batch of wings back. The food is unedible. 
Manager and staff were nice, but maybe try non frozen everything. Try some fresh stuff and see what happens. 3rd time I've tried it, last time."}
{"text":"This place is really not all that great as far as food goes, only good if you want to go for drinks and to watch a game. The only food I liked was the gyro and fries. Clam chowder is ok but nothing to write home about. Pizza was terrible and tasted like cardboard. The service is a hit or miss, we've had good service and very poor, slow service."}
{"text":"This place is great to watch a game, have a casual date night, and is kid friendly too for an affordable family dinner out.. The drinks are very affordable, the food is very good and the menu is big. Their wings are some of the best I've ever had, my kids love the crunchy dog, and the pizza and salads are fantastic. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is very friendly. The owner is often there to talk with customers. We go up there often and always enjoy seeing Karen, a very friendly bartender there who knows how to pour them! The atmosphere is low lit, cozy, and clean. It's a perfect spot in North Royalton to enjoy great food and drink for a great price."}
{"text":"My buddy saw The 3 Spot had a food challenge for $15 and if you are it all you earned yourself a free T-shirt.  So he obviously called me. 

The challenge was this: You choose a burger, and a sub, and a fried appetizer then they basically stack the three on top of eachother and call it The 3 Spot Challenge.  Oh, and there's also a pile of fries, some coleslaw, and a pickle.  Finish it all and you walk away with a free shirt.  Difficulty: 2 (of 5) 

After eating it all I celebrated with a few draft beers. They have an impressive 30 different beers on tap. 

The food, beer, crowd, and atmosphere were all great.  Unfortunately they didn't have any food challenge T Shirts yet (they just recently opened and maybe thought nobody would finish the challenge?) but did take my information to get one to me asap. 

Get there for your shirt before they raise the price or take it off the menu.  Run, don't walk."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. the wings were very good and the fried mushrooms too. Lots of tvs to watch the game. I would come back. Their clam chowder is the best I've ever had hearty and not too salty!!! Yummy!!! With oyster crackers!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to watch a game or just hang out.

There are lots of tvs for the sports fans and TONS of draft beer!

Not only is the atmosphere great, but the wait staff is super friendly and helpful

The owner, Diane, is very nice too.

Just when you think it couldn't get any better - the food is above the normal \"bar\" food. We have been coming here for a couple years now and we have tried many of the things on the menu - its ALL good!

There is a different food special each day - Tues and Wed are wing night and WOW are the wings good!

As you can tell, I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Not sure what it is, but when I come here I get the worst service. I would understand if it was busy but it never is at the times i come. It's unfortunate because it's less than 2 minutes from my house. Only gave 2 stars because the food is decent at best. I only go here if I don't feel like actually driving to a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I visit 3 Spot with family and friends once every few months. Great atmosphere with a full bar and plenty of seating. I recommend going here for happy hour or to watch a sporting event. The food is tasty and very cheap. Lastly, the servers are always friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Karen makes the best Bloody Mary I have ever had!! Plus she is friendly, super sweet and knows her stuff! The owner introduced herself, she was friendly and fun! She even walked around to talk to patrons. The wings were very very good! I don't have one complaint about this place!"}
{"text":"I decided to meet up with a couple friends to watch the Indians play the Cubs in the World Series game three.  It was extremely packed.  Diana the owner greeted me and asked how I was doing.   Even though she was extremely busy, she took time to greet me. I said great but I wasn't sure I was staying.  No seats.  So she said if I find you a seat will you stay.  So after a few minutes she got us a table and it was amazing.  Great view of the tvs and not smothered by the rest of the crowd.  I love her thoughtfulness.  
The food was just as amazing.  I ordered the Spinach and artichoke dip and a burger with fries.  The dip was really creamy.  It was delicious.  The burger was cooked to order.  And came out as I ordered it.  
I highly recommend this place.  A great place to eat and watch a sporting event.  You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best spots in Royalton to go to! If you're into high school football, the 3 Spot is the place to go after each game. The atmosphere is amazing and most of the servers are some of the most genuine people you'll ever meet. Also during playoff season, watching the Cavs games here a lot of fun. Best thing on the menu has to be the options of wings, and the only thing that I really didn't like was the kebob. Overall, definitely one of my favorite places to visit. Friendly family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place!  Food was good, excellent service, and the owner even came out and talked to us.  We live so close but have only gotten takeout.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and wanted to check out a new place and needed a salad. I was not a \"regular,\" though it seems like a place where many people are. Nevertheless I was served like I was a VIP. My order was taken by the owner/manager within a minute or two and the salad arrived in less than five minutes. The Greek Salmon salad was appropriate to the sports bar price point, not gourmet but acceptable. I was a one top, low ticket table but I received excellent service. The pizzas and other items I saw rolling out of the kitchen looked great and I wished I could have enjoyed them. The wings looked big and meaty. There is a huge selection of beers.  A very nice neighborhood bar and grill where families would be comfortable and where there are healthy items available.  Very nice place and a great, friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"So I use to like this place but recently visited and was told by the female manager that to-go orders for wings had increased because she could no longer sale them for the low price we have become accustomed to. The prices she quoted me were more than $3 more per order than the eat in price. She stated that if people eat in, she will at least make money off of them buying drinks. 

One, the prices were not adjusted on the menu. Two, the price of to-go orders should not be higher because it costs you more to buy wings now even if you are \"still the cheapest place in town\" like she said. Three, if you can't afford to be open and run a business with customer experience in mind, then close. 

Terrible experience. I did not order that night and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Kids running around.  Often fund raiser on Saturdays with no seating left for other guest."}
{"text":"The place is starting to slip. Not enough sauce on the wings or pizza. Still has many beers on tap, but the favorites are going away. Pick it up 3 spot or you will lose customers."}
{"text":"Food is great and priced reasonable.  Service is always good and the owner is super nice.  Love supporting this place."}
{"text":"Truly one of the better sports bars around. TVs everywhere, great menu and drink selections with plenty of room. We have our fantasy football draft every year and it's a great spot to watch a game."}
{"text":"I like hanging out here. It's a great place to have a beer, get some grub, and watch sports if that's your thing. The menu is huge - they have everything from wings and bar fare to healthier sandwiches and salads. 

The service during our visit was pretty quick and on point. Drinks were refilled and I didn't have to accost anyone for a refill on my water. They have awesome wings and wing prices. Their food is great - my husband didn't have too many great things to say about the boneless wings... but I wouldn't ever order those anyways. Stick with a regular wing and dry rub!"}
{"text":"My only gripe is I wish it was closer to my home. I seriously doubt you can get better bar food at what they charge anywhere else in Cleveland. The fried mushrooms...they're not portabellos but they are the biggest mushrooms I have seen anywhere in town. Served piping hot I sprinkle on a little parmesan cheese. They have a great\"earthy\" flavor and not only are they big the full order portion is huge. Ditto for the onion rings. The bartenders are great too.

Update:
Mushrooms went a bit downhill (nowhere near as big) since I wrote the original review. Still good though."}
{"text":"I always come here with my family and friends. The staff is always friendly, although sometimes, but not always, the service is slow. Usually I order a chicken quesadilla which is always good. It's really a fun place to be on the weekend with all the different people coming in and out. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"1st time visit was on a Browns Sunday afternoon. It's a big place so you don't have to feel like a Local to drink or eat there. We arrived at the perfect time and had a small bar table for me and my wife. 

Beers were dirt cheap. I wasn't in a drinking mood yet but could not pass up $2.00 20oz. of light beers.
 
Food was good. The full sized menu looked good to me. It's mostly bar food but in many different way. The fries were just the way I like them too. Skin on and a good fry oil. Not greasy!

Met the owner. She was very polite and welcomed us and asked how our meal was. Told her it was great and we'll be back. She asked what brought us in that day and I told her found the place on Yelp! She looked at me like she had no clue what Yelp even was!! Haha. We'll be back for sure!"}
