{"text":"Ordered their ramen. Probably the worst ramen I ever had. Even the cheapest instant ramen would taste better than this. Broth was watery. There was no flavour. Meat was too salty. Noodle was lukewarm. $12.99+tax for this? Daylight robbery."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sushi-Q in Urban Eatery inside Eaton Center. I bought several items just before closing time but the cashier forgot to give me one of the items. By the time I realized, they were already closed. I returned to the store when they were open to ask for a replacement as well as a small complimentary item to compensate for the fact that I had to come all the way back to the store. They didn't believe me and had to call the cashier who worked the previous shift to verify. I asked to speak with the manager, but he was a coward and would only speak through the cashier. After a lot of back-and-forth in what sounded like Korean, they agreed to give me my original (forgotten) meal but nothing else in compensation. The manager walked past me and didn't utter a word. He did, though, give me an evil stare like he was going to kill me with a chef knife.

Obviously, this is a place that doesn't understand customer service and how to operate in Canadian culture. I'm surprised since they are in a high profile location like Eaton Center."}
{"text":"Okay I realize food courts aren't exactly the best places for good Japanese, but I'll give them props for trying to serve ramen and udon out of the tiny joint (they dont even have a kitchen!) I ordered a miso ramen today and mum got a seafood udon. As I waited, I noticed them making my broth out of a packet! Like instant noodle seasoning packet! So my expectations were pretty low as I carried the tray to the table. (Pricey place for food court, 10.50 inclding tax for my bowl). Anyways, it was pretty hot so I dug in. The broth was actually not bad, it tasted better than regular instant noodle soup, but still lacked a real richness or meatiness. The half egg that was runny and delicious in the photo turned out hard boiled (they have all the ingredients other than veggies in some tupperware boxes on the counter. The egg halves as well as seaweed, bamboo, etc were all premade ready) The chasu was pretty good; tender and fatty but again lacking real flavor. It was okay overall but not something I'd go out my way for."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting good quality sushi because it's food court but the fact that the salmon was so fishy and that it gave me a stomach ache and listen, ok? 

Everyone who has had their fair share of sushi has had bad sushi and it has two endings; they both lead to the bathroom and theyre not good endings either. The salmon was so disgusting to eat because not only was it fishy, it had bones in it.

Alright. This is a joke for food court food. I honestly feel offended for Markville's food court that such a beautiful and nice mall has landed with a crappy sushi joint. Why not Mac sushi guys??? At least they know how to handle seafood 10x better than SQ and theyre also a food court sushi business."}
{"text":"I was in markville today and decided to try sushi q. I guess my standards for sushi are a bit high because this was total garbage. I got a multi pack with miso soup and it came up to just under $12. The rolls were cold and tasteless. I didn't even finish it. I ended up getting a combo from taco bell that was more satisfying and tasteful compared to what I got at sushi q."}
{"text":"We came here 10 minutes before the mall closed, hoping to get a good deal on sushi! They had a sign saying 30% off, but when we got closer, the lady told us buy one get one free, so 50% off.  We picked two different trays, but both around $12.5 each. At the register, we asked her for a miso soup, and she was glad to give us a bowl.

End of the day specials are the norm/standard for these sushi stores, so this deal wasn't a surprise, but the \"service\" really stood out - she was really helpful and friendly, much more than your average place.

Sushi itself was standard, food-court quality, not too great, but satisfied decently.  Ingredients seemed fresh, and the quality was definitely below what you would expect at a sushi restaurant.

It was an okay deal for 50% off, but otherwise, I wouldn't buy this sushi during peak store hours."}
{"text":"One of the healthier food options at the mall I suppose. I usually get the vegetarian roll which includes 6 pieces for $4.99. Their selection is pretty good, and they serve ramen and udon as well. Not the cheapest around and their sushi is just okay, the rice is kinda hard and tasteless sometimes. However, I would not recommend buying anything with salmon in it as it did not taste fresh at all. The staff are always friendly so that's a plus."}
{"text":"The sushi is good here. However! the owners have lots of unwritten rules. For example I had a $2 off coupon for the entire food court and they told me it can't be used for end of day sale prices unless it's above $12.... I've also bought a sushi box that was end of day sale for $6. When I noticed I didn't get miso soup and I asked about it. The cashier said its only free for items above $7... Man these people are weird. Like the soup prob cost them nothing. I would suggest they have these policies written clearly somewhere. But I swear they make them up as they go."}
{"text":"A pretty large selection, and my order came with a complimentary miso soup which was cool. Wasn't cheap or anything, but decently-priced, like what you'd expect. I liked how they had one tray of sushi made with brown rice instead of white rice, but wish there was more also made of brown rice. Will come again next time if I am in the mall looking for sushi."}
{"text":"Really didn't expect much going in and got about what I expected.  If you're in the mall and get a craving for rolls it's an ok option but no reason to go out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Ordered salmon sashimi.  Within 30 minutes of eating had the worst stomach pain.  Avoid this place!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing Sushi!! Ordered an avocado, crab, brown rice sushi roll for lunch. Got 12 pieces for about $10 and the rice in the roll tasted stale. I'm not sure if it was left over from the previous days but the meal tasted off. I assumed it would be fresh tasting since they may be making it all day with the high traffic going through Eaton Centre. That however was not the case. Totally not worth the $10 that I paid!"}
{"text":"Always fixes my sushi craving. Been a regular for 4 years and still at it. The establishment itself is pretty average for mall foodcourt sushi. Price range is mid-high - comparable to the price you may pay for large and more filling combos at other restaurants. But if you're looking for a cleaner alternative to fried food but not in the mood for salad, this ones for you.

Their end of the day sale is -30% but just be cautious of browning avocado when selecting sushi near closing.

Recently they removed complimentary miso soup with sushi from their menu. It is now 0.99. On a day I was sick I opted to buy a miso soup as I remembered it was quite good. Unfortunately they must have changed it up, it tastes disgusting now.

Not in love with Sushi Q but I will come back, especially when other food lines are too long for my liking!"}
{"text":"I was really hungry and it was getting late at night so I stopped by here because I was craving sushi. They were having an end-of-the-day sale (30% off) and I got the sushi combo 3 which came to being about $11. I found it still pricey with the discount but at that time I was really hungry. The sushi itself was okay, I ate it for the sake of eating but I would not buy this at the regular price."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Ordered Tonkotsu ramen and vegetables U-don.  Disappointed with the boiled egg.  Their sushi is fresh."}
{"text":"I'm sad that the current rating is 2.5 stars! I personally am a fan of Sushi-Q. I used to come here more often when I worked in the mall. I loved it then and I still love it now.

I'm not a fan of sashimi so I usually grab the trays with maki rolls that don't contain sashimi or contain very little (so I can't comment on the freshness of that).

The sushi has always been DELICIOUS. I don't even need to use the soy sauce + wasabi because the sushi itself is already so flavourful and I don't want to drown it in other flavours. I've even left it in the fridge overnight and had it for dinner the following day. Normally when I do this, the sushi rice turns hard, but it doesn't happen with their sushi.

I also come here to buy several small trays to assemble my own party tray for gatherings - the sushi is always a hit (but pricing-wise, it comes up to about the same as ordering a party tray from your average sushi restaurant).

They are always friendly and polite. I've seen the End of the Day Sales vary from 30% off to BOGO and even Buy 1, Get 2 Free (they don't advertise it, but will inform you if they see you're interested)."}
