{"text":"Wins for most Instagram-worthy hummus, four colors/flavours and edible flowers on top. The types are: chickpea, beet, edamame, and eggplant. 
The freshly baked piping hot sesame bread is to die for, we couldn't get enough. 
It was very busy on a Sunday afternoon, yet the service was prompt and courteous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time at this establishment, recommendation from a friend.

Walked in through the Turkish style doors, and the place was really inviting, high ceilings, and greeted at door with a friendly smile.

We ordered the cold mezzaine platter with a. It of everything and wow...really really good.  Fresh style naans out of the oven, hot and piping.

The food, all sorts was fresh, clean and very tasty.  The portions were really good for one and maybe a 1/2 more.  The fries were fresh style cut. The rice was not your normal style white rice, pine nuts and very good flavour.  All food comes with a pickled salad that offers a good contrast to your food.

All said, I would highly recommend this restaurant for middle eastern style food with a twist.

One small issue, the food was not very hot, luke warm...which gives it a four out of five, but will come back anyways."}
{"text":"A WoW experience that is unique in every falvour. A Mediterranean base with a twist makes this cousin unique although familiar. The place was crowded but we were well received and catered for till seated. Full house made the service a bit slow but forgiven with the first sight of the Dip Platter consisting of 4 colorful, flower topped deliciouses - flowers edible, too. 
3 main dishes were lovely. Even the Shawarma, a very common dish, was one of a kind. 
Service friendly in spite of the crowd. 
Highly recommended 10 /10"}
{"text":"Once you enter you're greeted by friendly staff and the ambience is what makes this place different. The singer added to the middle eastern atmosphere but the volume was loud to the point that we had to literally talk into each other's ears. 

The food did not live up to the hype. We had ordered their signature chicken shawarma, Iraqi kabab and hummus with lamb. The Iraqi kabab was on point but the other two dishes were a disappointment. Hummus with lamb had too little hummus and the whole thing was drowning in olive oil. The pine nuts added a nice roasted flavour. Most disappointing was the chicken shawarma. I was curious about this dish from pictures I had seen of the unique presentation. I must say, its not practical at all. The meat got cold way too quickly since its hanging in mid air. It was also a mission to pull the meat off the rod. To top it all off the meat wasn't fully cooked. 

Bread is complimentary but make sure you ask the waiter to bring you warm ones as the baker bakes them and places them on the counter which is close to the entrance and the bread tends to cool down quickly from the draft of cold air when someone opens the door. 

Overall- great atmosphere, friendly staff, food is a hit and miss."}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern cuisine. They serve the best Hummus Fatteh at all times... believe me it's the real stuff, they got it :) 
We've ordered multiple dishes and all were supper delicious, fresh & yummy. The interior is nicely designed and very clean, atmosphere is cheerful and cozy. On top of all, service was very good. I am in love with this place...It's gonna be my new favourite restaurant"}
{"text":"It's one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in town, I went few times and they have a very special Iraqi cousins mainly the Iraqi kabab, very delicious. Amazing services, stuff are very friendly and management are always their to make sure customers are getting served well. 

I like the atmosphere as it takes u back to the old traditional quit days."}
{"text":"The interieur is beautiful, the hummus dips are good. Bread that came with the dip is not freshly made but came from a bag, not fresh at all. We had to wait a long time for our food. There was mold on one of the pittas. Staff was friendly but there was a mix-up with the orders. We will not be going back, food is not great and it's over priced as well."}
{"text":"I'll echo other's opinions on here, this place is the best Arabic resto in 'Sauga.

Before I even get to the food, the decor is amazing. Love the old timey movie posters on the wall, the blue door, everything is beautiful. You can tell a lot of love went into this place, and that the owners wanted to share with everyone the things they love about Iraq and the food. Very well done.

Came at 11am on a Sat, website when it talked about breakfast had a link to a menu and it was their everyday lunch/dinner menu which I liked -  didn't have time to go later in the day but wasn't in the mood for breakfast fare. When I got there, I learned there was an issue with the website (mobile version at least) and that their was a breakfast menu that was seperate from lunch/dinner. To my delight though, everything I wanted to try was on the breakfast menu (btw this place is super vegetarian friendly). My co-diner got an egg/sasuage/fruit platter breakfast, and we also got falafel - hummus-spinach manakeesh -  grilled halloumi cheese - roasted eggplant dip, and lots of fresh bread.

The food was absolutely AMAZING!!!!!! So damn good. For me, the best items were the hummus and grilled halloumi cheese, but everything was great. My co-diner really loved their sausage. After we were done got some candy they sell by the pound and tea. The server was wonderful, she was super attentive -  knowledgeable -  and came by all the time to make sure we were ok and had enough water.

I absolutely love this place, just a great addition the the 'Sauga food scene."}
{"text":"Try the Iraqi kabab and some of their delicious appetizers. Shawarma plate is ok, great presentation, however, taste is nothing special. Live music on the weekends and great service! Also make sure you try their ginger, lemon grass tea, it's out of this world!"}
{"text":"When I heard and saw this new place, I was excited to try it, despite the mixed reviews. We came here last night with a group of 13 for a birthday dinner (yes I'm aware larger groups are always harder to accommodate). First off, it took the server way too long to check in on our table, bring utensils and water. It was after we all placed our orders, that things went downhill. It took close to 45 min for any of the dishes to be brought out. First came the 4 fatoush salads, and then nothing else came out for another 25 minutes. So here we are, with 4 people not touching their half meals (because everyone ordered a skewer of chicken with it which didn't come out with it) while the rest of the table hasn't received anything yet. Standard restaurant rule- bring out all the customers dishes together or none at all. The salad is the easiest thing to make, so I'm not sure how they got it wrong but was only edible by putting salt on it. The skewer of chicken that came out at the very end, was 4 pieces in a tiny bowl. Servers need to be more communicative of the portion sizes at the time of ordering. Paid $35 for two salads (which were $7 each) and 4 pieces of chicken...doesn't make sense. The bill wasn't transparent, but I didn't care at this point as I wanted to leave. Also, they need to use note pads when taking the orders, because it was a disorganized hot mess. The place has potential, but they need a training course on service. 9 months is a long time to be open and be making these kind of mistakes."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant it's amazing the decoration and everything is very nice and clean the service is very good and the food is delicious. Had the chance to meet the owner too they are nice and friendly the only minus star i give is because of the small portion size and high price for it20$ (chicken shawarma) if they fix it would perfect I totally recommend it. I also recommend the appetizer plate with the bread"}
{"text":"The place is just beautiful. Very roomy, can fit up to 100 people. 
It's a new place so our food took awhile but was absolutely delicious. 
We ordered the chicken shawarma and the four different hummas. Loved both
Will be going back."}
{"text":"Cute place and ambiance. It can get a bit busy, but the managers and staff do their best to serve in a timely manner. The Iraqi kabob, chicken liver and the dip platter are great. And of course the samoon! 

Overall the menu is very similar to other middle eastern restaurants, and could benefit from more unique items. Prices are a bit high for the small portion sizes. They also really need to work on acoustic dampening because it's super loud and the walls echo a lot."}
{"text":"Please save your money and time. The food is average at best and is served on fancy plates to make up for the lack of taste. We had to wait 40 min to be seated and another 40 min for our food to arrive. When it finally did arrive, it was cold. The prices are ridiculous for the amount of food that was served"}
{"text":"Great decor. I consider these guys to be Paramounts competition and these guys beat them hands down!. Great flavour on sheesh tawouk and the lemon mint drink was very nice. Only recommendation I will make would be around consistentency. Out of the two times we have been there, Once the marskesh tea was out of stock and the other time our meat was served without the dangling shawarma skewer. Same order each time.."}
{"text":"Such a nice atmosphere...but:
-menu descriptions are unclear, freekah was described as having \"freekah\" in it, I didn't know what it was and ordered it anyways cause I expected a hot cheese dip, it came almost like oatmeal with a very small amount of cheese, ew
-menu listed key ingredients such as nuts often so I ordered the kebbeh  cause it seemed safe only to find out it has walnuts in it (From an allergic reaction...)
-menu listed a popular middle eastern soft drink \"Vimto\" which came flat, it was just syrup and water 
-all side dishes of rice contain various nuts, even after we asked our waiter not to put it in
-it was extremely difficult communicating with the waiter, he didn't understand our order
-I sent back the vimto and it came back flat again
-a bunch of items came to our table in error twice and it was very confusing, waiter came back and forth a few times to confirm
-ordered a coffee that came in a cool antique cup, it was the strongest coffee ever!!! And was in the smallest cup, their menu should describe it more...
-couldn't get a hold of the waiter when we wanted to, he was focused on another table with a larger party
-food wise was so average, resembles paramount or persian take-out
-my fries were cold

I really wanted to like this place! I will give them another shot by ordering the dip platter and the signature shawarma on a skewer (these seem to be their best-sellers)"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service, and lack of care. I was burned by one of the servers, and they said it happens sometimes, apologized with no sincerity, and walked away. The food? Bland, and overpriced for the quality and portion size."}
{"text":"It was an inviting and comfortable place.  Good variety of food and food service too.  Favourite dish was Hummus platter. A must try for all!"}
{"text":"Its disappointing because I was really excited for this place but it ended up being very average. I'll break my review down into 3 different categories: Décor, Food, Service:

Décor - There is no question that the décor at East Meets Can is like no other. From the flooring to the beautiful frames filled with middle eastern pop culture, the décor is top notch. They even had \"East Meets Can\" labelled on all of the chairs, it was a definite beauty! 

Food - My cousin and I wanted to order a few things so we could try a little bit of everything. We ordered: Fattoush salad, Haloumi Cheese, Pita & Hummus, Falafels, and the Chicken Shawarma Platter with rice. Let me break it down for you and add my commentary:

Fattoush salad - Too much salt and vinegar 
Haloumi Cheese - Burnt
Pita and Hummus - Good, nothing great. 
Falafel - Average
Chicken Shawarma Platter - Average and not enough rice 

One thing I did like is that we were able to eat so many different foods for a low price, it wasn't that expensive. It's just the quality of food that was disappointing. 

Service - Our waitress wasn't as helpful and friendly as we would like. However, the manager who was on duty - Saif, I believe was his name - was attending to everyone ensuring they were having a pleasant experience which was nice to see. 

Overall, I'd go back again with my husband to see if our experience was just a one-time thing but the flavors in the food just weren't meeting my expectations."}
{"text":"RAW CHICKEN, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Second and last time I ever come here.

Last night, the 3 of us each ordered a shish tawook plate, all 3 had raw chicken, some were fully pink and cold in the centre, so we sent them back. Unfortunately, I noticed too late and ate one piece. Then the manager came by to \"apologize\" followed by excuses, he said something like \"the challenge is that it looks cooked on the outside but the inside is hard to tell\". Really?! Isn't it the job of the cook to make sure the food is properly prepared?!

The server tried to offer us free tea or \"dessert\" to make up for it. I refused, and instead asked to have our main course fully discounted since I was very upset that I had eaten a raw piece of chicken. At the end, the manager tried to give us a pathetic 10% discount on our NEXT visit. We had no intention of ever returning, so we told him to apply the 10% discount on this order and left. 

I've been sitting on the toilet all day as I write this review. To the manager Mahmood, you really need to learn customer service. The best you could do was give me a $2 discount? I hope it was worth the negative reviews from me and my friends. Gonna make sure none of my friends ever come here."}
{"text":"Best Arabic restaurant in Mississauga Period!
Modeled after a restaurant in Amman Jordan. 
Hummus is amazing just need to work on their service."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Lovely, spotlessly clean decor

Cons:
-Clueless server
-We ordered two Iraqi kebab plates and they were very, very salty
-For the price, you get 2 small meat skewers, a pile of rice, some bread and pickles - all served on a metal hospital-like tray ...for the price I'd rather go to my local shawarma joint
-The onion on my 'tray' tasted like propane
-My husband who has an iron stomach hasn't felt right since eating there, I've been ok"}
{"text":"The last time I came to this location it was a  sad Chinese resto and I hope this place does much better.

They have done a nice job decorating and renovating.  The menu has a nice array of cold and hot apps and mains and desserts.

We ordered the dip platter, the mixed grill (so we could try 3 of the grill items), and grilled lamb chops.

The dips looked almost like the menu.  They ran out of the edamame dip (Friday night at 6pm) so we got 2 hummus instead.  The dips were very tasty as was that crispy chewy fluffy bread that came with it.

The mains were good, especially the Iraqi kabobs.  The lamb chops were basically 1.1 lamb chops, i.e. one normal lamb chop cut into 3 skinny chops.  The prices seem a bit high for what you get.

Service while friendly is a bit slow.  We (and the table behind us) had to ask for our cutlery and napkins, and it took awhile to get our bill.  This is something that can be easily fixed.  It is worth noting since the resto was not that busy.

Definitely worth a repeat trip!"}
{"text":"Mississauga area is saturated with middle eastern cuisine. So, it is really enjoyable to have an Excellent one in taste and quality. Most what I like in \"East.tea.can \"that you can feel,touch, taste and read every thing about Middle east canteen. Rarely atmosphere makes me happy .. this one is very welcoming as they succeeded to transfer not only the taste but the whole philosophy. Their staff are very attentive.Their prices compare to others are fair. I tried Kabab Iraqi was amazing in texture and spice, portions was fair if you order appetizers and planning for desserts. The dip platter appetizer was so delicious. Right on time to serve with big portion of Tabouli and in house hot breads. Um- Ali came with full of nuts .. it was ok. I already planned to come with my friends over weekend to enjoy the atmosphere and the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, Amazing Staff, and stunning atmosphere. This little sweet spot in mississauga is a must go for anyone in the area looking to dive into a different culture!

Food- 5/5
Service - 4/5
Atmosphere - 4/5
Price- 3/5

Food here is great, decent selection however done very well. I highly recccomend the chicken dinner and to try the Teas! Very flavorful and a decent portion. Everything theres seems to be made by scratch with a working stone bread oven displayed at the front of the house!

Must-try: Chocolate Mint Tea

Service the servers are nice, you have 1 waiter and a busser. They are attentive and quick.

Atmosphere, if you dont mind it being a little noisey than its okay. You might have to shout even to the person next to you becauae of how loud the place gets. Bathrooms are nice and clean.,

Price is a little steep for my liking, but youre paying for the experience and the atmosphere so its worth it.


In all i would come back to east tea can! Its a great place for family or social settings. Its a great addition to mississauga."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but big portion. Chicken Swarma was not really swarma. It was thin slices of chicken on skewer . Presentation was good probably explains the price. Aryan was pathetic don't waste money. It's available In stores.thought they will make it on house . The bread, hummus was awesome. If I had not ordered chicken , I could have filled tummy with bread the dip platter. Salad was okay , not great. Seats were uncomfortable and the glass was smelly. Overall a good worth for money."}
{"text":"To call this place a disappointment is an understatement. 

First of all, when we first entered the place (through the smallest doorway imaginable) we stood there for a solid 5 minutes before any of the staff even noticed us; the place was EMPTY. 

We sat down, the table was greasy. 

My fork had someone's leftovers on it. 

The fat bearded guy who came to take our order was condescending, and rude, and not to mention he had absolutely ZERO knowledge of his own menu, while simultaneously acting as if he was God himself. 

We order two cokes, it took them 20 minutes to bring it, despite being told TWICE. 

Our food was absolutely disgusting, now I'm not talking about the normal disgusting, I'm talking about the crud on the outside of a homeless man's lips disgusting. The meat was BURNT, THE ONION WAS AN INEDIBLE DISASTER AND MY GODDAMN TOMATO HAD A TUMOR. 

THERE WAS A HAIR IN THE RICE; THIS IS A RESTAURANT, NOT A BARBER SHOP. 

I have attached pictures of the FILTH that this place has to offer.

TL;DR OVERPRICED HORSESHIT."}
{"text":"As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by young girl who quickly sat us down with our menus.. 30 mins later my friend walked up to the cash register and asked if she could place an order.. We were told by a guy (seemed like the manager) that he'll be right over and that was the last we saw of him.. 15 mins later, we again flagged someone down and forcefully placed our order and requested for bread to survive while our food was being made.. The server disappears for 10 mins and showed up with cold bread which I instantly returned and asked for fresh bread.. The fresh bread came after 5 mins but there was no sign of our food for another 30mins.. We have now been here for more than an hour.. Finally we get our food (shawarma plate and shish tawook) and our fries are cold.. We try our luck one more time and ask the waiter if we can get fresh fries and ketchup.. He brings our fries but no ketchup.. At this point we eat our bland food and flag someone down to please bring our bill because this was the most miserable experience I've had at any restaurant.. They have concentrated more on the aesthetics and entertainment factor in this restaurant than service and quality of food.. I would not recommend anyone to come here on a Friday night.. It's busy and they don't have Enuff staff to manage the weekend rush.. 

Food : 1/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 0/5 (I would give negative of possible)"}
{"text":"Best service yummy delicious mezze and beautiful setting and display super clean and family friendly loved the shawerma was delicious ! Best kunafa too and of course the Iraqi tea ...superb !"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner and had a really enjoyable time! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and there's a lively atmosphere. We came on a Friday and there was live music playing as well. We ordered pomegranate juice, dip platter, shared the mixed grill plate and finished off with mint tea. The dips came with bread freshly baked from their wood oven. The bread was delicious and the dips were smooth and velvety in texture. Definitely the highlight for me. The mixed grill was good but not extraordinary. Tea was delicious and beautifully presented. 
Service was good, we never felt rushed even though it was a busy night. Was a great place for a girls dinner out. Will come back again with friends and large groups, as there were quite a few large groups."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food, but they seem to have a problem with consistency. The food is not always of the same quality every time I've been here. Service is always really slow. When we went today we had to ask our waitress for things 2-3 times before we got it. Bread wasn't replaced right away even though we got dishes that can only be eaten with bread. We were unsatisfied with one of our dishes and normally when this happens you expect a manager to ask why you were unhappy with your meal, we didn't get any of this. If your looking for Arab food better than mediocre shawarma spots this restaurant does the job but you definitely will leave annoyed with how long it takes for things to get done."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, bright, vibrant, spacious. Great food. We tried the dip platter. The bummus (beet hummus) was by far the most delicious - freshly made naan in house. The freekah was not what I expected but still good. The chicken shwarma was also nicely presented and good as well - but we were so full we just ate the chicken. I had their lemon mint drink - very good, refreshing - kinda like a slush. My friend had the pomegranate drink and it was very tarte - needed to be diluted with water. Overall, I wish they a cocktail menu. But would definitely come back and try other things on their menu. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"PROS:
- Old meets New design - kinda chic?
- Waiters were willing to help and recommend food
- Spacious
- Food was tasty
- Food presentation was decent

CONS:
- Very expensive IMHO (came out to $30/person)
- Food portions do not match the cost (not enough)

VERDICT:
- If you are the kind of person who eats pizza with a fork and knife, you will probably love this place
- If you are taking your significant other on a special dinner, this is a nice place
- If you are looking to have good food and for a reasonable price, go to Osmow's on Courtney Park and Hurontario"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this place! The white exterior with blue doors is cute and remiscent of Mediterranean buildings. The interior is also pretty with details such as glass lights, a tea wall, Middle Eastern movie posters, large bar area, coloured chairs and bright glasses and plates on tables.

My husband and I ordered the dip platter and mixed grill plate. The nicely presented dip platter was made up of hummus, edamame based dip, beet root dip and an eggplant based dip. All dips were smooth, creamy, delicious and had pretty edible flowers on top! The dip platter came with fluffy pita bread. This was definitely my favourite part of our meal and great portions for $11! I highly recommend it and wouldn't hesitate to order this again.

The mixed grill plate had a lamb skewer, beef skewer, moist chicken skewer pieces and a couple pieces of grilled vegetables (onion, peppers, pickles, tomato). The chicken was definitely the best part with its seasonings. The lamb was decent and the beef was a bit bland. We chose a side of rice to go with this platter. I found it a bit expensive for $25 and probably wouldn't get it again. I would order the grilled chicken next time as part of the chicken shwarma plate though.

Service was good and attentive enough - no issues. We'll be back and recommend that others give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 12 people for an early dinner this past weekend on a Sunday evening for an early dinner around 5pm. Originally we wanted to come at 7:30pm but they told us they were closed from 7- 8:30 for Ramadan, which was understandable. After 8:30pm they only offered the buffet option which was $40/adult. Since we wanted to have a variety of dishes, we went with a 5:30pm reservation. 

I really wanted to like this place, but the terrible service here really frustrated me, hence the lower review. As soon as you walk in, you see the amazing decor and atmosphere, but that all wears off immediately when you are seated and see the service here. 

Our waiter came to our table, said his name was Ahmed, but you can call me \"Jay\" , was friendly but brushed off our repeated requests for drinks and bread. When it finally came time to take out drink orders, he reluctantly took them, but then didn't serve them until halfway through our meal, as if he forgot them. Whenever we politely asked for more of the house bread to have along with our hummus and Baba Ghanoush, he said he would bring some, but the bread never came. One of our 4 fries was cold, I asked him to bring a hot one, to replace, but it took over 20min to bring a new one. He continually forgot our orders, every time I asked for something simple like water or extra napkins, he always said \"I got you\", but then never came. He definitely didn't didn't \"have us\" 

Just in terms of service with such a large group,I truly think another waiter should have been assisting him. That would've helped our experience immensely. The most frustrating part about this this terrible service experience was that the restaurant wasn't even busy. There were only about 2 other parties besides us in the entire restaurant. 

We ordered:
Tabuleh - so much lemon, you could hardly taste anything else

Kale Tabuleh - pretty tasty, too much lemon, but a nice twist on the 
original parsley based one.

Baba Ghanoush - tasty and fresh

Fattoush salad - pretty ok, nothing special though 

Hummus - Good, nothing great

Falafel - Hot and crispy without being too dry on the inside, the garlic sauce accompanied with it, was rally good too! It was very flavourful without being too overpowering.  

Chicken Wings - pretty tasty actually, they had a really great flavour and were very moist. 

Family Mixed Grill
(4 Iraqi Kabab skewers, 2 Tikka skewers and 3 Shish Tawook skewers served with grilled vegetables, pickles, Hummus, fries, rice and salad)
 - All the meat items were delicious! It was actually a very good variety platter that a lot of us could share. 

Lemon Mint Juice - quite a few of us ordered this drink, and it was absolutely lovely! It was so light and refreshing without being too sour or sweet. I would highly recommend trying it. The only drawback here was that the drinks were served well into our main meal. We were about halfway done our dinner by the time the drinks arrived which was really disappointing. 

East Tea Can Signature Dried Lime - A couple of us wanted to try the tea before our meal, ( since we're Indian, and it was around 5:30pm, that is normally tea time for us) Our waiter insisted that we should have our tea after the meal to help with digestion, so in the end we listened to him and had it as a post dinner tea.

Overall, the consensus here, is that the food tasted great, but the service was sooooo poor I might refrain from coming back here again. Its disappointing because I was really excited for this place but it ended up being a bittersweet experience."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Amazing food. Juicy meat. Tender chicken. Lots of hummus. Smells great. Plenty of seating. Cool looking menu. (Service could have been faster though)

I recommend it if you want somewhere casual with your entire family. Try the east tea can signature chicken skewers and the falafel. The family meat platter was also generally great.

I also appreciated the endless supply of freshly baked pita bread. It smelled amazing and it was soft and fluffy."}
{"text":"Amazing food, decor and ambience. The bread is probably the best part as it's fresh, hot and soft. The shawarmas and Iraqi kebab are the highlights of the menu. Had a few mezzes, but would recommend the hummus sampler which goes great with their bread. Also highly recommend the mint lemon juice and the mannakeesh."}
{"text":"Friends took me to East Tea Can while on a visit to the Toronto Metro Area. Being of an Iraqi heritage I thoroughly enjoyed the decoration, the photos, the cheezy t-shirts and frames! This was an experience and a cultural education not just a brunch. 
Food was amazing so was the service."}
{"text":"Great place! Foods quick & staff is very friendly! Highly recommend coming here! Had the beef shawarma on the metal stick! Was very good !"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and interior as well as a pretty tasty menu. Definitely a restaurant that stands out from all the other mundane ones in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service, waiter was non attentive and didn't even bring us water for almost 10 mins. He even lied to cover up a mistake in bringing us half our food order. The food was okay but it was overshadowed by the bad service, not likely to go back. Wasn't impressed by the tea either."}
{"text":"Food is extremely fresh and presentation is really pretty too. The ambiance of this place is what really stands out! Live music, beautiful authentic decor and plenty of seating. Customer service was really great, we had ahmad as a waiter and he really took care of us at the table. 
But full disclosure, it's pretty pricey. Will come for special occasions but definitely not my go to Arabic restaurant."}
{"text":"A group of us (14) went to East Tea Can for lunch last week. 

We were greeted and seated as soon as we go there. We were given menus which looked like small newspapers. The waitress came over right away and took our drink orders and then spent a few minutes explaining what each of the menu items was (very helpful as a few of the party weren't used to Middle Eastern cuisine).

It took a long time for the food to come out and there was probably 15 to 20 minutes between the first person's food arriving and the last. However, they're a fairly new restaurant and we were a large table so we weren't really worried about that.

Everything we ordered was delicious. The salads were very fresh and the flavours punchy and bright. The hot dishes were all great too. I LOVED the falafel and can honestly say they were the best I've ever had. They were so crispy on the outside, but deliciously soft and moist in the centre. They were served with plenty of tahini, which I really appreciated and they also came with a huge plate of lettuce, onion, tomato and cucumber.

I also had the Jarjeer salad, which had baby arugula, red onion, dates, walnuts, tomatoes and was dressed with a pomegranate molasses with what tasted like lots of sumac. Delicious!

The servings were VERY generous and most of us ended up with doggie bags.

Everyone at the table said they'd definitely return."}
{"text":"We had the hummus sampler. The beet one was my favorite. There was also a hummus dip with chicken and that was very tasty. Almost like a barbecue taste. Super cool Decor. I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, Always feeling welcomed when going there, the owner is kind and warm hearted always asking if anything is wrong or if we needed anything. I know most people were complaining about the shawarma not looking like the shawarma they usually have, this is because its an Iraqi restaurant this is how we make it back home, everything I've got is fantastic, the hummus babaganoush full of fantastic taste, the fatoosh and tabouleh is amazing, and the warm area is awesome. if there were 6 stars id defiantly give it a 6 star rating, I think everyone should visit here. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! The middle eastern touch all around the restaurant really makes you want to stay. Each piece had a story and the owner was nice enough to talk about it with us. He was very personable and kind. 

The fatoush salad was amazing, especially if you like the lemon in it. The chicken that we ordered was undercooked at first but they took it back and made sure it was done more. It tasted great with the garlic sauce. GET THE FALAFEL! I'm not even into falafels and I was totally hogging them. 

The kanefe for desert wasn't too sweet, which I personally like. If you like the sweeter kanafe then don't go for this one. They also had this carrot dessert but it was only a test as they said they weren't sure if they would keep it on the menu, I totally think they should, it was really yummy. 

Overall the experience was what made this restaurant so enjoyable. :)"}
{"text":"Very cool interiors, spacious, bright and spotless clean.
The overall decor doesn't necessarily relate to \"Iraqi cuisine\", but it's fresh and clean and fun to look around.

The food is average, some items are better than others, but overall still about or below mediocre.
Just like the decor, the menu does not really include main authentic Iraqi plates, although some of them might have the same name(s) on the menu, but preparation, look and taste os something else.

The beef Kababs are actually good, flavourful..close enough to the traditional authentic Iraqi kababs.
As for the beef shawarma, I was highly disappointed with the taste, it had a different unique taste and structure. It's more of a layer meat slices rather than actual shawarma.

Presentations are cool and modern..which goes along with the other areas of the restaurant.

They sometime have a live oud player on weekend, which is a nice touch.

They have a patio that just opened up this summer serving hookahs outside, unfortunately the hookah did not live up to expectations as well. The patio looks like half-done also, missing any shades/umbrellas, heaters, etc..

In terms of pricing, it's more on the pricy side, charging $22 for a hookah for example, you would expect what you pay for..

East Tea Can has a massive potential to standout and be THE PLACE serving Iraqi food in Mississauga, especially that there are only handful restaurants within this category in the area, and the ambiance and decor is just right and inviting. Tweak the menu, make it less busy while focusing on the main items and make them better..rather than having more and sacrifice the quality."}
{"text":"The servers are very lazy, they don't care about their customers. They dont make sure about your satisfaction of the food just deliver the food to the table and if you want something you have to follow them to ask.
They also don't have a standard in their food some time it is good and sometimes not. Manakish some time is very delicious and the other time is like a pice of wood you cannot eat it. Also the size of their manakish is shrinking each time you go to them."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere is not like any other restaurant. The decor is super cute and fun. The food is absolutely delicious! They have a a clay oven for fresh bread that's delicious. Favorite restaurant in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"my friend and I tried this place out for the first time. for a first impression, it was a really nice place. well decorated, good ambience, music playing, guy singing. had a different flare to it. the furniture was unique and comfortable. they had a wall with unique pieces. not sure if they were for sale.

the food was tasty. good portions but not large enough to take home as well for the price they charged. the options are limited. don't expect to find wraps and their salads are a bit on the smaller side. the fattoush salad was tasty however. we ordered the kofta and chicken shwarma. flavorful. however they did mess up our order and did not fill our waters. we must've asked 3 times to have our waters refilled. I'm not sure why they didn't just leave the bottles at the table.


service was very slow considering there were so many waiters just hanging around. their customer service was definitely lacking among the staff. the owners however were very nice and chatty. I think their staff needs better training. our food took over 45 mins to come and there was bread offered during the wait  (but that's okay). just be sure to expect the wait. 


overall good experience. didn't try their teas yet. maybe will go back with the hubby."}
{"text":"Great place for Middle-eastern food. The store is large and clean. The decor is modern. Service is good. Food is good. Portions are ample. The complementary bread is fresh. It can get pretty busy, but they take reservations. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had their signature beef shawarma with salad. Beef is amazing. Definitely will be back for this. Salad is fresh and crunchy but dressing is very sour. Might be better to ask for it on the side if possible and put yourself as they put alot, and with sour pickles on the side its sour lol. Also had lemon mint juice on the suggestion of one of the reviewers here and it did not disappoint. Try it! Very refreshing. Other order was mixed grill with fries. Meats were very delicious. Fries was somewhat oily and not much flavour. Their rice is very good tho. Pomegranate drink was good. Ground beef manakeesh was delicious. I wouldn't squeeze much lemon juice on it tho, drops here and there are enough. Its pricy but very delicious meat dishes."}
{"text":"Great décor and atmosphere.
A lot of nice varieties on the menu.
The chicken msakhen was very tasteful with a nice touch of pomegranate sauce.
I lived in the middle east most of my life and I can tell you these people serve the REAL AUTHENTIC IRAQI KABAB and Samoon (bread). The kabab was very well cooked and it had the perfect combination of spices and meat. The service was excellent with very friendly and courteous staff. I went 4 times so far to this place and definitely going back again for some more Kabab and Bumos."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner w/ an Iraqi friend who pretty much ordered everything on the menu!  I remember they had some very good and interesting hummus (never seen some of these flavors of hummus anywhere else).  The kebabs were delicious and presented in such a cute way!  I would definitely come back again and have been begging my Iraqi friend to go with me again!"}
{"text":"I had my worst restaurants experience with this place. We drive by this place everyday from work. It looks absolutely beautiful from outside however the food and service definitely need alot of attention. We had an issue we spoke with the manager and I was absolutely insulted I  the way he handled our experience. I will never go back here again. Food isn't the greatest either! It's a shame cuz it's beautiful inside"}
