{"text":"Had a couple of slices and fresh cut fries. All very good. Cool spot for pizza in west view."}
{"text":"This is quality pizza!  The crust is just average, but the sauce and cheeses they use are so good!  Unlike most places, these guys don't need to serve a greasy pizza to have it taste good.

They are very nice people working there as well. We were given the remote to the TV and told to watch whatever we wanted.  I think it was their daughter in the corner playing games on an iMac setup in one of the booths.  This is clearly a family run business, and it shows in the quality of their food and service.

This is without a doubt the best pizza I have had in the Pittsburgh area, and very fortunate to live nearby.  I will definitely be back to try the hoagies."}
{"text":"A hit ot miss place. Sometimes pretty delicious, sometimes seems like they dont care about food or service. Im never getting delivery again after waiting one hour forty minutes for cold pizza without a word from the driver or the staff when we called in."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the best salads around, they never skimp on the fresh ingredients. My son's favorite is the cheeseburger hoagie. Great staff."}
{"text":"Center Ave Slice has been the go to pizza shop in the Pittsburgh Area. The pizza is delicious and cooked perfectly. The cheese they use is amazing. I'd recommend trying their bread sticks, white pizza, french fries, or a calazone. I've been eating at center ave slice for over 6 years and I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!

Customer service:  The owner always strikes up a conversation with me, he's super friendly and so is the rest of the staff I have encountered.  He will tell you about the history of the park too.

The pizza is delicious.  The cheese is the best money can buy, they made their dough fresh every morning and the toppings are fresh.  I ordered a pineapple pizza and when I arrived to pick it up I saw him slicing up a real pineapple.. imagine that!  SO GOOD.

I loved the atmosphere.. there are old photographs and news clippings from when the West View amusement Park was up and running.  Very interesting to learn about West View's history and something to do while you are waiting since there are things to read all over the restaurant.  Also, the huge mural on the side of the building is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the area.. The restaurant while a little unorganized is a great place to sit down and have some food.. Hoagie are good too.. Wings and cal ones are winners too! Our favorite place.."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Called and ordered food, they told me 1/2 hr...an hour goes by and I called back.  They couldn't find my order then proceeded to tell me it would be another hour before I could have my food.  


This included the girl on the phone talking to the manager and him saying \"make him wait\" guess they didn't think I could hear them.  I'll never order from here again.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza joint is near my house, so I'm a little biased, but the calzones are amazing, especially the Italian calzone.  Dine in is available, but the dining room isn't really all that great, so their main business is from carryout and delivery.  Definitely worth a call for a good meal."}
{"text":"We are always on the lookout for good pizza.  We've found it!  

You know when you get hit with that pizza craving?  We got hit hard last night around 7, when we were out by Ross Park Mall.   Not wanting to do a chain restaurant, I searched nearby pizza places, and put this one into the GPS.  It's super close to Mcknight road, but definitely off the beaten path.

We ordered it to go, we had wine at home, and pizza and red wine is my favorite football watching combo.

The whole way home, I could smell that these pizzas were tasty.  The sticker on the box said that they were made with the best italian cheese you could get.  It took all my restraint to not just start eating it in the car right then and there, but then my daughters would want to do  the same, and pizza is not good car food for 7 and 8 year old girls (at least not mine).

Once we dug in, they did not disappoint.  The pepperoni on my older daughters half were tiny, and she loved that (they have large ones too).  She said that way when you bit into a pepperoni, you don't have to try to bite it in half.   There were tons of olives and FRESH (I hate canned mushrooms) on my and my younger daughters half.  And they accommodated my husband with dollops of ricotta on his half (It's not listed as a usual topping).  The pizza was excellent, the toppings were tasty and plentiful, and they didn't screw it up!  

We aren't the easiest of orders, we are always halving this and that, and lots of times our orders are wrong, but not this time!

We have found our pizza place!"}
{"text":"i love this place! always good food, fresh and hot in a timely manner. pizza, wings, fries, cheese sticks, everything is always delicious! employees especially the owner are very nice. i always order from here, and the worse time i've had to wait is an extra 10 minutes at the store, because i got there too early leaving from my house haha! definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone! :)"}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for almost ten years now one neighborhood over from West View and this is my first time ordering from Center Avenue Slice. My order consisted of a side salad @ $4.50 and a 10\" hand tossed junior size pizza. 

The salad was a good size and and included iceberg lettuce, tomato cubes, fresh sliced mushrooms, green pepper and two types of cheese. They include additional veggies or peppers that I told them to hold including olives, banana peppers and a couple other items. It also came with a nice sized round container of my selected dressing - Italian. The salad was well worth the price and was very fresh.

The pizza I ordered was the hand tossed pan crust with mushrooms, hamburger, green peppers and diced tomatoes. The taste was very nice and the toppings were plentiful. The toppings were spread well and no one topping dominated in any area of the pizza. This is just good normal pizza. 

I called at 8:37 p.m. on a Sunday and my husband drove and collected the order, so I have no experience with their delivery service. They close at 9:15 p.m., so I was very pleased by the fresh food provided so close to closing time. I will be ordering in good faith again from this eatery."}
{"text":"Its okay.

Hand tossed dough was good, classic neighborhood pizza shop, but the rest is not for me.  The sauce was a sweet sauce, but I've had better.  The cheese was just the standard.

I'd WOULD order if it was my local pizza shop, but as I was just passing thru I won't be back."}
{"text":"Center Avenue Slice is pretty close to where I live. We have ordered a couple times and the results are varied. The calzones were really good the first time we ordered, but the other times, they are undercooked and soggy in the middle. The dough is nice and chewy, and there is usually a lot of cheese on the pizza. If you get additional toppings, there are pretty scarce. None of our orders were made on time. I usually have to wait an extra 10 minutes. They are usually pretty busy, so I can see why this can happen. The people who work there are very nice, and I have never been treated rudely."}
{"text":"A cheesy slice is a wonderful wall to end an otherwise dull week and Center Ave slice always delievers. The atmospher is very friendly."}
{"text":"Center Avenue Slice makes a pretty serious pizza. Their crust is thin, and  mildly floppy but not so much so that you end up losing all of the toppings between your plate and your mouth. The outer crust is very light and crispy, and snaps in half when you try and fold it. The thing I liked most about their pizza is that they hit a nice balance with their toppings. While the sausage and banana peppers were plentiful on my pizza nothing was  so dominant that you couldn't taste the other toppings. 

Their delivery service was prompt and friendly and the cost, $16 for a medium 2 topping, was a bit steep but ended up being worth it. I will definitely be ordering from Center Ave. Slice again."}
{"text":"I ordered a large cheese pizza for pick up from here this past Wednesday to share with my girlfriend.  Whenever I phoned in the order I was told that our pizza would be ready in 15 minutes.  This restaurant is located in a lesser visited part of West View but their food is always good and this is the local pizza place that I order from the most.  We arrived at the restaurant about 25 minutes later and our pizza was waiting for us. While we were paying for the pizza my girlfriend and I overheard one of their workers talking to the others about the expensive cost of cheese currently.  I did not pay it much attention until I got home and noticed that the pizza did not have as much cheese as it normally did.  This is not to say that it was lacking in cheese in any way but it was not as much as it normally did.  It did not affect the taste of the pizza much and it still tasted very good but their cheeses are why I normally order from here. The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future for pizza as I enjoy it.  Every other time that I have had their pizza it has been worthy of 5 stars so I am hoping that this time was an anomaly and not an indication that there will be less cheese in the future."}
{"text":"Joke of a company with useless service. Could have changed the whole situation of a company screw up but instead choose to go with the make em wait mentality. I will never order from there again."}
{"text":"I knew a girl in Pitt so I center a slice from here and she liked it. I like it too, even though it's not amazing and is far from my fave in town (Aiello, Fiori).

They have lovely service, and serve a decent slice. It's not really Pittsburgh-style Pizza, just generic pizza but still pretty good and worth a try if you're in this area.

If you live in Pitt and haven't tried it yet, my question is... why avenue tried it yet?"}
{"text":"Wow.  Peace out Center Avenue Slice.  The quality on the pizza has crashed, and the customer service SUCKS!

The parents ordered a pizza a few weeks back to pick up.  The order was simple: large pepperoni pizza.  When they arrived, the workers said the pizza still needed ten minutes, despite this being longer than the quoted time.  Ok, things happen.  

Five minutes later, a man walked up, ordered, and was given a large pepperoni pizza a few minutes later.  This pizza turned out to be my parents.  Want to hear the solution to this?  The employee gave my dad two options:

1.  He could pay the LARGE price for an already made MEDIUM pepperoni pizza.  Because they don't correct mistakes (WTF?) or do refunds.

2.  He could wait ten minutes for a new pizza.  (What kind of pizza is ready in ten minutes?)

How long did that new pizza take?  45 minutes.  And the cheese and sauce quality is now on par with Papa Johns or Dominoes.

The pizza is now passable and nothing more.  No one would miss them if they closed tomorrow with their new attitude.  Bye, Center Avenue.  We will never order from you again!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Center Avenue Slice? My family and I stopped in for lunch one day and decided to eat in the restaurant. I was a little confused if the restaurant is actually a place you ate or  your store junk. There was a lot of unused equipment, books stacked on benches and a messy unkept feel. In retrospect I actually cannot believe that we stayed and ate there. 
The pizza came out and it was served on a pizza pan with a wire stand that kept it off the table. The pizza was a typical thin crust and red sauce pizza. It was good the type of pizza that you can fold in half and eat it like a taco. But it wasn't good enough to say I always have to have pizza from there.
I think this is the type of place that makes it in a Westview type of neighborhood. A place that holds nostalgia for those who eat there regularly and cheap delivery option. 
I do not think I will ever eat there again but at least we tried the Center Avenue Slice one time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the staff is friendly the owner is a really good guy and the pizza is really good and so is the rest of the food like the hot sausage casserole or breaded cauliflower or even their calzones. I say forget Pizza Hut forget Little Caesars forget Domino's supported two small business guy go to Center Avenue slice"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place at all! I ordered the deep dish pizza and I was given a  thick crusted normal pizza. The regular pizza was thin The pizza had a doughy taste. I would definitely not reccommend this place at all. What a waste of $30.00."}
{"text":"Updated Review.

In the past review I had only ordered their sandwiches and calzones, which were really good and will be talked about.  However I finally got around to ordering their pizza which has been named best pizza in some category.  I will start by saying that I really enjoy big floppy slices with not a lot of sauce and good toppings.  Center Ave gave me just what I wanted.  A New York style pizza for a good price.  The crust was cooked well and had enough crunch.  The sauce was good and did not overpower the toppings like some pizza joints.  I really enjoyed the pizza and now see myself not waiting so long to get again.

Here's the portion of my last review that addresses their sandwiches.  The fish sandwich was large, crisp, good flavor, and not soggy.  Not the greatest, but definitely worth it.  The Pittsburgh sandwich, think Primanti's, was better than the original.  More meat, not as soggy and messy, and full of flavor.  
I must warn though that they charge quite a bit for delivery so if you want to save, pick it up!

I can't give Center Ave 5 stars because while the pizza is very good and the sandwiches are good to very good, nothing is great.  That being said it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I like there pizza,and have never had a bad experience until my husband went to pick up our order tonight and they had given it away to someone else."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to order from! To me, the price is worth the quality of the pizza I've always received. They usually show up early and the delivery guys are always really friendly."}
{"text":"I love center avenue, but lately the quality has been off.   Its like a box of chocolate you never know what you'll get."}
{"text":"Usually enjoy the food, and have never had an issue with the service.....until recently.  Ordered a take-out pizza, and asked for mushrooms on the side, as I was part of a group and the only one who wanted them.  When I went to pick it up, the mushrooms were RAW.  Really? I have to tell you to cook them if their not on the pizza??  By the way, get rid of the tip jar on the counter.  If I'm spending my money on gas to get there, what am I going to tip you for? Doing your job??  Delivery? I always tip.  If I have to pick it up, no tip."}
{"text":"Had friends over so we ordered a variety of food- 2 hoagies, 2 dozen wings, cheesy bread, and fries. The hoagie bread was rock hard and the Italian had very little meat on it, the wings were RAW inside, the cheese bread had garlic but NO cheese and the fries were mushy and cold. I called and the girl wasn't even apologetic so I emailed address on website and never got a response. I guess its okay with the owner that his food was inedible. We ended up throwing it out ($50 worth of food) and going to McDonald's."}
