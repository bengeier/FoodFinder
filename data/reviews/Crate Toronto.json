{"text":"Great ambiance. Drinks were as described and food was excellent. We were treated to fantastic live music. Will definitley return!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal with 11 tapas dishes and a bottle of wine for just over $100. Great service and everything was tasty."}
{"text":"My daughter has been to this place many times, so she convinced me to try it out. 

Though somewhat of an artist (improv comedy performer, writer) I'm not a foodie - not by any stretch of the imagination.  Put simply I was surprised at how truly artistic and tasty the  healthy meal was at this place. 

My daughter and I tried out their brunch menu on a Sunday - she had the eggs benedict, while I enjoyed their chicken and waffles creation. My expectation was that it would taste good - just because of what my daughter had to say about it. The reality was that it was beyond just \"tasty\". 

The presentation was excellent, but the flavours were just out of this world. The chef at this place is a warm and personable guy who loves to chat about his work. Though he puts in 16 hours days, he told me that it wasn't really work for him at all. For him, it's like preparing food for his friends, in an atmosphere that just invites everyone to stay and enjoy it all.

I had a great time there, and plan to go back.  I mean - talk about great first impressions!"}
{"text":"Wow. I was so impressed with this food. The service was amazing. - nicest people but I have to say that the food was amazing. Tapas meets brunch. We had the breakfast nachos and eggs Benedict. .....  Never tasted better honestly."}
{"text":"Was really impressed with the food  - i will be back!  The eggs Benedict was delicious, the chicken and waffles was very good as well if a bit small serving size.
service also excellent, ambience could be improved by turning off the tv IMO."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of tapas, but Crate just didn't deliver. The portions are incredibly tiny (even by tapas standards) and definitely not worth the price tag. The space/atmosphere is relaxed and cool and the staff are friendly, but I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food. The chef came out to ask us how the meal was and the wait staff spent lots of time answering our questions. We will go again."}
{"text":"Excellent informed service,  food is all delightful... Especially the bison sliders!   The vegetarian options are very plentiful and  delish for the vegetarian persuasion.. The unique and and perfectly made cocktails keep me very happy... If you are living in the east end of Toronto,  please come and support an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Super Chill but AWESOME! Its a Wednesday and we totally caught this little gem by accident and wasn't disappointed! The dudes that work here are cool cats with cool accents and super friendly kinda makes you feel like your friends already!!

 To top it off special drinks!' 

What better way to spend hump day than with your babe having drinks and tapas oh and a live duo of nameless dudes singing to you for entertainment!! 

This place has a cool vibe kinda wish it was in my backyard!!

Oh shit one more thing !! They serve  reunion island coffee in the MORNING..for all those coffee lovers out there!! 


BOOOYA!! Go here you will love it!!"}
{"text":"First but not last visit to this new addition to the Leslieville resto scene.  Love the dressed down ambience and caf√© like luncheon menu. Simple but delicious. Nice selection of daily sandwiches that come with a small fresh green salad. 
Tapas menu items are also available. 
At night, menu changes to Tapas bar. 

Two sandwiches, one caprese salad, 3 glasses of wine & a delicious iced coffee came to $51 with tax. Very reasonable in this day and age!

Service provided by charming French server added to the charm of this new place. 
Once the patio is licensed, my rating will go up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, and I've had tapas before but this was a bit too light. I The tiny portions are barely a mouthful and the kale salad was particularly microscopic. We dropped a significant amount of money and ultimately felt a bit robbed. Crate is trying to do something different in the area, and I'm happy to have another local in the hood, but this is def not a dinner destination. Good for drinks and they make killer espressos."}
