{"text":"We went there today and there was a line for the restaurant.  It was our first time there.  Unfortunately we did not get to order as our friend that was with us got ill.  We thought he was having a stroke.  I went to the kitchen area and asked them to call paramedics.  It was so impressive how quickly they responded.  The security came running, and they had in house paramedics come and also the manager.  Everyone was very helpful and they called Henderson paramedics.  The waitress came up and said she was sorry and hoped all would be better. Overall I was so impressed we with their efficiency and helpfulness.We definitely want to go back and have dinner soon."}
{"text":"The rainbow club restaurant images is my families weekly restaurant. Sometimes we eat here more than once a week. It has been that way for almost twenty years. The best breakfast with delicious biscuits and gravy. The prime rib is my favorite dinner but I can say I've had almost everything on the menu with no complaints."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for over 5 years and we love it here.  The staff is great, portions are huge and pricing is on point.  We love the Casino Special for breakfast which comes with eggs the way you want it, bacon or sausage, hash and toast or biscuits and gravy.  Lunch we always get a sandwich with soup or fries and we never finish our lunch because the portions are huge and that's one of the many reasons why we love coming here.  My hubby always has the thick cut prime rib dinner and I always have the Chicken Cordon Bleu for dinner.  We've pretty much tried everything on their menu and they haven't disappointed.  Every time we have family over we always have to take them here to try it out and all of them have always come back.  With all of that said we will most definitely continue to come here because to us this is the best restaurant on Water St."}
{"text":"we stopped  here after the hoover dam. the staff was amazing and the food was really good and reasonably  priced for sure. will be back next time in vegas."}
{"text":"My Realtor actually recommended this place to me as it was just down the street from where we were.  I was waiting on an inspection of a property I was purchasing, it was early in the morning and I had been out pretty late the night before.    

Pulling up to the building, my first thought was \"oh god, what a dive\" I was waaaaay to hungry at that point to play around, but I was also too tired to go to one of my usual spots.  The casino is very small and outdated-pretty much what you would expect in old Henderson. There was a bit of a wait to eat, but again, I just needed sustenance so I was 100% committed at this point to eat here.    Once we sat down, the service was fast and efficient and the food was old Vegas prices.  A full breakfast for $1.89!  Love love LOVE it.  I immediately texted my  husband a picture of the menu.  He had worked construction back when we lived there and I figured he knew every cheap eat in the entire Las Vegas area, but he hadn't heard of this one.

We actually went back last weekend, took my husband for the first time as well as a group of locals who were thoroughly impressed with not only the price but the quality.  It was a Saturday this time and our wait was about an hour, but once you sit down, you realize it's allll worth it.

LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"This place gets high praise for several reasons, the menu has hardly changed in all the years I've been eating here (this also includes the price), The food is consistently good (big portions and always the same), and the place has sentimental value from my childhood and high school years. The only downside is the service. From time to time you get a diner zombie serving you, she's backed up and in the weeds and totally neglects your table, but that comes with the territory. Overall service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Seriously...who doesn't serve food at 10:30 pm on. FRIDAY NIGHT??  Total disappointment."}
{"text":"Best place in Henderson for breakfast! I Dining here, since I were a child. My parents would bring my siblings and I for Sunday breakfast. I love this place! Food is amazing! The people and the ambiance makes you feel at home. Everything on their menu is awesome and delicious."}
{"text":"We put our name in a waited for a table, As I set and watched the host and waitress seat their friends and family before mine and another family.  
The host and the waitress will make you wait as they seat everyone they know, the whole time telling you that a table will open up any moment.
I walked out after an hour, We were the only people waiting for a table yet they sat everyone of their friends as soon as they walked up.
The cost is cheap and food is just ok, I will never step foot in this smoke filled place again."}
{"text":"You won't find a better prime rib for the price anywhere.  Sometimes a little fatty, but always an incredible flavor.  My wife and I eat here almost weekly with the in-laws and we've never been disappointed.  Breakfast, lunch, or dinner you'll find something to love.  Sure, it looks like a strip club with all the neon and mirrors, but the food and staff are always excellent.   It's a bit noisy, and almost always busy.  Give it a try and you'll realize why there's usually a line to get in."}
{"text":"Very good for the price. I've been here several times and have always been pleased with the food. The portions are good too. I've had soup, chicken wings, a Philly cheese-steak and fries and it was all good. It seems to be a popular place as there is sometimes a wait but it is worth it. Atmosphere is nice and there are plenty of TVs if you want to catch up on sports. If there are no games on all the TVs feature a slideshow of photos of landscapes etc. which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Love going there for a  quick bite at a great price.  Love their salad, and the blue cheese.  Plus the wait staff is very nice, just wish you didn't have to walk through a bunch of smokers to get to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ah Rainbow Club diner where have you been hiding? I found this little hidden gem during \"Date Night\". Since we're both food junkies, my other half wanted me to experience the Rainbow Club, similar to Peppermill. 

I had never really been to downtown Henderson and my better half lives nearby so this was a new experience for me and then to stumble upon this place...I'm digging it. 

Yes it's a pretty small smoky casino, and has a cafe that doesn't look like much. I was cautious to try anything from this place because of such cheap prices but figured it had to be decent if it was pretty busy on a Tuesday night.

I was craving a big chunk of meat so I got crazy and ordered the $7.99 prime rib. I was surprised how tender it was, I was preparing myself for the worst! It came with mash taters, green beans and salad. A little overkill on the gravy but overall it wasn't a bad meal. My other half munched on a grilled tuna sammich and thought it pretty decent for the price. Caution: the potato salad is a loaded with mayo so you can hear your arteries clogging.

In the end, so glad I discovered this joint. I can take out of town guests here instead of Terribles. At least the service is better here!"}
{"text":"The restaurant in this little locals casino has some of the best burgers you'll find in town at a reasonable price.

My favorite is the bacon double cheeseburger. I'm a big guy and this is almost too much food for me which really says something.

Two big pattys- I'm guessing 1/3lb each, so a total of 2/3lb of really good quality beef and your choice of cheese. What really makes this burger outstanding though is the perfectly cooked thick cut bacon. Two large strips of awesomeness criss-cross the top of the burger. Build the rest yourself with the lettuce, tomato, and onion provided on the side. I like some mayo to finish it off and you're good to go.

I haven't found a better BDCB in Vegas yet."}
{"text":"We come to this place because it's convenient for us the place is very nice the staff excluding the bartender are very friendly the reason I'm given 2 stars is because the bartenders are so unfriendly and would not acknowledge you unless you walk over to were there are at and ask for a drink there are here to serve you not you serve them, to the management of this place we are a customer that brings business to this place and don't forget the tips that comes along with it. With out us you don't have s job mrs bartender. That's my rant"}
{"text":"\"Images\" ( unless they changed the name ) inside the Rainbow Casino is one of my all time favorite places in the nation to eat breakfast.  Their country friend steak is the best.  Their country gravy to die for!   Definately worth the small car ride from Vegas to try it.

Only drawback is that it's a small place so the wait can be 20+ min on a busy day."}
{"text":"I'll I can say is Images inside the Rainbow Casino is AMAZING! Not only are the prices incredible but the food is sooooooo good!!! I will be coming here again! The staff was AMAZING as well!!!"}
{"text":"This is a little dive casino but the cafe has great food and cheap prices.  We used to drive here from the northwest part of the valley just for the biscuits and gravy.  I don't normally like b&g but the ones from Rainbow are absolutely delectable.  For under $2, before 11am you can order a casino special that includes eggs, hash browns, meat, and b&g or toast.  Now that's an awesome deal!  
My family has been coming here 11 years and we've had nothing but great experiences.  The only food item I have tried that I would not recommend are the pancakes.  They kinda suck.  
All in all, it's a great place that is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I Love This Place. Great Food BIG Portions 
Great Food At A Low Price! 2 Can Eat For Less Then $25  

Never Had An Bad Experience Here.  The Staff Are Usually Nice!"}
{"text":"I have been bringing in my family for 15 plus years because of the great service and food food. Bar is great as long as you see Lucy or the Hispanic younger male bartender, they are both awesome. Stay away from Kevin. Every time I go there he is rude and hates his life. Takes forever to get a drink especially if it's football, he pays more attention to the game. Would be 5 stars plus if it wasn't for him."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST hangover food in Henderson! The menu prices are cheap, the portions generous...and very few tourists to make my head hurt even more! I highly recommend the fried chicken with French toast...."}
{"text":"What a nice LITTLE casino! Was there three nights ago & I must say that it made the Vegas trip complete! I played Caveman Keno on the machines. Won/lost/won. Terrific atmosphere! Restaurant extremely popular/busy! I'd be a regular at this casino  & would travel to go there if I lived in Vegas area! It's like my new Vegas best kept secret! Can't wait to go back & take friends!"}
{"text":"For $2.39 for casino special breakfast 6am-11am, you just can't beat it. Very clean and staff is nice."}
{"text":"3.5 it's just that they don't have half stars. 

So the bf and i arrive at my friends house at about 6:30am hungry. She tells us that she knows a place we can go since all the other places we wanted to go didn't open up for breakfast til about 8 or 9am. 

So we end up going over to the Rainbow Casino for some grub. This place looks like something out of the movie Casino, just smaller and a bit more run down. 

The breakfast special was less than $3.00 which came with 2 eggs, your choice of bacon(2) or sausage(2), hashbrowns, and choice of toast or biscuits and gravy.

I ordered the 2 eggs (scrambled), 2 sausage, hashbrowns, with biscuits and gravy.

The food tasted good and was a pretty decent portion especially for the price (on weekdays the breakfast special is $1.98). The biscuits and gravy were pretty good as well. I knew this because the bf ate all his and he's usually not  big fan of biscuits and gravy. We all ordered the breakfast special, two drinks and a water and the total came out to $10 and some change pretty darn good for 3 people.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here if i was staying on the strip but if i was in or around this area and wanted a decent breakfast, that tasted home-cooked instead of tasting like Dennys. This place is the place to go.

They offer a decent amount of items on there menu and they are pretty cheap. I will be coming back...

And so i did come back, later on that day for dinner with the bf, bff and her husband. 

So for dinner the bf and i ordered the Prime Rib Dinner Special, my bff ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu, and her husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. All the meals come with choice of soup or salad, baked, mashed, or french fried potatoes, and green beans. I of course ordered the soup, which was cheesy potato that night (and it was pretty tasty).

The portions of the proteins on each of our plates were HUGE! The Prime Rib covered at least 75% of our plate and was pretty thick. I couldn't believe the size of that thing for only $7.95. 

The Au Jus and the Horseradish Sauce that it came with complimented the meat very well. The Prime Rib tasted decent for the price and size. I couldn't even eat half of the Prime Rib so i just took  the rest to go. Actually everyone had left overs from there meal that they took home.   

The total came out to $34.00 for two Prime Rib Dinners, Chicken Cordon Bleu, and Chicken Fried Steak Dinner and two drinks. 

The food here is good but the price makes it better. I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This place is great, cheap food which is also pretty good, decent menu, big portions, but the best thing about it is the atmosphere. It's loaded with neon, and penny slots. I love the tacky charm of it all !!"}
{"text":"This is a casual locals place in Henderson. Looks like they have done some remodeling. Food in coffee shop is good with nice size servings. Bad thing, being a non smoker, you come out smelling really bad of cigarette smoke. Other than that. Place is cool."}
{"text":"After breakfast, went to Rainbow Casino to play some slots.  They passed out Bingo cards then announced the #s.  Make a long story short, I hit the Bingo which paid $100.  However, they wouldn't give it to me without getting my SSN.  I walked out.  What a rip off!"}
{"text":"This casino has very good restaurants to choose from. I come to this casino often to eat with my family. The food is very good and tasty!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, there was a wait for the dining room so my friends & I sat at the counter, no wait, friendly server, but not at first. Eventually she opened up to us, I think her name was Tannisha? Not sure, something like that. She was friendly & helped my friend that's super picky find something. My other friend & I got the $8.75 prime rib special, came with a veg, potato, salad and prob 12oz (not sure of exact) prime rib cut. It was prepared to our liking, juicy, delicious, great flavor and they offer creamy horseradish too. The three of is ate for $28, can't beat that, my friends aren't local but I am & I'll def be back considering I can walk there!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Awesome customer service and the food is amazing for a very reasonable cost. It's very busy with local clientele so it's a cozy diner."}
{"text":"Rainbow Room.  Let this yelp review serve as my official breakup notice with you as being a loyal patron. I even would rave about you to others and encourage my friends to try you out despite the fact you have to hold your breath when you enter as there is no air circulation in your establishment.  Those days are now gone and you can thank your restaurant manager Jerry for that.  I am appalled by his lack of customer service and the fact that he said \"if you can't wait well then you shouldn't be here\" after we had already waited over an hour for a table (when we were initially told the wait time would be 25 minutes). Not an apology or a concern to see why we were told ten minutes prior our table was getting cleared off and would be ready in just a moment. He could care less and I guess he thinks we are just six customers that he lost for the night but we are six who will never come back and each can also tell at least six other people who will tell more people and so on. So I think maybe Jerry had this wrong and be is the one who shouldn't be here."}
{"text":"This is a fun little casino.  The staff is awsome, they remember your name and favorite drink. There is a huge bar with penny slots.  The diner has one of the best prime rib dinners I have ever had.  Sad note, the small 2nd bar is no longer staffed.  Bring your out of town friends, they just won't believe that you can get a full dinner for about $7 bucks."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant review. Recently redone and classic Las Vegas with neon, cool booths etc. Food was exceptional and prices are from the 1970's. Most entrees are around $8 and desserts were $3. Great service from nice people. Hot turkey sand was awesome as was the chicken salad. Only downside was to walk through the (still) quite smokey casino to get to the restaurant. Once inside, there is no smoke though. A real treat and a place to take out of town visitors to get a feel of old LV!"}
{"text":"Just went in to the Rainbow club after not being there in a bit.
Who knew they just recarpeted?
It also seems like the overwhelming smoke has been alleviated. 
I will defnitely be dining here more often since the price is excellent, and now the smoke is not as overpowering as it used to be. 
The only downside? They don't keep the restaurant open 24 hours anymore .. BUMMER! 
This used to be the place to go for your middle of the night cravings! 
I only gave 4 stars instead of five for TWO reasons.
a. They don't stay open 24 hours anymore...
b. Our server was totally forgetful. 
The table beside us was sat 20 minutes AFTER us and received their food first.
This is an unusual happening so .. I am only taking away 1 star.
Judge for yourself"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough! I was shocked when I walked into what I was expecting to be a dingy old smokey casino. Boy was I wrong! Nice Casino atmosphere. Very comfortable restaurant with unbelievable prices. Great tasting food. The best value in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I love the casino special with biscuits and gravy. Best breakfast I've had in a while, and awesome prices."}
{"text":"Cute little \"dive\" in a small smokey casino. 
We ordered chicken cordon bleu, chicken soup, potato skins, hot turkey sandwich, and a chocolate milk shake. 
The portions were large and our waitress Julz was very polite and attentive.  
Potato skins $4.75, chicken cordon bleu $7.25, hot turkey sandwich $5.85, and the milk shake $2.65. 
I just wished it wasn't so smokey in that little casino."}
{"text":"I love this place they have great food and good employees and i would die if someone said they hate this place."}
{"text":"On a whim, we found this place. GF and I saw alot of cars parked on Water street, so we said, maybe its the casino and the cafe. 

And low and behold it was...  

I have order about 12 different meals from the menu and only maybe 1 or 2 of them weren't winners or would NOT order again.

I have never been sick, so \"food poisoning\" is never issue or a concern. I am always content, stuffed, full, or need to be rolled out of there from the food coma.

The main reason I go there is for Carol (mother of 3 kids, I think) works graveyard, and we usually have her at the bar counter.  She does tell us \"do order this\", or \"I prefer this one\", and she is right on the money with her choices.

My last meal there was the FLAT IRON STEAK (very very meaty)

+++++++++
The only 2 downfalls are:

It does need a update on furniture or decor, or a interior designer, or like a John Taffer (bar rescue) midas touch

you have to pass through \"some\" smoke filled casino to get there"}
{"text":"I learned about Images from some coworkers and they raved about how great the food and service is here.  I have gone to many of those recommended \"great\" places and have always been somewhat disappointed.  That is not the case here.  I hesitate to write a review because I don't want to let everyone know about this place.  Had the Prime Rib and my family of 6 ordered a variety of items.  We all loved our orders and between the price, quality of food and great service, we couldn't believe it.  We fell in love with everything.  Definitely a hidden Gem in Henderson, NV.  Family of 6 and we walked out paying only $68!!!  That is for drinks, Prime Rib (double cut), Chicken Cordon Bleu, etc... Oh and fantastic milk shakes!!!  Prices are amazing for the amount and quality of food you receive along with fun and attentive service."}
{"text":"Images Restaurant is who I'm writing this review for.
Gotta say I was very disappointed in the food & service.
I ordered a cheese, ham & egg omelet with a side of 5 bacon.
I went after work with two co-workers who were already there. Once I sat down a lady came over & I ordered a water. Then shortly after I asked for a cocktail & was told they would send the cocktail waitress over. Well I waited & waited & no one came. So I asked someone who was walking by for the cocktail waitress. 
Shortly after she came & took my drink order. Then the food came & it was disgusting! They used process cheese slices on top of the omelet & inside it. This cheese was nasty & ruined the omelet so I couldn't eat it. Also the hash browns that came with the meal tasted like they had soaked them in spray butter. I had asked for my bacon to be soggy not crispy & of course it came out crispy. So I told the waitress & she took it away after I asked for soggy bacon again & then I had asked if I could have the 3 side of bacon not 5. She came back with the bacon on a different plate & it kinda looked like the same bacon she first brought. Apparently bacon is not cooked to order here. I told her it wasn't soggy the way I liked it but she left it on the table anyways & there was 6 pieces of bacon not 3 & walked off. 
When it was check time, mind you we never asked for it, she just brought it over she asked me if I wanted  a to-go container because I had barely touched my food & I told her no thanks & told her that I didn't like my food. As anyone who had some common sense could see this since I took like 2 bites of it. Well you would of thought she would of said sorry & taken it off my bill.......NOPE she did neither & I paid for a nasty meal that I refused to eat. Ten thumbs down Images Restaurant & staff!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate at the restaurant at the Rainbow Club. I hope this place stays open forever. It's a part of history. We felt like we had traveled back in time. The place is like nothing I've ever seen before. It is very, very old--and so cool. It's super flashy (in an old-timers way), it's unique, full of character, and originality.

We didn't know what kind of food to expect when we saw the extremely cheap prices on the menu. Most items were in the 5-6 dollar range for dinner! It was exceptional food. I had the Cajun chicken pasta and my husband had wonderful tasting fried chicken. Both meals were way above average food. Huge helpings, sides, and very flavorful and fresh--salad and soup came with the meals. The staff were also friendly. We will be back! You should go if you're looking for great food at a cheap price, and a unique experience."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. Service and prices cannot be beat. I will continue eating here every chance I get until I leave Vegas."}
{"text":"Old school diner called \"Images\". Amazing.... Best keep secret in Henderson on Water St. Found this treasure when I was at Super Run Car Show.  Great service and good American Diner Food. Go back in time and experience this golden nugget."}
{"text":"Great breakfast,  awesome prices.  It's very busy on Sundays,  but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ah, the Rainbow...with its low ceilings, far out decor and stale smoke smell (quite the combination), it is a great greasy spoon that requires a generous amount of febreze.

10:15 PM, returning from a drive out to St. George, Utah-- tired and hungry. Had to stop by the Rainbow as my trip to Henderson is never complete without one.

Cafe was set to close at 11PM, big surprise (new business hours!?).

I ordered the chicken quesadilla that came with guacamole,sour cream and salsa $5 (and some change) along with never ending coffee. Not only was the 'dilla super flavorful but the java was particularly tasty (IMO end of the day coffee tends to taste burnt, in most joints).

Portions are big and prices so low, make it so you want to over tip your server--they are so nice, they deserve it."}
{"text":"This venue is owned by the same folk that own the Peppermill/Fireside down on the Strip. And if you know that going in, you can tell.

The motif is the same, a sort-of 1970s disco-inspired theme. But here it is much more subdued, using light ivory and tans, instead of Peppermill/Fireside's eyeball-busting neon pink & purple. The design at Rainbow is tasteful, in a 'retro' sort of way.

I am entirely immune to gaming, but it was easy to see that this environ was soothing and compelling toward an older, more-experienced local gaming crowd. Also, being so immune, I cannot speak to the looseness of the odds or the strength of the free cocktails. But as far away from the Strip as this place is, it's likely you get a lot of loose and a lot of strong.

I was there instead to sample the specials at the coffee shop / diner. 

I went with the prime-rib deal. I don't remember the exact price but that it was pretty low for what I got. My sides ... and a lot of the other entrees ... seem to fall into the category of 'comfort food.' Again, that's probably a spot-on match to the target customer.

The food was pretty good for the price and the service quality was more than adequate.

It's a bit out-of-the-way, down in old-time Water Street Henderson, but if you are down that way, stop in and grab a burger or such, and get yourself a gander of this particular unique little corner of Vegas."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is no longer great. I can understand raising the prices on breakfast, because it was cheap, but they took away the early bird hours and I can't understand why. They have always been packed in there. The worst part is we went there the other morning and was told it would be a 25 minute wait. Fine. 45 minutes later, we were then told there were 2 other parties in front of us. Fine. After we were seated and ordered and  waited for 15 minutes more, a waitress walked by, tapped our table with her fingertips and said it was going to be an even longer wait. She went on to mention that there are only 2 cooks in the kitchen. That might have been helpful to learn beforehand.  After observing three or four people standing near the register, my husband went to complain. The manager told my husband, \"it's a process\". At that moment my husband had enough.  As we walked out, my husband told the manager, that he felt that was the worst customer service he has ever had.  The manager that told him, \"its a process\" went on to tell him to \"deal with it\"!   This is a horrible way to treat customers of any type. No empathy? No apology?  Nothing but horrible attitudes. If you are not happy with your job, QUIT!   What a shame; we will no longer go there due to the clearly poor customer service. This, hopefully, will shine some light on the need for role playing and training, which is so desperately needed!"}
{"text":"Somehow, these reviews all seem to be about the diner in the rear of the Rainbow Club & Casino (called \"Images\"), so I am going to stick to that.

As others have mentioned, it is a tad smoky in here, but nothing a normal person should object to (manic anti-smokers and persons with respiratory ailments need not apply).

The diner has a quaint, vintage 70's charm to it, and is a charming throwback to that goofy decade.  I found the service friendly, but (again, as others have remarked), their timing could use some improvement.  Seemed to alternate between \"you're my only customer so let's hang out and chat\" and \"where did she go?\"

Prices are excellent, and the food is solid, \"greatest hits\" of the American bistro menu - not tarted up with imagination, but just what you were hoping for when you came in here.  

All in all, a great little find."}
{"text":"I dont mind this place. 
The food is pretty  good. the prices  are wonderful. 
The honey stung chicken  is my favorite. 

The reason  why I'm  only  giving 3 stars is because  the service  each time is just terrible. Between having our food order being taken before we even get asked what we want to drink....bussers and wait staff passing us multiple  times (i made sure we looked thirsty ) .. its so easy to get ignored in here if you arent butt buddies with the waitresses  and eat here every day  of your life.

Their biscuits  and gravy arent what they used to be...they taste like they are ham based now instead  of sausage based....and i dont mean a yummy ham gravy. . ick. 

Like i said, the honey stung chicken  (4pcs for under $7) comes with a veggie  and choice of potato. Crispy skin and juicy deep fried chicken with just a \"sting\" of honey flavor. 

Their french dip, Reuben, and chicken fingers  i also recommend.  The (side) salads here kind of blow....theybdont come with crutons  anymore. 

If you can look past the shitty  service  (that seems to be consistent  server to server unfortunately ) i think youll enjoy  the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been coming here for decades. You won't find a better pound for pound place to eat. And by pound for pound I mean bang for your buck. Good food for a great price. The best biscuits and gravy I have ever had and I love their blue cheese dressing. This is my go to joint and will always hold a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Decent sized protions. Place gets VERY crowded so be prepared  to wait.... the service is SLOW....and I mean S-L-O-W. like ridiculously slow.  It get rather annoying. But... the good is good. Especially breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ok I will admit this may be a slightly biased review.  I used to work here years ago, and this is the place I met my wife.  So I sort of have a personal connection here which I will always hold onto; however after eating at the resturant here for years, I am finally doing a review.  We decided to go here on Saturday night because we wanted inexpensive but good food.  That is exactly what you get here.  For about 6-7 dollars I got a double bacon cheesburger with fries and ranch.  The cheeseburger was perfect, seriously.  It was huge, cooked exactly as I wanted it.  The fries are really thick and delicious, and the ranch was AMAZING!!!!  They have really good specials like prime rib on certain nights.  Service was pretty good, we never had to wait for any drinks or anything.  They also re-designed everything in the casino and the resturant so it looks much nicer than it did several years ago.  It's definetly a hometown favorite sort of place.  Even when I worked there, the place was constantly filled with 'regulars', where you know there name and what they want before they even sit down.  If I had to complain about anything it would be the same as it always has been, the place is smoky from the casino and you leave with a distinct smoke smell on your clothing.  The roof is low, not like the new large Vegas casinos.  This is old style, so that's the major reason why it's smoky.  Other than that the food is great, I love the nachos, the green chile burrito, the burgers, steaks, everything...and it's all pretty cheap."}
{"text":"I am reviewing their coffee shop which is a fabulous value! Everything on the menu is very reasonably priced, and you get a generous serving. My mother loves their liver and onions (yeah, I know ... Its a generational thing), and I am partial to their massive breakfasts. Their omelets are fabulous and chock full of whatever goodies you order.  Service can be a little abrupt, but keep in mind these waitresses have been around the block a few times and don't have the time or energy to play nicey nice with everyone.  Don't expect an elegant dining experience, but do expect some good chow in a nice little restaurant in a cute little casino in the charming little village of Henderson, NV.  CHECK IT OUT!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars primarily because the prices are very reasonable. It's located in a small neighborhood casino and if the cigarette smoke doesn't kill you when you stroll in, I doubt the food will either, but it is just not very good! The portions are decent and possibly we caught them on an \"off night\"  but we won't be back to give them another opportunity. There are just too many really good places to eat in the Las Vegas /Henderson area. 
I ordered the New York steak with a baked potato, salad with ranch dressing. The steak was 12 ounces but very tough and not flavorful. The potato was way overcooked yet not very warm. The lettuce in the salad wilted and dry. Even the green beans were cold. Just not good grub, plain and simple, even for $10.....the old saying that you get what you paid for probably applies here. Gomer ordered the chicken fried steak and was very disappointed when he realized that the mash potatoes were the instant variety rather than homemade. 
Granted some of the dishes that other folks were eating at the tables in our vicinity looked pretty good, our meals were just plain poor to midland!"}
{"text":"This old time casino located in the heart of Henderson. Although run down and very old, this property is or was owned by the Peppermill company so there is that signature neon light running throughout the inside. I wouldn't make a trip here necessarily but it is definitely something to see, as someday with all things in Vegas it will be gone!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant Images. The only restaurant inside the tiny Rainbow Club Casino on Water Street, cheap and tasty diner food is their speciality. They serve breakfast and lunch all day and dinner starts at 3. I was in the mood for something sweet, so I ordered the strawberry waffle and a side of bacon. The waffle was as big as my plate and came topped with whipped cream and strawberries. My bf got the chicken fried steak, which comes with eggs, hash browns or fries, and toast or biscuit and gravy. Our friend got the NY steak sandwich with fries. Everything is under $10 and the portions are big, so come hungry! We all left full. I don't hang out in Henderson often, but I made a special trip down there just to eat breakfast, so that has to say something!"}
{"text":"Great food! We love coming here for their prime rib. Always cooked just right and we've never had a complaint about the food. The service on the other hand...I understand being busy. But to COMPLETELY ignore your patrons? To the point we were LOOKING for them to refill our drinks? Then when we finally get someone to notice us they send the GROUCHIEST busser ever to walk the planet who then proceeds to spill drinks all over the table without a care. what the heck guys?! I guess they make up for their great food at good prices with crappy service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, i have yet to tried something on this menu that isnt good! The prices are great too. Prime rib is my favorite item on the menu! Tuesdays they have a prime rib special. Im never unsatisfied, and always leave full. The strawberry waffles are the most delicious things on earth...."}
{"text":"Great specials good food....homemade soup is so yummy great place to bring family great prices"}
{"text":"For an old Vegas feel and a meal made to feed you like a king, this is one place that I highly recommend. The food quality and portioning is fantastic! I always tell my friends to get to this joint for breakfast when they come to town and get wasted on the Vegas Strip (after sleeping it off in their hotels) because there is nothing like a big breakfast to make you feel human again. I should also say that this is located south of Vegas in Henderson, but it is well worth the jaunt.  

There are so many things on the menu that I really can't narrow it down to one that you must absolutely have, but if you're coming for dinner, I would highly suggest the prime rib. This is the stuff of legends and is known all over town for it, trust me. Matter of fact, this was what sold me on trying the Rainbow in the first place. The prices will have you reeling because you will not believe how cheap it is to eat so much food. 

They have an awesome high definition tv system with world wonders always playing and it is their \"art\" which is cool. You will have to deal with smoke-smell because it is allowed in the casino. The waitstaff are very good -- they deal with the nicest people to the worst drunkards all day, everyday. The absolute only thing that I'm hitting them on is their hours. They are not 24/7, which is a darn shame. Otherwise, please spend your money here and tell your friends!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for YEARS! The biscuits and gravy and all their soups are delicious. Another favorite is the prime rib special! Everyone loves the \"bow\". Tony, the day manager is a great guy as well."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food, huge portions , cheap prices , and terrific service you can't beat it!  Breakfast special is the bomb!  However the sandwiches and prime rib are excellent too!!!!  One of my favorite places to take the family!"}
{"text":"Always good and very reasonable prices. Very friendly place for the locals . It does not matter if you come for breakfast, lunch or dinner the food is awesome . 

We love this place , great location for sure."}
{"text":"Saturday special prime rip was amazing.  The club was amazing. The wings were amazing. All of our meals were great. $44 for 6people"}
{"text":"I hit a big jackpot here! they gave me a cool gold coin as a souvenir which was neat."}
{"text":"So you want a dive? I got you a dive. 

Welcome to the Rainbow Club & Casino, home of stale smoke and cheap eats. 

If you're on a budget than this is the place to go. Almost every machine in the joint has a $.01 option - poker and slots. Make $5 last an hour. 

More importantly the food at Images (their restaurant) is outstanding. Might I recommend the Chicken Fingers and/or Golden Fried Shrimp? Not your thing, then go with the Fettuccine Alfredo or the Chili Omelet. Honestly, I've eaten at this joint probably 100 times and I've never had a bad meal. Two people can get out of there with beverages and a tip for $20 or less. Not sure what they do to make them so good, but the Chicken Fingers are the best I've ever had. Also, take advantage of the cool sights from around the world while sitting in the only smoke-free environment in the place. They have large flat screen TV's showing 10-20 second clips from different parts of the world (not just in the restaurant, but in the casino too). So in case you crap-out gambling you can grab a seat at a vacant machine and scope out where you want to take your next vacation (when you win your money back). 

Just make sure to save a few bucks for some dry cleaning if you're heading to the Rainbow Club from out of town. The smoke stank on your clothes is as strong as Aunt Betsy's perfume."}
{"text":"Even as an Army Retired at 28 years old on March 2013 due to being wounded in Iraq not once but twice and also working for Washinton Traffic Patrol all I can say is:


-If you want to make your time and every dollor you spent is worth it, so go to Rainbow Club Casino and try out there Prim Rib, Steak, Shrimp and much more.
My favorite is Steak and Rib eye and I usually go to Outback Steakhouse but OMG since I tried the Steak and Rib Eye here at Rainbow back in October 2016 I always come here and it's been like 6-9 times a month when I'm around the area. It was so delicious and the price is just unbelievable.

-No other place that I know that beats there price and the price for there Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner is just unbelievable and its worth spending every penny there.

-Every week they have specials and price is just crazy.

-There are times you'll have to wait but I promise you it's worth every second during your wait. So it doesn't hurt to try it out your self and if you love there food and the price is resonable and you like the workers customer service then by all means Please post up your review.

-It's  a very nice modern bar, decent floor service and very clean but most of all every time I come across a waitress, waiter, Supervisor and most especially the Manager I just love there customer service and I gave all of them big respect.

-Most importantly It be your lost but hey that means more food for me and I can continue saving money for the Machines....lmao...PLEASE POST UP YOUR REVIEW AND SPREAD THE WORD AROUND and hopefully I get more food when I go there again.....not...lol...

{"text":"This is an absolute deal, a huge breakfast like the Peppermill with small prices. This is our favorite place to go when were in that area. The food is very good and you just cant beat the prices."}
{"text":"If you've been in Vegas more than 5 years, and DON'T know about The Rainbow in old school Henderson and their awesome cheap food and drinks- well we just can't be friends. Or you can go now, get full and drunk for $20 or less, and then write me and thank me. 
My first trip here was WAAAAYYY back in my teenage years when I worked at In-N-Out Burger. We would get off work at 2am, and go enjoy a $1 breakfast. Meat, hashbrowns, eggs, and toast or biscuits and gravy. Since then the price has raised a bit, but not much. I can still get the same deal for about $3 and I think $4 on the weekends. 
Also, their lunch and dinner is beyond decent for the price. Basic diner/café style grub, good quality and super cheap prices. 
The same staff has worked there for years. A double bloody mary cost $6. It is just a delicious, low cost, locals spot. I feel comfortable showing up in my sweats, or a cocktail dress.
If you go on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait, but the breakfast bar is almost always available for small parties. The casino is a bit smoky, but not as bad as some small Vegas casinos. The actual diner is called Images, and that is for sure a change made within the last year. 
I am glad there is still a place where I can feed my family at a sit down restaurant for $40. That is very rare these days, so I will enjoy it while I can!"}
{"text":"Not to swank of a place but they do have good food for cheap prices. In hendertucky off water street there is not much to choose from food wise. The rainbow club  is kind of lack luster but it will do if you're on a tight budget. Check out the menu because each day of the week has a special. Because of the low prices you do have to wait a while."}
{"text":"Nice locals spot.  Be prepared to wait but it's worth it.  Food is great and cheap.  Menu is normal diner food.  Portions are huge.  I love the chicken fried steak breakfast.  Service could be better but they are usually busy and food and prices make up for it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars for the poor service. They made us wait an hour for a table and said the table will be ready in 10 minutes at least 2 times. When talking to manager they said if you can't wait you shouldn't be here. Not a good practice for business and I will make sure not to let anyone ever eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"very clean
great food
great service
parking limited
thanks for the great night"}
{"text":"Your food is amazing the customer service is amazing, I am giving you a bad review because you took people's jobs. You took the breakfast menu away really. I don't think I'll ever be back at the rainbow and I've been eating there for I don't know 13 years."}
{"text":"What is it with the bad reviews about service there and a manager with an attitude ? Now I see why the sign on the doors says to leave certain items in your car.  So I tried the place , and ya know what ? They were right. The service wasn't that great.  And yes,  I did feel an attitude .  But in all fairness to the cooks , my chicken fried steak was pretty good. Aside from the fake instant mashed potatoes , I would recommend that item. But I was starving and my friends suggested I order more to eat.  Being bashful I said no, but they insisted & they ordered me a cheese burger. Cool . Then the manager (?) buss boy or something came over and asked if there was a problem. ????  I guess you can't eat more than one meal per person ?  So I'm new here and I guess that's how they do things in this place.  So we said forget the burger. I don't know if it was the waitress or rainbow boy , but I never saw a business refuse to let a customer eat more , thus spend more money. But I guess that's how these people do things in Henderson. Or maybe only at the Rainbow Boy Club ?  But the waitress with her tattoos covered up because they said she had too, was.a way  cool waitress .   Our other waitress was mad at us I think . Maybe it was because they didn't have enough wait staff and they had to run their butts off. I don't know. And yes I did leave a tip. I always tip.    But I'd  much rather eat just north of here on Boulder Highway at the way awesome Jokers Wild Casino ."}
{"text":"I ate here Sep 7 2015.  I had the Cajun Chicken Salad.  It was very good.  The salad had lots of cheese.  Very good chicken was on top lots of the cheese melted on the chicken this was extra yummy.  The service in this restaurant is always very good."}
{"text":"The food was very good and so was the service. We waited a long time to get sat as we watched a lot of other people go ahead of us. Don't think I will be back because of the smoke . I've been in a lot of casinos and this is by far the worst for smoke I have seen."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this lower...Took my family here on recommendation that it was almost as good as the parent company Peppermill on the strip...The casino lacks in EVERY respect, machines and no ventilation whatsoever...I know it's a smoking environment but breathing would be nice. We were told it would be a 20 to 25 minute wait...ok get it, but as people would check in, some would stay...some would not. The Diamond check in was used for 2 couples and the rest waited...most of us... I usually never post negative reviews, but I hate rude and after the third customers were shuffled in ahead of us, after asking how long the wait was... enough for us. After cancelling our table I told these people it was rude, They were snippy and could care less."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday breakfast. Left there STUFFED, and still had money in my pocket. Food is really good and only costs a couple of bucks. Had a denver omelette and biscuits & gravy. NO complaints. There was like 10 of us and we all got our food served at the same time. Breakfast ends at 11AM and you can expect a 1/2 hour or more wait. I love the sign on the door about loaded weapons not being allowed inside."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for over 35 years. Since management cut hours and laid off employees, we have haven't had a decent meal the last 4 times we have been in. Found two new local casinos to gamble and eat in. Farewell Rainbow, it was a long run."}
{"text":"Prime rib. Exellent. Casino better than most as far as pay out and drinks. My new place Club fortune is more expensive,  less,attentive and video poker machines don't pay at all"}
{"text":"***Update 3/13/11***
Last night we were trying to figure out somewhere to go for a quick dinner that would not be too far from the house. I suggested this place since we did not eat in the Diner the previous time. We got seated after about 5 minutes and opened what is a gold mine of a menu. They have anything from burgers to pasta, breakfast and prime rib. Every thing on the menu is way under priced which being the cheap skate I am works out well.

We all got the broccoli and cheese soup that came with every meal, and pretty much ate it in one minute it was so good. I got the Chicken Parmesan that was delicious and came with garlic bread. The ladies got chicken tenders with a baked potato and both were very good since I ate half of their meals as well.

The waitress was very nice and the atmosphere is casual and bright due to the neon theme.

I feel bad that I just found this place after nine months in Vegas, and will try and hit this place up on a regular.

Valentines 2/14/11

On our drive back to our place at Lake Las Vegas, saw a sign for Eldorado Casino next right. Thought we should check out something new, and took the right turn to find downtown historic Henderson which I have been wanting to see for awhile. One small street with three dinky casinos on it and of course this one strikes your eye with the bright rainbow lights.

Not much to see in here other than it is decorated like the Pepper Mill on the strip. Cheap beer but pretty smokey due to it's size."}
{"text":"0 stars if I could. The atmosphere is terrible I feel like I am going to get lung cancer the second I walk in. The main problem I had was at the mess up on my order and then they charge me extra for messing up on my order I will never come back and I would strongly suggest avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Been bringing my little one here since birth. She's now seven still love this place. Always will come here for breakfast for a long time..."}
{"text":"I forgot to mention on my review about the casino side of this place. This is me and my twin's ABSOLUTE favorite place to gamble in the WHOLE entire world. We play the 20 card Keno slots and we stay here for hours and hours kicking it. One thing about the small casinos is the waitress comes around all the time. IT's AWESOME. The Casino staff are absolutely wonderful.....Lynda, Anthony, Anthony (not a typo....they're 2 Anthony's) and Chris are so friendly and helpful! There is no other place that comes close to my heart as this little gem in the desert. :)"}
{"text":"Go for the food not for the exceptional service! Sometimes the food is so good and inexpensive that you can put up with almost anything, this is one of those times. Steak & eggs with biscuits an gravy for $6 a side of 4 biscuits and gravy for $1.75 They have a breakfast skillet for $5.75 that I wouldn't recommend unless onions happen to be your favorite thing in the universe but, if you don't like what you order they will get you something new and not even hesitate. My new favorite place on water street."}
{"text":"Really great prices, I'm SO glad I stumbled on this hidden gem with my bf. We came in at 2:30 and found the casino kind of packed!! We were lucky enough to get parking in the front but I think I saw a structure in the back. The restaurant had a shift change at 2:45 PM and we were greeted by a server and asked if we could order the prime rib thick cut ($12) and the rib eye special on Sundays ($8.95). She told us that the kitchen staff would be coming in at 2:45 so we could order it then. 

2:45 comes along and we were greeted by our new server who was super nice. Poor server had about 10 tables and was running around like crazy. She still got us everything we asked for... ketchup, horseradish, and steak sauce, and coffee refills. It was nice to see the manager helping out by picking up tables. There were a few regulars that sat at the counter top and chatted with the chefs in the back. 

We ordered at 2:45 and both got beef barley soup which was not good. It was way too salty for me. My bf said it was salty too, but ate it anyway. Our server asked me if I wanted something else but I was fine. 

Prime rib and ribeye was also very salty. Next time I come back, I'll ask for NO SALT and add my own. The chef today had a very heavy hand.. salt in everything we ate! Green beans that came with the food were canned I believe because they were soggy and salty... My fries were great. The bf got mashed potatoes but didn't enjoy the gravy because it wasn't very flavorful. I tried it and it was fine. 

We got both meats medium and because my prime rib was super thick, it was more medium rare. I'll ask for medium well next time. The prime rib was soft, and not very fatty. The rib eye was very very thin but was soft and juicy. 

So remember, if you want something off the dinner menu, come in at 3 PM. AVOID COMING IN AT 2:30-2:45!!! You'll get meh service because day shift is itching to leave, also you can't order off the dinner menu anyway. 

I saw AMAZING deals (pictures are posted). I wouldn't say the food here is 5/5, but the price and portions are great."}
{"text":"Cheapest breakest for the best price in town ! Took my folks ,they got the 1.98 breakfast special with 2 eggs,2 bacon, hashbrowns and killer biscuits and gravy which was on point.I got the breakfast skillet which was the size of the plate, which came with biscuits and gravy too for 5 bucks,staff was great and all was there for the coffee refills,btw the coffee was a buck.over all great find and has a sense of old school Vegas cafe."}
{"text":"They have always had excellent food.  Prices are reasonable and the staff is professional.  Peppermill properties has good choices.  Love their Denver omelette."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 favorite casino's off the strip.  You'll find loose slots here (especially at the bar) and most of the staff are quite friendly.  The place overall has that \"old school\" vibe with a loyal \"senior\" fan base.  For the price, \"Image's\" prime rib can't be beat (if you like it rare, I suggest going early as they sometimes run out).  If they had table games, I'd rate it 5 stars."}
{"text":"While vacationing in LV, my cousin, who lives in Henderson, suggested we meet here for dinner.  I ordered the 12 oz strip steak.  It was cooked to perfection, served with salad, baked potato and a veg for $10!  What a deal!! Dinner for 3 people was only $32 and change!"}
{"text":"Went to the Super Run car show and my husband and I got hungry and decided to try and indoor setting for lunch instead of the food stands at the show.  Our server Ashley couldn't be nicer and we were brought refills on our beverages without even asking.  The burgers were excellent and they came with salad or soup plus fries or other sides like cole slaw or potato salad.   The fries were great.  The prices were very reasonable as well!  It was very crowded but everyone seemed happy and we definitely plan to return, maybe for breakfast next time.   
There are many restaurants in the area that could learn a lot from this place!!  Coming from the east coast, we were impressed that the décor was very similar to the Jersey diners we miss!!  Good job!!!  :-)"}
{"text":"Very bad service at the Restaurant seem like they call friends vs people who have signed in will never come back and give my money to this place, you know you have bad service and waiting over 1 1/2hrs, when the Bartender keeps asking \"you still haven't been called\" not cool bad service"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite restaurant but it's a shame the prices went up and the quality went down"}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant!

You can some of the best biscuits and gravy around!!!  There is almost always a wait for breakfast and you will soon find out why. 

Some of the breakfast specials are the biscuits and gravy special for, wait for it, $1.89!!!  That's not a typo!  This deal also includes your choice of meat and an order of eggs. 

I usually get that but splurged on the NY steak eggs for $6.95. Amazing deal and great quality."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Me and the family were leaving Boulder City area heading back to Cali. Before we head home we were searching for a really good Prime Rib and boy did we find it. Luckily for us the Prime Rib special is on Tuesday starting at 3pm. We arrived exactly 15 mins prior. We were seated in the newly renovated restaurant, which was quite nice. The Prime Rib meal comes with soup or salad, choice of either Potato (baked or mashed), cole slaw, fries. I ordered mine medium rare with a baked potato. My Prime Rib came out perfect, pink and juicy. I definitely recommend this place, drive is worth if you're in the area. You can't beat a meal like this for $9.99."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast $1.99 special with eggs, bacon, hash browns and biscuits & gravy $1.50 more for coffee. Sat at counter for quick service. The cafe is always busy due to reasonable prices and good food. It's a hidden gem in downtown Henderson."}
{"text":"The Rainbow is very dive-casino.  But it has wonderfully endearing quality about it.  They have great breakfast specials served anytime and the casino is clean.  It does have a smokey atmosphere- but if you go late at night, it has aired out. 
They have daily beer specials that fit any budget.  
Check it out while you are in downtown Henderson."}
{"text":"Friends of mine have been talking about this place and their low prices so I had to check it out. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner menus that are available all day. They have egg specials that are under $2 during the week and just over $2 on the weekend. It's located right next to the Eldorado on water st and parking can be tight but there are lots up and down the block. Expect a wait on the weekend. Ours wait time was 30 mins on a Saturday before Easter, not bad at all.
I had the ham and cheese omelet with hash browns( or you can get fries) and biscuits and gravy( or toast) all for under $7. Decent breakfast for sure and the biscuits and gravy were incredible. I will come back just for them and to try the rest of the menu. Check this place out if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"To give Images less than 4 stars, one would have to hate their life in it's entirety! Either that or every staff person was simultaneously having a bad day! 

We were in Henderson for 7 days, staying at a resort property. We'd ventured to Las Vegas, of course, and had several meals (including the highly rated buffets). This meal, by far, was our favorite! My only reason for it not receiving 5 stars is because their skill level of cooking eggs....suck! As a culinary artist, when one masters the egg, you master the art form! 
I ordered eggs over easy and was not able to finish them. Raw. 
My sister ordered an omelet. The flavor was great! However, the eggs were over cooked. I didn't bother to taste the eggs of the other two that were at our table. I'm sure it was much of the same. 
In any event....

The rest of the cuisine was stellar! I had the 12oz steak and eggs (which included hash browns or fries and toast or biscuits and gravy!). DUDE! Go for the biscuits and gravy! That ish right there!!!!!  Fantastic!
Then there was the French toast! Simply put, the French would be envious! 
The bone in ham and eggs was my least fav. But of course I'm not a big fan of ham. The salt content was much. 
And the omelet, while tasty, was a slight overlooked. Still, they must have used a dozen eggs for that thing. Massive!
Our entire breakfast....$32 
That included more biscuits and gravy, a 5 piece side of bacon, wheat toast and bacon & eggs w/ that French toast. And of course, hash browns all around. 
Just check out the pics...then make this a destination! Totally worth a drive!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my dad here the other night and (possibly aided by my significant hunger) came away pleased. The restaurant was clean with a surprisingly sleek decor. Peppered throughout the dining area were these paired flatscreens that displayed a rotation of neat panoramic images that I really liked. Despite being fairly busy (it was around 5 pm) the service was fair enough. 

The house salad was a pretty lackluster jumble of the bagged variety (par for the course as far as casinos go) but this one didn't even have onions, carrots, or a tomato sparsely sprinkled about. I ordered the southern fried steak which came with a baked potato and \"vegetables\". Like I said before I was pretty hungry but the meal ended up being surprisingly good. The potato was a little dry but not enough to fuss over and I added some of my dads horseradish (he had the prime rib) to give it some flavor. I recommend getting the straight horseradish instead of the creamy stuff for that little extra kick. The \"vegetables\" turned out to be some bland green beans but some salt and pepper helped them trend towards mediocrity. The steak was a good portion and the breading wasn't super heavy. Also, they didn't drown the entire plate in gravy which I prefer. 

Maybe my experience was elevated by my company (and our hunger) but I can safely say I enjoyed my experience at the Rainbow Club."}
{"text":"Sadly I must report that while I have been here on numerous occasions, this restaurant only serves DEAD FOOD. You say what do you mean by \"dead food\"? This means that quite literally nothing on the menu has any nutritional value. Let's start with salad lettuce that is comprised solely of iceberg lettuce with zero health benefit. Now lets move on to any and all vegetables served here, being straight from the can. Folks this is 2016, get with the program and serve proper 'live food', such as fresh veggies and green leaf lettuce. I'm not the silver spoon type but this is not 1970 any longer, and TV dinner quality veggies are just NOT acceptable! How about a real fresh fruit plate added to the menu? Or how about fresh fruit cup as an option instead of potatoes? Speaking of potatoes, do you guys think that potatoes are and should be a human beings sole food source? Your plates of them fried, grilled and every other way surely speak to this! Your chefs definitely know where to find the french fries, hash browns and mashed potatoes. The portions are nicely sized here, but the food itself is nothing above greasy spoon diner in taste and quality. The soups can be the highlight here when not ruined by too much salt; sadly caused usually by chain smoking chefs who no longer have taste buds. Even if you guys offered a few healthy options; such as salads with real lettuce (romaine, spring mix, etc.), your customers might stop dishing you this way. I totally understand what your clientele consists of here, but you should be thinking about their well being too. Serving overly greased, fatty foods with high sodium cause more problems than you think. If you keep poisoning your customers with unhealthy foods, then you might not have any customers left. Raise your standards please, and be sure to visit the Emerald Isle Casino to compare the low quality of your food to their very high standard of quality. While they charge a little bit more, it's worth it in every way! That's not just my opinion, it's true fact. I just call it like I see it folks..."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever!!!! This place gives Peppermill a bad name if your waitress has a runny green boogie nose send her HOME!!!!!
We watched her wipe her nose with her hands wipe it on her shirt and serve my brother a drink at that moment we got up and left!!!!! Yelp should have a negative star review"}
{"text":"This sort of coffee shop (it was once a Peppermill and employee name tags still say Peppermill) used to be plentiful in Las Vegas and Henderson. What I mean by that is really cheap (like unbelievably so) good quality food with rotating daily specials. Now I can't think of another one, at least not one I consider any good. You can easily feed a family of 4 steaks, chicken, chili whatever a good meal for under 35.00 here. 
This isn't fine dining just above average tasty fare sold at dirt cheap prices!"}
{"text":"Man, am I glad Vegas doesn't look like this anymore. The casino is dark, smoky, and harshly decorated. The restaurant is so cramped you could eat off the table next to you comfortably. So why four stars? BREAKFAST. Holy crapoly, this place has the cheapest and most delicious breakfast. $6 for an omelet, toast, and hashbrowns? $5 for a skillet? $3 for an egg and a bowl of oatmeal? For. Sure. 

It always takes forever to be seated because the restaurant is so tiny and there are tons of families waiting to eat, but it is worth the wait, with good service to boot. I actually feel bad for all the families trying to wait since there is nowhere kid-friendly to wait except for two tiny benches. Regardless, it is a nice spot for breakfast in downtown Henderson."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  Breakfast is usually pretty good.  How can you screw up bacon, eggs and hash browns.  Dinner is a different story.  I was there Friday night and ordered the T-Bone steak special.  Won't do that again.  The dinner came in a decent amount of time and that was the good part.  I started to dig in when I realized as I kept cutting that \"Where's the beef\".  Chunks and chunks of fat, one piece was about 1/5 the size of the entire steak.  I ate what meat I could find.  Once I was done I put the bone and fat back together.  It looked like almost a whole steak.  The waitress came by and said \"You didn't eat much, would like a box for that?\"  I told her it was all fat.  She just grabbed my plate and walked away.  My wife had the prime rib which she said was pretty good.  When we where checking out to pay, the girl at the register asked how everything was and I told her my wives was fine, mine was bad.  She spoke not another word.  Just handed me my change.  They must become numb to people complaining about the food.  If they had to spend time to apologize for every complaint they would never get anything done.  

If you go there to gamble, keep you expectations low, low, low.  I was born and raised in Henderson and like to gamble now and then.  This place in the 30 years I have been going there for breakfast, I can count on one hand the amount of time I have won anything.  I expect to lose most of the time when I gamble but to win something now and then would be nice.  I have a couple Megamillion Lotto tickets in my wallet right now.  I have the same expectation of winning on those as I do when I put my money in a machine at the Rainbow Club."}
{"text":"Terrible service at this place. We went and it wasn't full there was open tables. The guy is making a list of names and says 10-15 minutes. They end up skipping over us with 4 sets of people because they started a new page and forgot to finish the first page. We should have left then, but we stayed and ate. 2 of us had the prime rib and ended up getting food poisoning from it. The others in our part didn't get sick and 2 of that did ate the exact same meal. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience of my life on July/12 /2015. Came in with my girlfriend to eat here. I been there serval times and had good service, but that day was the worst experience i had dinning in. I typically don't write a lot reviews but i have to tell you guys my experience.  I came in with significant other  and there was a long waiting list typical for any place for Sunday breakfast. Was seated down at dirty table With dirty silverware with pieces of food stuck to my fork and knife. I ordered my bervage and food then asked the waitress if can be seated with proper silveware and clean table. Then the bussesr came and picked up the silverware and said \"I will clean it for you\" and used her tongue  and went straight back into the kitchen. I was disgusted  and we left and went to tell who ever was in charge.
The assent manger was no help at all and didn't apologize and said that the busser was costumer favorite. we were so outraged and left. The whole experience was awful and I am never setting my foot in the place again. How can people be treated like this."}
{"text":"We always stop here to eat when we are visiting!! Big portions and cheap food with friendly service! Watch your times cuz they very busy - go early to get your name on list ;)"}
{"text":"Great food for CHEAP! the only down falls are the heavy smoke from the casino and the wait times are usually long. But if you want good food for cheap...like biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs, bacon and hash brows for less than $2 then its worth the wait and smoke."}
{"text":"Images is the restaurant inside of the Rainbow Room.  It's located on the west wall depending on where you enter the casino.  Not sure why the reviews on this place are so low; yes, people smoke inside this casino, just like all casinos, but not in the restaurant, so get over it.  It's dark too, so bring a flashlight...kidding.

I've written many reviews on many great restaurants...hidden gems in Henderson/Vegas and Images is one of them.  In fact it may be better than any other bar/casino restaurant I've reviewed due to one fact: the price.  The average bill for two persons will be somewhere between $17 - $25.  It is impossible to beat this price anywhere when you add food quality in.  The food is fabulous: breakfast, lunch, dinner, you can't go wrong.  Large plates, you will be taking leftovers home and this is awesome.

This is my new haunt because of one thing: the SAUCE.  If you order bisquits and gravy, cordon blue, etc., there is a sauce they put on top of your order that can be described only by one word: HEAVEN.  You will dream of it at night.  You will want it again and again and again.  If you want to try it to make sure you like it, order a side of it and dip some fries or vegi's in it.  Amazing!

The staff is super courteous and helpful.  You can tell they know the locals and they treat everyone great.  Food delivery is quick, however this place can be busy with a line out the door, so come with patience if it's super busy.  It's worth the wait so play a game or something.

The casino is fun and you can actually win money here, unlike the Las Vegas Strip, which may pay for your dinner... a win, win.  Parking is outside along the street, there is a large parking garage in back but never parked there.

Water Street is a pretty cool place all in all.  A fun day trip to try out something new!

Enjoy and don't forget to order the SAUCE!!!!!!  YOU WILL THANK ME"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years! Introduced by a friend of mine over 20 years ago for their awesome breakfast special and the best tasting biscuits and gravy ever! 

I haven't been in years and recently paid a visit. The biscuits and gravy aren't nearly as good as I remembered them from the years ago I last tried, so that was a little disappointing. Perhaps it was a bad day and I will give it one more shot because they used to be amazing.

The casino itself is very cozy and nice. I've never gambled here. Only come for the restaurant and sometimes a drink here and there."}
{"text":"This place is old, stale, and just a little bit scary. All casinos are dark inside but this one seems to take the cake. Years and years of smoke permeate the carpet and there is no escape. The restaurant leaves much to be desired and I have to elaborate on this. The first time I came into the restaurant was insisted by some relatives of ours. I was a little skeptical to see a full salmon fillet for only $7 but against my better judgement, I tried it. When it came out it reeked. It was in no way fresh and I could tell it was going bad. I took one bite and spit it back out, the taste was horrendous. The salad that they brought out to me was wilting. The sprite was good! But that was it. My husband ordered the ribs, and for a few days after eating there he was very sick. 

Our relatives LOVE this place for the price. I just cant see how it's worth it. The second time they invited us out, I found something on the menu that was actually very good. The cajun chicken pasta is incredible. 

My father always joked about how if you lower your standards, you will be happier. That may be true for this joint."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast last week while my car was being serviced nearby.  Was surprised that there were many people waiting but was seated in about 15 minutes.  

I looked at the menu and assumed it was wrong.  How could sausage, eggs, hashbrown along with biscuits and gravy be only $1.99?  Well, everything was not only great but the biscuits and gravy were about the best I've ever had.  And a $1.50 for coffee really topped everything off.

Returning tonight for prime rib or steak.  How can they do it for $10?  I'll find out in a few hours.

Yes, it's old.  Yes the ceilings are low.  Yes the casino is smoky.  But yes, it's great food at an amazing price."}
{"text":"Long wait for service, told it would be a 10 min wait it was over 20 min before we got seated! The service has gone way down over the years! Poor customer service! Food is not hot! Served Luke warm. Who eats biscuits and gravy Luke warm? Get it together Rainbow! Your losing customers to the Eldorado!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I rolled in a 10 pm last night after watch World War Z.  Nothing sets me in the mood for a steak like a zombie film.

For $9.75 we got a 14 oz steak, green beans, heap of fries, and a salad at the images café in Rainbow Club.  Very tasty and cannot beat the price.

We just made it, but this is a great place to get a decent meal at a great price.

Had I paid $30 for the steak, it would have been disappointing, but you get a great value at the $10 price point.

The restaurant also has an old Vegas feel to me and the wait staff was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Hands down, best diner food. Cheap good food, the waiter and waitresses are always extremely friendly. Forget Denny's or ihop, this places beats them every time!"}
{"text":"WOW amazing good deals. PRIME RIB DINNER ONLY $10.00 AND breakfast for only $2.00. This restaurant is a must have. I love the neon raninbow filled carpet and lighting.  YOU HAVE TO GO HERE YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.

Staying in Henderson, my girlfriend and I were looking for a quick bite. We stumbled upon the cafe here and decided to check it out. It felt like a classic diner, and when we opened the menus we were surprised at how cheap everything was.

Coming from Vegas where our entrees were $15+, there was barely anything over $10 on this. We ended up ordering their ribeye steak for about $8. Best meal for my wallet and stomach by far. Came with soup or salad and your choice of potato. 

Exceptional, friendly service throughout our visit. Couldn't have picked a better dinner to end our trip."}
{"text":"My brother in law lives right around the corner from here, so everytime we visit we come for the $1.99 breakfast. Well, i dont cause i hate eggs. I usually just get a side of hashbrowns. Everyone loves this place, and they make a GREAT bloody mary, not from mix, the bartenders own recipe. 

Stay away from the nachos though. Covered in some really strange bland  raincoat-colored plastic cheese."}
{"text":"This is a nice little casino. If your a video poker player, they have many 99% return games. They also have a very good cafe (more about the cafe, later in my review). Unlike many small casinos in Henderson, this casino looks new, modern, and inviting inside. They also seem to have installed a pretty good ventilation system, which does a good job in reducing a lot of the cigarette smoke. Now don't get me wrong, you can still smell the smoke occasionally (like all casinos), but it is not a lingering thick toxic cloud that suffocates you (like the Henderson Jokers Wild casino, and  the Skyline casino). I only have two complaints. First, the cafe is frequently crowded and there usually is a waiting list. But, I can't really fault them for that, because the waiting line is due to the fact the cafe serves very good food at really cheap prices (I recently had the prime rib dinner and it was great for cafe food, in which you can get the regular cut for $10 and the large cut for only $12...and shockingly, when you order the prime rib medium rare, they actually serve it that way...unlike most casino cafes, which serve everything medium to well done, no matter what you ask for). The second complaint I have is their rewards program. If you want to redeem your points for cash, or a store gift certificate, the redemption rate equates to about 1/100 of percent of total dollars wagered (most other casinos offer at least 1/10 of percent, or more). However, Rainbow does offer multiple points days (as most casinos do), so if you gamble on those days, you can get a competitive redemption rate. The other issue with their rewards program is, they only allow you to redeem your points for cash a few times a year, and only if your a higher level card member. Finally, unlike most casinos, Rainbow does not send you free play/cash in their monthly mailers (I am at their second highest card member  level, and I have never received any offers for free play or cash). But overall, this is a very good local casino, and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Well I thought i would try this place
For breakfast due to the decent reviews.
I'm typically not one to complain. Breakfast is my favorite meal. But this was horrible in every way. Place is filled will smoke. Yes i understand its a casino, but damn... there should be some kind of ventilation system going on for us that refuse to purposely kill ourselves with smoke. My breakfast came and was cold! Hashbrowns seemed old. My bacon was like rubber not even cooked. And whats better than cold eggs. I asked the waitress to take it back and have the cook make me a fresh plate. Well here comes my remade dish. Hashbrowns were fresh this time, but soooo greasie!!  The bacon
Was cooked better but also very very greasie. Plate was hot is all i can say. I give this place a big ZERO!!!  FOOD IS AWEFUL!!   i guess that's why it's so cheap.  I'll never go back. Been there done that!!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be a pretty good place in Henderson to grab a bite to eat the last couple times we are fine here the service has been trash the food has not been good"}
{"text":"The food is great, for a cheap price. Service is great, very friendly people. The only downside is that the restaurant is in a casino, even in the dining area you can still smell the smoke. Other then that is a food place to come eat!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with an old time charm that's just slightly off the highly traveled roads. I enjoyed the Saturday night special which was prime rib, soup or salad, baked potato, and mixed vegetables. Everything I had was delicious including the navy bean soup. Believe it or not, everything was included for $10! Wait staff was awesome, we got everything in a timely manner and were checked up on often. The prime rib was very good (probably about 12oz) not quite on par with Lawry's but then again I paid $10 not $75 for dinner. Will definitely be back for their prime rib and daily specials."}
{"text":"Very cool decor with plenty of neon inside.  Lots of machines, video poker odds were a little poorer than I would have expected.  I'd like to try the food next time we come here."}
{"text":"We love rainbow!! It's our go to spot for an awesome breakfast!
1.99 special reminds me of old school Vegas food you gamble and in return get a great meal for a cheap price.
2 eggs, bacon or sausage, hash browns, and either biscuit and gravy or toast can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to go here for lunch since we work right across the street. My coworker got the nachos and I ordered the reuben sandwich. The food ended up being good, but nothing to write home about. The nachos were definitely huge though. We had to laugh when the food came out. It was practically a mountain of chips, cheese, olives, taco meat, and onions. The service was good except for the older lady who was cashiering at the front. She was a bit of a grump. The prices, well you can't ask for anything better. With drinks and extra sides it cost $14.00 total for both our lunches. We've decided that were are going to go back to try their breakfast which is only $1.98 between 6 am and 11 am. If you're in the mood for a casual cheap but decent food, then this would be a good place to go."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, and tasty.  This cafe (think diner) has a basic menu, but seems to execute everything that they offer nicely. It is very inexpensive with generous portions.  Because of this they have a loyal fan base.  If you are looking for a no-frills grilled sandwich or a quick sit-down breakfast, look no further.  Two things that aren't so awesome:  1)  you have to walk through a smoky casino to eat here 2) when they are busy the hostess calls people's number/name over the PA system which is very loud and obnoxious when you are eating."}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love love this place my husband and I come here often. At least 4 times a week the price it's fantastic the food is great! We always ask for carol as our server, she is friendly and honest about what is good and what is not so good.  If u go on Friday they have  the best clam chowder in the Henderson area! If you want cheap food for with friendly customer service then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Tired of when the dining environment becomes overcast with many restaurants charging so much for so little? If so, there is a rainbow at the end of the overcast dining environment. 

   The Rainbow Club has been a downtown Henderson institution since 1984 when the Peppermill Group brought it. For over thirty years, the Rainbow Club has been serving quality food at old school prices. 

   Oftentimes, good things come in small packages. The Rainbow Club is an infinitesimal property that fits into a small downtown Henderson block. It is primarily a casino, bar, and restaurant. The best way to describe the Rainbow Club is as three long rectangles. The casino is one rectangle. The long bar in the center is the second rectangle. And the long and skinny restaurant in the back, which is Images is the third rectangle. Images (the only restaurant) with its long and skinny layout reminds me of a railroad dining car. 

   Over a couple of handful of times recently, I have dined in the Rainbow Club. I would experience four different items from the menu: 1) chicken parmesan with pasta, 2) meat loaf, 3) chicken fettuccine, 4) and Cajun chicken pasta. Every single one of these dishes exemplified a fantastic deal. The highest price is  $7.75. Where else in Vegas can you enjoy a chicken parmesan dinner for $7.75? The Rainbow gives a large portion. I remember last visit, bringing half of the chicken fettuccine home. The food that they give so much of is quality. At the Rainbow quantity equals quality. With the entre, the Rainbow includes either a soup or salad. One weakness in regards to the salad is there is a want for tomatoes. At the Rainbow, the service has also been right on. 

  The Rainbow may not be a gold rush to gamblers, but it is a mellow place to play at the bar. Several monitors hang over the long bar that turns the place into a professional sports entertainment center. The place comes alive during the NFL games. Just like the food, the drink prices are old school. $1.75 for a bottle of Budweiser is a gold rush for beer drinkers. As far as video Keno, they seem to target the nickel domination over quarters. Mellowed out after a tasty inexpensive meal that followed an outdoor adventure, I enjoyed quaffing a beer while looking up at the professional sports game, looking down at the dime Caveman Keno that kept my money in action and listening to the oldies and locals joke with the bartender. 

  If you want to experience one of the greatest restaurant values in town, then just follow the Rainbow."}
{"text":"I would love to give this a high review for the most part. I will first state, that had we not been with family that really wanted to go there is would have left. An hour wait, then another 45 minutes sitting at the table waiting for food.....not to mention the gambling waiting room filled with smoke...blech.
Now, I do get that smoking is always in a lot of these places. Ok fine. At least no smoking in the actual food area.
So, once we got to the food, it's actually pretty good. They did over cooked my steak. I wasn't going to send it back and wait another 45 minutes for food. The skies were good. The burgers got great reviews from the others at our table. 
I guess one of the biggest surprise draws to this off the beaten path, for locals is the price. You can't be the prices on this menu! !go look at the photos I added from here. You'll see what mean."}
{"text":"I'd at half the experience was good, bad, and ugly.

The good:  the service staff and our waitress were very friendly and efficient. Clam chowder soup was tasty. Onion rings were crisp and hefty sized.  The flat iron steak and the T-bone steak were cooked exactly to our order.  The food prices were super affordable. Portions were large. 

The bad:  The food was WAY TOO SALTY.  The corn on the cob was super soggy.   There were not many parking spots available at the premises.  The casino next to this restaurant was super smoky. 

The ugly:  whatever you do, DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. The texture was like crumbled and grounded mishmash of stuff you can't recognize.  It was hidden in a bucketful of store bought gravy that was super salty and tasted like it came out of a can.

For me, it was one and done. I give kudos to the service and portion size 
, but I don't think I can handle again this amount of salt in my food.  Whoever created that chicken fried steak recipe needs to be fired from the place."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover or a casino by it's outer wall. Because tucked away inside the Rainbow Club in the back of a dark, slightly smokey smelling casino is a restaurant with a seriously good and very reasonably priced menu. 

$6 Denver Omelets! And they are freakin huge!

The decor is changing as the restaurant is remodeling. The rest of the casino while kind of smelly has a great bar with lots of big screens and good bartenders, and they have a nice mix of various slots to chose from. On the down side the restrooms are...in need of a remodel to put it nicely. But Peppermill knows how to make great food, and if you are in Downtown Henderson you would doing yourself a big disservice to skip this place especially if you're hungry. Parking can kinda suck,  but the short walk is worth it, and the wait even on a Sunday morning for breakfast is not that long. 

The Ortega Chile Omelet is another favorite I have to recommend. And the service...the wait staff knows their stuff. Some of the older wait staff can come across with an attitude at first, but if you treat them with respect you get the same and a smile at the end. The younger wait staff has ALWAYS provided service with a smile without fail. As I sit here writing this I'm already looking forward to this weekend and going out for breakfast with family and friends again at the Rainbow Club. 

4 Strong Stars, leaning towards 5..it's close. Rainbow is Peppermill owned and Peppermill treats people right or at least me and my family love the place.

{"text":"We had two breakfasts at this popular cafe inside the Rainbow Club in downtown Henderson during our 2 week vacation.  Expect a line during peak dining hours, but in our experience the wait has only been a few minutes.  The wait staff is very efficient so we were soon provided menus and our requested ice water and a coffee for my wife.  On each of our visits we ordered the $1.99 casino special of easy over eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast.  The eggs have been a little underdone both times, but otherwise no complaints.  On our second visit I was admonished first by a waitress and then by a security guard for taking photos."}
{"text":"This is one of the best local Casinos in all of the Metro Las Vegas area. In fact, it is my favorite for a few reasons. Their staff is always friendly, their machines are loose with low denominations, their comp policy (on drinks) is ludicrously lenient, and they have an amazing restaurant. A note on the restaurant: It is actually called Images, though many people are reviewing it here in this Yelp establishment entry. I will be reviewing the Casino as a whole here, so if you want to read my review on Images please look it up.

This Casino has a lot going for it. Their machines have incredible payouts, even on the lowest denominations, For example, their payouts on Keno are better than 90% of the Casinos and Bars in town at a quarter level. Almost everyplace lowers their payouts for lower denominations, but not here. Their penny keno pays better than most of the other gambling establishments in town, and that's unheard of! This is the only place I have ever found anywhere that does this.

On top of that, they comp drinks at an average bet of .20 cents. That's amazing! Almost everywhere wants you to average a $1 a bet, though to be fair, most bartenders at locals places will comp you at lower play as long as your tipping, which I always do. Anyway, if you want plenty of complimentary drinks, take a seat at the bar, start playing some low stakes game, and tip for every drink.

This place isn't perfect though. Their players club is pretty stingy and seems to never off free play. It also seems like you earn comp dollars for the restaurant at a very slow pace. They don't have draft beer and their bottle selection is your usual list of domestics and the most popular foreign. The only other negative is that there are a lot of smokers here (most small locals Casinos are like that), but they have air purifiers everywhere. My wife is very sensitive to smoke and it doesn't bother her here unless a smoker sits right besides here.

Still, these criticisms are very minor and the overall value of this place more than makes up for it. As mentioned earlier, their restaurant is fantastic and is has amazingly low prices. I don't think there is another Casino in town that gives you more bang for your buck. If you want a low budget Casino night, there is no place better, and even if you aren't watching your budget, this place is great."}

This was Friday 1/30/2015 at 5:30pm We were told it would be 25min wait and we were fine with that because the food is so amazingly good everything time. But that 25min wait turned into a total of 1hr and 15min because every time we checked on the status they kept tacking on 20min and the expression on the girls face said it all. Not even an apology presented.

We will NOT be going back to our weekly family stop for a while due to this horrible service."}
{"text":"I was craving a yummy breakfast close to Henderson but away from the chain restaurants like IHOP and Denny's or any buffet. I was looking for something local and good and I remember I had bookmarked Rainbow Club & Casino after reading that there was a dinner inside that served really decent food.

Located on Water Street in downtown Henderson it was close to home and easy to find. The casino was small, very local and quaint. The dinner is located towards the back but there is not much walking to do as the place is not very large. The restaurant is called Images. The staff is very friendly. We were seated right away, it was around 8am and the place was packed. By the time we left there was people waiting in line waiting to get in, I don't blame them...it's worth the wait!

I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at the menu. Breakfast Casino   specials starting at $1.89!!! There are $5 lunch special with soup or salad and half sandwiches. Dinners specials every day for less than $8  like juicy Prime Rib on Tuesdays and Saturdays and Steak and Shrimp on Wednesdays. This occasion I was craving the NY Steak and Eggs for only $6.25!!! It was delicious, it came with hash browns and my choice of toast or biscuits.

The food was amazing, the prices you couldn't beat, the staff was super quick and friendly and the restaurant was clean and amazingly I didn't get a headache from excessive cigarette smoke. I will definitely be coming back to try out their other specials :)"}
{"text":"The Restaurant at the Rainbow Club offers some awesome value.  Flipping through the lunch menu, nothing seemed to be over $7.00.  Soups, salad sandwiches, everything was nice and affordable.

I'm normally not in this part of town, but a training seminar had me out at a training room inside the Wells Fargo on Water street.  Being lazy and not wanting to drive, I walked across to the Rainbow Club.  I got the cajun chicken sandwich with a side of potato salad for roughly $7.00.  And it's a good sized lunch too!  The cajun chicken had an awesome seasoning, with a good spiced flavor.  It also wasn't overseasoned to the point of tasting salty.

The next day I came back here for lunch, this time for a cajun chicken salad; I liked the chicken that much.  What's interesting is that the menu says the chicken is cooked fresh and hot, then added to the salad.  They weren't joking; the top of the salad was sprinkled with cheese, and all the cheese under the chicken had melted.  Chicken was as tasty as the previous visit, and the salad was large enough that I didn't finish it!  It came with tomato, cucumber, cheese and your choice of dressing.

If I'm ever in this part of town, I know that Rainbow Club can deliver a quality lunch ar a good value!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is really good especially the prices, if you get there right at opening time be prepared for an old people stampede. The only bad thing was the stink of cigarettes when you walk into the casino. We've had the same waitress and she was great cause we're not  in a hurry when we go there because there were tons of people right at opening time, some of the people do not have patience and I just wish they would open their eyes see that the wait staff is hopping and jumping with all the old people, assholes, workers and gamblers that come in first thing. For the price this place is great we have not had anything bad yet."}
{"text":"Came to the Cafe for Breakfast on recommendation from a work friend. Old school kitschy place like all the best hole-in-the-wall joints. I didn't realize this was a Peppermill Property though! 

Hostesses greet & seat. Decor is very 70's. My 67 yr old father loved the moving picture screen with all the lovely nature scenes. :)

Our server, Tabatha, was very pleasant & prompt. She told us about the 7a-11a breakfast special. 2 eggs, 2 bacon or sausage, hash browns, and your choice of toast or biscuits & gravy for $1.99!!! Coffee was strong. And the food was out before we knew it! All in all a very solid experience! We will definitely be back...Thanks Rainbow Club!"}

{"text":"Cute little casino that Grandma took us too for breakfast.  And wow, was the food cheap.  For the 3 of us $20 for breakfast.  That's one reason I love Vega$, the cheapness factor.  I had a waffle with strawberries and my fiancé had the pork chop breakfast.  It was huge.  2 huge pork chops, eggs, hash browns, and biscuit and gravy.  The food was pretty good too, and this place was packed.  I will definitely go here again on the next trip.  I noticed in the menu they had a breakfast special for $1.99, but it was over at 11.  The casino was nice too, clean, lots of locals.  I didn't win anything here either, but I had fun, and that is all that matters."}
{"text":"Not bad at all!!!!

The restaurant inside is called The Peppermill and the prime rib special for $8.99....... So good!!!!!

The casino itself is old school, looks like something from the late 60's. It's seriously from a time capsule. The service was awesome. Carol and Sandra rule. A hidden gem outside of Vegas."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since anyone wrote about this place so I thought I'd chime in.  We used to frequent this place but have not been here in awhile.  We stopped for a late nite breakfast since we were in the mood for an omelette. 

I usually go for the veggie omellete, heavy on the spinach and veggies, hold the sour cream and light on the cheese.  My favorite.  I tried that same order last night, and while what I got was pretty good, it was, well ahhhh, not an omellete.  

Aren't omellete's supposed to be folded?

First off instead of light cheese there was none.  The spinach used to be stuffed to the hilt.  What I found were a few flecks.  Some little cut up peppers kept the spinach company though so things were looking up.  There was also a smattering of tomato to round out the chorus.  All in all it was mostly egg, and veggies thrown in seemingly as an afterthought.  The cook must have been sleepy or something as the omellete looked like it had taken a ride in the blender on the way to the plate.

Maybe he thought I ordered the veggie smoothie.

Still it was tasty and worth the price.  Maybe this was just a one time foul up.  I hope the next visit they are back in the veggie omellete making form that we came to know and look forward to!

Oh yeah Rainbow, fix your moving picture displays.  Three out of four  that we were next to were not moving.  Maybe they ate one to many omelletes."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours. The cafe is called Images & located in the back. Old school feel & look to it all. 2nd hand smoke galore.

My fiance and I went there because I was craving liver and she found out that they are one of the few places which still serve it. I was not disappointed. Bonus!: the french dip she ordered was A-mazing.

Their service was fantastic as well. Our waitress, Christina, took pride in her work and paid close attention to detail. We even noticed her send a few dishes back to the cooks because they weren't to her standard.

We can't wait to go back to experience this hidden jewel again.  I'm thinking: late night slice of pie and coffee at their counter. How about that?!?"}
{"text":"veggie scramble rocks , and gravy all the way ......... thanks rainbow for value and taste ."}
{"text":"I have to say this was a great find! If I hadn't read the reviews I would of never went in. Besides the smoke in the casino it was well worth the 25 min wait. Tip, ask for a booth you get seated much faster. The Prime Rib was fantastic and at the regular price it is still a bargain at $11.50 for the thick cut. Tuesday and Saturdays it is on special. When I'm in Henderson I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"A nice option in the Historic Water Street District of Henderson, where other restaurants unfortunately tend to come & go.

I'm still somewhat new to Henderson & enjoy exploring my city.  the Water St District has a lot of history to it, but despite the city's efforts, past history is mostly what you see -- closed down storefronts awaiting redevelopment.

  I wandered into the Rainbow Club out of curiosity.  I expected it to be old, dimly lit & dirty inside, smelling like cheap booze & stale cigarettes.   I am very pleased to report that my stereotype of the interior was completely wrong!  It's clean & relatively modern inside.  The one thing I guessed correctly about was the clientele -- mostly chain-smoking local retirees, plus a few younger people who perhaps wandered inside to escape the Summer heat.   no table games, just the electronic slot machine types (I don't gamble).

After wandering around, I went to the restaurant.  It was 5:30PM, and all the tables were taken (old people eat early...) but I opted to sit at the counter.   Service was great, food was quick, plentiful & good -- all in all a very good deal for the $$.  An iced tea (free refills), potato skins appetizer, & big bowl of spaghetti marinara with side-salad & garlic bread was a little over $13.

Sitting at the counter, it's a fascinating show to watch & hear the staff interact with each other.   I got to overhear one waitress complain to another about a very high-maintenance table, the waitstaff joke with the line cooks, etc.   organized chaos, but they operated very well together.

If you're on or near Water Street & are hungry, I recommend the restaurant.  It's not really a 'destination' that I'm going to drive a ways just to eat at, but I have no problem recommending it to anyone in the area looking for a cafe type of place.  Remember though, it's not a 24/7 joint."}
{"text":"We went to try the Prime Rib as it was inexpensive. I thought it was ok. My husband wouldnt eat his and he loves Meat. He got sick later in night as well. The place is a total dive locals spot. It is not really for me.. Not trendy, hipster or cool in any way. Primarily lots of old people playing old casino games and hitting up the restrauant after."}
{"text":"Still love this spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

We have tried several menu items here at the Rainbow Club and everything is always tasty. Some of my favorite things to order are like I said in my original review the Country Fried Steak & eggs with their most delicious biscuits & gravy. For lunch I love the Turkey Deluxe which has tons of turkey, tomatoes and cheese all grilled on sourdough. I wish they would let you substitute a side salad for one of their other side options. The Chef Salad is also my favorite item to order for lunch. Great if your trying to low carb it. It's piled high with meat and cheese. It comes with orange slices, which I find odd. Lol For dinner my absolute favorite thing to order is the regular cut Prime Rib! Yummy! It's cooked perfectly and so tender you can cut it with a fork. It comes with choice of potato and veggie. Plus, soup or salad. I love that they give you au jus to dip the meat in and sour cream mixed with horseradish. It gives it the perfect kick! 
If your just looking for a snack or a super cheap appetizer check the menu out of their onion rings. They are super cheap and you get a ton of them. Also, the nachos! Oh the nachos!! The plate comes piled high with chips nacho cheese and jalapeños! They even layer it so that ALL the chips have cheese. 
One sad thing is Rainbow Club is no longer 24 hours and they are usually super busy. So be prepared to wait, but it's totally worth it for the food. The staff is super friendly and on point. 
Yay Rainbow Club! Your still one of my favorite spots in downtown Henderson. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I grew up in vegas. Born and raised. I know you don't find them a lot , but I am one of them. We have been coming here for years. As a kid my grandma would take us here to eat she would play keno and we would eat breakfast , she would eat too of course. I would choose a few numbers on occasion. The nostalgia of the black crayons and the smokey casino brings back good memories. Yes it's smokey. Inside the restaurant isn't so bad. That's what this review is for. Since I've been here as a kid. The restraunt has been remodeled. It was years ago so I can't really say if it's improved or declined since then. We were in the area so I decided to bring my boyfriend here for breakfast since we were starving ! 


The restraunt itself is called Images. A sister Restraunt owned by Peppermill. Basically another branch. Everything on the menu is fairly priced under $10. The boyfriend had a Huge country fried steak and eggs with hash browns  for $6 and some change. Comes with toast or biscuits and gravy. More like gravy with a biscuit. Way too much gravy but that's ok. We just ate the biscuits and left the pool of gravy. I had the country Skillet which I enjoyed. Round scrambled egg with tomato , potato sausage and onion inside topped with melted cheese and green onion. Very good. We spent a little over $12 bucks for this meal and were completely stuffed with leftovers to take home ! Our server was super friendly. I dont remember the food As a kid so we will be back to try some more of the menu. Everything that came out was generously portioned and looked really tasty.We came starving and left satisfied. In old Hendertucky this place is a gem."}
{"text":"ahhhh-mazing food for an amazingly affordable price! we like to come here for breakfast, but anytime of day is good. their prime rib is fantastic. they have the best breakfast ever."}
{"text":"Seriously?  These 4 star reviews are really making me question Yelps validity!

We got to this smokey casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait that was almost double that!  After we were seated there was no smoke, thankfully, but there were certainly a lot of empty tables!

My wife joked that maybe they were making us wait so that we could go gamble because she saw people being seated yet nobody leaving the restaurant!  When we got into the restaurant, I realized that her \"joke\" was probably not a joke after all because there was plenty of seating....and also plenty of people waiting outside.  That was really irritating to me.

I know this review is focusing on the experience and not food.  Ambience and service is just as important for a customer as the food so I think this is a valid review that should be read.  Cheap prices don't justify the smokey waiting area with fake wait times.  F- for integrity."}
{"text":"We (my family and I) have been going to the Rainbow for over 20 years.  This is a locals establishment where everybody knows your name.  The people are amazing the the service is great.  Unfortunately the management recently changed the restaurant hours.  They are no longer open for breakfast opening at 11am instead of 6am and close at 9pm, but quit taking names by 8pm.  The food is great, the casino employees are amazing, love them all, very friendly and quick service.  This has been a great little gettaway.  Unfortunately I won't be going back like I used to and many other locals feel the same way. It's going to be hard to find another location like this one.  No one is happy anymore."}
{"text":"The food is good, cheap and there are no frills here. My parents live in Henderson and have taken us here a few times. It is certainly not a tourist place to seek out but it could be. 

I know we have eaten here a few time and the food never disappoints.

This place is super divey but totally awesome. You can play the games here with better odds than on the strip and get stiff drinks and cheap food. What more do you need?!

And if it is your thing you can smoke in here too, unless they changed that."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday morning and order 2 casino specials for $5

- The restaurant in Rainbow is called Images 
- Breakfast specials served from 6-11am. As long as you are on the waiting list before 11, you can still order from the special menu! 
- 15min wait around smokers can be a bit irritating, but can't blame them. 
- Casino special is the same as El Dorado's Cafe and Grand Cafe's midnight special, 2 eggs, choice of 2 sausage or bacon, hash brown, and choice of biscuit with gravy or buttered toast. 
- Hash browns are very crispy here! 
- Service is very quick! We got our food in about 5-10min. Great job Lacie. 
- If you want to order another Casino special for yourself, it's 2.89! Haha..
- Prices are actually more expensive here than El Dorado, gotta love the 4 deuces there. At Images, it's 4.25!"}
{"text":"Food is good, plentiful and the price is fairly inexpensive. The decor is a little 70's ish. Looks a little like an older funeral home inside. The giant silk flower arrangements need to go. I think the flowers take away from the Rat Pack charm the place has. Service was good. It's a little loud inside. You can hear everyone around you talk. Some more than others.  We will go again. Great deals and good food."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant here with a few of my gal pals for a later dinner, and really enjoyed the experience.  All of the servers and staff members I interacted with were very friendly and courteous.  I had the tostada salad, and it was very yummy.  I wish there were more vegetarian options, but if I come back here I'll be happy to have that same salad again or one of the other couple of meals.  Prices are great, too!"}
{"text":"While the neon is a trip to the 70's, the food, prices, and service cannot be beat.  There is NOTHING over $11.00 on the menu.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner (closes at 10pm)  The food is the SAME as The Peppermill on Las Vegas Blvd. and in Reno.  They don't have the super gigantic portions, but I guarantee you won't leave hungry.  They have lunch, and dinner specials daily.  I have been a customer here for years, and always have a great experience.  The staff works very hard, and is always friendly.  It is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at great prices.  It's become a favorite in such a short time because it is so close to my apt.  Just a greasy spoon with endless amounts of coffee if you need it.  My waffle was a little late the last time we went so my meal was comped.  I didn't even complain but the manager must have seen the ticket time and the fact the other people in my party already had their food.  It was an delicious waffle.  The tuna melt is to die for and the make your own burger is a mouthful of goodness.  What I love about this place is that it is very busy but yet everyone that works there is always on it.  It's not the whole, \"well, that's not my table so why should I bother.\"  Collectively its everyone's table."}
{"text":"Stopped thru the \"ol skool\"spot for a Sunday breakfast and had the western w toast n hash browns. Never been disappointed, and today was no exception. Good service w Kelli and coffee helped me wake up also! Great way to start the day on any day not just Sunday. Omelet was made to perfection. The crew here was on point today!! Thanks for the great start to the day.."}
{"text":"How did I ever forget about this place ?

No you are not going to get gourmet food.

What you will get is good, basic food and plenty of it.

Prime rib for me, it actually didn't look that great, but the first bite confirmed it was good, no strike that is was fantastic, one of the best slices of prime rib I have eaten, melt in your mouth good.

Pot roast for the wife, she was very happy with it, i'm not a fan of pot roast, so it's not fair for me to judge.

All in all, great meal, silly cheap prices (I would have been happy paying double for the meal) service was good, place is clean, certainly one to visit again."}
{"text":"This review is for images restaurant. I've been here in the past and it was always affordable quick and tasty. This last time it seemed not quite up to par. The waitressing to forget about me once or twice and the food just seemed a little less love in the preparation. I'm I'm not giving up when I travel through Vegas I will hit this one again and give it another shot but hope they can get back up to the a friendly atmosphere and good food on a custom to you. I do wish that the booth had more seating room they're very tight."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the prices fantastic, the restaurant itself was nice and clean, also the waitress was nice...BUT the host was terrible and the busboy was worse. Horrible attitude and a smart Alec, don't even dare to ask any of them to remove a plate or anything else, we were in fear of getting beaten up, so let the dishes pile up and enjoy the prime rib. Its worth the abuse."}
{"text":"We have been going here for quite awhile now. This place is truly a diamond in the rough. \"Images\" has good food for great prices, the casino special is a morning ritual on the weekend for us. Casino special comes with two eggs, bacon or sausage, and hash browns or home fries all for a really low price. The portions and pricing you just can't beat. 

Pros: friendly staff, portions of food, pricing

Cons: small restaurant, can get crowded easily 

Tip: it gets busy around the weekends so there might be a waiting list but the bar counter top is open seating and you can grab food up there too!"}
{"text":"I do not live anyway close to Rainbow's casino. But I drive by it at least once a week cuz I'm always heading to the lakes to
Dive. And this one awesome place to eat after a dive! Food is cheap and freaking good."}
{"text":"excellant......staff wonderful, food really great, prices right, reminfs of old timer diner with friendliness and athmosphere....had the super breakfast and did add ons to build my check.   the ham was a whole slice of ham. and another day i ordered french toast beside breakfast special.    everything was outstanding. well definitely be back.   dinner specials sound wonderful and for the price.   see you in the spring.....thanks again gang"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here!  Great price with excellent service.   Everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"The corned beef and cabbage is OEDIBLE. Not the best. The corned beef is very dry, the cabbage is squishy ( I like it though) and the potatoes are very bland and tasteless. Avoid.

\"Drafted on 3/17/2012, for a St. Patrick's Day meal\""}
{"text":"Very dishonest and poor people casino: sent me a flyer but refused to give my gift. No rain-check nor make-ups.I will never give my money to this casino, nor go there anymore."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time for the Tuesday prime rib special.  Salad was simple with fresh ranch dressing. Then came a standard baked potato and corn with the prime rib. The outside was seasoned perfectly.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it, especially at the $8.50 price. My son had an omelet, which came with hash browns, and biscuit and gravy. It was also delicious. Will definitely come again. You do have to walk through the smoky smelling casino but the restaurant was smoke free."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some of the biscuits and gravy I have been reading about at their Cafe. Have to admit, the value is amazing for them! The food was good and the service wasn't too shabby either. 

The cafe's decor was surprisingly updated and interesting. The photo slideshows showing on screens throughout the restaurant livened up a casino cafe."}
{"text":"Time to update my review since the cafe (Images) remodeled awhile back and is much nicer.....

The old cafe looked similar to the Peppermill Lounge on Las Vegas Blvd - with bright colors and neon lights.  They've recently (within the last year - I'm behind on updates) remodeled the entire place.  The decor is much more neutral and modern and quite a few of the tvs were removed (sad).

The prices have gone up about $1 per meal, but are still impossible to beat.  I had a porterhouse special on a Tuesday night, and at $7.99 (with a salad or soup and a baked potato) it was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Never thought I'd say that about this place!

It's a small place, located in a small casino and it gets crowded on evenings, weekends and holidays.  Lots of locals love this place, so be prepared to wait for a table at peak times.

The service has always been friendly and prompt and they have a lot of servers in the room so that nobody is overwhelmed by tables.

If you find yourself near Downtown Henderson, stop in and give Images a try."}
{"text":"I went there because of all the high ratings it got.  And this place is a prime example where the rating is really deceptive.  I tried what most people suggested...the prime rib.  Well...it was the weirdest (not bad, but weird) cut I ever tasted.  It LOOKED like prime rib...but it tasted exactly like corned beef.  Like, I think the beef was actually put in water at some point.  The peas and carrots must have been left soaking from the morning...HORRIBLE.   The stars, ironically, are coming for the service which many have knocked.  I guess I got one of the better waitresses that day, but at least she salvaged my experience.  Also, I saw some other people ordering plates like chicken fingers which looked ok.  The prices are pretty good, and I would actually give this place a second chance because I think if I go with a simpler dish, I might leave happier.  

I love dives, and as far as prime rib, Longhorn remains my fave, but for now, Rainbow gets 2 stars from me."}
{"text":"For the price, no one can beat it!   The menu offers variety, a daily special, and great prices. Service has always been quick and friendly.  Food is great...where else can two people eat for $15 or less...?"}
{"text":"I come here every time I've visited Las Vegas. I come for the breakfasts which are really good for what the cost is. The flavor is really good. The wait kinda sucks but you get to play on the slots while you wait for your table to be called."}
{"text":"OMG....Had the $10 Prime Rib Special, came with baked potato, vegetables and salad, was soooooo good! The piece of meat was huge, couldn't believe the size. Very reasonable prices for everything on the menu. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Your prices have all gone up and the breakfast early bird menu is gone.  This restaurant is not that special now.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places in the valley. The service, food, drinks, and bar staff are on point! The atmosphere is retro-perfect, and the prices are so good you couldn't make the food at home for the same money. The prime rib is excellent, especially if you request the end piece! This place is first class all the way!"}
{"text":"Eat here quite often. Sometimes it's great other times its terrible. On a good day the food is excellent and the best you will find for it's price. Other times nothing is cooked the way you ordered it and/or it's cold. Have had more positive experience than negative. Figured 3 to 3 1/2 stars is about the average for the many times I have eaten here over the past few years"}
{"text":"We ended up here based on the high star rating for the food. Upon arriving, it is clear this is a favorite for the locals. If you're expecting a large glamorous casino like those on the strip, go to the strip. 

This place is a step back in time. The air is smokey, there are Rainbow regulars, and a good number of elderly. If you sit at the bar and play (I think $0.20) you will get a complimentary drink. 

Anyway, we went for the food. It was nothing spectacular, but basic. I got a chicken quesadilla and my husband got a turkey sandwich for lunch. These were items that you could easily and quickly assemble in your own kitchen and have it taste the same. I'd say it was standard portion sizes, definitely not too much, at a very economical price. We both ate for under $14. If you're looking to save money and splurge on other meals, this could be your place."}
{"text":"Smokey and old but for under $2.00 you get a good breakfast and in my opinion the food quality is what you would find at Denny's or Ihop"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem of Henderson. 

If you're not a local, you probably don't even know this exists. But it does and I'm glad! I've been coming here since I was younger, and nothing beats the prices! The quality actually isn't too bad. Their food is delish and cheap. What more could someone ask?

I love their strawberry waffle!! It's drenched in whipped cream and strawberries though, and if you're not a LOVER of whipped cream I wouldn't dare try it. But it is super yummy! I also think they have one of the best french toasts in town! They give you a slab of butter and thick syrup that just makes the french toast so fluffy and perfect texture! A must try.

I've had their club sandwich which is HUGE and tasty!

Their casino special can't be beat.
6:00am-11:00am so you must be early!
But it's $1.89. Tell me, where else can that be beat??!
It comes with hash browns, bacon or sausage, eggs, and toast or biscuits and gravy.
Whaaaat a DEAL!!!!!!

Customer service is friendly and always accommodating.
It's a small diner so it can get pretty busy.
But worth the trip! If you're in Henderson, MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"It's strip-club-tastic. The neon / mirrors motif is pretty awesome, but you definitely don't want the waitresses to be giving you lap dances.  The gals who wait on you look like old diner movie cliches. They all look like \"Maude\"s or \"Harriet\"s.

The food here is good old diner food. Sub Denny's prices, and way better than Denny's quality. Most of the stuff on the menu will shorten your life, but walking through the haze to get to the restaurant takes 10 years away anyhow. My wife thinks the potato skins are awesome, I don't understand the big deal. I think it's more about nostalgia for her. I don't mind going because the prices are great."}
{"text":"Amazing casino special breakfast! I always come here multiple times whenever I visit Henderson."}
{"text":"Worst casino management in Henderson, Nevada. I use to praise them on their restaurant but now they seem to be racist company. They allowed a waitress to work there and last night this waitress accused me and a friend who is a business owner of motel down the street of trying to get over with a slice a pie which he purchased a pie and we split it. That was racial profiling which in Henderson that happens very often. Other than that their restaurant is not a good place to eat if you have a strict diet of no pork. That contributes to high blood pressure. I personally don't eat red meat or beef anymore. The cheap breakfast doesn't provide an alternative like Denny's does."}
{"text":"Images The Restaurant is a surprising gem hidden inside the Rainbow Club. My wife found the restaurant and said let's go. We arrived at the casino, and at first I was confused. Once we walked through the casino, it all made sense. The food and service were great. My wife and I are both from the restaurant industry in California, so we know how to look at a restaurant from an insiders perspective. 

Pricing?! Can't be beat! (The business math is simple with the casino offset.) The service was great and the staff was as well. Glad we found this place. Next time were in Las Vegas, or Henderson, we'll make a point to return."}
{"text":"The food is great but the people working there are terrible.  It's very clicky.  If you aren't from Pitman you get treated like crap.  Everyone is beyond rude and acts like you are putting them out to do their job.  The casino is overrun with cigarette smoke and the wait is always over 40 mins."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable prices. Note that they have New Hours.. They open at 11am, the times posted are incorrect."}
{"text":"I strolled along Water St to finally enter this itty bitty casino at the heart of Downtown Henderson.  It's bigger than a Dotty's but smaller than a Fitzgerald's.  However, gambling wasn't on my mind, it was coffee shop grub and I was hoping they would deliver the goods on a Hot Turkey sandwich or a Blue Plate special of some sort made from the remnants of the Blue Plate special that wasn't sold the day before.

The hostess was real friendly greeting me at the door.  The dining space was spacious but felt very similar to one of those roadside diners that you might see on a long trip or in a half-lighted neon poster with Bogart, Dean, and Monroe.  Yeah, that kind of joint.

I sat down at a very clean table with menu in hand and already a comment card given to me by the hostess.  Now that's a way to ensure everyone is always on notice to bring your A-game.  I asked about the special and they didn't have anything that sounded appetizing or mysterious or challengin to digest so I passed.  I instead ordered my guilty pleasure, the Open Faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with Mashed Potatoes and a Diet Coke.  Crystal was very friendly taking my order and she told me her name, I didn't have to glance-snatch it off a name badge.  The food was yum to my tum and the her busperson was equally as friendly clearing my table and inquiring on re-fills.  

I like the food and the service.  I knocked it down one star because you have traverse the small casino floor which like all casinos is drenched with the smell of smoke soaked carpets and littered with tripping hazards like Oxygen tanks and the people attached to them.  Seriously, I'm not keen on taking that smell out with me but it's inevitable.  The exchange is that I got a great hot turkey sandwich and the world seems a tad brighter like the Wizard just gave me cuh-rij.  Recommended."}
