{"text":"This place is so essential whenever I go down to Las Vegas for golf. My Korean food cravings are 100% satisfied with an excellent quality food court, clean and organized groceries, and delicious ready-made foods. I especially love to pick up the kimbab, which is among the tastiest. There is a store in the back of the food court that also freshly makes boonguhbbang.  The existence of this place makes my trips to LV a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Asian snacks, whether savory or sweet, are my favorites. You'll find either of those in the aisles and ready to eat/hot foods at the back of the market. Produce is nice. Home goods section is adorable. Single serving foods for a quick lunch at work you can buy by the case. Meats and seafood you can find seasoned and marinated ready for cooking or unadulterated for your favorite dishes at home. My family will make the 40 mile round trip to Greenland over my weekends without a second thought. I like this joint!"}
{"text":"I just love Greenland! I happily drive across town anytime I want to get reasonably priced fresh vegetables. (usually once a week!) Especially if I need, green onions (5 bunches/$1), napa cabbage, onions, or an assortment of mushrooms (enoki, beach, shiitake). 

They have a great seafood section. I always get a little slab of salmon to eat salmon sashimi! It is always fresh! They also have a small selection of already made foods such as an assortment of kimchees, kimbab, vegetable pancakes. My favorite is the seasoned raw crab! They also have pre-packaged raw meats/seafood with vegetables to make hot pot, I'm assuming?

They have a food court in the front area. I've never tried any of the places (I usually buy already made foods from inside usually) But it looks like there are a lot of choices from a few vendors. They have a small little bakery in the front as well. They have freshly made breads, cookies, manjoo, breads filled custard and much more. 

Greenland is my favorite and its not the closest asian market near me, but I drive there cause its THAT AWESOME. lol. I haven't been to International Market Place or Ranch 99 in ages!"}
{"text":"This market is huge, but the sashimi grade fish steaks were a huge disappointment.

One word: Smelly. All of the sashimi here smells terribly fishy. I made the mistake of buying the fish without smelling it first (amateur, I know). I got it home and it smelled TERRIBLE.

I tried making it into spicy tuna and spicy salmon the second night in the hope of drowning out the smell. I took two bites and gave up. I'm throwing away about $15 worth of fish because the smell is so fishy, you can taste it in every bite.

Other than that, there's certainly variety in terms of this being a huge market with a ton of stuff. Anything that's a dry food is a safe bet here. Just stay away from the fish."}
{"text":"My favourite place to shop for groceries. It's a one way stop to heaven! Ha! They have everything from clothes in the little shops within the supermarket to even a makeup store! The grocery selection here is no joke. They have everything Korean! Although they can be quite overpriced, the products I've bought are so worth it. I love the ramyeon, jajangmyun, etc noodles section of the market. They have SO MUCH selection. 

The workers here are nice, but they don't really communicate with you unless you have a question. And when you do, they are more than happy to help you and assist you with satisfying and answering your question. I also like that the grocery market itself has a hot food section where you can purchase cooked Korean food. They sell kimbap, soondae, dumplings, and etc freshly made every morning. The kimbap (laver roll) and the corns are put 50% after 8PM which is pretty awesome!!!!


My favourite part of this entire market is the FOOD COURT!!! Freaking awesomely, amazing selections of Korean foods you can order. I love, love the jajangmyun and sweet and sour pork combo, the kimchi stew, and the octopus udon mmmmm!

I always come here and you should too!"}
{"text":"The market was of a pretty decent size and bigger than the ones found in Cleveland, but it was certainly didn't blow me away like the markets in Toronto. The store was very clean and it was nice to find a lot more variety of korean brands than I would normally see at the Chinese markets. They also have a good selection of marinated sliced meats and some prepared banchan. Wish they had more produce and Asian fruits though. They do have a very nice variety of drinks."}
{"text":"I come here for pork belly!!! I leave with a fancy bill. I love coming here but it's a quite a drive for me... I find this place to be pricey.
The food court is not bad at all! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great Korean supermarket but just a little pricey. I come here once to twice a month to stock up on a few items and take advantage of the Laver rolls for lunch! Great fresh Kimchi selection too!"}
{"text":"Green land is the best for their asian cuisine food court.  Great variety in foods.

the only negative is that they don't slice their fresh meats thinly.... ;("}
{"text":"Everything thing you need to barbecue Korean style at your own home. Great marinated bulgogi and other meats, all the vegetables that you need, kimchis, rices and sauces. We stop at this one store and get everything we need for a bomb backyard barbecue. I love it. I'm not Korean, but everyone is very cool there and it has been a great place to bring the kids to explore new foods. My favorite \"Asian\" supermarket in the valley.

Bummer- as of December 2013 all of the food court is a ghost town- weak sauce."}
{"text":"I bought two  kim bab !! ,, l never had this kind of terrible taste .
I hope make a better kim bab .
Waste my money."}
{"text":"This place is clean and doesn't smell. Aisles all neatly lined up and products are all nice and fresh looking (in terms they don't look like they been sitting on the shelf for a while)
Okay that gets it 3 stars

It's Korean supermarket with a food court that has good food okay 1 star

The items in the supermarket is diverse and pretty much 90% Korean products and the rest is Japanese/other ethnic products. The items they sell are legit and the seafood/meat section is diverse. OH AND THE PRICES, I love how their cheaper then white grocery stores and better too. Tried buying chicken breasts at Vons it was like $5+ while here it was like $3+. amazing (GAZILLION STARS FOR THAT)"}
{"text":"Front desk service is way to bad because i called in to the market to check if they have certain product that i am looking for. And the women who picked up the phone answered with poor attitude. First, she said she does not know that they have that product. Second, after i reminded her of the location of the product she told me there are too many products that are similar so she does not know. Third, she decided to tell us to come over and look for it ourselves... there is a reason why we called because we needed to know ahead of time because we are far away. We hung up but, we got pissed off so we called again to know what her name is. She said she cannot tell us. I asked her for her position and she said she was the manager of cashier. So i asked her to get the gm. She said the gm is not present, so we asked for the gm's phone number and she said she cannot give it to us. I believe that the customer has the right to get the employees name first of all and when i first asked to speak with the gm she said she was the one speaking. I think this is a fraud to say she is the manager of cashier not the gm. Finally she did not even care to look for the item or if she was tooo busy or she really did not know if the product is there, she could've asked other workers. I am very angry of her attitude and i was once a fan of greenland because it is like the only korean market but now nothing matters but the fact that they have the worst customer service, i am not proud to say that i am korean just because of people like this. Please fix the attitude of the employees"}
{"text":"I love going here cause they always have what i want no matter how random it is. I also love the places in the foodcourt, especially the sushi place."}
{"text":"This place has arguably  the cheapest Japanese/Korean rice in town and a nice selection of things so its not terrible but, what was terrible was the food court. If I had the option of rating their food court I would give it a 1. 
So there I was, I was next in line the cashier lady turned away from me and started saying angry things at the bus boy or the kid who took the trays back.
It went something like this.

Old lady: Jinhuan u no gud

Jinhuan: I gud.

Old lady: No u no gud,

Jinhuan: I rear gud

Old Lady: WONGTONGBONGSONG!!!!!!!! U NO GUD

Me: Shil lyeh hamnida.... Excuse me....

*Stand there with a $20 in my hand... They kept arguing. So I walked away.*

I would go back for the Kimchee in the supermarket though."}
{"text":"This place is easy to get to from the westside, well alot easier than going farther in to Chinatown. 

Their produce is decently priced, and I'm a fan of their sales of the Korean pears.  

I like the already made sides like pickled cucumbers and kim-chee. 

There's also a food court area outside of the grocery store and it has a lot of different things.  I heard good things about the Hawaiian place in there."}
{"text":"Love this store! My kind of store! You will surely enjoy shopping here at Greenland! Thanks, I don't  have to go to California to do my monthly grocery shopping. Yay!!!"}
{"text":"I agree. Going down to the food court alone is worth the trip. Well everything there is really good,but that's my opinion. All the restaurants there are all the best! If it's your first time going here either go shop than eat or eat than shop. Whichever choice you pick, you still get to leave with a happy stomach!"}
{"text":"The food court is great yes I agree but the stands around selling bake goods are not friendly at all; the same goes for the grocery store.
All of their products are label in Korean,  if you try to get help the people here are so rude and they act like your are taking their precious time, in the bakery outside the girl was speaking Korean with a friend from the booth next to her, they ignore me and when I ask for help she had and attitude.
I have no intentions to go back or to recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"I came here because a co-worker suggested I go here for some ready made bulgogi.  It has just about everything you may need for your Korean BBQ needs.  A good selection of the per-marinated stuff and some side dishes too.  It has everything you can expect from and Asian supermarket.  Parking is plentiful and they also have a food court which the wife and I haven't sampled yet.  All in all I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food poisoning!!! Threw up afterwards!

Bought their already-prepared food: marinate kimchee tofu, raw octopus, salted cucumber, tofu soup, and seafood pancake . Ate it around 9pm on Saturday night at their dining area. Threw up 3 hours later at home... Felt miserable. 

Either their seafood is unsanitary or there may have been cross contamination..

I will call the southern Nevada health district and file a complaint. 

I brought all the prepped food back, but the lady named Grace only took back and returned the prepped food. She refused to refund my whole grocery bill of $40+ dollar. For all the pain, vomiting, light-headedness, nausea that I've been through, it was only little to ask for. In fact, I would pay her $40 to shove that shit down her throat and she can tell me how food poisoning feels."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went here my first time the other day to buy ingredients to make kimchi. This place is like Korean heaven they have seafood, meats, a lot of produce and a wide variety of Asian items. I brought pork belly as well for a great price! Definitively will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The Cashier Lady of \"L'EPID'OR Bakery\", is so TERRIBLE!! What is wrong with her? Probably she's never gotten customer service training. Of course no smile whenever I saw her, NEVER says \"hello\" nor \"thank you\".
Yesterday (July 19th, around noon) was the worst. She was tapping her fingers so hard after the check out (when I was putting my change to my wallet). It was so ANNOYED!! I looked at her, she stopped tapping, but 2 seconds later, she started again. Then, I looked at her again, she stopped. Then I turned and leaving, she started tapping so hard again!! I don't have a chance to put my change to my wallet for a little moment?!? Or she was not happy because I asked her to give me a receipt? By the way, the store was so slow, no customers but me.
My friends, who went to the bakery, hate her so bad, too. One of them has never go back to Greenland Supermarket because she doesn't want to see her face. Too bad the bakery is located at the entrance of the building.
The Bakery Cashier Lady should know what is a customer service, she should not have a job at a check out counter."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this kim-chi... just $9.99 for  almost 8 lb!!  A few ounces at the health food store is over $10!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great prices. We have nothing like this in MO or AR I want to move here just for this store!"}
{"text":"Love it. Beef bulgogi is awesome. Apples the size of new hampshire. Cheap fish. Got to love it."}
{"text":"I loved organic mangos and papayas from here... Everything is affordable and fresh, and stuff are kind and helpful. I live in Henderson, so it's not the closest, but I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. Boy was I surprised! They have a large selection of noodles. This not not your small selection like in other stores. There are towers and rows ofany varieties. I had to buy several different ones. I loved the different choices, it definitely allowed me to go out of my \"ramen noodle\" comfort zone and explore. I am happy a coworker suggested this place. 

They even have shops and a food court. The food court is a must try."}
{"text":"I had the miso ramen from the food court which was kinda bland.  The tuna rolls are tasty.   Prices are comparable to a most sit down full service restaurant.  For the quality of food, it should be 1-2 dollar cheaper.  The portions are reasonable. They do offer free tea and water to all patrons.  Overall,  I like the comvenience of getting a bite to eat before or after grocery shopping.  I will try the korean pizzas next time."}
{"text":"I love going to Asian markets, so I was thrilled to find a Korean market.  It was late in the evening when I stumbled upon this place after dinner.  They had a lot of products to offer, the problem is some of the aisles are too cramped.  But they did offer ready to eat items that kids love, like Gimbap and mini seafood pancake for that late night snack when in Vegas.  They also have a food court with a good selection of options to please everyone.  This place will be a frequent place to stop by when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I continuously smell like kimchi because of Greenland.  Enablers! 

So, yeah, blondie here is addicted to kimchi and Greenland is my proverbial crackden.   As I'm writing this review, I have a giant jar of Greenland kimchi in my fridge.   I have no idea what brand it is, the label is written in Korean.  That narrows it down, right?

Anyways, Greenland, besides supplying the cabbage, also has other great selections such as marinated bulgogi, kalbi, cucumber salad, stir-fry noodles, etc.  I'd highly recommend the cucumber salad.  It's excellent, very flavorful and slightly spicy.

Their produce selection is also pretty decent.  You can find deals on oyster mushrooms and shitaki.  They also sell gigantic bags of bean sprouts.  If you need to make a stir-fry for 29, check it out!

I do buy other things there but, honestly, I have no idea what they're called. They're good, whatever they are! I guess I need to learn Korean...."}
{"text":"I love love love this market!  It's so clean and well lit, with beautiful vegetable, meat and seafood sections, great prices and it's open till midnight every day, which is good for a vampire schedule person like me.  :)  

I've also bought several of their prepared foods like various banchan, chicken wings, pancakes and my family has loved all of it.  Especially convenient are the bibimbap pre-cooked set of vegetables and meat - all you have to do is add that to your sizzling rice.  Very nice for tired evenings when you still want something yummy.

There are also several excellent Korean fast food outlets in the lobby of the market.  So come a little hungry when you shop here - work up that appetite while browsing all the delicious things on offer and then get yourself an awesome treat!"}
{"text":"great korean supermarket, had items we couldnt find here at our local K super, prices are extremely reasonable and staff was stellar-we asked one of the workers in the produce section if the plums were sweet and he took two to the back, washed them and offered us to taste them before we purchased any, so nice!"}
{"text":"I love this market they have a several vegan products inside the actual grocery store as well as Asian produce. And the food court has vegetarian options as long as you ask, my favorite restaurants are the island style with the nicest people and the tofu place where you can order vegetarian black bean noodles. I've gotten veggie sushi at the sushi place as well. I love eating at the food mart and then doing some shopping! Oh and the sweet rice cake vendor is the sweetest lady! She sells the best rice cakes!"}
{"text":"I went in for my usual weekly shopping trip. Marinated Bulgogi, various banchans and some cooking essentials like sesame oil. As always, I'm pleased with the selection they have. I was a little disappointed that they were out of the boxes of original Sapporo Ichiban noodles but no biggie."}
{"text":"Food court where at the front of the market is worthy. But, the market is too pricey and not fresh. I rather go to another asian markets on Spring mountain rd."}
{"text":"While my parents were here, I decided to take them and my nephews to Greenland market to do some shopping since we didn't go the last time they were here. My mom WAS in heaven. They had everything we wanted and a cheaper price than what she wzs use to spending. For instance she got 4 lbs of bulgogi at $5 a pound vs the $7 per pound the she spends in Washington State. We found frozen New Zealand Mussels. We found taro as well and cooked it on Saturday so that we could eatas part of the celebration for my son's birthday. She cooked with coconut milk and seasonings. We nighthawk rice, fruits, veggies, and much much more. We had a great time walking around finding everything she wanted."}
{"text":"I think that I would come to Koreatown just to visit the food court.

The Greenland Supermarket meets all of my Asian food needs, desires, wants, etc.  I like the variety and of dry goods, produce, and meats.  It would be more helpful if all of the displays were both in English and Korean.  I am the Korean-American kid that didn't pay attention much to my Korean language skills.

The best thing I like about the Greenland Supermarket is finding all the great things that I didn't know I needed until I walked by the displays!"}
{"text":"Best Asian Supermarket in the Valley.  

Supermarkets need to be assessed based on these categories:  Selection, layout, quality of service, and price.  Here's why Greenland slathers the competition in Gochujang, and throws it on the hot grill:

Selection:  Although it's predominantly Korean, there is a large variety of goodies here, ranging from whole fish that the monger will slice or filet to your likings, freshly made banchan, good produce, and an array of delicious snacks.

Layout:  The store is organized in a logical manner.  If you start out with the produce, and make your way around the floor, you'll finish at the frozen goods.  This is how it should be, so your frozen food doesn't get all melty on you before you check out.  

Quality of Service:  The staff is usually very friendly and helpful, even if a language barrier pops up, you can still get the answers you need rather easily.  The fact that you can have the seafood prepped here quickly before you get it home is a huge benefit to trying new recipes.  

Price:  The prices here are similar to many other supermarkets, cheaper than Whole Foods of course.  

**Bonus**  The food court here offers up some tasty fare, including soups, stews, sushi, and some grilled items.  A new Korean fried chicken place opened here, and while I haven't tried it, it looks fantastic.  


Thumbs way up for Greenland Supermarket!!"}
{"text":"I love it ! Great selection of asian foods , reasonably priced . So much stuff in one space !"}
{"text":"I have been going to this market for a while for their kimchee, namul, and Kalbi to cook on my grill ay home.  It's all great, especially the fresh kimchee.  But today I took a chance and bought the spicy chicken from the marinated meats counter.  It was FANTASTIC.  It looks really spicy as it is bright red with chile, but it was perfect for me after grilling.  I ate it with so e kimchee, bean sprouts, and radish from the same store and LOVED it.  Oh, and I am positive it was breast meat, which my doctor prefers for my cholesterol.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is a very large asian supermarket.  Very clean & well organized & stocked.  They sell a variety of asian foods like korean, japanese, & some hawaiian too.  Very much affordable as well.  Not to mention, they also have a great food court in there.  Not too much of a selection in the food court but the food is awesome & the staff is super nice! Luv it!!"}
{"text":"Growing up, the Greenland Supermarket was a Lucky's, and little bit later an Albertson's. However, just like everything else on Spring Mountain between Rainbow and Decatur I barely recognize it anymore. Chinatown is getting quite epic. 

This is a review of the food court:
In the Greenland Supermarket food court there's a Hawaiian place, a Sushi place, two Korean booths, a Tofu \"casserole\" place (which I don't think I'll ever try, it sounds kind of disgusting) and a coffee shop which serves Boba but seems to be out of it a lot. 

I really wish the Hawaiian place served lumpia and Portuguese donuts but I digress, the spam musubi was quite delish. The sushi place is pretty cheap, for $1.99 they will give you two nigiri, which is about ten nigiri for $10. I also tried Korean food for the very first time when I came to this place, just for the hell of it. I had a kim-chee and meat stuffed bun, which will have to grow on me sadly. It tastes very good at first but the aftertaste is pretty odd. 

In conclusion, I had a pretty good experience here. I wish they had a little more variety (such as a Vietnamese booth or more offerings at the Hawaiian booth) but I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Damn I love this Korean supermarket just two blocks away.  And the great thing about this super market is the juicy pussy clams.  The Korean bbq is pricey.  I can understand its Korean bbq.  but still the prices for the rest of the food are pretty fair.  I always come back for more.  And the soju is the cheapest place I can afford to buy haha.  I love Greenland super market."}
{"text":"Price is affordable...good variety of asian goods. Easy to find location. Also the food court has new restaurants"}
{"text":"What kind of noodles are you looking for? Well look no further, Greenland has a variety of noodles to choose from. My favorite is the tempura and miso flavored noodles. If you don't like noodles, check out their meat and seafood section. We always get the marinated Korean meats. There's also a section with all the ingredients already made for bim bim bop. If you like hurricane popcorn like I do, there is a Hawaiian section.

Did you say Asian vegetables to make your favorite Asian dish, well this is your one stop shop. I love this place. Its clean and has what I need in terms of Asian food. There are vendors right when you walk in that sell Asians sweet goods. Did I mention there's a food court too? YUP This place has it all."}
{"text":"Worst ever. People from this market are very unprofessional. Hispanic guys are always cursing & making nasty jokes in Spanish. Koreans are always talking stupid personal things in front of other customers. That's why I get very pissed off when someone asks me if I am a Korean, which is an insult to me."}
{"text":"Needed to get these awesome pots and pans to bring back home because there so awesome. The store is huge and well managed very organized and clean for sure! Lots and lots of good stuffs we wanna take with us but unfortunately not enough to time!!  Way cooler and more then the ones back home. Nice!!!!"}
{"text":"Love, Love this supermarket! Every time we visit my family we stop at this supermarket. Everything is so fresh & a lot of groceries to choose from. They sell a variety of Bento, sushi, fried fish etc. There is also have a food court which is very good a lot of restaurant to choose from. If you are hungry & have a taste for asian food such as Japanese food I would go there & price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Not too bad a place to buy food - vegetables arent always the freshest so it's hit-or-miss.  The food court is a decent place with few, but good places to choose from.  Good place to go if you have small kids too as its open and relatively clean."}
{"text":"When I did a search for Korean market, this is the only place that shows up in the area.  They were definitely no H-Mart from Cali, but it was the best they got in town.  The place was quite big with a modernize design located within a complex with a mini strip mall before you reach the grocery store.  They even got a post office here.

Size is about the same as other ethnic grocery stores like 168 and Ranch 99.  They do have a large variety of Korean products here, like the Korean paste had over 20 plus choices, and tons of brand for soju.  They also have small boxes of the fresh Korean small dishes for sale here.

I would definitely recommend Greenland Supermarket if you are into Korean products.  The staffs were very friendly too."}
{"text":"After 8pm you can get discounted kimbap (beef and vegetable rolls) or chapchae (stir fried sweet potato noodles with vegetables) for 50% off if any are still available. I had some chapchae for around 2.14 for my dinner, good eats! The kimbap goes fast so try to get there before 9, you can get that for around 2.25 for 2 big rolls.

This large marketplace also has some of the most hardest to find korean items you will find anywhere. Whether it's a brand name korean soju, red pepper paste, or candy, this supermarket has it all. 

There are also stalls inside the center that sell freshly made breads and pastries from the Lepidor bakery, and another one that sells fresh rice cakes. Along the outside, there are stores that sell electronics, travel tickets, as well as clothing.

For a one-of-a-kind experience into a whole different world, Greenland is the place to go."}
{"text":"Took a long long time for it to open but after it did, its one of my regular places to shop at ! 

Not only do they have a grocery supermarket, there's also a wide variety food court (to satisfy your korean or hawaiian? cravings), small shops, bakery, and coffee shop ! 

Prices are decent. This is THE PLACE TO GO for ALL YOUR HOT POT MEAT NEEDS (sliced beef, chicken, pork, lamb) and of course BBQ too (galbi, bulgolgi, etc) XD i do not go anywhere else to buy meat for hot pot. such a wide variety at a good price ! 

After 8PM, the \"cooked foods\" area, the metal cart, i think everything on there (kim bap, jap chae, corn?) is 50% off. good snacks XD"}
{"text":"When Greenland first opened its doors, it immediately took me back to my childhood memories munching on Korean and Japanese junk food after school back in Guam. Haha! This place is like Trader Joe's for me where I find aisles of interesting products to see, but darn it! I can't read half of the labels! LOL

I come here for things such as their Korean side dishes, instant noodles, and frozen treats! The Gimbap (Korean sushi) is great when they are freshly made and must be eaten within hours. The monstrous selections of  instant noodles are insane! If you can't find anything in this section, there's something wrong with you! Haha! They have several mochi brands which is way cheaper to buy a box instead of ordering one piece of mochi at a restaurant. If you haven't tried the Melona frozen bars, you're in for a treat!

This place has great selections if you know exactly what your looking for. The prices here are a bit higher than other places depending on the type of product. There are things that I shy away from like their produce stand because the days I visit, they don't look appealing. 

If you haven't been here, they have postal service available, mini food court, small bakery section, and other mini shops to choose from that may keep you busy for a good hour or so of your day."}
{"text":"Good selection of stuff. It was even open on thanksgiving! They have two snack aisles and lots of fresh veggies to choose from. 

Their banchan selection was nice but a lot of the stuff wasn't so fresh. The squid looked really old and just tossed in some spicy sauce to hide the quality. It's really different from my usual Korean markets. Sucks that I wasn't able to bring any back home. 

They have sriracha popcorn!"}
{"text":"If you want to be teleported to Korea...This is the place for you. It even smells like Korea, it's awesome. Lots of Korean food including Soju. We go for better choices in Ramen soups and also for some Korean snacks. Can't get enough Choco Pies! I recommend coming here to stock up your pantry with Korean specialties!"}
{"text":"I love my Asian supermarkets, and I definitely love this Korean geared supermarket! Located in the \"Korea Town\" plaza, you'll find Greenland Supermarket nestled inside along with various other small shops and food court. 
This Supermarket is very clean, I feel that they have one of the cleanest fruits and vegetables (no dirt residue from of picking picking and saran wrapped perfectly) and seafood display. As for the meat, I do favor buying their pre-seasoned short-ribs and beef brisket. They have it nailed down when it comes to the taste and freshness. Its also perfect and easy to cook when you are at home craving for that Korean BBQ taste, minus the smoke. This is the prime place to pick up your kimchi as well! They have various sizes from small to a large tub of kimchi, so come by and take your pick. If you fancy tteok-bokki or spicy rice cakes, you can pick up the rice cakes and sauce here! To compliment your food that you get here, you can also purchase soju here.

Towards the back you will find pre-cooked food. meaning you will find kimbap, fried mackerels, glazed chicken wings, vegetable/meat cake, seaweed salad and much more. I've tried a good handful of these, and they are a life saver when you don't want to cook that day or if you are in a rush.

If you are looking for your instant Ja jang myun gratification, look no more! You have find the prime spot to find your perfect ja jang myun noodles. There are literally two sections of noodles for you to select from.

You will also find that they have a variety of Korean snacks like rice cakes, chips, cakes, cookies, and candies. They definitely carry popular Lotte snacks here too (ice cream included). You will also find that they have some selection of Japanese goods here as well. Such as pre-packaged cheesecakes, dorayaki (red bean filled cakes), mochi (rice cakes and ice cream ones), flavored drinks, and sake. I will also like to mention you can find the popular Japanese \"Palty\" hair dye here as well."}
{"text":"Why should you come here for your asian grocery needs?

1. The place is cleannnn. When you compare this place to the other asian supermarkets in town *cough* 99 Ranch, this place gets a A++ from the health inspector. 

2. Large selection of fruits, vegetables, seafood and just your overall asian spices, sauces, and snacks. This also includes everything you need for a korean style feast : marinated meats (bulgogi, galbi), fresh made kimchi, soft tofu, every type of ban chan available, krn chili powder etc etc. and everything is at a reasonable price.

3. This place comes with a fully loaded food court. Too hungry to shop and make your own korean dishes at home? No worries! This place provides just about every korean dish your heart desires."}
{"text":"I love Greenland market! It is an excellent Korean-owned asian grocery store and carries a lot of varied products. 

Their fresh meat selection is awesome. Everytime my Mom is in town I always make a trip to Greenland to stock up on Korean-style short ribs so that she can marinate them (and so that I can have a freezer full of Mom's delicious bulgogi short ribs nom nom nommm).

The prepared foods section is very good too. I have had jobchae, kimchee, kimbop and seaweed salad from there.

The food court is perfect for when you need a quick bite before grocery shopping, knowing that if you walk in to Greenland hungry you will end up buying everything in the store. My favorite food court item is the mussel champong (spicy seafood and noodle soup) from the stand in the corner, the name escapes me. So yummy.

Be sure to get your Greenland Market rewards from the cashier. For every $500 you spend, you get a $10 coupon/voucher to use towards future purchases."}
{"text":"With our latest \"Korean food\" craze during my family gatherings, I decided to check this place out! I give this place 3 stars because although they had quite an abundant selection, I couldn't read a darn thing, besides the prepackaged meat of course. There was a ton of staff putting stuff on shelves, etc. but when you ask them a question, they look at you with this confused look on their face. It's all good though. I got what I \"could read\" and I'm sure I'll be back... but I think I'll go with my friend who is a lil more familiar with the store next time."}
{"text":"Bring out the inner Korean in you. 

I paid a visit to Greenland because I was fed up with how stuffy the Ranch 99 store was becoming. Ranch 99 went through a renovation, but it seems that it got smaller. ANYWAY...

The moment I wanted into Greenland, I texted my Korean bestie and bragged about how awesome this store really is. It's great.

Awesome produce section, awesome seafood (only downside is no live crab, shrimp, or fish), and amazing freezer sections. 

The pricing on shrimp was amazing too!! And high quality to boot. I know because I'm a food snob.

As you walk past the seafood section, you'll go through the meats and eventually into the prepared foods section. If you came to this store stuffed, you'll leave starving if you don't eat. It's THAT good. Delish kim-chi, pickled garlic and anything else that is on your K-Palate. Om nom nom.

Lastly, the customer service is quite good. Although the number of checkstands is low, they are efficient, and you don't have to wait long. Also, you can listen to killer K-pop while you wait. 

Get ready to hear the awesome tunes of Big Bang."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with the cleanliness of the supermarket. I've been to others and was put off by the cloying fishy smell and general dinginess of other places. OK, the fish section may have a little smell but it's only confined to that area. For all you 9th Islanders there is an aisle containing all kinds of products normally only available in Hawaii. And an aisle for Mexican and Latin American products. I don't speak nor read Korean, but all the products are clearly labeled on the shelves in English.

Outside the supermarket is a food court and mini-mall, so you could do all your shopping there and grab a bite as well. I highly recommend a visit if you need Asian or Korean specialties for your next home-cooked meal!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Greenland! This is my weekly grocery store, and where I do most of my shopping at. You can get good quality seafood here, there is a meat section that is already marinated, kimchi and side dish station plus daily made kimbap, battered and pan fried veggies, grilled fish, etc. The produce area is far beyond impressive. You can buy apples and Korean Pears by the box, bagged veggies at a good price, and for the people who don't like to deal with the hassle of peeling Garlic, they have bags of peeled garlic ready to buy. 

You can also find a little Hawaii food section isle over there also...something that used to be at Longs Drugs before they were taken over by CVS. 

They have an area in there that has fresh noodles (Udon, wheat flour, chow mein, etc.), that beats buying the dehydrated noodles. They even sell rice cakes there, so I like to make Dukbokki :)

My favorite part of this store is the household section. We bought one of those portable stoves that you can put in the middle of the table, so we can use it at home ;) I also love their plastic storage containers, they are sturdy and airtight so when I store the Kim chi in there, it wont smell up the refrigerator."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm not in the US when I'm here, which is awesome!  The produce is really fresh, I can pick up roasted corn tea, soju, random cute household stuffs, tteokbokki and various banchans by the kimchi, they even have marinated meats you can buy by the pound and take home to grill."}
{"text":"To be frank, I like shopping here waaay more than Seafood City.  They have what I need, plus better selection too for condiments, teas, and more.

Only gripe, the aisles are cramped or blocked but it's the norm at these specialty grocery stores.

The meat department clerks are helpful. I pick up marinated bulgogi and sliced pork belly for the family.

Their seafood department is clean and well maintained, no fishy smell at all, whereas SFC, I'm gagging from 2 aisles before I even reach that department and I just want to get heck outta there.  But here at Greenland it's always a more pleasant experience, which means, I spend more time and more money than I should."}
{"text":"This place has everything one might need in an Asian supermarket...

I used to shop at Western Market on Spring Mtn before they shut down. Greenland is much bigger and more spacious, with lots of ready-to-eat foods which are helpful for me who doesn't cook. You can still get your fresh fish and meats from the back, noodles, Asian snacks, and especially their produce. Who doesn't like Korean pears?

You can't go wrong with their food court, I'm always ordering something to go, shop inside for groceries, then come back to pick up my food. Kal-bi, sushi, spicy tofu soup, spicy rice cakes... lots of choices.

I'll be there again next week :)"}
{"text":"well I guess this is one of the few asian super markets around in vegas, at least that I know of.  So gets an extra star just for that.  Otherwise its your run of the mill asian market with a food court.  I tried the jja jang myun here, it was ok,  and it wasn't like the cheapest price (but not sure where to get jja jang myun in vegas so I ended up here when I had my craving).  

I'm sure I would have stumbled onto this place one way or another as it's on a busy street corner....but the first time I came here was when I used yelp to find a post office of all things!  haha  They have a small postal kiosk inside.  

It was fun people watching as I ate my lunch...."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at an Asian supermarket in Las Vegas. They have all the usual suspects but is mainly a Korean market. Great and sometimes intimidating selection of noodles. Awesome selection of ready to eat Korean side dishes as well as great seafood. I didn't see any live seafood but there was some of the best sushi grade fish including salmon, tuna, yellowfin, octopus, etc. at great prices. $18 a lb for sushi grade salmon and tuna. Walked out with fresh sushi grade fish, quail eggs, masago, noodles, and nori. Great selection overall. Nice niche items like fish buns and specialty produce. No Uni : ( But will try the other Asian markets in town. Pre packed and seasoned ready to go belgogi and kalbi. Overall great experience. Even had native Koreans notice I was the only white guy in the store and helped me find the best items as its very difficult for a non native speaker to navigate the items and prices. Love this place and and happy it's in Vegas. Don't have to be in Seattle to get all this stuff! And on the way out had the best Vietnamese Ban Mi. Their food court is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place for their banchan and other foods. I don't actually purchase my normal groceries from Greenland because I find that their prices tend to be a little higher than the other Asian markets in town. 

I am constantly getting their cucumber kimchi, spicy squid, and japchae. They are all very tasty, and it's the only place I know where I can get them ready to go. Make some rice at home and you've got at least three meals!"}
{"text":"168 is my usual Asian market of choice but I decided to try this one for a change of pace- produce section is a lot smaller but this place has sushi-grade fish available in salad-bowl type packs, which I haven't seen elsewhere.

In addition to produce, there's the mandatory giant row of various pastas and multiple rows of condiments, along with an insane amount of udon. I liked the ready-made section, with seaweed salad, fried vermicelli, wings, pancakes, and even sushi rolls. (Side note: there's a sushi stand in the food court making it fresh for less.)*

Minor irritation at the fact that the soba noodles and the soba noodle sauce are nowhere near one another- in fact, the soba noodle sauce is on a random shelf above the frozen gyoza. Too bad I didn't find it until after I looked through every other aisle with bottles for 20 minutes.

And then I was kicking myself to realize I could have asked the cashier, who speaks perfect, fluent English- I think he was actually Hispanic. Guess I need to check my assumptions at the door!

*Without the attached food court, I'd have no reason to come here over 168. We'll see which becomes my preferred stop over time."}
{"text":"Dun Dun DunDunnnn!!!  Time for Juany B's 2nd review!!!...of one of my FAVORITE places!!!

Greenland is this half-Koreans dream come true!  This is where I go to get my Seoul Food on!!!...LOL...I used to always rely on Vietnamese markets to find my Asian supplies...until a friend told me about here...  Seriously kick @ss!!!

So your thinking Greenland, that doesn't sound Korean...well once u walk into the place you'll think differently!  There's a food court with yummy smells coming from each one!  Some of the signs r written in Korean but the folks there r always smiling n willing to help (I've been to 2 and there's like 8-ish different ones...). There's also a couple different shops...I just remember a hair product one and a coffee one I think, but the Bakery stand!!!  Ohhh this lady knws me cuz I ALWAYS stop for something!!!  Lil pastries for like a buck25 each or so...(hint hint--there's a lil tag on the back telling u what each one is, LOL...)

Ok, onto the shopping!!!  Always fresh produce!!!  Great prices, and some hard to find items too...the back does have a fish dept...a little bit of a fish smell in that corner (it really is minimal!), but not NEARLY as bad as some places I've been to...if your looking for fish it's always fresh w/ good selection, they also have a small fridge area w/ a sashimi selection too!

The high point in my book is the back section where they have marinated selection of meats!!!  Kalbi!  Bulgogi!  Spicy chicken!  I love the boneless rib meat the best!!!  Also they weigh the meat, make the price sticker, and then add the extra juice...Brilliant!!!  

Also have a meat fridge selection of Shabu!!!  Tons of different kinda, in different thicknesses...
Further down the line they have more made goodies, like rice cakes, Dop-po-ki!!!, Kim-bap...
For those familiar w/ Korean food you have to have all your little side dishes right?!  Well they have a slew of them in little plastic bins ready for consumption...nom nom nommmm!   =)
Yummy yummy all up in my tummy!

Of course they also have rows and rows of your staples like rice, sauces, ramen, etc etc...additionally also items like porcelain dishes, knives, serving dishes n all...best part you can tell this place is new and well kept CLEAN!!!  It's not crowded like 99market or some of the older ones...not doggin them but u feel claustrophobic n nasty coming out of some other places, not here!!!

Since finding this plce I seriously do like 85% of my shopping here...and if your one of those odd hours working guys/gals...they're open from 9 to midnight!!!  Corner of SpringMtn and Rainbow...enjoy some good shopping/eating!      =)"}
{"text":"just picked up this bad boy from green land. I will have to be more careful in the type of products I choose when shopping here and keep it to just what we need as we don't have many choices in Vegas."}
{"text":"Greenland supermarket is slightly more expensive than 168 and SF for some things, but overall it is nicer and has the widest selection. The food court seems like a plus as well"}
{"text":"Greenland was a highly anticipated opening for me. I love the other asian markets in the valley, but this one is HUGE and was close to the house I lived in when it opened. 

I want to point out, the ratings for Greenland itself are going to be skewed because I am seeing reviews for the food court eateries, and those ARE NOT part of Greenland itself. They are INDEPENDENT shops who lease the space. 

Continuing with Greenland. They have pretty much ALL of my favorite Korean foods all in one place. Before they opened, I would have to stop at both commercial center and the one further down spring mountain (at valley view), to ensure I was able to get all that I wanted. 

I like the pre-prepared meats as my mother did not learn to cook a lot of korean foods growing up as she always had older sisters around to do it for her... so, in turn, I didn't get taught either. 

The ONLY reason that I did not give Greenland a full 5 stars is because twice now I have bought pre-made kal bi that was already turning! It made me sick the last time. :( I really do love this place, though, and I continue to shop there, even with the meat issue. 

I love their prepared sides and it appears they refresh them regularly, and check for freshness regularly, too. They also have a steady supply of kim bahp! The other stores run out around 2pm, 3pm if you're lucky, but I can never get out there that early. 

If you want to check out food reviews, the food court stores are: Soon Tofu, Chapaghetti, and more that I will write down the next time I am out there."}
{"text":"A specialty Korean market with a mix of frozen, fresh and prepared items. It is a smaller store, but does have a nice variety, including large rice section, fresh seafood and marinated meats. Loved the prepared veggies and Kim chi varieties. 

Make a fun healthy dinner from my finds."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this market. Anything and everything I'm looking for or need is here. My only complaint with this place is some of the employees. I've been going here since it has opened and I've only come across a handful of employees who actually has good customer service skills. The rest rarely say hello or even a smile. Great customer service goes along a way."}
{"text":"If you are looking for any type of Asian food item, or any type of Asian item at all, you will find it at Greenland!  My husband looooooves Asian food so we stop in every once in awhile to stock up on Hite and other hard to find food items.  It also give us a reason to go to Chinatown, which is always a good time.  

Not only is Greenland a huge supermarket, they also have a food court full of any Asian food your heart desires, a little bakery that makes everything to order and some K-Pop & J-Pop memorabilia stores.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned, the food court has really taken a big dive in quality and taste. I usually eat here every time I shop for my basic korean supplies.
Most of the dishes I ordered were tasteless and old. Even my old standby, fried korean dumplings was tasteless and greasy. Also the personal hygiene of the front cashier/food handler was outrageous. She was coughing and sneezing into her hand and not washing. Just could not take it! Won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"The food court here probably has one of the best food quantity to cost ratios in Vegas. The tofu beef soup that I ordered at the Soon Tofu stand came with pickled daikon, mayo-based cucumber, pieces of fishcake, kim chee, rice, and a whole fried fish. All of this was just $7.99, a great deal to be stuffed until you are ready to explode.

The cool thing about the food court are there are multiple similar stands selling tofu soup, noodles, rice dishes, and numerous other korean specialties. The prices are all comparable since it appears they all appear to compete for the same demographic.

Tip: The water/complimentary tea is located to the side and is communal between the various stands."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a Korean market in Vegas and we heard about this one so we decided to look around. It was the typical Korean market....it was fun to look around but to me, it's all same since I live around a lot of Korean markets. It was just interesting to find in Vegas. 

We got our dinner here, dumplings, Korean soondae, corn, fried beef, and a lot of Korean snacks. 

It was a fun little adventure driving over here and looking around. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Greenland closely resembles LA's Korean markets except that its selection is much smaller. It sells pretty much all the brands and items I normally purchase but nothing beyond that. I like their ready-to-go side dishes, kim bab (rice rolled in seaweed), fresh oxtail, and Greenland brand dumplings (in the frozen section).  I was bummed out today because I got there too early and they didn't have the kimbab.  I usually come out here 1-2x a month because it's a long way from Henderson; I usually have to stock up on galbi, shabu shabu beef, and black pig pork belly. 

I would have given this place 4 stars but the customer service stunk. I had to bag my own groceries when there were plenty of employees around. I don't mind bagging groceries but I was irked that everyone acted like they were too good to bag groceries and didn't help another cashier out. 

Lastly, the food court is a bit overpriced so I'm hesistant to eat there unless I'm really desperate for Korean food. I'm glad that there is actually a Korean market around here but I wish it was closer so i could get my kimbab fix."}
{"text":"this place is really good! There's a wide variety in the food court and portions are pretty big. If you can't decide try the grilled mackerel or spicy noodles (note its cold!)"}
{"text":"Korean markets are almost always cleaner and more organized than their Chinese or Viet counterparts, though the tradeoff is it's almost always more expensive. Depending on what you are looking for you may not have a choice. For example, Greenland is probably the only market in the Valley that sells uni (seasonal). A tray for $7.99, not too bad, but not like you have any other choices in town.  They've also got several types of marinated kbbq meats ready to grill which I haven't seen anywhere else either. The seafood section is one of the cleanest, but no live fish or crab/lobster tanks. Produce section has mostly Korean specific stuff, even real Korean pears actually from Korea, but again pricey.

If you're into Korean noodles, they have a huge section in the front of the store, though brands that are sold everywhere else such as Nongshim are priced about $1.50 more per pack. Here, Nongshim Black was priced at $6.99; at SF down the street they were $5.49.

Another huge selection that I was not expecting was pickled daikon radish (takuan). I was looking for some at the other markets in town and they all only had about 3-5 brands and every single one either had artificial color Yellow #5, aspertame, and/or MSG. At Greenland I found a few brands that had none of the above offenders and only limited and natural ingredients. If the daikons have artificial coloring, perhaps it was not pickled correctly since the traditional pickling process turns the radish yellow.

Too bad their prices are high, otherwise I'd come shop here more. For that reason, I only shop here if they have something I can't find elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time here today with my family.  Great prices on produce (quality may not be quite as high as Whole Foods, but eh) and fantastic selection of Korean and not-Korean foodstuffs, including but not limited to: Hello Kitty marshmallows, kimchi, pork belly, seafood that moves and grooves, and sauces and oils to satisfy almost any need or craving.  The place is very clean, which I appreciate very much!  

We had eaten lunch at KoMex before our trip to Greenland, otherwise we would have checked out the food court.  Next time.....

I know I'll be coming here a lot.  In fact, I got a few ideas for stocking stuffers from the snack and candy aisle!  :)"}
{"text":"Love korean or japanese food? This is THE place to get it! From fresh uni to tako yaki, jajangmyun to bulgogi, they've got a huge assortment of goodies to choose from! The meat selection is my favorite- last time I went I bought $50 worth of galbi, bulgogi, thinly sliced beef tongue, duck breast, ground meats, pork belly, beef slices for sukiyaki... plus an army of sauces [gochujang, bean paste, fish sauce, ponzu, salad dressings, etc] in all the sizes you could possibly need. There are huge bags of mineral salts, a well supplied produce section, a large refrigerated section with rows of noodles, natto, a huge frozen area with meats & dumplings, etc. I haven't tried the food court yet, but I might next time because the photos look yummy! There are open mini-store areas near the front that are mostly unoccupied, but I'm hoping they'll fill in soon because it has a lot of potential. It's pretty far from my side of town, but it's worth making the trek to stock up on awesome foods that are hard to find. I haven't seen skate or fresh uni anywhere else, and the marinated bulgogi is delicious! If you spend over a certain amount, they offer you a bag of rice for $.99. I'll be going back after my next payday! :}"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time visiting this Korean market. I like the selections they carry esp. the Japanese products which is hard to find.  (I usally stock up at Marukai & Nijiya in Cali.) Today, my shopping experience was not a pleasant one. As I walked through every aisle, I noticed this tall Asian guy in a white jacket following me. He wasn't pushing a cart nor was he carrying a basket. His demeanor was quite strange. He totally gave himself away that he was not there to shop. After 20 minutes in the store, I decided to leave. When I walked up to the cashier to pay for my groceries, I saw that man in the white jacket turn around and talk to one of the employees... #smh"}
{"text":"My favorite asian market. They have everything you can imagine inside the store not just korean but really other asian culture food and products. I am from Hawaii so seeing basically one aisle with all the local comfort snacks and foods through the store. One store that has the most diversity comes too find local style products. The fresh meats (love getting the kalbi; just like back home plus go too regular grocery store aka alberstons or smiths never find that cut of meat), too fresh seafood, and produce all really clean, fresh looking, displayed really nice and organized. The prices are very reasonable for most too all of products.

The food court LOVE the place never thought about checking it out. I usually go there for the market. I wanted too check it out since brother telling me about ramen one of the stores. I ended up getting the meat jun at island style store. It awesome! It exactly like meat jun back home in the islands. The egg batter was just right on not too heavy or light. The dipping sauce was tasty. It comes with rice, mac salad, nice hot fresh clear soup (not sure call it but great starter cleanse the palate so too speak), couple side dishes of kim chee and bean sprouts. Both are really good. I love kim chee in general.

The atmosphere is nice laid back lots of tables and chairs. I never went super crowded so maybe it could get loud? The service is excellent they call your number or not paying attention they come drop off the food. Something makes it different most food courts. All the stores get food on real plates and nothing like strip mall food court all paper/plastic. Nice change is knowing that every store is family run places not chain places see in normal food courts. I been too island style twice but make point few times too try the other stores."}
{"text":"Backstory..

My best friend Kelly is Korean and always used to come here and ask me to go. I had it bookmarked and for some reason beer ventured out. Jump to present time and Kelly has moved back home and I'm heartbroken. To ease the pain and get a place of my bookmarks I decided to finally come here.

Now, I wasn't blown away. Maybe it's because Kelly sends me these items in the mail from Korea so I'm used to it. Or maybe Korean stuff just isn't my thing. I'm more a Mexican meat market type of girl

Okay okay I will get to the review..

This market has high quality fish, but not any other great types of meat. The ones they do have our limited. I felt as I was walking through it was just snacks, chips, munchies etc. they have a ginormous amount of ramen soups. That definitely shocked me. Of course I'm spoiled though and why would I make ramen from a box when I can go to a ramen house that delivers it fresh for practically almost the same price. 

My husband got their coffee. It's in te picture. He's ridiculously obsessed with it and it's all that gets him through his long days at work. Swears it's better than Starbucks or mad hatter. 

It was very cool to see there was a food court outside the supermarket that had sushi, ramen, tofu and BBQ grilled type foods. We tried the grilled one. Thought it was a inexpensive. Just wished I would have liked it more. She said it came with two sides. The sides being potato, broccoli, fish patty, macaroni salad and beet salad. Went with potatoes and fish patty. Fish party was so fishy if couldn't eat it. The potatoes were delicious but ice cold. Which made it difficult to eat. The BBQ chicken though was extremely tender and delicious. Not much BBQ taste but it was too good to care. I wouldn't come back to this restaurant. 

Next we decided to try a roll from the sushi food place and the rolls are only 5.99. My husband got the dragon roll ad thought it was amazing for the price. We will def be back to the sushi place. 

Warning food courts only take cash. 

Market we shall meet again but it's just for fun to walk around or come for a specific reason, like the sushi in the food court."}
{"text":"this is my to go place for when i need my shishito peppers fix (twisted peppers on the label). its a typical los angeles style korea market. beauty store, bakery, cafe, korean old lady style clothes store, computer repair store, travel agency, post office, jewelry, etc... the supermarket has good produce. over priced korean snacks. the food court is ok. the employees are usually busy playing on their phones and occasionally dont see customers waiting in front of them. they had some good  food there when they first opened up, but most of the stuff there now is just your standard  korean food court stuff."}
{"text":"The parking lot at Greenland is less hectic than 168 Market's, but in my opinion that's the only redeeming quality about it. Inside, it is cramped and organized in a way that does not make sense. If you have a cart, get ready to squeeze your way past people because there is barely any room in the aisles. Although this market has a variety of Asian goods, it is primarily a Korean market. Probably my fault for coming here in the first place because it's named Greenland KOREAN supermarket, but be aware that if you are looking for Japanese ingredients it might be difficult to find what you need. 

I was looking for packaged mochi for the New Year, and the kind I usually buy does not need refrigeration. After looking alllllll over the store, I finally found it shoved between Korean rice cakes in a corner of the refrigerated section. They also did not carry a vegetable that is commonly used in Japanese New Year cooking, which I found at 168 last year. 

Even though I was after specific things, I don't feel as though my shopping trip here should have been so frustrating and claustrophobic."}
{"text":"I purchased two Okinawa Soba (Okinawan Noodle made in Hawaii) on Tuesday, and as soon as I got home (about 15min.) I put them in the freezer.  This is how a raw or partially cooked noodles should be stored until ready to cook them.  Today, I opened one of the package to cook it and I found some mold starting to grow on the noodles.

Unfortunately, Greenland Market doesn't store them frozen.  Just stacked up on a open refrigerator.  This is how mold grows.  I stopped buying raw or partially cooked noodles (especially the Yakisoba) from 168 Market for this reason, and 168 is even worse.  Fortunately enough, Okinawa Soba noodles are pretty thick, so, I was able to pick the ones with the mold on it, and just cut that part off.  After boiling them, I examined it and the rest was fine; however, some people may have an allergic reaction if they eat those noodles.  I have also checked the other pack in the freezer by opening the outer bag and sure enough, mold.  I'm afraid to imagine what the other noodles look like in that stack.....  I've also bought some curry yakisoba that was in that stack.  I have yet to examine those.

Raw or partially cooked noodles should always be kept frozen while fresh.  When using them, just put the frozen noodles in the boiling water"}
{"text":"Ahh Greenland is my new favorite market. So much goodness.  I spent almost an hour in the store looking around and bought nothing. I was just over whelmed with all the great selection they had and I'd probably leave with a least a couple wagons full easily.  Being late I didn't want to be a pain to anyone so I'll save it to next time.
First thing, straight to the back where there was fresh blue crab still kicking, ahi trays and other fresh seafood, all the Korean marinated meats ready to just be cooked, Kalbi, bulgogi, spicy chicken,..., all kinds of Kimchi variations, bottles of soju for a round a buck, ton of frozen mandu dumplings and pastries, sushi, a Hawaiian aisle with all my favorite treats, the list goes on. 

I also like that it's closer to the west side of town so I don't have to rush to get home before my Asian ice cream and goods don't melt. Bring a cooler if you live on the other side of town.

There's also a really good food court which I haven't tried yet because they were all closed when I was there @ 10pm. But from the menu and prices on the wall  I'll probably coming back for some quick bites."}
{"text":"Greenland Supermarket is right around the corner from my parent's house. So when I needed to pick up some Korean chili powder to make Momofuku Daikon kim chee, I immediately thought of Greenland. I think I got the right one, though it was hard to tell since only a small portion of the label was translated into English. I tried to get help from one of the workers, but he didn't speak much English so I stumbled through.

While there, we picked up some marinated bulgogi and seaweed salad. My wife cooked up the bulgogi with some sliced onions. Yummmm!

Greenland has a nice supply of fish and Asian produce. It's a great place to go if you're looking for these items."}
{"text":"Greenland Supermarket is located in Las Vegas' Korea Town Plaza on Spring Mountain Rd.  The grocery store has a good fusion of Japanese, Korean and Chinese food products. The vendors that surround the grocery store raise the shopping experience, for me. We enjoy the convenience of the food court, the post office, jewelry vendor, beauty supply shop, and bakery which occupy the space around the Greenland grocery store.  The grocery store is good for their sushi supplies, selection of teas, noodles, hot sauces, cooking utensils, marinating sauce, sushi salmon, fish cakes, and rice. They also have a wide selection of Banchan near the back of the store. The environment is mostly clean and organized. 

During our trip here today, we first stopped by Hot Tofu at the food court for some awesome Bulgogi, then continued and did some light grocery shopping (rice, salmon, Sriracha sauce, and Banchan), and lastly visited Epidor (the bakery stand) on the way out for some tasty white bean & green bean buns. 

It was a fun visit...we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband spent a year stationed in South Korea, so he's developed a love for Korean food.

He loves taking us here to shop in the market, and I love soju! 
The food court is amazing!  It's pretty affordable, but very fresh! Bring a fork if you're not well versed in chop sticks!"}
{"text":"Didn't buy anything from the actual supermarket but they had a great selection of korean ingredients. The vegetables were very old, however. Most of them were wilted or covered in fruit flies though the daily necessities (ie. green onions) were still fresh. The supermarket is super convenient and tasty. The ban-chans were just enough and the noodles/soups that I ordered tasted very homey and warming. The price was right as well. If I ever moved to Las Vegas, this is where I would get all my korean grocery needs!"}
{"text":"This is the only major Korean market in Vegas so I come here often. They have pretty much everything I need. The customer service could be better. The cashiers never say hi. Also, I don't like how they stopped using the reward card. Other than that, there really isn't any better Korean market in Vegas so this one will have to suffice. :p"}
{"text":"I love this freakin' store. When I first came here, I was like WOW! It's like back in Korea! Awesome. They have a great selection of different food and fresh produce. They also have all your banchan needs and other prepared foods - if I need some kimbap on the fly, Greenland it is! 
They also have a pretty awesome food court. The portions are big and they have water coolers available for your needs. They also have other little shops inside the store like a pharmacy which came in handy the other day when I need to pick up aloe water for Baboy and some children's medicine for Hunnie Bunnie!"}
{"text":"Korean Supermarket with a food court in the building. Good food choices in the house... From Island style to Japanese to Korean... Cheap and great food... Try it !!!"}
{"text":"When I have my Asian snack craving this is the spot for me.  Prices are average but they don't carry much of the snacks I like, however, I can get easily carried away.  

They do have a food court and several other shops that carry clothing, makeup, and the like.  I mostly go to the food court, especially, for lunch.  The prices are fairly reasonable and to my surprise pretty good.  

Parking is ample making it easy."}
{"text":"Even in the world of specialty Asian Supermarkets, there is no one-stop-shop, but if I can have only one, I think it would be Greenland.

Greenland Supermarket stands out for a few of reasons:
1. Sashimi Grade Fish--they always have fresh, sashimi grade salmon and tuna...sometime they have tuna belly and yellowtail as well. 
*1a. Wikipedia states that \"fishing and fish exporting is a major part of the Greenlandic economy\" ...probably why they carry sashimi grade fish...
2. Sake--Greenland has the largest selection of sake of the Asian markets in Vegas, including some high quality Junmai Daiginj?, Daiginj?, and Junmai Ginj? sakes.
*2a. I was told that Greenland is the world's largest island...so largest sake selection and largest island...
3. Eats--In addition to the groceries, Greenland itself has a good variety of Korean Banchan, as well as some noodles, and dumplings, and the like... but they also have a great food court (as food courts go) that offers different types of Asian options. Across from the food court is L'epid'or Bakery, a wonderful Korean Bakery.
*3a. Kiviak is a traditional Inuit food of Greenland made by stuffing Auks (birds) in a hollowed-out body cavity of a seal, sealed with seal grease and covered with large rock pile for 3-18 months...probably not as tasty as the aforementioned Greenland Supermarket food court items.

There are still reasons to go to other Asian markets, but Greenland Supermarket is my favorite.

* Some information may actually pertain to the country of Greenland...it can be hard to decipher this whole internet thingy."}
{"text":"Well lit, clean, courteous help, great looking produce, organized, well maintained, and the marinated bulgogi and sides taste great.  Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Best asian market in vegas! I love getting all my korean food here."}
{"text":"Very clean store. I like to go there for specific Korean spices and some food. Their produce is pricy. The cut and packaged meats are packaged cleanly. 

Their bakery is one of the best. Try that on your way out."}
{"text":"This is the first time i've ever been to this place,and it sure as hell wont be the last :).They have everything you could want here from ramen,to chilli paste,drinks,frozen foods,and ofcouse SNACKS!!! They have the nicest erray here besides nakata japan.And the people in there are actually nice unlike some of the other supermarkets in china town.But back to the snacks,I could be in those 2 isles for a half an hour just looking at them :) I got a few things wich i will post later,so far everything is good! I'd defently recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"I got ramen noodle yesterday for lunch, but noodle became brown and got moldy.
I like Japanese snack but they don't carry enough anymore. Only 1good thing they open till 11:00pm."}
{"text":"I love it! They have this place in the very back that they cook authentic korean food. The halmeoni that coordinates it and I think that she is the chef and she is great! She can be a little tough, but don't mind her she's just very busy. The food is authentic korean and home cooked style. I wish she would cook some of the other favorites like bulgogi and galbi. I've always wondered why they don't. If she did I'll be there every day! 

The store part is like every other Asian market. The produce is excellent quality! I love it!"}
{"text":"Korean Supermarket, Most stuff here is pricey compare to other Asian supermarkets.  For the damn food count the prices here are crazy that I can just go to an nice restaurant to eat. Shhsh But if you need anything Korean specialties for cooking they have it here."}
{"text":"I couldn't have said it better than Vivian S. She pretty much covered everything regarding the food court here. Greenland Supermarket is a little gem for visitors who want to experience something better (like diversity of Asian food, etc.) than what's offered on the Las Vegas Strip.

I was pleasantly surprised to take a short drive to this location to just browse through the aisles and aisles and aisles of hard to find Asian products and foods that aren't so common in the south. The variety is tremendous and I definitely stocked up on my snacks. Just go here."}
{"text":"I'm grading very harsh because we do shop here. However, as someone else said it's no HMart. On top of that it is crammed tight with thin aisles. And, unfortunately, the customers are awful which affects the overall shopping experience. I'm used to shopping in Asian markets, but really almost got in a few fights and I'm extremely docile. 

Staff is very friendly and they have decent selection for small size."}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal was or if we came on a bad night but the produce section was horrid. All of the greens were wilted and brown. The spinach was waterlogged and swampy brown. The broccoli was soft and I could bend the stalks easily. Same with the carrots, I could bend them and they looked dry. The napa cabbage was bruised and brown - like someone used them in a recreational activity. Not one thing was fresh. I couldn't stomach buying any produce there. 

On a positive note, they did have some dry goods I needed such as udon soup base, aji pon ponzu, and udon noodle packets. Other than that, I was able to grab my produce down the street at the Vietnamese SF market - the produce was much more promising. 

I'm hoping it was just an off night for them and they aren't typically this terrible. I will give them another shot on a different night - maybe the night that they actually get their fresh shipment in."}
{"text":"I go here all the time because the food isn't so bad and it's a reasonable price. The lady in the food court \"hot tofu\" is VERY RUDE. She doesn't have no sense of customer service. I asked her for napkins when its clearly stacked right infront of her register.. She told me to go to the other ones and gave me a bad attitude. Very stuck up. I asked her \"why does it even matter?\" And she completely ignored what I had to say."}
{"text":"Not sure if this should be listed seperately but the small food court has started to open restaurants.  This first is a chinese/korean place. I had the the champong/chajangmyun combo.  The champong needed a little more seasoning and the chajangmyun was a little runnier than I like it but bother were pretty good.  Especially for $8.99.  They only have a few dishes.  Looks like the Hawaiian  restaurant Island Style is also moving in shortly."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of fish and I have always loved this store. Today I went and bought fish and asked for them to be filleted. I went about doing the rest of my shopping and came back and picked up my fish and checked out. When I got home I will stunned to find that all they did was take a meat cleaver and hack the fish in 2. They were full of guts and not cleaned at all. I am extremely disappointed in the fish cleaning service provided by Greenland."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever seen a Korean Supermarket of this magnitude -cough maybe i'm just uncultured and need to explore more- but there's fresh Korean sides in the back near the meat and the typical asian-market items. There's also some guy-hair dye and gatsby near the bath & kitchen area. There's also some coal-soap that my friend got to have her family try. She checked it online and it's supposed to be good.

I needed toothpaste and got some pinesalt toothpaste to spice life up a little and try it out. It's really kewl and feels good lol. The toothpaste feels more gel-like when you squeeze it out of the bottle than other kinds.

There's also a food court, baked goods in the front (at least when I was there), and a little store with some clothes that's worth a look."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.  good korean super market.  like all other asian markets in the china town area it has asian type veggies you don't find in  nonasan markets.  although, some of the veggies look bleah!  there are a wide assortment of korean eats, from prepared meats to pickled vegetables.  alot of seafood,  make pokee buyin the mix in their small hawaiian section.  will go again."}
{"text":"I probably come here once every time I'm in Vegas because there's always a need to stock up on drinks/snacks/ramen or pick up some fresh kimchi or get some bulgogi in the food court.

Greenland always has plenty of people because it's a nice oriental market (mainly Korean). 

My favorite things are the pastries from the bakery, the food court, sac-sac grape drinks, mandoo, kimchi, and everything else in the place."}
{"text":"My favorite, and honestly only, Korean grocery store in Vegas. Not only can you buy close to anything you need to prepare a Korean meal, they sell pre marinated meats that only require cooking. Great to keep around for a quick meal. I love the ramen selection as well as the kimchee, sides, and other food items they sell ready to eat. And if you aren't quite sure what you want they have a food court where you can try different dishes before you buy ingredients to make it yourself. I like to go for a quick meal when I'm craving Korean and don't wNt to do the whole K-BBQ thing."}
{"text":"One of the bigger Korean Grocery store in Vegas, the price is moderate. Great service and nice foodcourt as well. Inside the store includes a pharmacy which has top notch service as well as a cosmetic store and a bakery :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a Korean supermarket with authentic Korean food and groceries. It's a grocery store/bakery/food court all in one! The food court is small, but the food has HUGE flavors. They serve your typical Korean favorites and even if you don't know what everything is, just point to whatever on the menu and it's bound to be good. Also, they have HUGE portions, so make sure you bring a buddy to share. 

The grocery store has a very extensive selection. The produce looked really fresh and their marinated meats are AWESOME. They have pork, beef, chicken, and lamb all pre-marinated that you can buy by the pound and it's SO TASTY. I would go out of my way to come here and get my groceries."}
{"text":"A Korean only market with many selections. Very clean store, only thing was all the boxes on the floor in between the isles. Great prices. Got four pounds of bulgogi, $6.99 a pound."}
{"text":"If nothing else I like Greenland Market for their meat. I love shabu shabu. That being said, my favorite shabu shabu restaurant is all the way across town from where I live. I can make it at home, but slicing meat that thin is just not easy (and I'm lazy.) Enter Greenland market, which is up the street from where I work. No need to ask the butcher for special service, they have it already sliced up in nice neat little packages. And bulgogi, ah, already marinated and ready to pop on the grill plate. My mom was really happy with some of the fried fish selections. I really liked the well stocked Japanese curry and furikake aisle. Another big plus is the selection of Lock n Lock they had in the housewares section. I love making bento and have been looking for a local supplier of these containers. Also, I don't know if I just haven't been looking hard enough but they carry Aijinomoto potstickers in the big bags. I can usually only find these at Seafood City."}
{"text":"Love to shop there! They have everything from pre made sides to marinated Kalbi, Bulgogi, Chicken, Pork belly and Cutlets. And if you would like to make your own, they have all the ingredients you'll need there. I also love their Food Court. Sushi, some Hawaiian and Korean foods at decent price compared to DJK and some other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"I got the pork-kimchi soon tofu soup and fish with the #33 chapaghetti.

The tofu soup is something I wanted to compare to Mr. Tofu, but the soup here was so bland and tasteless. However, the small fish it came in was really delicious (besides the fact that there are many bones and it is a pain to remove them). 

The jjajangmyeon from Chapaghetti is an awesome dish that everyone must try! It is something I remember eating growing up as a child. Also, the noodles came with a sweet & sour chicken, which I think has a lot of MSG because it was so slammed with the flavor of MSG, I forced myself to swallow it.

Last stop, dessert (fish cakes) from Tiffany's Coffee Shop.

Please try the Red Bean fish cakes from here. It is an authentic Korean dish. The fish cakes are filled with red beans and surrounded by a waffle-like texture that comes out delicious, warm, and perfect during the winter time (in my opinion). They also make ice cream out of this, which I think is a great idea during the Las Vegas heat (look for the ice cream version in the market)."}
{"text":"Great Prices! great customer Service! 

Clean and neat! 
Always welcoming and greets customers! 

Clean veggies and grocery items!"}
{"text":"Great place to shop and a wonderful place to eat at. I love grabbing a bite to eat in their food court before I start my shopping. The produce is usually very good at good prices. The varity of food is very nice here, I can usually find the items I need."}
{"text":"Feeling like Korean food but not feeling like K-POP blasting at Soyo? You're in luck! Greenland Supermarket has a ton of offerings within the food court and a great assortment of items you can buy in the grocery store itself. I usually make it out here to by some pre-marinated meats that I grill at home and my favorite banchan (boiled peanuts, beansprouts, spicy anchovies, seaweed salad and fish cakes). They also sell raw shrimp unfrozen with heads intact, which is really hard to find at your local Smith's or Albertsons. They're not as big as the other grocery stories further down in Chinatown, but they also carry a lot of Asian staples (Japanese curry, variety of sauces, candies, noodles, tea, etc.). Pro TIp: Watch out for the expiration dates on the banchan, some fall quite sooner than others."}
{"text":"Greenland might just be my new favorite Asian market in Vegas!!! My man and I decided to hit this place up (over one of our other favs, the newer SF market) to see if we could find uni... and lo, and behold, we hit the jackpot and then some!! We found our scrumptious uni inside the seafood area where a conspicuous \"A\" (a la NV Dept. of Health) was proudly displayed behind the counter. But we were in for treat after treat.... shisito peppers, frozen BBQ Unagi, sushi-quality tuna, tako and hamachi (SLURP), and red bean mochi that is delish!! It doesn't get much better than this, I tell you!! I also discovered a new fav at one of the food stalls in the front of the store-- a tuna kimchi rice roll. YUM!! I'm salivating just thinking about it..... 

Actually, the cutest part: we were looking for Unagi sauce and a passerby, who took pity on us, tried to help us hunt it down. As our searches met with failure, he asked his Japanese born wife to start looking for it too. Pretty soon, the whole store was involved!!! 

Go to Greenland -- you will find some great Asian food (cooked or uncooked) at decent prices, and you'll meet some nice folks!!"}
{"text":"Greenland is Located at the northeast corner of Spring Mountain and Rainbow, and has a pretty nice selection of Korean food, and merchandise.   

Of all the Asian markets in Las Vegas, Greenland is the cleanest and has one of the best deals of prepared Korean boneless short ribs."}
{"text":"WOW wish we had more time to explore the store. We were pleasantly surprised to see an eating area at the entrance of the store. Next time we come, we will be sure to eat there and then do our shopping. We live about 25 miles away, so I can't visit as often as I'd like. We bought some Korean ginseng, mochiko flour, and some Korean snacks."}
{"text":"Gone down hill fast.   Produce always sucks.  Prices are way high. Some of the prepared foodsate okay.  Meat prices are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great staff, all around from cashier to produce.

The market is clean and spacious with great sales. 

I like the fact that its open, and not too crowded like other Asian markets I've been too. And not to mention their variety of freshly made food."}
{"text":"I literally was in awe when I first came here. It's sooo much cleaner than the other Asian supermarkets and doesn't smell like an old aquarium. They have a food court, which I love and is delicious, great portions, a bakery section with ready to eat cakes, breads and desserts, other small stands and of course the grocery part. The produce was fresh and neatly arranged and they have a crazy amount of Asian specialty ingredients! I really like how they have marinated meat at the deli counter as well as sliced and packaged meats for convenience. Ban chan is also available and comes in a wide variety. They even have a small section of ready to eat sushi rolls and bentos. Towards the back of the store there's basically a ramen room filled with any and all types of noodles. And more towards the back are house/beauty supplies and other essentials. 

I could spend a good couple hours looking through the aisles and testing all the different foods. 

It's a great grocery store!"}
{"text":"One of the many reasons I stop quite often at Greenland Supermarket is fresh seafood...from whole fish to sashimi grade fillet of tuna and salmon, Greenland has rare selections you won't find everywhere else. For whole fish, they will scale, butterfly, and wash your fish for you. They are not going to go out of their way to offer you a bag of courtesy ice like Whole Food would, but they will give it to you upon your request....so don't forget to ask. 

Their sake collection is above average and fresh fruits and vegetables are vibrant--always carrying seasonal produce. Apple pears and soshito peppers are good now.  Even though they are known for Korean groceries, they also carry a variety of international products. 

Their food court offers many choices from sushi, pho, Chinese-Korean fusion, to of course Korean food.....as good as you can expect for a quick and simple food court at fairly reasonable price. Also, don't forget to stop at Lepidor bakery on the way out.

It may not have fresh air like whole foods but fresh fish and produce await you.

Open everyday from 8am to 11pm.....really!!!"}
{"text":"Omg get the love roll from the sushi place in the food court it's only $6.99 plus tax it's so delicious and I'm excited I don't have to drive to Charleston for island style there's a second one in the food court can get my saimen fix and it's down the street and go get red bean fish cakes at the boba cafe next to lees can this place get any better lol"}
{"text":"I wasn't too sure what i was about to get myself into. I was being sent for Korean supplies, but usually go to a Chinese market for the foods I need. Today, grocery lists include radish kimchi and napa cabbage kimchi. I got lost in the aisles and aisles of delicious spicy ramen noodles but eventually, i made it out with everything I needed."}
{"text":"Just got told about this place but by looking at the pictures i will definitely go and check it out im going to go to island style 2 i heard they make one killa meat juhn"}
{"text":"I love korean food so it's no surprise that I like this supermarket. I like how you can get meats for kbbq. It's your typical asian supermarket. I also like how within the supermarket there's a food court, small shops, and a bakery. The bakery inside has great desserts all for under $5! 

The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because of their kimchi. I'm not a huge stock person, and they happen to fill their kimchi containers with mostly stock rather than the leaves. It also didn't taste as great to me until I fried it. 

Overall, good place!"}
{"text":"If I ever want kalbi or bulgogi to cook at home, this is THE ONLY market I'll buy it from.

Greenland supermarket is a brand new Asian store located on Spring Mountain and Rainbow.  They are an excellent source for very fresh ingredients ranging from vegetables to meats.  They have the typical array of fish and seafood, but what I love is how fresh their meat and fruit selection is.  For some reason I can't find pork and steak as good as this market.  They also carry all my favorite snacks that I used to buy back home, and at reasonable prices.

I come here for the real Fuji apples--the ones that are as big as a softball--and their ready to cook meats.  You can get a pound of bulgogi for 2.49 and cook it at home, saving yourself over 30 dollars if you went out to eat.  Their marination is excellent, and I bought the korean bbq plate and single burner to use on the dining table, but you can cook it in a frying pan if you want.  I just love the experience at home.

Their food court is okay so far.  I love the bakery in the entryway because their cakes are the EXACT same cakes I found in Japan on my way here.  That was a nice find.  Also, their Island Cuisine food kiosk is good for bbq.  You have to try the bbq plate.

Whether it's an odd Asian ingredient you need or some snacks, this is a great store to find all your Asian delights, and at great prices, too."}
{"text":"Wish I found this place sooner... Now I buy all my fatty soups here! The prices are great, compared to other local shops. I am not so crazy of how small the place is though. I have been to the one in Las Vegas and man that one is huge! Still it is what it is and it is good. Everything is neat and at it's place. The shops on the left hand side make up for it though. I must say the beer is good haha."}
{"text":"Found nothing that I liked so I guess I'm gonna give an updated review if and when I come back and find something that I liked"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst customer service!  How hard is it to price an item?  I went to check out a bag of dumplings and the cashier wasn't able to ring it up since this \"new\" item wasn't in their system yet.  They couldn't even accommodate their customers and make up a price to sell as miscellaneous?  I even asked the manager and she just refused to sell it to me.  Really?  I'm just trying to buy a bag of dumplings!!!  If you aren't ready to sell an item, then there's no reason to put it out on the floor yet!"}
{"text":"If I could shop here all the time, I would. I love everything from the hot and cold side dishes, fresh seafood, noodle/rice/dumpling selection, snacks, marinated meats to the kitchen gadgets at the back. 

The food court is really delicious as well. I forgot the names of the vendors but I have had the pleasure to enjoy hot tofu soup, spicy tuna rolls, kalbi and tons of delicious side dishes. The food court serves the food in dishes as if you were dining in at a restaurant so don't expect your typical styrofoam and plastic utensils that you would get in most US food courts. They have a counter all the way inside next to the boba tea shop to drop off your used dishes and utensils."}
{"text":"The store has some really good items, like authentic Korean foods and wares. My only complaint is the vegetable department. Some of them are very moldy and rotten. I still come because there are other things worth buying in there."}
{"text":"I have to say, I really enjoy Greenland! I lived by El Paso, TX for a while and their Korean markets have nothing on Greenland! This market has everything I need and a lot of extras! From marinated meats to cooked foods; Japanese candy to cookware and hair dye, this place has it all. I grew up in Japan, but my mom is Korean and I come here often. It has a little bit of everything and I love it here! Plus the employees help you if you have any questions and they're very friendly."}
{"text":"ONLY KOREAN SUPERMARKET IN VEGAS

I have been to this market when it first opened & have been coming here for the past few years. Their quilt of products have definately gone down & the cleanliness of the place seems to be getting a little bad. One of my biggest peeves of a market is when there is a weird fishy smell that lingers around it is just unpleasant. 

Some days the smell is gone & it is usually during the winter time while the smell comes back during the summer time. 

Items also seems to be a hit or miss kind of thing here."}
{"text":"This is a quite large albeit disorganized Korean Supermarket. There are plenty of items to choose from, to include premade foods like steamed mandu, kimbop, blood sausage etc:
There is a meat case as well as a fish case, and a restaurant of sorts in the far back of the store. At the entrance is several small boutique type restaurants, and a rice cake vendor.
OK Chicken may very well be the best fried chicken I have ever had. It was hot, juicy, flavorful all the way to the bone and just absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend this chicken joint to anyone shopping at the store!!!"}
{"text":"Clean, but tends to be expensive on certain items... Good place to get marinaded meats for grilling, and the food court in front has a great selection of food to eat, but is on the pricey side for what it is. It does offer some items that you can't find at other asian supermarkets in the area, but if you want good prices on sake, go to Lee's discount liquor or other liquor stores."}
{"text":"I get in touch with my inner Korean every time I come here. No better way to do it than through food that reminds me of home. 

Greenland was built after Albertson's had shut down a couple years back. It's exciting that the Korean community is growing in Vegas. Now I don't have to drive down to LA to get my Korean market fix. Sure, there are smaller Korean markets in town, but Greenland is the first of its kind. 

They have great produce selection for fair prices...sometimes. My mom likes to buy her apples there but complains that its much more expensive than the supermarket down the street from our house. They have a good selection of meats, too. You can find different cuts of beef and pork already marinated and ready for the grill! They also have a good selection of side dishes. This comes in handy when we get too lazy to make our own. Furthermore, we all have to agree that Korean cookies are the best! You can find an isle-ful of sweets here. If that's not enough, there's a small area in the front where they sell pastries and cakes - all fresh baked and delivered to Greenland every day. These pastries are my guilty pleasure. 

Their pre-made hot food (i.e. jap-chae) is buy one get one half off after 8 PM! But beware, the cashiers have to manually punch it in and they always forget to do so. I lost count how many times my mom went back to the store huffin' and puffin', all angry at the fact they keep forgetting. 

Food isn't the only thing they sell here. They also carry household items too. I love the  red Korean rubber gloves that you use for dishwashing. Seriously, better quality than the typical yellow ones you find at Wal-Mart! I also bought a back scratcher from here - you know, the Asian wooden ones. 

Greenland has an amazing food court! You can find your typical Korean stews and soups here. Have a craving for some jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) or jjamppong (Korean spicy seafood soup)? Well, you don't even have to pick between the two. One stand serves both in a bowl divided in half. Feeling like sushi? They have a stand serving your favorite rolls. Want something sweet? They have a little boba/coffee/snow ice shop adjacent to the food court to satisfy your sweet tooth. Most of these stands open at 11 AM. Perfect for lunch! 

Not craving Korean? It's okay, there's a Subway a few doors down. See, something for everyone."}
{"text":"I came here for kimchi and there was a bunch of different brands to choose from. Marinated meats for good prices. Nice market, will return."}
{"text":"Came by last minute knowing what we wanted, some person not in uniform of any kind stopped us that the door waving his arms saying \"closed\" when they clearly had enough time lol. Nice to"}
{"text":"I go here beacuse right outside there is a guy who does car washes from his truck. They get pretty close to detailing your vehicle for a good price. Inside and out. Love them."}
{"text":"wow this is korean market, i like it.
i think this is new market at vegas.
iam not Korean people, but i like korean food.
before inside market , they have korean food court too,
to many item korean food they sale.ready to eat.  unbelieveble.
the price cheaper than korean resto, i like it.
i love korean bakery too.the bakery regular the same japanese  bakery.
if i go again to vegas, iam not worry about the food.
if you like korean food, i recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the Asian supermarkets in Chinatown but Greenland is different.

First off this place is clean! No overwhelming fish smell (99 Ranch!) or messy produce/deli sections. However, the aisles are small and hard to navigate if the store is busy. The aisles aren't organized that well either. Chips and assortments of noodles can be found all over the place. I noticed that the prices on some of the items were a big higher than say, SF Market or Seafood City but Greenland has a lot more selection and variety. For me, this super market is my one-stop-shop for anything KBBQ: The deli/butcher shop features pre-marinated bulgogi, kalbi ribs, chicken or pretty much anything you need.

But what really sets this place apart is the food court. Small eateries that make up the food court offer a great opportunity to sample some unique Korean and broader Asian food if you don't have the time to cook it up yourself at home. The sweets/boba spot offers excellent smoothies and the sushi stand serves up freshly made rolls. Definitely worth checking out especially if you are in search for a certain Korean grocery item."}
{"text":"Very rude and unfriendly employees!! Overpriced compare to other Asian stores but no choice since this is only Korean Market in town."}
{"text":"Greenland as a supermarket is pretty cool. I do like the variety they provide for people with things such as rice, fruits, frozen items, Korean specialties, etc. The food court though has gone down hill to say the least compared to when it first opened. The food court was my favorite part of going to Greenland and people loved going there, but now the food court is relatively empty and dead now.

The supermarket itself is nice. My favorite part is shopping for where all the meat is because of all the different Korean meats you can get. They range from different kinds of beef, spicy pork, and chicken. Their snacks that they have, are filled with variety. My personal favorite are the shrimp crackers! Those are a MUST try. I do like these seaweed flavored chips by Calbee (if I remember correctly). They are different, but a good different for me. It may sound really Asian of me, but I like that they have all the different kinds of rice you can choose from. I like short grained rice, and they do a really good job of having a variety of those. Line things that I didn't like is that they discontinued their rewards program, for whatever reason. I think that was pretty selfish of them, but hey, what can you do about it?

This Greenland supermarket has a good court in it, so that has to play a role in my rating. I really really loved the good court. I would go with my family at least a few times a month, and then they started changing. Things became different and less people started showing up for whatever reason, and then the restaurants started closing down. I don't really know what happened, but I was bummed out about it. Currently, they reopened it with a few restaurants up, but it is nowhere near the same as it use to. People who did come during the prime of its life know how it was, and it was amazing. I don't think it can ever go back to being like that, but we could sure hope one day."}
{"text":"This review is for the food court. You gotta give this local place a shot. You wouldn't expect a food court to be in this unsuspecting korean super market but the food selections are great. You can get Hawaiian plate lunch at the Island spot in the corner. I like the korean all i combo with tofu soup at Hot Tofu ($15.95) place and if you are there with Friends share the spicy fried korean chicken from OK Chicken. Put in your order, then grab groceries and by the time you are done your dinner is ready."}
{"text":"I call this Little Koreatown in Vegas. Prices are awesome. Food court is great. When facing the entrance there's a puppy store on the left for your puppy fix. On the right is a great, authentic Korean restaurant called Lee's. Next to Lee's is a Vegan place that I have yet to try. The snack aisle in Greenland has a great selection that's reasonably priced. Love the section in the back with Korean household stuff like socks for your chair legs to avoid scuffing up the floors."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 5 star rating. Nothing more needs to be said."}
{"text":"Since I am on a weight loss kick right now, I decided to make up my own cool-as-sh*t diet called the \"Miso Soup, Brown Rice, Tofu and Seaweed For As Long As It Takes\" diet. I was in dire need of these ingredients, and as quickly as possible. Plus, I called around and this was one of the \"for sure\" places open later on a Sunday. Skinny me, here I come! 

Initially, I thought this was a Japanese market, but my Yelp homeslice Tetsuro P. informed me that it's actually a Korean market that has been taken over by the local Japanese community. I had to giggle cuz that's awesome, but then I thought.... WHERE YOU AT, KOREA? Yall need to roll up and Gangnam Style yo fly as*es back up in your own market. There's enough love and gochujang paste to go 'round. 

Aaaaaa-neee-wayzzz,

This place is spacious! It was much larger than I thought it would be. Very inviting. Brightly lit, and despite the isles being a little bit small and overcrowded, things were well organized. It was almost like they were trying to cram too much Asian goodness into the place. 

I never felt judged or weird here, like at some of the Asian markets I have been to in the past. It's bad enough not being Asian in one of these joints, but having tattoos and stretched ears usually makes me stand out like a sore thumb. NOT HERE! I actually saw like, three other alt chicks besides me shopping. Sweet. Possible alternate reason I wasn't judged: There are more Mexicans working here then Asians. Real talk.

Now to the little stores. This place has a few perimeter shops as well as a food court. Because of the aforementioned diet, I unfortunately could not sample the delights that the food court promised. Sad day.

I did check out the coffee shop/bakery. Not much to report there. *shrug* Maybe it's better during the day. Then I popped into the cosmetics store. LOVE! I only looked around for maybe five minutes, mainly because I was afraid of buying something. Everything looked legit. Next time I go, I will definitely be making a purchase there. They had makeup, hair dye, lashes, face creams, that sort of thing. All from Japan or Korea.

They also had a bunch of empty stores, just waiting for some really bomb stuff to fill 'em. Like Mitsuwa Marketplace, they should get a bookstore, liquor store, ceramics place, and a sweet bakery. I would die of happiness. My heart so filled with joy, it would proceed to burst into teeny, tiny, pulpy pieces inside of my chest."}
{"text":"Korean supermarket located on the north east corner of Rainbow and Spring Mtn. I've been coming here since it opened. Most of the smaller ones have closed down and this is by far a lot larger and cleaner. 

I come here and to 168 Market for all my Asian food needs. I rarely venture outside of the two and I don't have to go out to LA constantly as they have what I need here! 

I usually get some of my Japanese foods here as well, since they have some of the better quality stuff for a decent price. I usually get my udon and soba here along with soup stocks and sauces that make up the dishes. 

I love getting Korean snacks here! I wouldn't know what to do without some of them. They have an aisle full of Korean snacks and a lot of them are my favorite from my childhood when I used to visit family in Korea which is a huge plus!! 

I get a lot of meats from here as well! Specifically if I'm buying meats for KBBQ or Hot pot for home. They have a wide selection and the quality is better than most of the other supermarkets. I also get a lot of my produce here because it's usually cheaper. 

Since it's a typical Asian supermarket they have household items as well. They have a wide selection of Asian household items that you wouldn't find anywhere else really and are a LOT better than Wal-mart. Usually end up getting pots/pans, some dishes, rubber gloves, chopsticks, and etc. from here. 

The food court is good for after shopping fillings or even before. They're pretty quick and have a wide range of foods available. It's not top quality but it's good food still and I like coming here to just chill and eat something when I'm craving something Korean."}
{"text":"Seriously, Greenland, SERIOUSLY! This has by far kicked the sh!t out of any Asian grocery market in the Las Vegas Valley and surrounding cities. The cleanest supermarket as far as Asian ones go. And we all know how it usually is (example: 99 Ranch). They have a whole food court to the right as you walk in, and a bakery on the left. It is still a fairly new complex so a lot of the \"office space\" hasn't been occupied yet! I am excited to see what else comes in. 

Anywhoooooo, I could have sworn I went here at least 3 times in the week that I first found out about this place!! What makes this place even better is the fact that they have cute Korean ladies making samples of the different food every single time I go! They've got some personality and are very funny too! (\"You don't need to read what it is! Just try it!\" or \"Hungry time! Come on!\") 

Now the banchan has got to be some of the best selection! I LOVE THE ROASTED FISHCAKE! AHHH, and the bean sprouts! and the pickled daikon! and the different selections of kimchi! Even ready to take kimbap! WOW... just WOW! The pre-packaged bulgogi is YUMMY! And, if you get the bulgogi in the case, they weigh the meat first, price that, and then ask if you want more sauce! SCORE! I frequent this section of the store the most! Not to mention i just love  the non-stop yummy smells coming from behind the banchan display. 

They even have other things besides food, like teapots, plates, fans... a bunch of random home goods and personal care items on the left side of the store. I thought about the hair dye... haha, but that will need to come with a translator! I did buy a cute little teapot for under $10 though. 

I'm also happy that the people at the check-out counter are friendly! And the prices are very reasonable too! Especially for a lot of the snacks!

Even though it's a little further down the way for me, I'd still make the drive to this place! PLUS, they're open until midnight! YAY."}
{"text":"I do love Greenland.  I love the concessions on the outside.  Getting lunch before going in. Coming out of the grocery store to pick up a boba drink before going home.  Korean skin care and Japanese soft and moist pastries.  Purchasing already made dinner items and their bonchon items, except for kimchee.  My husband always wants to get the super oversized bottle but I have learned that lesson several years ago. Or marinated meats so my husband can grill.

Its just a great place to shop.  Wish it were closer to my home because I'd shop there all the time.

5-stars for this establishment and their fresh produce."}
{"text":"I like this place, huge selection of pasta. Great wonton selection and sauces. Great thinly sliced meats are great too and hard to find. Seaweed and miso ingredients along plenty of tea selections."}
{"text":"This Korean supermarket now has a steady following of Koreans and other patrons.  When it first opened it's door, business was slow and there wasn't as much selection of food products and produce items to choose from.  But now business has picked up significantly and their items are more expansive and fresh.  They have a deli section that serves package japchae, gimbap, sundae and other Korean delicacy items.  If you go at the right time, the food that is packed may be freshly made and still hot.  I will start coming here to get my japchae fix from now on. 

The food court outside the supermarket is equally as busy now.  This is my first time eating at this food court.  I was pleasantly surprised by the selection of food booths to choose from.  There were quite a few people in their food court area, so the food must not be bad.  For a food court, the menu items are a little bit on the expensive side, but you can expect Korean food to be more pricey.  I ordered the haejangguk from Mr. Color Food.  It basically is a vegetable soup made with Korean spices.  You also get a bowl of rice with the soup and a few pickles radishes.  For $7, it was quite a nice meal for lunch.  It was delish and a refreshing change from what I usually eat during lunch time at work.  I would go back and try their seafood soup next time."}
{"text":"This is a very well organized Asian supermarket but it's mostly korean.  It seems like a very basic place.  I think their selection of the premade items is what makes this place more of a good place.  I think the food court is overly priced and it's nothing you can't make at home.  I miss the food courts of Korean subway stations and Singaporian stations, the value is top notch there and infintely faster food service."}
{"text":"I'd been here before and when I walked through the door it had a horrible smell. So I just grabbed my condiments and left.
When I came yesterday, it was like I was in a completely different place.
I started at the bakery in the front of the \"mall\". I picked up several different treats. Which reminds me, I'm about to have a piece of cake now!
The bakery place was good. Fantastic prices (although someone said they were high, No way!). The selection was limited. I heard they had a storefront and it burned down. 
We went to the coffee house for some coffee and the 2 items that I picked, they didn't have. I wanted to try the peppermint chai tea and then the chocolate frosty thingy. They could make the chocolate thing but without whipped cream. I'm never ever gonna have a blended drink without whipped cream. That's crazy talk.
I heard they might be closing this place and I hope it's not true. I'd like to come back and grab some stuff next time around."}
{"text":"Love it here!!!  Great selection of fresh produce and snacks."}
{"text":"There's a big Korean shopping center here - they even have a post office in it.  Greenland is the flagship store.  It's a large one and has a huge variety of Korean foods,  including some I haven't seen elsewhere.  Prices do seem to be a bit on the high side; both compared to Korean places in California and Oregon, and, for produce, compared to SF Market down the street a ways.  Still, its the place to shop in Las Vegas if you want to get Korean groceries.  

There's a food court out in front of the supermarket.  I suspect i could have me a tasty lunch there. In the supermarket they have lots of types of banchan, a table of varieties of tteok. I wish they had Greenland where I live."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Asian Market.  I love the food court out in front. They have buddae jiggae! I didn't expect it.  It has all sorts of food to try out.  I'm from Colorado,  so I would say that this is the closest to HMart that LV has to offer.  I go to this place and 168. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by before the Beer BQ UYE because I couldn't find the Regia Salvadorean Lager at Total Wine and Cardenas which is odd because Total Wine has buku beer selection, and Cardenas carries all kinds of Hispanic brews????

We first tasted this beer at Rincon Catratcho while chowing down on pupusas and as far as I know, This Central American Beer is only found in this Korean supermarket. Try a bottle if you're looking for something different. Its easy drinking, add some lime and salt and you're good to go!...ALOHA!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(336/365) \"Regia Sold Here\""}
{"text":"I like their produce selection. Their veggies are always super fresh and usually at a really good price. My only complaint is the service. The cashiers are always unfriendly. They never smile, never say thank you, nothing. 

As for the grocery selection in itself they do have a wide selection and I love their kimchee. Their kimchee is always fresh and not sour like some places. I also like their pre made soup like their seaweed soup. It had tons of seaweed and great flavor.

Why aren't things clearly priced and labeled here? I feel like every other item I looked at was missing a price. Sorry, but don't feel like buying something blindly. I don't remember it being like this before."}
{"text":"It is so hard finding a clean and fresh Asian market in the Las Vegas area. Ever since I moved to Vegas I luckily came across the Greenland market. Their produce is always neatly arranged and fresh, along with their many items on other isles.

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when you need help finding something no one is really around and when you do come in contact with an employee they do NOT smile or have any vibe of friendliness. They just scan your stuff, wait for your money and give your change/receipt to you. Some don't even tell you the price of your products or the change you have back - you need to watch what they scan on the screen.  PLUUUUSSS. When you walk in it stinks. So after you hit the revolving doors ladies and gents, hold your breath until after you've reached the registers.. Unless you dig that sort of scent."}
{"text":"I may be a little biased, but 5 stars for my peoples food! I'm surprised at how clean this store is. Usually Asian supermarkets are a wee-bit gross and smell a little off.. not this place! They also have a small food court with decent Korean food! 

Also, another A+ thing about this place is the parking lot. Super spacious and plenty of spots. So unusual for an Asian supermarket.

Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Every Asian mom's favorite grocery store. One of my favorites, too, for that matter.

I get my rice, Asian fruits, veggies, nori, and Korean bbq and banchan from here. 
Talk about Asian snacks galore. Not enough flavored KitKats but, enough gummy candies to make up for it. 

They seriously have some of the tastiest (homemade) banhans evs. Love their pickled radishes and seaweed salad.

Just recently started making my own miso salmon and they have a ridiculous amount of miso selection that I took 15 minutes to decide which one to purchase.

Oddly enough, they best part of Greenland is that they have a food court outside of the grocery store that I can eat various Asian/Korean foods before buying my groceries."}
{"text":"A generally clean and well stocked market.  It is a plus that it has a food court too."}
{"text":"Only large Korean supermarket in Las Vegas. They have  food court and some shops inside of supermarket. But no comparison to LA.  You can pretty much get what you need here for Korean dishes. Employees  here are the most unfriendly including the baggers. All these years shopping  here I don't think I ever heard \"thank you for being a good customer\"  lol. Whatever I don't have a choice as far as Korean supermarket goes.

{"text":"This is about as good as it gets for Korean supermarkets. They serve a wide variety of fresh and packaged foods, as well as prepared foods. There is also a small food court outside and a small bakery stand as well. The prices are fair and the food seems very fresh. They are pretty busy so I imagine turnover of their inventory is pretty good. A great find!"}
{"text":"Full of all food things Asian and other accoutrements, plenty of authentic smells to go along with it. The produce area is always worth a gander as is their meat/seafood counter...very live and squirmy....

I can always find that one hard to find 'ingredient' I need to complete my feast!"}
{"text":"Has all of your Korean needs! Plus the food court is pretty great! They even have a small Korean cosmetics store."}
{"text":"Greenland market!

One of the few familiar grocery stores I see in Las Vegas.
This Greenland Market is alot bigger, more well maintained, and at least have fresh items - unlike most other asian grocers.

Bought most of my korean snacks here, and they have everything from fruits/veggies, meats, seafood, hair dye, and home goods like rice cookers! (Just in case anyone needs a rice cooker)

They have a bakery right outside the registers, and a small food court. The outside is a row full of eateries! Will def come back for all my asian foods."}
{"text":"Finally! I've stumbled on a great Korean supermarket here in Vegas. It was about time too. Having lived in LA for several years next to Koreatown, the choices for Korean food and groceries were pretty much endless. Imagine my disappointment after moving to Vegas and not having a place to get my Korean fix.. the horror!

Enter Greenland.. they have a huge variety and selection of Korean products/snacks/drinks/etc that you would expect from an Asian supermarket. My favorite part is the kimchee and side dishes that they sell in the back. Word on the street is that they're made fresh in-house! The price is decent and there is a huge selection of dishes to satiate your pickled needs. I grabbed the cucumer salad, bean sprouts and radish kim chee. A perfect supplement to almost any meal at home!

The kim chee is probably going to be the main reason I come back here. Honestly, I can find cheaper groceries (sometimes) at other Asian supermarkets. But the kim chee is a winner in my book, so hello Greenland. 

There is a food court adjacent to the market with various vendors including Korean (obviously), Japanese and Chinese cuisine. There is ample parking right outside as well."}
{"text":"Greenland is my go-to Korean supermarket. Although the produce section is a bit lacking, I mainly go for the deli in the back that serves fresh laver rolls, vermicelli, and a variety of banchan. They also have sashimi grade ahi and salmon. The marinated meat for barbecuing is a bit on the pricier side. I've found it cheaper to buy meat from Seafood City and marinate them on my own. Otherwise, Greenland is also great for a multitude of Asian and Korean snacks. They are usually stocked with Melona bars and mochi ice cream. I also like that they have nearly every type of ramen or udon brand ever."}
{"text":"Love coming here to grocery shop AND eat! Defiantly a big variety to choose from, loads of delicious side dishes for sell in the market as well as marinated meat. The food court never fails. Love the sushi and black bean paste noodles, yuuuum. Give it a try if you're indecisive because they have a big variety to choose from! Also very friendly staffs!!"}
{"text":"I tried to take pictures on my cell Phone.   I was stopped by the security guard and told to delete them.  I will not be returning to this store.  Please be open and free.

{"text":"I was making my way to the other Asian Markets in Chinatown when I came across this place..

I fell in love instantly. They weren't busy when I first went there around 9pm. I really like that they close at midnight everyday. I tend to do most of my shopping at night when places aren't so busy.

Besides being a market, they have a mini food court, a little side that sells baked goods, and little stores varying from beauty products to clothing.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how bright and clean it was. All the fruits and vegetables looked fresh. As with places that have seafood, there was a fishy smell, but not as bad as other places tend to be.

The meat looks really good and on my second trip there I had gotten some marinated short ribs and they were to die for. I'm not sure what prices should be for that kind of thing, but it wasn't bad at all. The gentleman that got the meat for me weighed it then added a little bit more for free. They have a ton of side dishes to go with your meal that are made fresh available there too. During the afternoon they tend to have free samples of food like curry and iced coffee.

They also have some frozen Hawaiian food! I forgot about that. The prices are a lot cheaper that what I used to pay so I'm definitely stopping there more often. In fact, a lot of things in there were a lot cheaper than the bigger stores here.

I highly recommend this place. I don't know much about Korean food and ingredients, but I'm definitely willing to learn thanks to this market!"}
{"text":"I have been driving past Greenland Supermarket during all those months (years) that it was being renovated from the previous occupant and was always going to stop after it really opened.  Today I took the time to stop and I did a lot of looking.

Now I know where to go for fresh or frozen fish whether common or exotic.  The marinated meats looked great.  There were so many varieties of kimchi I'm going to need help from some fellow Yelpers before I buy.

The whole place was really well stocked with Asian foods of all kinds.  I really enjoyed the stop."}
{"text":"I mainly go here for the kimchi which i like a lot. I think their dessert section is kinda weak. Still a good place to go to for Asian food stuff though."}
{"text":"I've been to Seoul and the produce aisle reminded me of an outdoor Korean market.  Awesome selection of fruits and veggies. I couldn't tell you what I would do with half of the stuff I saw in this store but eager to find out!  Thrilling was to find my kids favorite marshmallow snacks (which we looked for at the ABC store and they discontinued them!) and picked up some California rolls for an afternoon bite.  This is a huge Korean market offering an array of goods and services!  They even have a U.S. Post Office inside!  Travel Agency, Food Court, and a pharmacy is coming.  Neat housewares department with rice cookers, chopsticks and sake china. Clean store, friendly service.  I think the prices are cheaper at other Asian stores, so this place wasn't screaming deals.  But since I'm usually in that area I'll be back for more kid treats-assuming they've earned them."}
{"text":"Premade Korean side dishes, premarinated Korean meats, authentic Korean food court, and a lot of other goodies.  Sure the fish section can be overpowering when walking into the market.  Actually, it's rather disturbing how smelly it is.

But I still YELP this place! 

When you walk into the building to your right are the restaurants.  

Starting directly next to the market entrance is a place not too many people are familiar with.  All I know is you've gotta get the pigs feet (which is sliced up for you), it comes with sesame leaves, lettuce, sauce, jalapeno slices, garlic and rice.  I take the meet out of the sliced pigs feet, wrap a little bit of everything into the sesame leaf...OH, BOY!  Party for your taste buds. 

Next to that is Island Style.  Yummy Yummy!  My favs are Bim Bim Bap with chicken, pan fried dumplings (on request), Guk Su Bap, and Hawaiin Sun Green Tea.

Just after, is a sushi joint.  I've only gotten the Korean Style Jirashi...absolutely love it.

Then Chapgetti...momma gets the Jaja Meoung.  It's here favorite along with some sweet potatoes.

The next restaurant is stuck between Chapgetti and the new Thai restaurant.  It too is oh, so good.  We usually get the steamed pork buns."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here to browse and eating at the food court. This Korean mart is huge. They have everything from snacks to housewares. I swear they have every Korean instant ramen brand plus some Japanese ramen too. You can pretty much find everything here for Korean person's need. 

They also have small concession stores like clothing, herbs, rice cakes etc. 

Parking lot is huge. It's never a problem. You gotta love that!"}
{"text":"I bought 7 frozen bags of Japanese cold noodle last night. 4 out of 7 were not eatable. There was mold on the noodle. Please be careful to purchase the noodle. The bag was not see through. I should've opened the bags and checked the noodle right in front of the cashier..."}
{"text":"My girl is from Japan and she offered to cook dinner for me when we first started dating over a year ago. I've been hooked since!

Even though this is a \"Korean Supermarket\" they carry Japanese and Chinese food products and other goods. Every time we feel like doing sushi, but not all you can eat, this is the first place we hit up for sushi grade fish. They have a small section stocked with salmon, tuna, and a third fish that isn't coming to mind. If you want more selection you'll have to go down to the display case where they hold the yellow tail, squid, octopus and whatever other sashimi they managed to get that day.

While their fresh seafood leaves something to be desired, their frozen seafood is extensive and well stocked (they always have soft shell crab) Their produce is also very fresh and only a few times they didn't have what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Greenland is my korean supermarket for all my korean needs. Honestly they do not have fresh produce.  I just shop for mostly packaged items and korean goodies.  They set out premade side dishes but not offer a wide variety.  I'm pretty dissappointed in the premade dishes, i alway have been purchasing these items until this week as i was eating at home i found 2 hairs in it..YUCK! totally lost my appetite. Not to mention, my brother bought a packaged bulgogo (marinated meat) and after he fried it up and sat down to eat he saw a roach in the mix.  The food court is not so great either.  I feel like the place has gone down with the premade items.  I will be shopping here only because its the closest korean market for us."}
{"text":"I came here when they just opened at 8 AM on Saturday.  The people restocking the shelves were extremely rude and unfriendly.  One man actually whistled at me.  That is completely unacceptable, unprofessional, and disgusting.  I'd give negative stars if I could.  I will not come back here."}
{"text":"Closest place you'll find to a kyo-po market like the ones in Santa Clara off El Camino. They have frozen pre-marinated kalbi/bulgogi along with freshly marinated ones you can buy at the butcher counter. This place has all the Korean spices, cooking sauces, snacks, etc... 

Large parking lot, clean market, legit products... good prices."}
{"text":"Greenland is like the only place I know of in the Las Vegas area where I can get a small hint of the Korean life compared to the International Supermarket. I've been here countless times to get small things like some of the food that Korean celebrities endorse, whether it's the instant ramen, the coffee, or the soju. The food inside the market place is well prepared and is always wonderful. The most I've spent here was about $85 and that was all on the snacks. You may think \"who spends $85 on snacks?!\" but believe me. The snacks are so cheap it's as if one of bags of bin bin were 10¢ each! I did try the food court for the first time a week or two ago and it left me wanting more. I had the black bean noodle and it was just absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"One of two Korean markets here in Las Vegas.  I shop at Greenland Supermarket at least once a week. They sell mainly Korean foods and products but do carry other Asian & American foods/products. 

Their pre-made food section is awesome! Offerings include kimbap, grilled fish, sundae, various banchan including fresh kimchi, etc...  It's a great place to take home or grab a quick & delicious meal.  We usually get kimbap and a side along with a pack of wooden chopsticks (for just $.89 cents) for lunch. A filling meal for two for under $10!  Bring your own napkins and eat in the adjoining food court. Oh and don't forget to order a drink from Volcano Cafe :) 

Prices vary.  Most items are affordable while others are more on the expensive side. 
Store is clean and well stocked. Employees are friendly & helpful.  Definitely check them out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My first time in an international grocery store in Vegas so I can't really compare to others but the selection was amazing! I was in awe the whole time and made more than a few impulse purchases. The prices are fair and there is a food court and bakery with great smells. A really fun experience, although may be overwhelming for some as there's lots of variety and I don't know much about Korean cuisine or language to navigate through the store. Overall I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Greenland Korean Supermarket not only offers Korean food specialties but also carries one of the best (and cleanest) seafood options available this side of Vegas (uni anyone?) as well as premarinated meats like calbi or bulgogi. We're waiting for the in-store tofu shop to open which advertises freshly made tofu. Greenland also houses smaller shops, a pretty good bakeshop, and a growing foodcourt offering Korean fastfood eateries. Among the eateries currently open, Chapaghetti and Island Pacific are the standouts, with menus that include traditional bibimbap, jajangmyun and kimchi dumplings paired with reasonable prices. Greenland stays open until midnight, perfect for late day shoppers such as myself."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I enjoy coming here to get my Korean ingredients when I'm feeling some soondubu or bulgogi. The vegetables are always fresh just like the meat and they also have a wide array of snacks, seasonings and cooked food ready to go. Whenever I come here, I always get the fish cakes and potstickers plus a new small container of kimchi:o) 

I forgot to mention that they also sell complete sets of Korean plates, pots, rice cookers and other stuff you use in your kitchen. It's the place to load up on portable gas cans for your gas burners. On your way out, try the multiple restaurants they have outside and the customer service is always good."}
{"text":"Clean store. Well stocked & organized shelves. Kimchi & prepared  side dishes are fresh. Some items are pricier compared to other oriental groceries, but their quality is better.  My favorite place to go for everything Korean. 

I'm glad they have a food court.  Fast service, delicious food & reasonable price. We are regulars here :)"}
{"text":"I always get the haedupbap from Sakura sushi and it never disappoints. The vegetables and fish are fresh and delicious. My bf got jajangmyeon/jampong and it was also very good. Will definitely be coming back as always. Always a good quick meal before doing some shopping!"}
{"text":"I'm half korean and always searching for my groceries to make homemade food from.... I've always found what I needed and reasonably priced too!! I go in for 1 team and walk out spending $200. Great place!"}
{"text":"Prices are highest of all asian grocery store. Most smart vegas shoppers go to 168 groceries about 2 miles east. 
Greenland supermarket had low prices back in the days when they had competitors but now that most competitors have gone under, they have increased the prices on most of the items."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Moving back to Las Vegas from Korea and not being Korean I wAs worried I wouldn't be able to access some of the delicuous meals as well as the amazing fresh and delicuous ingredients that are used in Korean Meals. 

The grocery store is great to just walk around a look at all the fresh products and beautiful produce. I could honestly just walk around and enjoy myself. I brought my mother and she couldn't wait to grab a basket and start filling it up with the fresh seafood and produce plus the pre marinated and seasoned meat! 

I was in love with the food court! I felt like I was back in Korea grabbing a quick hot delicious and fully satisfying dish of bossam or big bowl of kimchi stew and all the perfectly suited banchan. 

I'm also please with the hair salon I can get my MAGIK straight touch ups!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate ASIAN KINGDOM!  You get an ultimate shopping experience with samples and music.  Now how cool is that?  I really, really, REALLY LOVE how this place gives you pre-marinated meat.  I love to shop for all my Korean food addictions here, and I get it all in one sweep.  Kal-bi, bugolgi, kimchi, and pork belly! All crossed out in one area.  I also love their various choice of ramen, I could stand in the aisle for hours reading every single one and putting them into my cart.  And get this, THEY EVEN HAVE MY CHILDHOOD DRINK! Milkis = YUMMMMMMM!"}
{"text":"If only they were closer to the Henderson Area!!!

Not only do they have an amazing grocery, ( I have flash backs of the grocery near Halmoni's house in Osan ),
But the food court has so many choices, it's hard to decide what to get.

I definite must if you need authentic Korean food items!"}
{"text":"They have everything I need to make my filipino meals if I can't go all the way to seafood city. It's close to where my place is at, on spring mountain and rainbow. It's right across from a target one of my favorite stores to check out when I'm doing errands. Just recently I discovered that they have household supplies in the store. It's awesome and so cheap! Most of the things are written in Chinese so you have got to be careful making sure you're getting something that you could actually use. They had a juicer for fruits and vegetables with seeds that was very cheap, cheaper than a juicer you would find at Target or Walmart. 

I got my refrigerator handle covers here and they were ao adorable! Only 3$! They have a variety of vegetables and good meat selection. Also they are pretty big in selling Asian snacks and desserts. It is a good and quick place to get things if you live around the area. The parking lot is laid out well. Before you enter the store there's little booths that sell bread and a shop that sells clothes, accessories, and makeup imported from parts of Asia I believe. 

I believe there is also a U.S. postal service where you can drop of your mail, which is convenient for people who need to do errands as well as go to the post office. I definitely recommend everybody to come check this place out! I believe there's only two or three locations, two of them are in California and there is only one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian market. It's has lots of selections in vegetables, fruits, noodles, candies, bakery and other Asian foodie needs. It's always clean too =) I go to Greenland weekly for freshly prepared banchan, marinated Korean BBQ meats, yogurt drinks, and fresh produce. Other Asian markets don't have much friendly service, but Greenland feels welcoming and familiar, so it doesn't feel too exotic for those who aren't used to checking out international markets."}
{"text":"The stars are for the food court! I still cannot get over how good my unagi don was! My friends also tried their bulgogi potato pizza, we're coming back to try more of the food :D

as for grocery, love the meats and noodles, these products are not available at every asian market! This is my favorite place to go for my asian food needs!"}
{"text":"Going to Greenland Supermarket is a major trek for me as I live on the opposite side of town, but is it worth it? YES. YES INDEED.

Upon entering there is a mall-type area, with shops on the left and a food court to the right. Straight ahead is the supermarket itself. The vegetable and fruit selection were bright and fresh, though my friend said a few items seemed pricey. What I really liked was their selection of yogurt drinks (i.e. Yakult). We had been looking for ones that do not contain many additives or sugar and were quite surprised that the selection here had just what we wanted.

This store is huge and we spent well over an hour maneuvering through the aisles. 

I will definitely try to come back again."}
{"text":"This Asian supermarket has emphasis on Korean goods.  I don't know a lot of Korean cuisine and culture, but my girlfriend and I have taken an interest lately.  I really enjoy coming here.  There is plenty of parking.  It's not as busy as some of the Asian supermarkets in Chinatown.  There are several Korean businesses in the front when you walk in.  Try the food court to the right; I recommend Island Style.  I love the snack foods available at Greenland Market i.e., cookies and chips.  There are some items from this place that we have made a staple in our pantry.  I'm assuming that this place is a must for Korean households, but even non-Koreans will have a fun visit (assuming you are open minded to other cuisine from other cultures)."}
{"text":"Since no one has really listed all of the food court shoppes, here they are, from the vendor closest to the entrance inward:

MIRAK
Typical Korean food here. Meat dishes and soups. I've never tried this one. See photos for menu. 

SONG'S FAMILY
They have Kim chi fried rice, ramen for $3 or $4 although I think it's instant or about $6 with rice cakes. Haven't gotten a chance to try this either.  

SAKURA SUSHI
Typical sushi rolls (Philadelphia, sunset, spicy albacore, tempura.) Cheap California rolls for $4. Also Haedukbibimbap (which is pretty much a Korean poke bowl) for $8 and katsu for $9. 

RED GATE WOK
More of a Korean/Chinese fusion. Lots of chicken options here like orange chicken. Also jjangmyeon, which are a good portion of noodles with a thick black sauce. Always served with pickled radish. 

HOT TOFU
I've eaten at this place the most. I've had soondubu which a tofu soup served bubbling hot. Ask for an egg to be cracked in it as its bubbling. Served with a side of rice and fish and lots of banchan. Good price and really fills you up. I've also had the spicy noodles and pickled radish with cold noodle soup. These use thin rice noodles. The cold soup (it had ice in it!! :o) was delightfully surprising and really refreshing on a warm day. 

PHO THIEN HUONG
This one isn't Korean. It's Vietnamese. Extremely large menu. Pho, rice dishes, mi (egg noodles), bun (vermicelli noodles), egg rolls, banh cuon if you come early. My boyfriend tried the pho and he described it as very watery. Meat wasn't too fresh and you're better off going to the pho restaurant next door. Can't speak for the other menu items here though. 

So many choices and good food. Can't complain."}
{"text":"You name it, they slice it! Talk about do it yourself teppanyaki heaven. Greenland is my go-to place for hosting a dinner party. The sliced meat section is to die for. They even have wagyu beef ready for the grill (It's a smoking $25.00 a pound and it's worth every penny). Sliced rib-eye, sirloin, beef belly, sirloin OH MY!

Set up a griddle in the middle of your dining table, add some veggies, rice papers and dipping sauce and you've got yourself a party that goes all night long."}
{"text":"Well I think the food court are ok; not great , not bad... But the grocery store is nice. well organized. Some times the items just runs out and taking so long to put on display. Maybe their shipment is not often enough? I go there regularly and happy with what i am getting."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of OC because there's a lot of Korean super markets in Orange County with Food courts inside their grocery stores. I love the concept!

Korean Food: 5/5 I love Korean food and at Green Land I love their meat section. You can pick from and variety of different meats to BBQ that are already per-marinated to Barbeque. I love the their side dishes from sea weed salad to cold noodles to Kimchi and radish so yummie. I really like their selection of rice cakes golly they have a lot. 

Veggies: 2/5 Its a hit or miss, they usually have way better prices than your average grocery store but I find a lot of their produce aren't fresh. Some are even beginning to welt and rot away. 

Food Court: 3/5 Like I said I love the concept but I don't the selection. In OC the selection are all different but at Greenland they seem all to be noodle stews. I want tofu stews or Korean BBQ at a fraction of the prices because it is in deed still fast Asian food. 

Overall if your looking for a Korean dinner at home go here. This place is Korea away from home for Koreans :)"}
{"text":"I love the sashimi.  Take it home and slice it up - save money.  The kimchee is good and fresh.  I'd be lost without this grocery store really."}
{"text":"My go to Korean grocery store in Las Vegas. 

Pros:
- HUGE selection. If you are looking for something you'd go to an Asian grocery store for, chances are very likely you will find it at Greenland. Lots of Korean goodies too. Veggies, fruits, fresh/frozen seafood, meat, kimchi, rice, candy, instant noodles... The list is endless. 

I don't want to go over my entire my grocery list but a few things I always come to Greenland for is to replenish my rice (huge bags) and soy sauce (big tin gallon). I always get a couple pounds of the frozen sliced ribeye to make bulgogi and tofu to make Soondubu and Mapo Tofu too. 

Cons:
- I think they only get a shipment of certain goods once a week. There's times when I make the trip to Greenland and there are absolutely no bean sprouts when they usually have a few rows full!
- They have an area where workers make banchan and they sell premade packages of it. I've tried various kimchis, ddukbokki, japchae, jun... Not very good
- The food court is not impressive. I've had their Bibimbap, Yukaejang, Jajang-myun, Tang-sooyuk at all different places in the food court, hoping that the next time will be better. I've learned my lesson...

I come here once every two weeks or so to fill up on groceries. I give it a 4/5 because if this grocery store didn't exist, I'm not sure what I would do. It's the only Asian grocery store in Las Vegas that has the Korean goods I need!"}
{"text":"Love this supermarket. The only downfall is I can't read half of the items because most of it is not in English. I would shop and buy more if I knew what I was reading. They do have a few takeout restaurants inside before you enter the market so that's pretty cool."}
{"text":"wow, this place is awesome. It has a great variety of fruits and veggies section, as well as the common core of canned products, a wide selections of snacks whether they are candies, cookies, or just freshly made at the store. They also have a section that is household products. They have a meat/fish market and \"banchan\" section too! I love this huge selection of things under one roof. As you come in, they have small stores clothings, accessories and services such as postal and airfare. I love the kitchen section, looks like many simple, delish dishes would fly out of their venues, but sadly they are under construction/remodel~ oh well... They also have a small \"tokk\" stand and a korean pastry booth. Love love love, food! Im glad I stopped by to check this place out in my visit to LAS VEGAS. Can't wait to cook me some lovely dinner with some delicacies I picked up at the store, and finish it off with \"shik hae\" (sweet rice water) yum yum yum :)"}
{"text":"Came with the sole purpose of picking up the hot food to go items like kimbop, chap jae (sorry about the spelling) but at 10am we were too early for some items. Ended up getting kimbop, braised tofu, kimche. The braised tofu and kimche were full of flavor. Surprisingly this time around the kimbop was a little bland so i used the kimche sauce as a flavoring. 
The grocery section provided a variety of seaweed wrappers and snack packs. I also picked up bulgogi marinade but had a hard time determining the price because the cpu codes from the product to the shelf didn't match. I had to bring it up to the cashier to determine the cost. Overall, i love the hot to go items and variety of Korean Products."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat.  The stands at the food court are all battling each other for customers.  So the prices are great. You can get a whole fish for around $11 and delicious too.  Don't go for those deals where you order something and get a free bowl of noodles because those free noodles are bland.  Be careful, the portions are huge. You can easily share a dish with a friend.  And most of the stands will give you different types of kimchee for a nominal price if they charge you at all.  

Walk around and look at the photos of different dishes displayed at each stand and don't be afraid to ask questions. Check out the grocery store as well.  They have great prices for everything. I pick up some good asian beers at reasonable prices at this grocery store. You can get korean beers that you can't find at other grocery stores."}
{"text":"I went to Greenland Supermarket a couple of weeks ago with my friend. She was nice enough to walk down each isle with me and give me a tour on what everything is. I grew up going to Asian markets but this was my first time in a Korean market. She was also there to point me in the right direction to this fabulous Chili paste that I love...move over Sriracha! 

We first started in the far left side of the store where they have everything from hair dye to kitchen knick knacks. I love their little Sake sets and they even have waffle makers that will put hearts on your waffles. I fought off urges to get cute stuff and bought some practical cleaning supplies. One of my favorites worth mentioning was this dish rag that had all these holes in it. If you can imagine Madonna back in the day in her Lucky Star video with her black mesh blouse. It kind of looked like that but it was thicker and pink. The holes help all the dirty dish water to escape and because the material is hard it's easy getting off caked on food off your plates. It works like a dream! 

They have pre marinated Kalbi it's a great quick fix if you are entertaining or need a Kalbi stash in your freezer. Greenland has a decent seafood area it's not the biggest I've seen but I if they sell Dungeoness crab at a good rate then I don't mind. I didn't have a chance to check though. 

Greenland also has the biggest selection I've ever seen of soy sauce, and sesame oil. I never knew there were that many. I of course picked up that chili paste which is yummy! 

This supermarket  has a vast selection of exotic vegetables and fruits to choose from. I saw that they sold Lotus Root ...I've never tasted it but would love to try it. All this talk of food reminds me of their great food court filled with deliciousness. The food court alone is worth making a trip down here!"}
{"text":"On the corner of Rainbow and Spring Mountain, there's a big sign that says Korea Town. And while we can't compete with LA or NYC's version, I'll gladly come to this market for all my bibimap, sprout and kimchi cravings. I'd rather much come here than Seafood City (the Filipino version; it's a cluster fuck and I feel like I'm at a bad family reunion) or Ranch 99 (the parking is the WORST) because it's less crowded, rowdy, loud and better organized.They have a food court and bakery if you're so interested. They have lots of pre-cooked food to take home with you at a reasonable price. I got some 2 sushi rolls for less than $5. Booyah. 

Although, the employees are alienating and don't really smile, they're quick at check-out and get the job done. Plus, they played Gangnam Style while I looked at a dead fish on ice. Where else can I do that? Whole Foods? I think not!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  My fella took me here and it knocked my socks off!  Probably the cleanest of all Asian super markets that I have been to in town so far.  Also, being the very white girl that I am, I often get poor service/treatment when I need help but not here!  They were super friendly!  The food court has amazing Korean options and boy am I excited to head back real soon!"}
{"text":"Greenland is the largest Asian market in town.  Though there are many options on Spring Mountain and around town, there are some things that are only found here or just cheaper here than some of the other markets.

I had a few things on my list but generally just wandered each aisle slowly (and painfully to my friend Susan, who was starving but waited for me to traverse the entire food part of the market), picking up anything that sounded interesting to me.  I had been here before and noticed that this is the only place in town that carries ito en's green tea-fruit blends.  I spotted a new set of flavors since they were first released around the time of the World Tea Expo last summer, and bought the remaining four green tea-coconut blends...I cannot wait to try this!

I also noticed they have abalone (from Chile they told me), but did not buy any today.  I also was unable to find soft shell crabs this time.  I picked up lamb shabu shabu meat, and noticed there was a nice selection of sliced beef tongue meat...mmm!  No yuzu tobiko, but there was wasabi tobiko frozen.  I got some uni and hamachi.  I do love the produce section, where I got a huge amount of shishito peppers for $2, lemongrass (3 stalks for 99 cents), and ginger.

In the aisles, I sought out sushi vinegar, mirin, sansho pepper, layu (chile sesame oil), half size nori sheets, yamamotoyama loose genmaicha tea for a friend's birthday who loves it, yuzu kosho, Japanese sweet rice, hijiki....I did well today!  There is so much to see here, and I could spend hours looking through the aisles.  The small stuff adds up quickly though!  There is also a nice food court in front of the store in the plaza as well as L'epidor bakery."}
{"text":"It's one of two Korean grocery stores in Las Vegas. I can find some stuff only at this store and that is the only reason I go. It's a bit of a commute, it's pricey, selection isn't that large and customer service is not a priority.

- Customer Service - 2/5
- Product Selection - 2/5
- Price - 2/5 (Pricey) $$
- Fresh Fish - 3/5
- Produce 2/5 (Korean specific produce at times but not always)
- Readymade Food - 2.5/5 (hot)
- Always keep an eye out for the expiration date!"}
{"text":"You ever read your old reviews and wonder what the heck were you thinking?

Anyway, I figure a star bump for this place is in order. I do enjoy going here to pick up banchan, random snacks, and the after 8pm half price gimbap. I wish this place was closer to my house actually. I like to eat the banchan as soon as possible because you never really know how long it's good for.

I also like to look through whatever Korean snacks they have. I recently discovered yuzu and black pepper shrimp chips. I guess it boils down to lemon pepper flavoring, which is A-OK with me! Plus, although Costco carries pretty good dried seaweed, the selection at Greenland has better flavor."}
{"text":"Finally a place like the Korean markets in downtown LA.  Like the LA ones, this one has a supermarket as well as a food court and post office.  Plenty of space.  Produce is okay, but not as fresh as the produce I get in the supermarkets in LA.  I suspect they get their groceries from California.  Also, they don't have water sprayers to keep the produce crisp or plastic wrappings/bags to keep the lettuce and celery individualized and fresh.  Nevertheless, produce still cheaper than standard supermarket chains.  Lots of items to select from.  Recommend you go whether you are Korean or nor, when you want to go supermarket/food shopping."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 67/100

Possibly the cleanest Asian Grocery store around LV and thank God for living close by. Greenland's neat arrangement of aisles and a variety of products keep us coming back -  make that Korean, Japanese and some Chinese! Certain days, I would come here to buy a pack of kimbap, 21 pieces (give or take 2) cost only about $4.40 on average, depending on its weight.

Yesterday, my parents and I strayed away from our usual restaurant hops and settled with getting some pre-packed cooked goodies - chicken kampung gi (sweet with a hint of spicy), broiled blue mackerel, kimbap and spinach - which we ate at their food court. For less than $15, we had a well-stuffed lunch that kept us away from any other cravings the rest of the day. 

Greenland is not merely a supermarket, but a whole lot of other things too. They have postal services, bakeries, a jewelry kiosk, a Korean airline agency, miscellaneous gift stores, clothing stores. I guess you could call it a mini Asian mall. This place alone makes up what people call Korea Town here in Vegas. It's quite a treat."}
{"text":"Was looking to try the spicy ramen noodle challenge and found these gems... #spicynoodlechallenge"}
{"text":"Disappointing. But at least it's clean even though you can clearly smell the fish in the back! I have been on a search for good ethnic markets where I can source authentic produce, sauces, spices, and other items and that search has led me to some interesting places. My visit to Greenland was another one of those discovery visits, I needed a couple of basic things and thought I'd give them a look. 

Getting in the place was interesting as one of the front doors was broken. Once inside the front door you have to pass through a mini-mall of sorts with assorted shops, food offerings and even small appliances on display before you finally get to the market. Shopping carts...you gotta look for them as they are tucked away to the right side and I almost missed them. 

The produce...was disappointing. It's overpriced for one thing. And the quality was hit or miss. The Italian squash was huge and good quality. The mushrooms? They looked good in the package but once I got them home they were slimy, stinky, and woefully disappointing. But they do carry lots of various peppers, they carry shallots, and even had watercress but again the pricing seemed a bit too high compared to other places I've been. 

They do offer Mexican coke in the dairy cooler which caught my eye before I checked out the seafood cases. Shrimp was priced pretty competitive, but overall...I felt the seafood selection was ho-hum. I've seen better selection elsewhere and yes that includes the squid. The rest of the store was not anything surprising. If you like a wide variety of Cups of Noodles you'll be impressed. They also had large jars of kimchi including some that listed radishes vs. cabbage as the main ingredient...and they had some housewares including average quality pots and pans, chopsticks, soup spoons, and the mandatory bulk rice section that was again priced a tad too high compared to other places. 

Overall...it wasn't worth my time to drive to check it out. I'll give them 2 stars...one for not finding flies on the produce like Seafood City had going on, and another star for fast checkout lines. Otherwise...yawn...it ain't all that.

{"text":"I love this place. Clean and delicious food. We got a lot of to go goodies for our road trip. The prepared food were fresh, hot and yummy!
The fermented crab is a must try :)"}
{"text":"My family and I always come here for all our Asian food needs. Being from Hawaii we are so used to having the Asian flavors in our food. To me it's the best kine.

The prices are high on some things but that is expected when some products are imported from Korea, Japan etc. sometimes we come for the certain type of rice we like and it's not here, I understand that it grows in crops so it's not always ready but this was the only reason I gave it 4 stars, other than that this place is great."}
{"text":"Love Greenland Market! There's little competition for a Korean Market so prices can be higher and sometimes the produce at other Asian markets can better (which is normal). Their hot food section in the back is one of my favorite places to get tteotbokki, pajeon, pan fried fish, etc. I have literally lived weeks off prepackaged bibimbap and their hot food items. 

I also enjoy going to the food court, especially if nobody knows what they want and everything is extremely reasonably priced. We tried the new Chinese/Korean place called Hong Lao (i think) and the portions and food were very good, very well priced and I do think it's better than the previous people that were in that space. All the restaurants there have great and versatile items on the menu. Like where else are you going to get gamjatang for $11 or a $15 combo meal that could feed you for two meals?

I love Greenland market! It's one of my favorite places to go and fulfills many of my needs! Keep an eye open for new snacks because they're always getting more and stop in for a sheet mask in the cosmetics store on your way out (they are very helpful there too). Also, my parents love the rice cake stand and even brings them back with her to California because she says they're so good. 

Definitely come check out this market, get some food and enjoy it."}
{"text":"The best Korean market and great food court.  Very good selection of high quality meats, seafoods and produce.  This place is clean and everything always looks fresh.  The marinated kalbi short ribs are amazing.  

The food court has so many good choices would highly recommend trying a few.  Island flavor is delicious."}
{"text":"Living in a remote area in Arizona, roaming these aisles and seeing the loads of seafood and meats felt like pure luxury.  My go to place for stocking up on Korean goodies and produce when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Going to Greenland gets me excited.  What do you do when you go to a grocery store?  Buy food.  What do you do at a Korean grocery store?  Buy Korean food!  And I love me some Korean food.  Whether you're satisfying your current hunger at the food court or bringing home some food for later, Greenland's got you covered.

The biggest reason I go to Greenland is for their BBQ.  They have several meats already marinated and ready to take home.  Buying your kalbi/bulgogi/etc. by the pound here and grilling at home is so much cheaper than eating out!  That wouldn't mean much if the meat and marinade isn't good, but luckily that isn't a problem.  Potluck coming up?  Pool party coming up?  Greenland's BBQ is my go to spot for bringing a dish.

The other thing I've come to buy a lot of is the banchan they carry.  Gotta have the banchan with the BBQ!  Kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, fish cake...more banchan than I can remember!  Everything has been decent and consistent.  For someone that's never made banchan at home, this is my only option!

Another nice thing is that it's no problem if you head to Greenland with an appetite.  No need to go grocery shopping while you're hungry, just stop by the food court!  Obviously the biggest reason to go to Greenland is for Korean food.  Me being a fan of Korean food makes me a fan of Greenland."}
{"text":"I love this Supermarket. I can always find exactly what I need and their food court is awesome. The reason for my 3 stars is you need to really keep an eye on the young baggers working in that store.  They're usually too busy into their conversation speaking in Spanish to pay attention to the fact that they're stuffing items into bags with no rhyme or reason. I had soft pastry items and the bagger threw them into the bag at the bottom under heavier items causing them to all get smashed. Then he proceeded to throw the already bagged smashed soft items into the bottom of the cart further pulverizing them with the other grocery items being thrown on top. I had to say something and told them if I didn't buy it smashed up I don't expect for them to be packed so that everything gets crushed. They obviously don't care."}
{"text":"I love this place!

This place reminds me of a condensed Home Plus without the clothing. They sell just about anything you would find in Korea. It's very tidy here. You don't have to worry about stepping over boxes or around large crates.

The produce section is great! Most of the produce you can't find anywhere else. Since the drive is a bit long, I always stock up on my favorite snacks. I also love nodding my head to the k-pop playing as I shop. I'm not a seafood person, but there is a fresh seafood section there.

There is a home good section where you can buy pots, pans, utensils and other goods. 

The food court is amazing too! I love getting japche and dukkbokki. When I was living in Korea, there was a street vendor on my walk home that sold dokkbokki. My home-stay sister and I would stop there and get some just about everyday. I was glad they sold it here. On thing I liked in Korea's food courts specifically was that they don't use Styrofoam as much as we do here. All of their plates, bowls and utensils (beside chopsticks) can be washed and reused. I was happy to see they do the same thing in Greenland as well. The only Styrofoam they use is for the drinking water. And the service is just about the same with the numbers on the screen. I feel as if I'm right back in Seoul.  

Overall I love this place and can't get enough of it. It's very clean, the workers are very helpful and you can find what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the staff are not so friendly or helpful 
But don't let that get to you.

This is a great place to find everything Korean that you luv, I had a lot of fun shopping here"}
{"text":"I love this market. Although it is a Korean market they still have other non-Korean food items from Japan and China. 

What I love though is how clean, organized and well stocked this store is! Ingredients are labeled well and usually in English somewhere. This is helpful to those of us that love these foods buy can't always decipher the original label.

The have a nice seafood section although probably not as big as some of the other asian markets. They will clean them to order, however. They have a nice selection of sashimi cuts such as salmon, ahi, hamachi, and white tuna. This varies as I have also seen uni and octopus. just look for the freshest ones!

The food court just outside of the grocery is worth a look too. The food is pretty cheap and also tasty!"}
{"text":"Im putting 4 stars here because I haven't bought anything from Greenland as yet, but I will be. I am so happy we found this place today and I wish I had checked in when we were there but I just wanted to mention that this is one of the more organized Asian markets I have been to and this one has the exact brand of seastix I NEED (It totally matters I Swear) to make the spicy crab I so love for my sushi rolls at home. I have been looking all over Vegas since we got here Easter wknd and were starting to think I was going to be making monthly trips to San Diego to get what I need from there. Thank you Greenland. Now just don't disappointment and stop stocking this (lol) Wanted to mention that they have a large selection of fresh rolled sushi as well as a counter to order from in the back with food, as well as the food court in the front."}
{"text":"after all the waiting.. i thought this place would be bigger!

i came here thinking i would find awesome goodies to take home. but i didnt really find anything. maybe if i wanted some meat to bbq i would come here since it seems like everyone likes the meats here.

shall update once i come back!"}
{"text":"Interesting set up.  You walk in to a large foyer that houses a food court to the right, and then some other miscellaneous shops to the left.  Straight ahead is the market.  I found the produce selection to be less than other Asian markets I've patroned.  It's was nice, but will probably not return unless they offer hard to find produce that I cannot find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lately I've been trying to try several different Korean based stores to find some good sauces so I came yesterday to see what I could find. When u first get there it's across the street from target and actually next to a Korean bbq place lol. That's fairly decent. The parking lot is pretty clean, when h walk in there's several kitchen on both sides and and as u actually get to the market side u begin to notice all of the Asian snaks, chips, etc. They have a nice selection of fruits and vegetables, and they beer selection is a bit small, but has the essentials, I bought me a case of Sapporo and a screwdriver for my girlfriend, and they have a meat selection that fairly decent. When u begin to go to the aisle, it's super crammed, we didn't have a shopping a cart so it wasn't a big deal, buy if I did, I'm sure it might have been hard to navigate through the aisles. The merchandising of the areas were definitely taking quite a bit of space, could be a bit cleaner, but like I said not a big deal to me. I'd say the biggest issue I had, is the security that kept walking last us as if we were gonna steal a jar of marinate, seriously? The place overall was decent, nothing special, but think I might go pack to Maryland parkway plaza with the other markets"}
{"text":"This place has everything you can look for when trying to make Japanese or Korean inspired meals.  The produce far from standard.  There are many \"other\" fruits and veggies that your local Smith's Asian isle will not have.  Some of less familiar produce items are more pricey but Greenland is one of the only places that will have it.  If you are looking for high grade fish for home made shashimi or sushi you won't have a problem finding it.  I was so happy to see that they sell octopus, squid, and even the thinly sliced beef for Korean BBQ.  I was able to find all the condiments among all the different brands that they had of mirin, soy sauce, sake, & gochujang.  One thing that I really liked is towards the back of the store they have boxed and prepared cooked food of which I don't think I have the experience to make.  My wife loves Korean Japchae which they had.  I picked up some seaweed salad and spicy squid salad which was delicious!  You have to come here when you're not in a hurry because there are just so many options for the at home cook looking for some genuine Asian products.  Hope this was a helpful review :)"}
{"text":"lots of Asian fruits, veggie, meat are fresh, they also have ready to eat food item for you to pick , have a food court also"}
{"text":"Greenland Supermarket is a welcome addition to all the other Asian supermarkets in Las Vegas.  A little healthy competition is always good!  However, this market does specialize in more Korean goods than anything else.

Since it's a newer supermarket, it's very clean and quite large.  They also have quite a few promotions going on and the Husband loves to stock up when they have their mushroom sales.

We've been known to hit up their sliced fish section and have our own little sushi meal.  They also have a lot of pre-cut up items ready for your own hot pot / grill meal at home - so many variations of marinated meats!  That's definitely useful and something we'd love to take advantage of in the near future.  (We've already witnessed My T.'s use of their sliced meat section and can attest that it's great!)  

Their selection of ramen is worth taking a look at too - Koreans love their ramen and you can probably go for weeks and have a different kind each night!

And if you're hungry before, during or after your shopping trip, there are a bunch of little restaurants in their food court.  Those little shops have gotten some decent ratings although we have yet to try any ourselves."}
{"text":"Soooo good
Great selection of Korean food plus.  Awesome prepared foods and marinated meats as well as banchan and fresh fish.  Produce is super fresh and and priced well.  Nice selection of frozen foods as well."}
{"text":"The ultimate korean super market in vegas. In fact, this is the only korean supermarket I know if here. Are there any other ones yelp friends?

In addition to finding all you need to make Kim Chi fried rice or bulgogi, they also have a pretty good food court where you can order a variety of korean dishes. Even through its a food court, prices are relatively high. Probably 8 to 12 dollars per dish. I highly recommend the spicy pork with rice. Forgot the name of the stall but look for it on the menu. It's a generous amount of food and their flavor is very good. Pork might be a little fatty but it adds to the flavor!

Their produce selection is ok. I think chinese super markets or trader joes carries more variety and might be better quality. They do have pre marinated meats so you can make your own korean bbq at home though. They also have a premade food section filled with Banchan ( side dishes) Kim bap, ddok bok ki etc."}
{"text":"After all of the build-up of friends praising this place, I was expecting better.  I didn't see anything really special here.  Of course, they had a decent mix of various types of Asian packaged items but there is another Asian supermarket a couple of blocks away that is bigger and seems to have a better selection.  Maybe the employees here are friendlier but I only bought one thing and couldn't really say.  Produce and meat didn't look as inviting as they did back when we had a similar market in Honolulu.  But admittedly, maybe that is just because that one closed a long time ago and I have undeserved charitable memories of it."}
{"text":"I was here a few days back just getting some last minute items for my daughter's bday. Customer service was the worst. I had an issue with their pricing. They didn't want to honor the price that was displayed. I had to speak to 3 people to finally get it honored. I was trying to not make a scene but it's like one of the ladies was doing that on her own. After walking back and forth with different people showing them the price displayed and finally getting the price honored I get back to the register with all my items bagged and already scanned but then I had to wait longer because they couldn't find the items they scanned and saved on their register. I asked if they can scan my items in front of me but they insist on finding it. When they finally found my items I noticed the one lady who made this a bigger deal than it should speaking to the other lady who actually honored the price being very passionate with her words. (She was obviously speaking another language near where I was standing.) I thought that was disrespectful. It's obvious she was either talking about me or the situation. Either way that's bad customer service. It's disappointing because I used to like coming here. Because of this I won't be returning."}
{"text":"It's been a while since the whole debacle of feeling sick and I've been getting a bunch of deli items again and have not had issues since. I like getting the various pancakes specially the mung bean, chive, and seafood pancakes, the braised fishcakes, and various kimchee. 

I like shopping here as it's clean, convenient from work and has all the Korean staples and basic Asian staple items. The prices on vegetables and fruit is pretty reasonable, though sometimes the quality is hit or miss, but generally more good than bad. Only thing I don't really buy here is meat. They carry mostly sliced meats for bbq. I do sometimes get their marinated meats. Their fish selection is small compared to other Asian markets, but generally pretty fresh and the area doesn't stink of fish just because it's there. It's always nice smelling in here. 

Of course the bonus is the food court and various other businesses all in the same building. Eat, shop, go to the post office kiosk is often a routine of mine."}
{"text":"Probably my wife's second favorite Korean grocery store!  Only outdone by H-Mart in Tacoma or Federal Way, Washington which is a very long ways away!  Any time we come to Vegas she makes us stop here literally every day that we're here with a longer stop on the last day so she can completely load the entire car up for the trip home.  They have an excellent selection of Asian groceries, fresh produce, seafood, and house wares."}
{"text":"I love this place. GREAT food court, great prices both in the food court and in the market. VERY clean, organized, great selection. They always have what I am looking.  Great produce too.  Their seafood & meat dept is fresh, great quality, 

I come here allll the time."}
{"text":"I come here mainly for the large selection of kimchi as other supermarkets (especially Chinese/Viet ones) have slightly lower pricing on non-Korean food products.  Their food court, mostly Korean eateries, is awesome."}
{"text":"I like to shop there but what ever u do, do not buy anything that is soup, kimchi I have been finding rocks even fishing line in fresh kimchi I have complained about it but almost every time I purchase soup, kimchi or gim bab I find my self chewing on rock."}
{"text":"Is this a mirage... Duh Freak?!?! 
I grew up coming to Vegas with my parents, uncles, aunts, and cousins. That's what AZN fama-whee's do mang. But if you grew up AZN positive, you also know that whenever poor Asian families go on road trip type vacations they need their Asian fix. ESPECIALLY KOREAN- holla at yo boi! We use to take little Korean foods from LA or SJ and hit the road and always looking for microwavable junk before getting to Vegas. Once we got here buffets and junk all day everyday and ramen in the morning or late night. BUT ma people fear no more! THEY HAVE THIS PLACE UP IN HERE!!! 
This is every Asian parents dream come true when they come to Vegas. They have literally everything you can ask for and even the FOOD COURT! 
No more fearing caucasian cuisine and its toilet side effects. No more missing Asian food thats good and affordable while visiting Vegas! 
THANK YOU JESUS!"}
{"text":"I must say, out of all the Asian Supermarkets in town, Greenland is definitely my favorite. 

As of lately, my boyfriend and I have decided that we are going on strike from eating out at Korean BBQ places, and have decided to make our own Korean BBQ at home. Making the sauces and side dishes are a piece of cake for me, but they aren't the most important part of Korean BBQ, the meat is. Greenland offers a wide variety of marinated meat, as well as un-marinated at a great price. You can find everything here from kalbi to brisket, and it's affordable! 

On top of having great prices on meat, their produce is pretty cheap as well, making it the perfect spot for a one stop trip to the market. If you're looking for a great selection, as well as great prices, then this is definitely the market for you."}
{"text":"The baby and I decided to take a peek at this Korean market.  Everyone was very friendly and the store was nice and clean.  I felt strangely comfortable in the store, making sure to check out everything they had in there.  Ever since we (me + hubby) were stationed in Korea back in the day, I've been looking for those little bottles that had the magic hangover potion, Bacchus-D.  FOUND IT!  Had no idea what it was called, but recognized the bottle and the box.  It was also on sale, yay for paying less money for things that I would have payed full price for!  We also picked-up some OB & Hi-Lite, for memory sake.  The hubby much appreciated it.

So the baby fell asleep while her mommy was wondering the aisles, so I stopped by their food court.  There were many places to choose from, but I decided to grab something from the one non-Korean place, I Love Oshi.  I picked up their udon special with a spicy ahi tuna roll.  Not too bad, but I did love the nice and runny poached egg in my soup.

We will be back and maybe, if he behaves, we'll bring the hubby/daddy along too!"}
{"text":"This location is ok. Service is friendly. The location seems to be a bit disorganized,but generally clean."}
{"text":"Sigh, the past couple of times I have visited the granola man has not been there, so perhaps he is only there around the holiday times. Somehow his absence makes visiting Greenland a little less exciting for me. Also, the food court options always seem like a good idea, but you end up paying as much as you would at a sit-down restaurant, which in my mind defeats the purpose of a food court. Plus, I never seem to find exactly what I am looking for. The highlight for me has been the veggie tempura from the sushi spot, and if you like mushrooms, their udon is flavorful and generous."}
{"text":"The market is a little cramped for space but it's because they have so many different products. They're pretty much a full service market with a full size produce, meat, dairy, and grocery department. We like to come here to get their marinated kalbi when we're in the mood for a Bbq. The prices are pretty good for meats and the korean side dishes are always tasty. All kalbi lovers know that you can't have the meat without the banchan (kimchee, bean sprouts, choy sum, etc). 

They also have a good food court if you're not in the mood to cook at home and would like to order some great takeout."}
{"text":"Good place to buy food cook for family. I like Fresh meat and fish here. Japanese and Korean best here."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here and the food court was amazing. Finding parking is super easy even though it is a crowded parking structure so I recommend watching where you park. The supermarket reminds me of Asian supermarkets from home/ Hawai'i which I love!!! The wide selection of Korean beauty products, food, and house products are amazing!!!! I loved the food from the restaurant the prices are fair and food is flavorful and delicious. Only complaint is when checking out of the supermarket the cashier was rude and kept rolling her eyes and sighing loudly for no reason when I only had 6 products 5 of them being thin face masks. Won't stop me from coming back just felt it was unnecessary."}
{"text":"I went to Greenland Supermarket yesterday after reading a review on Yelp. I was really impressed that they had everything that I needed on my grocery list. I've been to other Asian grocery stores and haven't been able to find the ingredients for the sauces that I had wanted to make. I wish there was a bigger variety of fresh meats. I like the marinated meats that they had. I just would have liked to see more fresh non-marinated meats."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get some stuff for our road trip.  Cheap and many various products if you are looking for Asian grocery"}
{"text":"Greenland Supermarket is really the only Korean market in Las Vegas that has legit fresh products. I was reading up on other peoples review for this place and the reason why my mom and I go shopping here every week is the variety and freshness of meats & fish they have here. GS reminds me of the Korean markets in LA and in Korea. They have a plethora of different types of rice cakes, fish cakes, meats, ramen, sauces, banchan, dry goods, snacks, etc. and this is the only Korean market where they actually pay attention to the expiration dates of the products! The meats are good quality and you will not regret purchasing any marinated meat and the pork belly. My favorite 'togo' meal they have is near the banchan isle and its an assortment of fish eggs bibimbap style. It has chunks of sashimi with lettuce, daikon, carrots, and hot pepper paste. Mmmm yummy! Before you enter the market they have a list of specials that you should take advantage of, especially the dumplings and cold buckwheat noodle soups. 

Last but not least, the GS foodcourt. My mom and I usually stop by Baek-ni-Han (corner store towards your right). The owner is a man with glasses and he makes everything from scratch. If you like soups and noodles, try getting the half seafood soup with cha-chang myeun. The bowl actually has a divider so you can have a bit of each. Spiciness of the seafood soup compliments so well with the soy-sauce/ heartiness of the black bean noodles. What a great day to end your shopping trip before you head home and a one stop shop for Korean cooking headquarters!"}
{"text":"Love it here and my favorite Korean grocery store.  It is located in a large strip mall with plenty of parking spaces in the front.  There is a food court with a coffee restaurant, clothes store, beauty store, salon, bank, bakery, and MBC store.  The grocery itself has produce, liquor, fish and meat section plus much more.  It's comparable to HMart in Cali.  I would recommend you checking it out."}
{"text":"Snacks heaven!!  omg... i was absolutely lost in this snacks heaven.  All kind of snacks, both sweet and savory snacks.  

And the fish section was so clean, i usually hate to go to the Asian markets especially the fish section coz the smell, but this place does not smell! If you are not a fan of fresh seafood like me, they got plenty of selections of frozen seafood such as mussels, clams, shrimps, squids, bah bah bah! ready to cook/eat in vacuum bags!!  Cooking like a pro without stinking your hands! lol"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite ethnic supermarket in Las Vegas. This market specialized in a large range of Korean products and it is the main anchor store for Korea Town. Plus, they carry various Asian products from other countries. One of the main feature is the Hot and Ready made Korean dishes including various Banchan(side dishes) in the back prepared onsite for those looking to stock up or craving for Korean food on the go. The Produce and Seafood section is fresh and the quality is good. Another section is dedicated to ramen in various flavors and spice levels with a wide selection of brands. 

We rarely get any issues with customer service but when they get busy the lines can be long but they move in a timely manner. The aisles in the store are reasonably larger than other Asian markets and the store is clean and organized.

2017 Yelp Review #82"}
{"text":"This is probably the biggest Korean market in the Las Vegas area. They have occasional sales and it seems to change on a weekly or biweekly basis. The ramen prices are more expensive than bigger cities like LA but I guess with the amount of choices we don't have much options.

They have food and side dishes already made in case you can't cook. They also have a lot of household items as well (of course all Korean items). The staff is friendly and will get you stuff in the back if they run out on the floor. 

The complex also has a food court and they have Korean bread and Korean hair salon with a Korean pharmacy as well. It's off rainbow and spring mountain so the location is ideal as well."}
{"text":"I always come to Greenland Supermarket at least twice a month. It's one of the supermarkets that I like to go and shop for groceries. My husband and I have been trying to cook more at home and trying out different recipes. There are certain things that I usually buy at Greenland because they are the only ones that have them or they have more variety to choose from:

Huge jars of kimchi
Soondae
Gochujang (red pepper paste)
Ssamjang (fermented soybean paste)
Pork belly slices

Their meat selection is usually a better quality than some of the other supermarkets in the city. Their sliced pork belly here is amazing and we tend to always get it here if we are making dwaegi soondubu (spicy pork tofu soup). Or if we just want to grill some up and make a wrap or sandwich with it. Their sliced beef here is great as well and we usually get that for our hot pot nights. They also have marinated meats here like bulgogi (marinated rib eye slices) and it's delicious. Their marinate isn't too sweet or too heavy. It's great when paired with rice.

They also have ... beef bones! They're in the frozen section and they sell 'em by bags. I don't think there's another super market where I've seen them just sell beef bones. Oxtail bones sure but not beef bones. You can use these to make beef bone soup, i.e. sullungtang. 

They have a decent selection of ramyeon (instant noodles) and some are imported from Korea. They have the firey noodles and they sometimes carry different flavors of it (2x spicy, curry, mala, etc). They also have a good selection of frozen rice cakes and packaged fresh noodles. 

BANCHAN! They have a really good selection of these. They have roasted anchovies, spicy roasted anchovies, spicy cucumbers, seaweed salad, etc. They have a cooked foods area where they have corn, japchae, kimbap, fish jeon, and soondae! Soondae is korean blood sausage :) And it's delicious! 

Their alcoholic beverages are also decent. They carry flavored soju -- even though it did take them a while to get it in. They don't carry all the Korean branded beers though. The last time I went, I wanted to buy some Cass and they didn't have any. I can't seem to get any Cass lately...

Speaking of their stock ... it's not very consistent. There are a few items that I have bought, ran out, and wanted to buy again but they were no longer in stock. I'm not sure if they are just out of stock and haven't gotten the item back in or if they stopped carrying it. 

Regardless, still one of my regular grocery market stops. They have a food court, beauty shop, bread shop, mochi shop, and they recently opened a ginseng shop!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a work colleague, this market carries some of the best asian foods and products I have been able to find in Vegas. Reasonably priced, this market offers quality nori, frozen gyoza, Thai/Korean/Japanese spices and sauces, soy wrap paper, pre-cut fish for sushi, fresh veggies and AMAZING salmon steaks. I went in for a quick look and ended up spending over an hour just browsing around. The staff is pretty friendly and will accommodate your requests (meat department).

The prices at this market are right on par with any other grocery store in Las Vegas, so if you are in the mood to try exotic spices or different foods, come shop here. Some of the things I found here are:

* Nori (quality stuff)
* Salmon Steaks
* Sushi grade salmon/tuna
* Pre-cut fish for sushi
* Sushi rice
* Loco Moco sauce
* Apple-Pears
* Amazingly fresh ginger
* Fresh pork belly

If you are going to this market for the first time, do it with time to spare so you can browse around and find some pretty cool stuff."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Katrina M. took me here after I was getting homesick. I have been back almost every week if only to walk around and read the Korean. I love supermarkets. Maybe it is the fact that we all need food to survive and food has always been a source of comfort. Walking around a supermarket in any country I visit is almost as important as seeing a landmark. It speaks more about the people of that area than any other culture center.

The pre-made food section offers a wide selection of banchan (Korean side dishes). I haven't tried any yet, because I am still in the stage of wanting to make my own. I have 8lb. of kimchi sitting in my fridge as proof. Thank you Greenland for stocking all the essential ingredients. ^_^v 

I have bought their bulgogi since my friends were too impatient to wait for me to marinate my own. I liked it, I would only add some onions, enoki mushrooms, and green onions to give it a little contrast to the sweetness of the sauce. 

The japchae (sesame clear sweet potato noodles with vegetables) was also decent. A little sweeter than I am used to, but it is decent if you add some black pepper and slices of green chili peppers."}
{"text":"This is my favouritt marcket.  Great selection for Korean product, I hope they have more Japanese one as well."}
{"text":"This place is one of the cleaner Asian markets and without that distinctive smell lol. It's not messy in there either, everything is kind of... everywhere. For example, when you walk in, there are a whole bunch of delicious cookies/crackers (Pocky!) and then when you go to the actual cookies section, there's nothing appetizing. There's one section for seaweed, then when you walk by the home section and there are boxes and boxes of more seaweed... like how was I supposed to know those were there? LOL. 

There ARE designated sections for dairy, seafood, vegetables, raw meat, and frozen foods, AND there's a home section! Home section with chopsticks, BBQ grills, and face masks (lol, random, I know). But I definitely recommend getting the marinated bulgogi and do homemade KBBQ! 

Greenland is kind of like a mini Asian town. Right outside of the market itself, there is a food court, post office, hair salon, you name it. Right outside, there's a boba place (Volcano Cafe); to the left, Paina Cafe (get the ube tarts), and a puppy store lol."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest asian super markets I've ever been too. Even the bathrooms are spotless. Enough said"}
{"text":"It's not the biggest, it doesn't have the best selection, but it's clean and well stocked and I like that it's sort of a mall in itself. -1 Star for poor customer service."}
{"text":"The date of this review is Friday, February 5, 2016.

After placing Super Bowl bets, I went to the Greenland Supermarket on Spring Mountain Road. I have been many times to the Greenland Supermarket in Los Angeles.

For this market in Las Vegas, I prefer the Los Angeles market instead."}
{"text":"Sitting at the house on a Sunday afternoon with some of my other sushi loving friends and the plan was to BBQ some steaks that night and have a few drinks... Somewhere in this mix the idea of going to sushi came up, and then somewhere in that mix the idea of me just making sushi came up. Okay, so now that the dinner plans had officially been established I had to run to the store to get the things I was missing. Yes smiths and albertsons are right by my house but I have heard great things about the selection here but again it is just sooooo far from my house. 10 or so minutes later I was in the car on my way to Greenland Supermarket. This was in no way a mistake... what a selection, and the fresh fish market is amazing. They had everything I needed and much much more. I have always wanted to have a market I can go to and get Sashimi grade fish and it is finally possible."}
{"text":"If I need anything for a Korean meal , this is the place I go to. It has everything Korean you can think of, but I actually don't buy much produce here, because it doesn't always look the best, and I can get better price and quality elsewhere.  

We like to buy our kimchi here, and most times I will pick up a tray of kimbap, chicken wings, fried fishcake and Japchae .  Its made fresh in the kitchen, and sometimes we will eat it out by the food court or take it home. They sell thinly sliced pork belly and round steak which I like because I don't have a meat slicer at home. 

The food court is okay. They used to have a Thai place that I would go to that I thought was really good, but its gone and has changed a few times. The ramen at one of the stands, is like they opened a packaged ramen, it wasn't fresh noodles that we are used to, and it came with a side of sushi. I'm not too impressed with the food court. The last time that I ate there, I tried the Korean place on the end and ordered the Meat Jun. the worker was surprised and said everyone was ordering it that day. Well if you are from Hawaii, you know Meat Jun. Its the best, and nothing has compared to it. And surely this one did not. The meat was a little tough and there was gristle on the edge."}
{"text":"I love this market everything is cheap, I can get all my homeland cooking stuff, the have fresh fish, marinated meats, Korean food court which has awesome selection food and open late!"}
{"text":"This was a fun mall/grocery store visit. I came looking for looseleaf green tea based on a tip from a Yelper. Found the tea in a smaand looked at other interesting items. They carry lots of imported foods and have a small but nice produce section. The strawberry packages were huge -and those berries looked delicious! It was an early Sunday afternoon and hardly anyone was there, so no lines. I wish the tea selection were larger."}
{"text":"This is definitely your go-to store for your Korean fare at home. This supermarket is the only reason we end up on Rainbow Blvd. 

Great selections all around. I even find things I need that has nothing to do with Korean food. We love their banchan that is sold by weight in their cooler section. Whenever I was in my postpartum (4x btw), my korean friend said that the Korean seaweed soup (miyeokguk) is what Korean mothers would eat because it helps with their bm supply. So miyeokguk to Koreans is equivalent to chicken malunggay soup to us filipinos. I actually found the seaweed in the miyeokguk definitely helpful to my bm supply. With all the newborn craze, it's nice to be able to buy it premade so i can simply heat it up at a very affordable price in my opinion.

The workers have been friendly, fast, and efficient. You'll definitely walk out with a hole in your wallet especially if that shopping cart is filled, but who said korean food is cheap?! =)

I highly recommend this store for your korean needs. They also have a food court and other stores such as a clothing boutique, salon, pharmacy, travel agent, bakery, and a few more upon entering. Ample parking!

Keep the curious aged kids in the cart or stroller as it is stroller friendly. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for fresh produce.  The selection is excellent, and the prices are unbelievable (EASILY half the prices of major grocery chains).  
The seafood section is amazing here too.  The counter is packed full of vibrant cuts of very fresh fish.  Nothing like the limp, pathetic, hacked up \"fillets\" you see at most big name grocery stores.
There are all of the basic kitchen staples, rows of Asian snacks, prepared, refrigerated foods, a housewares section (nice, cheap electric kettles, spatulas, tableware etc.), a small frozen foods section, and a large food court.
The the fact that the store is small enough to get through quickly, and easily is a huge plus for me, as is their large parking lot, and friendly service."}
{"text":"They should call it \"wonderland\". This place has a little of everything. I really enjoy just coming in here and poking around. They have an excellent selection of Japanese candy and snack foods which I adore. The fish market is really fresh and they have a nice produce area as well."}
{"text":"The good: Great prices on everything from roasted soy paper snacks, Hi-Chew candy (my personal fav), to sashimi quality salmon/tuna slabs. Plus right next to a couple good eateries like Lee's Korean BBQ.

The bad: Barely anyone here speaks understandable English. You have to kinda know what you're looking for, and where it is (or at least willing to search on your own) before coming here. 

The ugly: Some of the things here make my stomach squirmish. Severed fish heads staring back at you (almost) make me turn vegetarian. Haha. Place is overall clean, but people begging for money out front combined with communication problems, kinda turns away coming back as much as I would like to.."}
{"text":"I didn't make it past the food court!

This is an Asian grocery store with a huge food court up front.  Honestly, I don't even know what I ate there, but it was a bowl of rice with a bunch of stuff on top.

This place is a legit place for Asians.  There are Asians everywhere!

This place is a Korean market but I do believe they have a variety of Asian goods.

If I lived even remotely close to this place I would stop by more often."}
{"text":"This place is our \"Korea Town\" here in Las Vegas. Pretty much one market and a couple of restaurants. This market has many selections of snacks, vegetables, meats you name it. This is my number one spot to get any groceries if I'm craving fresh salmon. They do have a open food court that serves great Korean food. 

Must come to this place to check it out yourself. Many varieties and shops are in this market to try for. Love this place !"}
{"text":"I'm used to the Greenland chain from living in NorCal. 

Yes, this place is SUPER clean. Like, Smith's standards clean. That's a plus. Giant food court, lots of items to pick from outside the store. 

Inside: the aisles are TOO small. Stuff isn't organized well. Chips are here, there and everywhere. People have no qualms about just blocking you from an aisle while they legit zone out in the entrance. Really? Ugh. Annoying. By far, Greenland has the rudest, pushiest customers. 

While I do enjoy the fact that the place is clean, the prices here are offensive. I'm talking double the prices of Seafood city on some items. I spent $32 on ingredients for a batch of kimchee, and the only non vegetables I bought were red pepper paste, red pepper powder and sweet rice flour. Crazy. 

While I do like that I can grab Korean ingredients here, I come here because I have to out of necessity, not because I just love for money to bleed from my wallet."}
{"text":"Good selection of food and home hardwares. Lots of generic and branded Korean side dishes were available. Very friendly staffs."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally and try all different foods they provide.  Today, I came in specifically for soju. The Lee's by my place has been out of the grapefruit flavor, so I came here because I know they have it.  I did end up getting a couple other flavors I haven't seen before, Apple and grape.  I thought that grapefruit was the best, but after trying the Apple, I know I was wrong!  I just wish they had it for the same price.   Lee's price for the same soju is only $2 bit here it's over $4.  

I have eaten at the good court just up front and had purchased the bakery goods up front as well.  They do have a wide variety of food and korean home goods as well."}
{"text":"I love Greenland, but the lack of soy and wheat \"meats\" is what takes this down a star."}
{"text":"My favorite supermarket to go to here! They have a crazy huge selection of those sodium filled instant noodles lol. It's pretty exciting but we definitely don't buy them all the time. If you love your noodles, you definitely want to come here. I love the different sizes of Kimchee they sell and veggies are great to buy here. They have a great selection of seaweed too. Not packed at all like other Asian markets."}
{"text":"Disappointing when compared to some of the better H-Marts that I've been to--food selection is inferior, fresh food items are inferior, and selection in little shops is also inferior. They still have a decent selection of various things, but I just wish they were a bit better."}
{"text":"They sell endive, dandelion and other super healthy and super good greens for you and very affordable :) however other stuff in there is a little more expensive comparing to other stores in china town ... I'll always have to swing by to buy my green leaves for my smoothies ^_^
They also have a variety of Natto which i like also kelp noodles are a must here very affordable  and good for you if you vegan"}
{"text":"This review is on the market itself, not really the food court. I was first led here out of simple laziness. I was invited to a bbq and Hawaii style dictates try never to show up empty handed. Being too lazy to make something, I sought out the nearest Korean market since they almost always have marinated meats. So glad I was forced to come here! 

First off, the parking lot has slanted parking spots. As anyone who's been to Chinatown knows, Asians can't reverse for sh*t. Hey I'm not as bad as some, but sadly I'm included in that generalization. It's nice to shop w out worrying about some little old lady w a minivan backing I to your car.

The store is very clean since it's still pretty new and hopefully will stay that way. They have a great selection of produce, but sadly the quality is lacking. I got super excited about a box of dinosaur egg pluots by the entrance, but every single one was overripe. 

The seafood section isn't as extensive as other Asian markets in town, and nothing live swimming in tanks. But that's usually in Chinese markets, not so much w Korean ones. 

On to my reason for being there - the meat dept! Large selection of cheap marinated meats and everything I've tried so far was great. Spicy pork isn't too fatty and has great flavor, although I don't consider it spicy at all. I usually add more garlic chili paste before cooking it. Bulgogi is pretty good, but may not be marinated long enough since flavor wasn't really set in. Same with kalbi ribs, which were also extremely fatty. Yes I know the cut is supposed to have marbling, but this was excessive. 

They also have ready to fry tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and chicken katsu. Katsu is simple to make, but creates such a mess I hate it. Awesome to have this option. They must season the meat because it has flavor even w out katsu sauce. Spicy chicken is just ok, teri chicken is flavorful and so juicy.

Their regular meat section has cuts of varying quality including some beautiful and expensive kobe beef. Next to that is a small hot and cold prepared food section. The best thing there is the beef pancake. Its a beef patty w carrots and other veggies mixed in, dipped in egg and pan fried. Its like a patty version of meat jun. Whatever it is, just get it. FYI - the label simply said beef on mine. 

Greenland has the best selection of Korean snacks, nori, instant soups. It seems to be the only place that carries my fav potato noodle soup. 

Ladies at check out are quick and friendly, although they always talk to me in Korean. I respond by staring back blankly....  

I've only tried the homemade fried mandoo at island style. Its just like my Korean aunty used to make, and love that I can also get Hawaiian sun juice w it.

This market is pretty damn awesome, but I still prefer SF market (spring mtn/decatur) for my produce, seafood and spices since Greenland is solely Korean."}
{"text":"When you gotta go get that kimchi action, where do you go?  GREENLAND. Greenland isn't a place that sells a bunch of green veggies and plants, or an amusement park featuring the wildlife forest. 

What they do have, is my fave brand of kimchi by OSHINAE (it's got some cartoonish ladies in the front) for those who can't read Korean. I don't settle for anything else, so this is basically why I go. Also, I don't have a choice to get Korean stuff elsewhere. Greenland is as good as it'll get in vegas. 

Don't get overly excited though. It's generally an average market even in Cali with a bunch of other competitors like Galleria Market and California market, so, I'm giving it 3 stars. I love the stealing photos they got posted by the cashier. It's blurry and graphic all at the same time. And yeah, the people who work here seem a bit robotic in their actions, starting from the cashiers to the baggers. Hey man, it doesn't hurt to smile once in a while. 

They seriously could use some upgrading to the quality of food in the food court. I think it'll draw more customers to regularly come in to eat, and then inevitably buy some groceries on the way out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian supermarkets in Las Vegas. I love Korean food and this place makes it so easy have a Korean meal at anytime. They've got a great selection of pre-made items including all of the little side dishes you would get at a Korean restaurant. Its a pain to marinate any meat just right to make the perfect bulgogi or kalbi and I don't have to anymore. All I have to do is stop here is make a quick stop here and then cook it at home. This place has saved me a lot of headache of trying to figure out what to do for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went their for the first time to pick up some good korean food to q and it was more than i could imagine as far as having everything you need. They also have a  food court in the market that had good food smells on the way in and out but didnt try it out, next time. The store is very big and worh the trip."}
{"text":"The ultimate place to go shop for Korean grocery. Every time we visit Vegas, we always stop by here and pick up snacks and ramen.  They also have a food court inside where you can pretty much choose all of the different menu Korean restaurants offer.  We actually come here especially for that. Wish we had this in Utah."}
{"text":"they need to get their act together in selling decent produce. this is evident everytime we go..all rotten.
we have been going elsewhere for Korean groceries. there needs to be more competition for these people to straighten up."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi to-go but the place never seems to prepare enough.  Either hire more chefs or make more sushi!"}
{"text":"Part one of the review is on the market itself.

It's clean, bright, does not smell (well maybe only by the seafood section). But I love the cheap produces and the meat selection here. You can even get the pre-marinated Korean BBQ. I would not recommend their fish though, I bought it twice and it was not fresh.  

So I would suggest their meat, which is really fresh and also their cooked food section with various kimchee and Korean side dishes and salads. (These however are a little bit pricy but I thnk that's pretty common for Korean food, it's usually on the more expensive side)

Second part is on the food court outside.
Two of my favorites ones I think are worth trying is the Chaphaghetti (try their Jajangmyun - noodles with black bean sauce) and Island Style (which is a spinoff of their original location on Sahara I think?)

Food comes out fairly fast, sometimes I come get food to-go for dinner.
It's pricy for food-court food, but the portions are huge so it will last you 2 meals."}
{"text":"I can always count on Greenland Supermarket for all my cooking needs. From just little snacks like pocky to major ingredients for family dinners at home. This location is very clean and they even have small shops ranging from clothes to food courts. I honestly enjoy coming here and the employees are friendly too!"}
{"text":"Since this is a Korean Supermarket, I come here for one thing. Kimchi. This place sure doesn't compare to HMart or anything similar. If you ask me, I think most of their goods are overpriced compared to other stores in the area.

But if I want some good, fresh kimchi then I know I can come here. I don't have to buy the bottle stuff and can get some that they make in house. And I have a plethora of choices. 

And while I am at it, I can pick up some fresh, hot eats. Choices from noodles, dumplings, sushi rolls, tofu dishes and various meat dishes. Most choices are $5 and under too. 

For me this is a good spot to come and get some lunch or dinner if you want to pick up something quick and easy. You just probably won't catch me wondering the store with a basket and shopping."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I have discovered that after 8pm some of the items sold at the \"deli\" are half off. The only one that interests me with this deal is their laver rolls or what I think of as Korean California Rolls.

They also have a members reward card system that offers % back.

And the produce sections and the pre-marinated meat sections still offer great products at a reasonable price.

Plus if you can't wait to go home with your groceries, you can always grab a bite to eat from one of the food court vendors."}
{"text":"Used to like Greenland Supermarket, but it has really gone downhill since I first moved to Las Vegas. I still come here maybe 2-3 times a year to buy a few select things, but try to avoid this supermarket as much as possible. 

First of all, this place is claustrophobic. Everything is cramped and unorganized. When you walk around, it feels like they just put products wherever they can fit them. Good luck trying to get around with a cart since the aisles are very narrow. Also, double check anything that you buy here! I have already noticed a few times that they leave expired and damaged products on the shelves. Horrible! I know that this is a Korean market, but they used to have a lot more Japanese items in the past. I see less and less each time I come here.

Last year, I remember during one of my visits that this place smelled like clorox bleach. Really strong too. I'm not sure if it was coming from the food court area or the market area, but it made me feel sick. I mean come on, the least they could do is thoroughly air the place out! Customer service is pretty horrible. The employees do not care and just shove their way past you without saying anything. I was here about a week ago, and as we were checking out, the woman who was bagging our groceries just decided to stop halfway. Yup, walked away and never came back. After paying, the cashier started to ring up the next customer, so my mother-in-law and I bagged the last of our groceries ourselves. I mean seriously?? WTF?? They should just have a self check-out lane at this point!

Ughhh so frustrating! We need a Marukai or Mitsuwa in this city, that is all."}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood for getting Korean bulgogi this is the place I go and they do have other Asian food besides Korean also they have a little pastry section yummy pastries it's a pretty big market so if you're looking for any type of Asian stuff you might want to check this place out"}
{"text":"For all you Hawaii people this place is like Palama supermarket back home.
It's your one stop shop for all your Asian, specifically Korean food and accessory items. 
The prices here are very competitive and the bonus is no tax.
This store provides fresh fruit and veggies, meats and all your other supermarket needs. 
They have several areas dedicated to ramen and rice. It's like a shrine to these two items Lol!!!
If your in Korea town, stop by and take look."}
{"text":"Greenland is probably my favorite Asian supermarket in town. The store has so much variety and is pretty well-organized and clean, which I enjoy. Everything is pretty reasonably priced as well. 

I don't shop there nearly as often as I'd probably like, probably because I don't really cook. I do try to get here about every month or so, just to get my fix. Also, as someone who doesn't really cook, I really enjoy their huge selection of premade items as well as all their inexpensive kitchenware.  

Another great place about this place is all the food vendors that are located in the mall area as well. I can usually grab some food to go on my way out for dinner as well, which is probably my favorite part about the place. Convenience is the name of the game here."}
{"text":"If you're Korean, you can't miss this place. This is the biggest Korean Super market in Las Vegas..If you're up to some Korean home cooking tonight, you better start from here. P.s. if you're planning to grab some Kimchi, skip this place. W Mart on Sahara carries Kimchi that taste hundred million times better"}
{"text":"Champaghetti 

This is a little Korean food stand in the far corner of the Greenland food court.  While there are lots and lots of Korean restaurants in town, I haven't found many that serve Champong.

Champong is a Chinese-Korean noodle dish made with a red, spicy Beef broth. It is noodle based, and filled with seafood and vegetables. (See pic #45).

Champaghetti's version offers large portions, and great flavor, with a decent amount of spice.  Takuan, Kim chee and raw onions are also served as sides.  The broth is very red, so dress accordingly-- no white shirts!  Also, get a few extra napkins, this stuff will make you sweat! Great all year round, but a must for the rainy weather season."}
