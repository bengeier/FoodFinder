{"text":"The app was very nice (something breaded and fried), the margaritas were strong, but the service was slowwww.  I ordered the tofu secuwa, and they somehow served the tofu too dry -- didn't know this was possible."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and never disappointed. Well seasoned and prepared. We've had the pork chop, coconut chicken, beef bourguignon, and chicken chwela. All have been great. Great service too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"As other have mentioned, the decor was gorgeous. The food was decent and reasonably priced. The service, however, was atrocious. It took several minutes for the waitress to seat us. The food took ages to come out, and they forgot our salads, which took another 15-20 minutes to arrive. Our waters were not refilled in that entire time. This was in a practically empty restaurant -- there were two other tables aside from ours. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I have always loved the food here.  Their vegetarian options are fantastic- the tofu buff and veggie burger are my favorites- and weirdly enough, they have some of the best french fries I've ever experienced- truly unexpected.  I love that they use many local and organic ingredients, much like their sister restaurants (Himal Chuli/ Chautara).  I'm here regularly (sometimes weekly), the staff knows me and I don't take it personally when things move slowly on a busy night."}
{"text":"The East side of Madison and Atwood Ave. have an eclectic blend of restaurant offerings. Dothan has a nice menu offering that will fit anyone's desired tastes. From Vegetarian to meat they offer multiple choices in each category. Our food was excellent, the wait staff was personable, the service was very good and we'll continue to go to Dobhan. They didn't get 5 stars cuz no one gets five stars from me unless you blow me off my chair."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with boys during basketball tournament.  Great staff.  Quick service.  Excellent food."}
{"text":"Classy but simple Nepali/Himalayan food in the Atwood corridor. Their chicken kabobs are really juicy and well cooked."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal here on Sunday.  The service was great and the menu interesting.  I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Wonderful decor! But the length of time it took to get our meals served was ridiculous. I would never return on a weekend night."}
{"text":"A friend and I ate dinner at Dobhan on a Friday night. We arrived early and we were one of about 3 tables.  The space is welcoming, but the service is slow even when the place is virtually empty. I  started with the dal- it needed salt but was otherwise ok. I had the shrimp masala and my companion ordered a tofu dish. Both of our dishes. We're just...bland. Mine was a curry dish, yet it was virtually tasteless. We both asked the waitress for sriracha sauce but instead received the house mango habanero sauce. After waiting for a long time, we asked someone walking by for our check and then they forgot to split it up. I really wanted to like this place and had been waiting to dine here. Unfortunately I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is our first time trying Dobhan. The Pakauda is excellent! The bowl of Dal is equally amazing! The Moroccan Vegetable Tagine is really tasty!! The service is also impressive. I arrived 10 min early for my pick-up order and it was ready in minutes. A nice member of the staff labeled the sauces ! And she shared her fav! We're visiting from Chicago and have eaten great Nepalese food below. I'd highly recommend the food and the service!"}
{"text":"I know the service can be a little lacking, but personally, I go to a restaurant for the food--and this place is one step ahead of many Madison restaurants in terms of ingredient quality and delicious yet healthy options.   Brunch, in particular, is definitely worth checking out.

We need more restaurants like this in the area and I will continue to support!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing!!! We were a table of four and it took well over an hour after we placed our order. What's worse is it was not worth the wait. Portions are small, price ridiculous, flavor bland. It was a complete bust."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting mix of Nepalese, Indian, Moroccan and Mediterranean.  I tried the Kathmandu-style Lamb - Tender leg of lamb prepared in cumin, ginger, and paprika with potatoes and peas.  A nice dish with definite Indian influence."}
{"text":"Comfortable well-lit restaurant. Excellent service and helpful waiter. Dal lentil soup excellent. I recommend Norwegian salmon. My guest had Moroccan Vegetable Tagine which he rated so-so. Rice dessert was good."}
{"text":"we went on a week night so it was not busy and we didn't experience any service problems.  our waiter was great and made some really helpful recommendations.  i ended up getting something i did not expect to - the special, the cuban plate with tofu (i was sort of confused as to why they had cuban food).  it was the some of the best tofu i've ever eaten, im not sure what they did to it, but i was sold."}
{"text":"Excellent. Best brunch in town hands down. I can't believe this place doesn't have people lined up outside. Everything I have had has been delicious. Service can be a little slow, but when you get a deliciously prepared meal it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Wayyyy delicious food, fun atmosphere and nice decor. The service here was a bit hectic as there was some private party going on tonight, but the food was way too amazing for that to detract from the evening. The dining experience was civilized yet laid back and I can see myself coming back here numerous times in the future.
Also, their food is not just \"Himalayan / Nepalese.\" They have tons of Mediterranean, Indian, even South American dishes."}
{"text":"Upscale version of Chautaura on State St.  Preparations are more European.  Food has been outstanding every time I've been there.  Atmosphere is wonderful.  This is a kind of restaurant lacking in Madison - excellently prepared creative food at reasonable prices in a neighborhood setting."}
{"text":"I love having brunch at Dobhan. Their food is cooked well (I especially like the Cuban sandwich and the huevos rancheros) and is tasty. They also have great homemade salsas.

HOWEVER, their service is ALWAYS terrible. The servers are slow, forgetful, and unhelpful. I have friends who REFUSE to eat at Dobhan because of the awful service. If they could get the service to match the food, it would be a hands-down winner."}
{"text":"Madison's best vegetarian cuisine. A wide range of tofu, lentil, and vegetable dishes, done right - savory and delicious, never bland. Reasonable prices. Service sometimes a little spacey but mostly good."}
{"text":"The service was better than I thought which was nice, but the yak burger was so so.. We need to go back again. The soup however was very tasty."}
{"text":"We went to Dobhan's right before Christmas to get dinner before we left the next day to travel.  And to be perfectly honest, we ended up here because the two places we tried before were packed and we really just wanted to eat and leave.  We had seen Dobhan's previously while we were killing time before eating at Monty's (across the street) and were interested enough to try it out.  

The inside is a nice size and nicely decorated in Indian style tapestries, ceramics, art, etc.  There were two servers that night, both of which were incredibly calm and quiet people.  The bottom of the menus say Namaste on them and we definitely felt like we were sitting in the local yogis hotspot amongst people who drink a lot of tea and center themselves every morning.  

The menu is fairly extensive and offers a lot of different kinds of options of Indian food.  I did think that the prices were a smidge high, but normally if they are providing something authentic to the cuisine, I don't usually mind that.  The hubby ordered a fish sandwich with fries (*shakes head*) while I got a coconut chicken entree with a side of dahl.  The fish sandwich was actually very well done, though not particularly Indian.  Very nice flavors and came with a tasty \"aioli.\"  Pardon the quotations, but I could go on a 10 minute rant about the overuse of the word aioli on menus these days...anyway.  My coconut chicken was also delicious.  Very well prepared, delicious flavors, good portion size.  The cup of dahl was also tasty, though it was definitely more of a lentil soup than any of the dahls that I have had before.  Not that I'm an expert on Indian cuisine, but all previous experiences have been different.  It was still tasty though.  I also had a mango lassi to drink which was also tasty.

The biggest complaint I had was that when we first arrived it wasn't super busy, but it still took quite awhile for us to have someone come by to take drink orders and then food orders.  I get the whole chill vibe and maybe I'm being overly critical because I was thinking about all the packing I still needed to do, but the servers just weren't on top of their game.  It then got progressively busier and I saw two instances of people come in, wait about 5 minutes to even be seated and then walk out because no one even acknowledged they were there.  Either the staff there needs some more training, or management clearly didn't think the Tuesday before Christmas was going to be that busy.  

Overall the food was good, it was nothing special, but it wasn't bad.  The service left a little something to be desired and the restaurant was a little cold, but I didn't hate my experience.  If I had particularly zen friends who liked to eat only organic, free-range indian food, I would definitely send them here.  Otherwise we will probably only be back if Monty's is particularly busy again..."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review after dining here recently in March 2018. The owner's adult son was our server and showed almost no interest in taking our order let alone following up with us on our meals or offering to bring anything further out after our main dishes were brought out. As a regular customer this is incredibly infuriating. 

********
My original 5-Star review from 3 years ago is still posted below. 
Some of the best food on Madison's eastside. Never a disappointment for dinner or a weekend brunch. 

We watch people wait in line for hours at Monty's when they could be seated immediately for a truly special brunch. 

I've enjoyed amazing tofu, lamb and goat dishes for dinner. The Chef-owner takes great pride in the quality of the food and seems to be working his tail off almost every night. He regularly checks in with customers. 

Some reviewers have commented about service and waiting for food. Yes, food may come out a bit slower during rush times. But we know the occasional wait will be worth it. There may be some room for improved systems and efficiency with operations here- but I'm still inclined to give them a 5 star review since they are in my neighborhood and I see a truly committed Chef-owner at the helm. 

This is a particularly great spot for bigger groups."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here, but the service is usually very slow. Delicious dinners with reasonable portion sizes."}
{"text":"We've dined here three times.  The food is always good and so is the service.  The exception was dining on Friday 4.1.11.  We had a four top and the waitress forgot to put one of our orders in correctly.  She didn't figure it out until after three meals were brought out.  So, three of us ate and the 4th person in our party had to wait 20 minutes more for their food.  We were finished by the time the 4th plate arrived.   It was very awkward and ruined the dining experience."}
{"text":"I love Himal Chuli. I wish I loved Dobhan. The space is attractive but not warm and welcoming. The service is lackluster even when there is hardly anyone in there. 
As for the food, it is uneven. I recently had the Tandoori chicken. It was delicious, moist, and good to look at. The vegetables were equally as tasty and attractive. The accompanying yogurt sauce was excellent. 
I have had lamb a couple of times in the past. The last time I had the tangine it was so salty it was inedible. I spoke to the owner who said the preserved lemon could have caused the problem, he offered no reparation. 
The vegetarian dishes are overpriced. 
I wish that the owner and staff reflected some commitment and joy about this restaurant that could be a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Many Nepali and Tibetan dishes with some Italian, Mediterranean, Indian and Wisconsin comfort food - a sort of global fusion. The dishes tend to be simple, but fresh, good quality, and always satisfying. It is well executed for an inexpensive restaurant. I have eaten here many times and will continue to do so. They have a simple, yet thoughtful weekend brunch - occasionally serving a nice egg scramble with smoked salmon or trout. 

Two notable nightly specials are the fish fry and baby back ribs. The goat curry is a favorite. 

Service can be hit or miss. And mixed drinks are usually disappointing - watered down Old Fashioned Sour or too many chucks floating in a mojito. Stick to the beer, wine, lassi, and other drinks."}
{"text":"Food is  very good but the service is painfully slow. Speed is the only reason for the 3 stars. Took over an hour and a half for brunch."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated interior, very friendly service, and excellent food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Masala dosa doesn't come with the usual sambhar. It comes with raita which tastes delicious with the dosa. 
The Vegetarian Dobhan burger is my favorite which has a moong daal patty.
Slightly disappointed with the Biryani (not cooked properly ? ) and Mango Lassi (it was freshly made but didn't taste good)
Our server was friendly and provided a quick service."}
{"text":"We went to a show at the Barrymore Theater over the weekend. We decided to try Dobhan since it was just a block away. The exterior of the restaurant is not particularly inviting, but the menu sounded tasty and reasonably priced. When we arrived there was a small line and a few open tables. While waiting for the hostess to seat us, what was most noticeable was the smell. It was a cross between south Asian spices and cleaning supplies: a little curry, a little chemical. It was not overwhelming but we noticed it the entire evening. The hostess asked us \"How many?\", grabbed two menus and headed off to our seats. There was no \" Follow me\", but it must have been implied.

Our waitress was friendly. She consistently gave each of us the other person's drinks and entrees, but she was delightful to interact with. There were a few creative cocktails on the menu.

For an appetizer we had the Mediterranean Flat Bread which consisted of pieces of pita, hummus, a red pepper paste, and a carrot dip. The carrot was surprisingly sweet and my favorite. The red pepper had great spice and surprise flavors. The hummus was perfect. This was a good beginning.

For entrees we had the fish fry which consisted of fried walleye which were fine, french fries which were crunchy, crisp, and perfectly seasoned, and a yummy light vinegary slaw. The lamb in the lamb tagine was also perfectly seasoned and prepared. The food was definitely the high-light.

I probably won't make an effort to head back to Dobhan, but if I am in the area, I would be happy to dine there again."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options, service and atmosphere.  I had the seitan and it was really good.  Great salad, dal & dessert.  Paced well... nothing but good things all the way around for the four people we had who ate dinner here tonight."}
{"text":"We went to Dobhan for brunch after discovering the diner across the street had a long wait. It was our second choice but ended up being a good one. The eclectic brunch menu offered up some breakfast classics such as eggs Benedict as well as some less ordinary options including eggs on chili con carne and dhosa (a kind of crispy crepe) filled with scrambled eggs. Everything looked and tasted delicious. While I can't speak to their regular menu, I can definitely say that I would have no hesitation returning to Dobhan again."}
{"text":"Just as good or better than any vegan meal I've had in Madison. I had the sautéed greens small plate and it was simple and loaded with umami flavors. The omnis at my table loved it too and we tore it up. Then I had the vegetable tagine and it is exceptional. Each vegetable has its own outstanding flavor and texture - not all stewed together. The greens are light and fresh, and the couscous on the bottom is flaky and buttery. The olives, almonds and figs give the dish its bass notes and I left satisfied. I also asked for a recommendation on a virgin cocktail and I was happy with the lime and mango puree out server suggested. My friends enjoyed their salmon and lamb. So many vegetarian options here but it's going to be hard not to keep ordering what I got!"}
{"text":"I've been to brunch 3 times at Dobhan, and I've run out of excuses for them. The service is abysmal and the staff seems to spend a lot of time bickering 'behind' the bar in full view of the dining area. 

On our last visit, we waited almost an hour for our meals, only to be served the wrong preparation for our eggs. We were hungry, so we didn't ask for them to be done again. Even if we'd wanted to, the server was long gone. The potatoes were unevenly cooked and some were a little hard in the middle. Really too bad, because the menu has some unique items, but there are so many places with excellent service in Madison that I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Food was great! Service was excellent! Everyone watched the entire floor. BOH was even coming out and checking on guests and helping clear plates. Everyone was smiling. Food really was fabulous."}
{"text":"We like to come to Dobhan for brunch, and it's always been tasty. We tend to get their breakfast sandwich, but the whole brunch menu looks good, especially if you like a little bit more esoteric dining experience. Their mango habanero sauce is delicious, but you have to ask for it, and a little goes a long way."}
{"text":"Consistently great food.  Love their tandoori, specials are always good.  One of the few restaurants in Madison that has excellent curried goat.  A great place!  Don't know why they aren't always packed?  A go-to place with guests because everything is so good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  I live nearby, so I'm there OFTEN.  In addition to their regular menu, they have some delicious and unexpected nightly specials....Mexican, Cuban, and barbeque ribs specials are always great.  Vegetarian friendly, great portion sizes and very reasonable prices.

The decor is wonderful....even Tibetan prayer wheels.  Airy interior, interesting art.  And I've never felt rushed.

If you go, don't miss the dal."}
{"text":"Tried the samosas and the dumplings. Both were divine. When we got the entrees, neither of us talked for a while because it was so good. I want to try everything on the menu. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the service is slow. However, we weren't in a rush and just enjoyed ourselves. Chill out and you can do the same."}
{"text":"Wife and I shared Tandoori chicken kabob  this evening. Started with battered vegetables, salad and dal, tasty. All was well presented including the hot empty plate we used for splitting our meal. Fresh stir-fried vegetables and rice accompanied the kabob. This was my 3rd visit."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite places - especially since part of my party is vegetarian and the rest enjoy 'meat'.  On average the food had been good with an occasional issue.  Last night (and recent trips) the quality of the food has degraded - my favorite dish, the Chicken Margarita  was over cooked and the delicious rice wasn't.  The service was so-so, one dish of the 6 came so late my dad got to start his dinner when everyone else was about done...  We  tried to wait - he insisted that we eat while most still had hot food.  There were 6 of us - they added in their 18%.  Was far more generous than if we got to choose the tip.  I doubt there will be a return trip in the near future.

One of the questions on Yelp when you do a review asks if good for group - if the service was better I would be able to mark it yes....  they have room but lack the experienced staff that they used to."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Madison. If you like lamb or their specialty goat try it. They also have excellent salmon on a bed of rice that is truly delicious.. vegetarian food as well. This restaurant is a hidden gem on the east side of Madison. A full bar as well. Its across the street from the Blue Plate diner"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed several meals at this restaurant. They have a nice variety of vegetarian dishes and they offer both brown and white rice. That scores major points in my book. 

Some of the wait staff are fabulous, a couple seem decent. As already stated, the decor is styley and they have a good set-up for large groups."}
{"text":"This restaurant was like a gift from the heavens above so the ratings for this place should be sky high. It was set break at the Barrymore and we were looking for a quick bite. This place was closed but decided to stay open to serve us! They suggested the lamb kebab and lamb Kathmandu. These dishes were delicious, so well prepared. Great grilled veggies, super sticky rice, fresh starter salad. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Good food! Great atmosphere. Slow service."}
{"text":"As others have said, service is slow.  But, if you aren't in a rush and bring friends for good conversation, you can relax and enjoy a really nice meal.  Fresh ingredients, nice flavors, and affordable wine list.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I may like Dobhan more than I normally would for the following reasons:

1. We had just driven 4 hours from Minneapolis and needed sustenance.
2. We wanted to go to Lao Laan Xang for lunch (at 1:45) on Sunday, but they were closed.  So we went to Monty's--who wouldn't have a table for 30 minutes.  We were starved and still had to drive 4 hours back home, so we stumbled into Dobhan, who was serving brunch until 3pm.  Hooray for keeping good hours!
3. I got the \"Bhat Tarkari,\" which was simply described as a vegetable stew with Nepali spices.  I was given the choice (by the waitress) between \"Saag\" and something else--but she had me at the word \"Saag.\"  I loves me some Saag.  She served me a generous portion of Saag with black-eyed peas and mushrooms over rice.  It was lick-the-plate good.  I'm serious--I actually had to stop myself from licking the plate.  It seemed relatively healthy, and my tummy was satisfied for a long while.
4. Honestly, for the quality of the dish I had, I would've expected to pay more than $10 including tax and tip.  That was a nice contrast from paying $10 for a can of soda and small sandwich in Minneapolis.

In other news, the decor is gorgeous and the service is friendly.  Plus, they serve yak meat in more than one dish.  I didn't get it, but if I go back, I'll have to try it.  I mean, come on...yak meat!  Where else are you going to find that?"}
{"text":"Really tasty breakfast . Great eggs and bacon  nice quite peaceful atmosphere .  Go local , the service is a little slow but it's so much more relaxed and friendly than the other restaurants in this area . Cool vibe ! Same price better food."}
{"text":"Ok so I came home with a tummy ache from this place, but its totally because I ate way to much (sheepish grin), it was just soooo goood.  Decor is kinda mix and match asian and indian which also describes the menu. I had a really hard time deciding what to get - there are plenty of appealing dishes on the menu.  Which simply means I'll have to go back,  with a bit more restraint..."}
{"text":"It was a 20 minute wait for the waiter to take our order (which they messed up). Our water glasses were empty the whole time and it was not clean at all. I wouldn't not recommend at all"}
{"text":"Love ! Love! Love this place! The dal is perfect and I always leave satisfied when I order the tofu buff or tofu secawa. The service could be improved by simply hiring a few more waitstaff. Atmosphere is lovely. This is a little gem."}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor, delicious food. Interesting detail: first drinks were very small, second drinks (red wine and margarita), the servings were TWICE the size. What was that about? Remorse? Food was delicious. Mussels in coconut curry, chicken tagine, salmon salad... all very very good."}
{"text":"Authentic food, great servers and kitchens staff. If you like exploring different tastes and aren't picky, just go with something unique & new. I trusted them and they delivered. Rajan is great in the kitchen and even better at interacting with customers"}
{"text":"The previous reviews are accurate, so if you're not prepared for a long night, go elsewhere.  The service is seriously slow.  The servers are nice but they disappear.

After quickly taking my beer order,  our server left and didn't return for a half-hour with my appetizer of spicy musshae (steamed soy-bean pods)- and no beer. We had to flag down the hostess to retrieve the beer.  She was embarrassed, and the server apologized.  Service continued like this all night, probably due to the \"private party\" effect.

The middle of the restaurant was dominated by a child's birthday party (balloons and all), with kids and parents enjoying food together.  Nice scene - I like families dining together.  But the kids were absolutely wild.  They were running laps around the restaurant with balloons trailing, playing with the big beads near the entrance, and almost flattened a server during these antics.  (Maybe that's why the servers disappeared?)

Yes, the parents acted terribly by not constraining their kids, but the management could have handled this much better.  It was really unpleasant to have these kids running and screaming by our table every thirty seconds as they did their laps.  Eventually two kids had a big collision, leading to screams and tears.  Yet, the management continued to be mellow and uninvolved.

I liked the food and the beer.  The curry shrimp over wilted spinach was delicious.  I found the mussels in the coconut milk sauce to be fair. There are many things on the menu that look appealing.  Next time I'm in town I would think about trying Dobhan again - if the servers were still slow and the atmosphere was mellow, I'd be okay with it.  But if I saw a bunch of little kids with balloons I'd turn right around and head to one of the other Nepalese places in town!"}
{"text":"My current favorite brunch place on the eastside! Never a wait, great food, and a large, warm friendly space. They use local organic ingredients and the food is delicious. My favorites were offered as specials (trout scramble, pork chop & eggs) but everything we get there is fantastic. Service can be a bit spotty, even when we are only one of four tables (we tend to get there right when they open). But while they may forget to bring us something we requested, they are friendly --and the food is amazing so we don't care. We don't go to be fawned over, just to eat like KINGS!"}
{"text":"I didn't necessarily dislike Dobhan, but I'm in no hurry to go back.  The waitstaff was attentive but the food too slow to come out.  Food was okay but OVERPRICED. We dropped $40 on two samosas, an appetizer sized salad that was supposed to be an entree, and a vegetarian dish that was 4 pieces of tofu, a few vegetables, and some rice.  Next time we'll  head to Himal Chuli.....or even good old Wong's down the street."}
{"text":"In addition to having some of the same goodness as Himal Chuli on State Street, they have super weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time this evening because I had a gift card. It was a nice time.

The place is just lovely. There's a lot of art on the walls and it's just a really nice atmosphere. 

Our server was so, so nice. She helped us decide what to order. 

Now the most important part: the food! I really liked the keema dosa (lamb and potato in a crepe like thing) and my friend enjoyed her tandoori chicken salad. What you really MUST order is the dal. We both ordered cups and regretted not getting bowls. IT IS SO DELICIOUS! I would come back just to order this. It's so much more flavorful than your typical lentil soup. 

I will mention that prices are a little high compared to other Madison restaurants."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite brunch spot on the weekend. Today, the service was again very slow. The Puhle Mumari ( an eggs Benedict type dish, and always my favorite) was disappointing. The sauce was sour rather than pungent and spicy and the  mung bean patty was flat. Bummer."}
{"text":"As far as Nepalese places go in Madison, Dobhan is not the place to visit. Stick to Himal Chuli on State Street.

I came here for dinner on a Sunday night. To start, the service was friendly, but slow and inattentive. I had to flag down a waiter to get me a table, and then do a lot more flagging to place my order and to pay my bill.

I started out with an order of samosas, which were solid and respectable. I wanted some veg. potstickers or momos, but they don't offer vegan versions (or even vegetarian versions) which was surprising. I'm guessing that they use some kind of frozen pre-made kind, which is why they don't offer any variety of fillings.

For my main course I had the veggie burger ($8), mostly because none of their Nepalese dishes looked appealing at the prices they were charging ($14 for a seitan curry?). The burger was terrible. The patty had no flavor and was under-salted; the bun was an awful white flour spongy piece of garbage and the lettuce and tomato were like eating plastic. The tomato was particularly brutal: it was pink in color, mealy and devoid of any flavor, the way that cafeteria salad ingredients tend to be. Which is basically how Dobhan is sourcing its ingredients I imagine (let me guess: their food service provider is Sodexho or Aramark).

In the end, Dobhan is imminently avoidable."}
{"text":"Wow, this was amazing, fresh, and delicious! We came for lunch on a Friday and at our table we got the Coconut Chicken,  Tikka Kebab with lamb and then another with tandoori chicken. We all agreed that if it had been socially acceptable, we would have licked our plates! 

Highly recommend this place and will return. Dinner is a little pricey so we'll come back for lunch and brunch."}
{"text":"Had I known their Himalayan/Nepalese speciality, I could have liked this place with better choice of entrees. 

Ignorance was on my part, I guess. A Sunday night dinner here started with a warm welcome at the front followed by a plate of delicious bread + dip (it was \"like\" hummas and pita, but not quite - anyways, delicious). For the main dish, I ordered Tajine (moroccan speciality), which really could have been a lot better with proper cooking technique. My friend's salmon dish looked very pretty, but the flavor didn't quite match the appearance. He said \"I could have had better salmon at Red Lobster.\" Ouch.

But their mojito was good. So I'll raise a glass to that."}
{"text":"This cute place is excellent! The decor is very Nepalese and inviting.  Not too many customers on a Thursday night which is unfortunate because the food & service were excellent. Started with the potato croquette, great flavor. Make sure you chose the Dal soup as your side, tastes homemade and authentic. I had the curry shrimp which you tell were fresh, flavors were rich and delicious. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is delicious and for such a reasonable price! Everything is $15 dollars or less. My family and I are all vegetarian and they have an impeccable list to choose from. The spices and flavors of each dishes blended together amazingly. 

The service here was also wonderful. Our water glasses were never empty, and they made us feel very comfortable."}
{"text":"While the service can sometimes be lacking, the food is excellent. The Sunday brunch has become a habit for me- almost every week I have the eggs Benedict or phull dosa. Good, strong coffee, too. I highly recommend this place.

EDIT: The last time I went and had brunch here, it took AN HOUR to eat. The service was abysmal. also, twice we have ordered dishes with chorizo in them, and that's not what we got. Instead, we got breakfast sausage. No warning beforehand (so that we could change our order), no apology for serving not-chorizo. Very unprofessional. This is why I am changing my review to 3 stars.

EDIT: After we were ignored for 15 minutes and not brought the coffee we asked for (for over 10 minutes while the 'server' messed with the POS system? having a hot cup of coffee right away would have kept us there), we just canceled our order and left. One star as of now, and I will not be giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious here!

Came in one day for breakfast. Got the lamb hash (a breakfast special). The land was very tender, juicy and flavorful. The potatoes were mixed with green and red peppers, and tasted very special, not too salty, but did not lose the saltiness that hashes should have.
Also tried the egg Benedict with trout (because they were out of smoked salmon). Everything mixed very well. All ingredients were very fresh, and made a delightful breakfast.

The only complaint is probably their extremely slow service. But the food is very good!"}
{"text":"Visited here two weeks ago. 

Ambiance - high ceilings, nice colors, artwork on the walls, etc
Service - our server was friendly, service was quick but we ate dinner at 5:30pm so probably early for the dinner rush
Food - tasty, the dal soup was good, samosa (only one in the order) spiced nicely, and seitan buff was delicious

The only negative was that I asked the bartender? (someone other than our server visited the table) for a dessert menu and she never brought one so we just paid then left.

I will definitely visit here again in the future."}
{"text":"If our first visit is any indication of the restaurant in general, it will be a definite no in the future. Combine bad service with mediocre food and you have Dobhan.

It should have been a warning sign when we walked in that half the tables were empty and just dirty (waiting to be cleaned), but we grabbed the only open table left anyway. We had just been shopping and running errands on a Saturday morning and were looking for something for brunch.

We very patiently waited 20 minutes for the 1 waitress to come to our table before requesting service at the counter. When she finally did come, she acted like she was doing us a favor by taking our order for 2 precious minutes.

I ordered the phull dosa and was incredibly disappointed when it came out. The menu listed it as a crispy crepe with eggs, spinach, and manchego cheese. The eggs were fine, but the spinach content was minimal and I refuse to believe that the orange shredded cheese was manchego.

My friend got one of the biryanis and it was pretty good. It seems like their true Nepalese food is tasty compared to some of their Nepalese-American combos.

When attempting to pay the bill, it was another waiting game, which ended in me leaving a flat cash amount for the waitress at the counter. I'm a pretty patient guy and it was a long time.

I would love to give it another try, but the restaurant wasn't even half full when we were there. There's plenty of other places (even some serving the same cuisine) in Madison to waste your time here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Lamb kebab and coconut chicken. Portions were appropriate for 1 and not too large. The food was very well prepared and had great flavor.

Overall a good experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"For me, it's a NAH. 
Coming here right after we biked for almost 5 hours, we felt hungry. 
If hungry, even the bad food tastes good. But too bad, that hypothesis wasn't working in this place. 
I hate to give a bad review but this restaurant just left some bad taste in my mouth. 
It was five of us and we ordered different menu. 
I had the samosa and Curry Shrimp. Hubby had potato croquette and Keema Dosa. Other companions had Morrocan Lamb Tagine, Morrocan Chicken Tagine and Tandoori Chicken. After waiting for more than 40 minutes (the waitress whose job is to fill in our water had been coming back for countless time before the food was served), most of us were disappointed with our dish. My curry shrimp sauce was good but the shrimp was cold (I assumed they just didn't heat it enough from the fridge), and my samosa was cold too. Hubby complained the same thing about his potato croquette. It was cold inside. 
My friends who had other dish commented similarly: it was too salty. They wanted to complain but were too worried it would take them another long wait just to enjoy one meal. 

Too bad our evening was not of excellent due to our failure of choosing a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Dobhan has quite a few unique food items. We decided to experiment with one and go safe with the other. 

The experiment was the phull dosa. Traditional Indian cuisine has a Masala Dosa in which a thin crepe is filled with a potato stuffing. The phull dosa had the stuffing on the side and the crepe was instead filled with a spinach omelette. It was an interesting concept that we liked but was not mind blowing. They don't provide chutney's (traditional ground coconut or tomato paste) with their dosas. 

The safe dish was kheema balti. Kheema consists of minced lamb cooked with spices. It came out exactly how we had imagined it. 

The chai (milk tea) was so good that we had two glasses each before we left the place. 

Definitely a place we would like to come again to. There is a pretty lengthy menu for us to try from."}
{"text":"Lovely food and great service. We had the sangria, which is quite tart and not very sweet at all; a nice change from the expected. Their ri-1 derby is a fine mint julep made with rye, tin cup and all. We had the Pakora, crispy fried vegetable fritters with a zingy tomato onion sauce. We had the Bhat Takari, made with tofu and cauliflower (ask for the half-half version), which is a lightly spiced yellow curry. Get the brown rice. We also had the Moroccan Vegetable Tagine, a deeply spiced dish. We really enjoyed the figs and olives tucked amongst the vegetables. Get the Dal! It's a hearty lentil and bean soup that has a good amount of peppercorn. We had been wanting to try this place for some time, and are so glad we did, finally, we will definitely be back."}
