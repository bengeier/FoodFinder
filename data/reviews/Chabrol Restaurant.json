{"text":"Amazing new restaurant!   I had the foie gras to start and the chestnut soup.  I also tried the creme brûlée for dessert and it's the real deal!  I enjoyed my meal with a glass of JM Sohler Grand Cru Winzenberg Pinot Gris (wonderful with the foie gras).  I took home the mushroom artichoke ragout for dinner the next evening and even leftovers were excellent.  The chef is outstanding and the service is impeccable.  Love this place- you have to try it!  Suggest you make reservations though as the dining area is quite small.  They do have seats at a \"bar\" area."}
{"text":"Love at first bite; truly authentic French food in the heart of Yorkville.   Having been in Toronto this entire summer, I was feeling that the authenticity of French food in Toronto was fairly lackluster. After Truffles closed back in 2009, the only place where you could order any French dish that wasn't on the menu and have it delivered to your table, my father has complained relentlessly about the lack of fine french food in the city. Although I was hesitant to try another French place out with such a critic, I thought that we might aswell give this new joint a try.  From Yorkville Ave, this place is set far back from the street with seating for 10 inside and a large patio with kitchen for the summer months. The size of the restaurant immediately transported me back to the times I have been in Paris inside crammed restaurants that push out delicious food to those lucky enough to snag a table. Absolute 10/10 for decor and ambiance.   When it came to the food, I ordered the Rabbit Tartine, the Ttoro and the Apple Tarte for dessert. My father ordered the Trout Tartine, the Papiollte of Whitefish and the Creme Brule. Everything that we ordered was cooked to perfection and was delivered with the techinique which French food prides itself on. The tartine had a sweetness that had me addicted at first bite, the Ttoro was perfectly portioned and had me wanting to drink the saffron-broth from the bowl and the Apple Tarte was doused in the Calvados Sabayon sauce which I had heard being whipped to perfection just minutes before. Overall, you could see the effort and serious elbow grease that was put into every dish.   If that wasn't enough, at the end of the meal my father insisted I write a review about the supreme experience we had shared. As a self-proclaimed French food critic himself, he claimed the food was authentic and deserving of a gold star in his books.  Five stars all around."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Never before has such culinary genius, great service and wonderful wines been presented in such a tight and efficient package... Check this one out!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant tucked away in Yorkville. We had the lamb and ttoro as mains. Both were delicious, but the lamb was exceptional. Service was great and the atmosphere was intimate, with an open view to the chef's impressive work with what appeared to be an extremely small kitchen! We will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"This is a charming tiny restaurant tucked away in a walkway in Yorkville. I started with the Rabbit Tartine. Great flavour, perfectly cooked. My guest had the Papillote of Whitefish. Excellent. And yes, I had cold chicken with sauce suedoise. I never imagined that a cold chicken could be so tasty. We had perfect service. What I appreciated was that we never had to ask for our water or wine glasses to be refilled. We were never rushed, and the timing between courses was appreciated. Cava has always been one of my favourites. Chabrol is now added to that list."}
{"text":"Came in from NYC to celebrate our 5 year anniversary and I have NOTHING negative to say about this place.  It's small, cozy and very intimate tucked away in a back alley, it's like trying to find a secret treasure.  The food was so so good! Rabbit and foie gras for appetizer and the mushroom and cauliflower ragout for dinner and the apple tart for dessert.  Everything was to die for!  Great portion sizes and rich in flavor.   This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We had dinner in March (the day of earth hour).  Nice wine list.  I was enchanted by the server's explanation of how the different grapes in a Bordeaux were like the bones and muscles in your body.  The ttoro (like a bouillabaisse) was awesome; it's the destination dish of the restaurant. The lentil salad was also delicious.  The rabbit tartine was forgettable (like a cold chicken sandwich) and we were confused and expecting a terrine.  I blame the earth hour candlelight that made it hard to read the menu.  We mentioned this to the server in passing, and she graciously took the tartine off the bill.  For dessert, the tarte tatin tasted like it was made by the French aunt I always wished I had.  It's a tiny little place and they make all the food on a hot plate behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. Oysters were amazing as well as the cheeseboard. Wine and fish were also wonderful.  Service was excellent. This is a really quaint restaurant - I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Don't bother making a reservation if you have a child.  Guy basically blew me off when I tried to make it.  Said he'd loved to have us back (when we don't have a child with us).  Didn't even give him the time (which was not peak time btw).  At least wait until we give you information on when we are  thinking of coming before you say there's no room.  *feel like I should note that the restaurant we did go to were very accommodating. The manager came up at the end of the meal to say how incredibly well behaved our kids are.  Not the first time we've heard that.  Restaurants need to have a little more faith in some parents."}
{"text":"Very Good....... But not fantastic. Chabrol is a small cute bistro/ small restaurant. I had a seat outside (during summer which was nice).  I had the lentil salad with beets as a starter, which had some very interesting flavors, but was not great. As a main I had the lamb which was truly delicious; perfectly cooked, juicy and well seasoned.  This is a good place, food is high quality, but for me, it lacks originality!"}
{"text":"It's a lovely restaurant in Yorkville. My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary/ his birthday. We seated in the patio. It was quite and delightful. The dishes were flavourful but light. I love the apple tarte. I'll just come back for the dessert."}
{"text":"We had dinner for the first time at Chabrol last night and I will be sure to return for another close encounter. For starters, I had the Riesling poached Foie Gras, which was very tasty and my wife was thrilled with her Cured Trout, which melted in the mouth.  I was blown away with my main, which was what the chef calls Ttoro; the best way I can describe this dish is the very best Bouillabaisse I have ever had. Period. The broth was so delicious that I would have been very happy to have it without the accompanying fish and seafood. It was that good. The fish was too, by the way. Would have made any decent chef in Marseilles proud to serve. My wife had the braised lamb with fennel, which she enjoyed very much. Not a speck to be found on either plate as they made their way off the table.  We shared a tart tatin for dessert., which was bathed in a most ethereal cream sauce, and it still retained a very nice crisp texture on the pastry. It was all produced on a two burner cooktop by the chef alone. No sous chef in sight. Really a treat to watch, which you could do from every seat in the house. Very attentive staff, and a bartender who pours a great martini!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in yorkville. The seating is small so you always have to book even for two. It's very intimate so I wouldn't recommend it for a first date unless you're on the patio.  The ttoro and apple tart are the best, at times the wait for food can be quite long but there's a small. It's still worth waiting because the food is always divine. If you're visiting Yorkville you must try this place."}
{"text":"Chef Doug and his team were absolutely amazing. Was here for dinner this evening and I had the best service!! Yorkville is often known for being a little pretentious but the staff here were incredibly attentive, down to earth, and hospitable. Prob one of the best service I've received at a restaurant in Toronto. Chef Doug was also very personable and I really loved watching him cook in the small amount of space available to him! Would come back here just for the ambiance and service alone. Had a great evening at this little gem. Thanks Chabrol!"}
{"text":"Love this small restaurant! Kitchen is small but very efficient. Servers are very professional.  Must make reservations because tables always fill up fast if not. This is the second time I came and the quality is still excellent.  I really like the mushrooms dish and their apple tarte. The fish seafood soup \"ttoro\" is also a must try;  the fish soup base has the extracted fish taste but not very heavy. I would say the whole menu is excellent and delicious. Recommend to bring your date here!"}
{"text":"Very nice cute little restaurant serving authentic crème brûlée. It's best to make a reservation otherwise it's a very tiny and busy place."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is packed all the time (had to wait a long time for a seat), probably due to location, because the food is really nothing special. First of all they have a limited bar, and you couldn't really order really just any drink you want, which is not really a problem. The Martini was pretty good. The foie gras was fine, but the bread was very stiff and hard to swallow. The salad was just a lot of mayo splattered all over some lentils - was actually really bad.,There are 3/6 entrees that are cold dishes, so we both settled for the braised lamb. It is not well done at all - lukewarm, lacking flavor and was not even that tender. For a Yorkville restaurant it is really uninspiring."}
{"text":"It's experiences like this that make me wonder.  Immediately upon arrival, the vapid atmosphere hit my fiancé and I like a ton of impotent bricks. \"Greeted\" by the server, it was as if we were about to dine in the lobby of a half-baked 3-star hotel. The reality of the situation was regrettably not far off.  Coming in with high expectations, and money to burn, was our first mistake. The first word that comes to mind is \"Drab\".  My partner and I aren't the Yorkville types. Maybe that's why our server, sloppy as ever, seemed to despise every moment of attention he paid to our table, though those moments were few and far between.  The food was mostly cooked with skill, but dishes like the lamb shoulder were held back by GastroPub veg.  Creme brûlée? Sure it's on the menu. Sure my fiancé orders it every time. Did she order it this evening? No."}
{"text":"A pretentious little place, catering to the upmarket crowd. Worth a visit on a quiet day if you have cash to spare.  Pleasant patio with small tables, the inside is tiny and very cramped, but it all happens in the right part of town. It will do great on such occasions as TIFF.  Good wine list, overpriced - $65 for a lovely Cote du Rhône white.  Plenty of unctuous waiters (who rather pretend they know the wines), who manage to be condescending and obsequious at the same time.  The portions are small and yet carefully prepared. Fois Gras, cold, yet well presented. (The black current overwhelms it). The celeriac dish is lovely. The Greek mushroom dish is cold, which is an aberration. TheTtoro is sparse, with the sauce made separately from the main ingredients, it is a pity that they never met. The Tartine of rabbit is exactly as posted, but small."}
{"text":"Located in (part of) what used to be Le Trou Normand, this tiny restaurant is intimate and absolutely delicious.  I started with the chestnut soup, which has sheep's milk crème fraîche, sorrel and croutons is silky smooth and flavoured perfectly.  The main, whitefish en papilotte, was amazing as well - perfectly portioned and not overdone.  I also shared one of the restaurant's gratins - escarole, celeriac and savoury - and it wasn't heavy like some gratins tend to be.  For dessert, I shared an apple tart, topped with Calvados sabayon.  The mixture of the tartness of the apples with the sweetness of sabayon was definitely a treat (especially the sabyon).  The tarts are made to order and the sabayon poured tableside.    Portion sizes are excellent - definitely European-sized (with the exception of the apple tart, which is meant to be shared, anyway) - and service is at a pace where you don't feel rushed.   Staff are also friendly and will answer any questions clients may have.  Dishes are clearly explained (in terms of how it is prepared).  This is definitely a place I will return to."}
{"text":"Wow! When searching for new gems - this place has always been in mind but never had the opportunity to go until now! So happy that we came on a monday afternoon during patio seating. P.s very limited seating inside. Very cute restaurant tucked away in an alley & impeccable service. Must get the apple tart for dessert - 25 mins prep time so order ahead - it was honestly heavenly. The pastry part was so flaky and crispy on the outer part combined with the creamy foam , thinly sliced apples & dough in the middle was perfection. Atmosphere was so chill at the patio and relaxing when i went because they were not too busy that afternoon. Loved every moment!"}
{"text":"Chabrol is a small restaurant in Yorkville. It is a bit of a hidden gem. My partner and I visited this restaurant as it was a 2016 En-Route Magazine nominee for best new restaurant in Canada. The atmosphere was very intimate and romantic. There's a whimsical and Parisian vibe to the restaurant.  The service is excellent as well.  The kitchen is in open view. Chabrol is able to turn out amazing dishes by using just two induction burners and a convection oven.  To start, we had the foie gras. It was delicious.  For main, I had the braised lamb with provencal vegetables and rosemary jus. The lamb was cooked perfectly. It was tender and flavourful. It also went well with the red wine that was recommended by our server.   For dessert, we got the apple tarte which was a wonderful way to end the meal.  The puff pastry is made in house, and the Calvados sabayon poured tableside over the just-baked tarte is whisked Ã  la minute.   If you are looking for a cute intimate restaurant for dinner, Chabrol is an excellent option."}
{"text":"Chabrol is a beautiful restaurant, chef Doug is such a wonderful chef and kind person! The food here is always incredible. The beauty of Chabrol is that the ingredients are such high quality and everything is cooked to bring out the natural flavors. I usually get the mushroom dish (which is vegan/vegetarian) or the Ttoro, both dishes are absolute must haves when you come to Chabrol.   The restaurant is small, but it has an incredible patio for the summer.   This place is pricey - but more than worth it, for special occasions this has to be one of my favorite places, the food, service and ambiance are all incredible.  While my many experiences have been incredible, my one complaint would be for booking parties, I looked into renting the venue for a special occasion, which they were very helpful about. However to rent the venue there is a down payment of 5000$ - which does not include any of the food or the wine which we obviously would be getting. Although the establishment is in York ville, which is always going to be very expensive, a payment of 5000$ before food and drinks is a bit ridiculous. For a party it would roughly be around 15 000$. Which I cannot justify."}
{"text":"I can't possibly understand why I waited so long to visit. Now that I have, at the polite suggestion from a very good friend, I thank both him and the chef (Charles that evening), and all the wonderful staff (Russell and Chris) who made our evening spectacular.   I was fortunate enough to go with my family; as such, was able to enjoy a larger array of appetizers, entrees and dessert than I would have if I went with a smaller party. I am only sad that my pants and stomach would not allow me to consume more. All this means is that we shall have to return again for their seasonal menu changes and regular specials.   I can only have have high praises for all the items ordered and look forward to be awed again. Final note, I think I'd just visit for their apple pie if they'd let me , but will fail by wanting to order an appetizer and entree too."}
{"text":"I went here for an early dinner/late lunch, which turned out because it's a very small place and apparently gets packed.   The lamb with turnips was delicious.  It was hearty but not too much.  We also got a delicious apple tart desert with foam on top that was the best part of the experience.  I would def recommend this place to friends.  Great little gem in Yorkville."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  For the appetizer, I've ordered the  Tartine of Cured Trout with Chervil ($15.00) They were cut into bit size. I usually don't enjoy trout but this appetizer with the chervil, it tasted good and presented nicely. I really enjoyed it.  I've also ordered the  Riesling-Poached Foie Gras with Black Currant and Salsify ($23.00) usually I preferred foie gras pan seared but this dish brings out the flavour.   My friend ordered the  Gratin of Potato, Cantal, and Thyme ($15.00) as she is vegetarian.  I took a few bite to sample. The cheese wasn't too heavy and it was nicely presented on a small skillet. It stayed warm for a long time.   I must say the service is excellent, from the time we sat down, our waiter placed the napkin gently on my friend and I with a lovely warm smile.   It made the experience very pleasant on a gloomy day. Lovely ambiance. Will definitely bring more friends back!"}
{"text":"5pm reservation, seated immediately, very nice staff. Tiny restaurant with a nice menu but overpriced for bistro food. Food was very good and the apple tart is delicious but for $200 for two we expected more. In addition, the waiter accidentally spilled a full glass of wine on me - completely full - resulting in a soaked cashmere sweater and marks on my leather bag which was on the floor and they didn't comp us the wine. They replaced the glass of wine but I will have to get the sweater and bag cleaned. A bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I thought about giving this place a 3, but I realized that just because it wasn't my usual scene, doesn't mean it didn't deserve a 4 for its delicious food and superb service. When I showed up and explained we were a party of 5, the host told me that they don't usually take reservations of parties over 4ppl! But since it was Sunday at 5pm, they seated us. Very nice of them. I know some places that would just downright refuse!   Food: Pork Liver Mousse - I could see myself coming back here just to snack on this. Quantity and quality fit the price.  Lentil Salad - This was delicious. Not sure how healthy it is in terms of a salad, but I would recommend it.   Friends had:  Ttoro - and loved it.  Roasted squash salad - apparently it was only okay.  Rabbit tartine - a good portion for a lunch or light dinner Apple tart - they liked it, I didn't.   I would come here again if I was really in the mood for some light french cuisine, and didn't mind shelling out a few bucks. I'm not jumping to bring anyone here though; personally I like more of a trendy vibe."}
{"text":"Just outstanding...it is small so I'd highly recommend a reservation.  Service is very well done even if it is clear that regulars may get a little bit extra. The sous vide method is quite well used on several item's as are traditional methods for other dishes. Had an amazing Birthday dinner here with the Fois starter followed by the white fish (atlantic cod that day) with swiss chard, beurre blanc. Then the lamb with provencal vegetables.  The potato gratin with that was outstanding.  Wine matches were very well done and super consultative approach was used. Also enjoyed the amazing apple tart and an espresso along with an armanac.  One of the nicest parts was a willingness to allow our courses to be shared and that extended to the wine. Super impressed by that. It remains a splurgy meal regardless and with that kind of attention to detail and service be prepared to tip accordingly.    I would eat any of the dishes again in a hearbeat the presentation flavour and care were super obviously present along with the service."}
{"text":"What we ate :  - rabbit tartine  - Roasted squash salad  - Foie Gras - Braised Lamb  Overall, a very good restaurant.  Because I had heard such great things, perhaps my expectations were overly high, so I wasn't wowed but can certainly appreciate the attention to detail on the plates and services wise. A bit too pricey, though, for what it is.   The restaurant is very quaint and got definitely want to sit on the patio in the lane way if you are able to. The foie Gras and rabbit terrine were tasty starters. The rabbit was the winner of the two. Also, the roasted squash salad was fantastic. Very refreshing flavours and the squash was definitely the star...it wasn't drowning in greenery   The lamb was cooked perfectly. But nothing novel about the preparation.   Service was fantastic. Our waitor was attentive, made good suggestions and checked in with us the right amount."}
{"text":"Apple tart and ttoro are worthwhile. Commit to the apple tart early because it takes 25 minutes to prepare. Skip the foie gras, the carrot soup, and the potato gratin. Service is fair considering the price point and location of resto. Travel light, there isn't much space for stuff. Patio can be quite lovely if you can snag a seat."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We were looking forward to this visit, but it didn't work. The apps were good, the mains less so. Ttoro had good broth but was undistinguished fish, ok shrimp, terrible mussels. The chicken was all right but not great, the mushroom dish good. Wine was expensive. In all we expected more for $100 each. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Divine. Delicious. Delectable. Small and intimate tucked inside and alley - very romantic. Food to die for and service was friendly and personal."}
{"text":"Went here for my husband's birthday and we absolutely loved it! The food was amazing, the service was excellent and overall it was a nice, romantic experience. I highly recommend this place for dates and couples. It's a small space but that adds to its intimacy. We had the Ttoro and Apple Tart - which you CANNOT miss."}
{"text":"I went to Chabrol on a cold winter's evening and felt like I stepped into a someone's personal, warm, bustling kitchen. It is a TINY SPACE. For a second I was certain that I was in an escape room and there was a secret door I had to uncover to lead me into the actual restaurant, but in fact they really did manage to cram a kitchen, bar, and all 19 seats into that space. How they manage to create such delicious full plates from what appears to be a kitchen the size of an Easy-Bake oven is beyond me; the chef is obviously a tiny and magical wizard.   We started with the pork liver mousse and roasted squash frisee salad. The mousse was delicious, the salad unique but not something I would order again. Then we shared the Ttoro - mussels, shrimp, and white fish served in a saffron broth. This was served with fresh crusty bread to mop up the outstanding broth. We then shared the lamb, which was moist and served in a flavourful jus. I didn't love the turnips that were served with it as they were kind of bland. The escarole and celeriac gratin was INCREDIBLE and was my favourite savoury dish of the night. I should note that this was an excessive amount of food and if you intend on going, I would skip the lamb. This is primarily to save space for the apple tarte dessert which should be ordered in advance as it takes 20 minutes to prepare. THIS. DESSERT. IS TO DIE FOR. You could even come and order JUST this dessert and your life would be complete. The chef apparently makes his own puff pastry every morning (a very labour-intensive job according to YouTube). The combination of this buttery, warm, fluffy, slightly chewy puff pastry with tart apples, caramelized sugar, and freshly whisked calvados sabayon sauce is GENIUS. I can't even. Just go."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant recently and loved it! This is a very small place, it looks like it might seat 20 people inside. It has a cute and petite open kitchen which amazingly cooks up the most delicious food. We ordered the pork liver mousse and Savoy cabbage soup to start. The pork mousse was packed with flavor and reminiscent of Paris. Enjoyed the soup too, but if I had to choose one I'd pick the pork mousse. Tried their famous ttoro, and delighted in the exquisite saffron base and seafood. Also had the white fish and was surprised at how the delicate fish was complemented by the butter sauce. Finished off the dinner with an apple tart and cheese. This was my favorite part of the meal! The apple tart was hot, fresh and made to order. The flaky pastry had just the right balance of crunchiness and softness. The tastes of the  slightly tart apples and creamy sauce were well paired. Cheese plate was very authentic, they were unpasteurized and imported from France. Overall would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I came here in October one evening, and actually sat outside on the quaint and intimate patio since they had heaters. The service was extremely attentive (without being bothersome), polite and knowledgeable. The food was absolutely amazing. I had the pork liver mousse, the gratin of escarole, celeriac, and savoury and the braised lamb. Everything about this meal was amazing and memorable. I cannot wait to go back. I highly recommend this place if you are an open-minded eater, and have an appreciation for French cuisine and fine dining."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for dinner during the weekend. He mentioned that he booked a table one month prior so I'd highly recommend booking well in advance! Chabrol is a boutique-sized restaurant. It seats 5 tables of 2 and a bar of approximately 10 people. We were lucky to be seated away from the group of 2's or else everyone would basically eavesdrop each others' conversations haha. Overall, I think Chabrol is a great impress-your-date place. Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't as good as I expected.  DRINKS: * Domaine Merlin Chardonnay 2014 - Macon La Roche Vineuse (mine) * Pinot Noir (his)  * RIESLING-POACHED FOIE GRAS with black currant and salsify (2/5) Ok.. I LOVE foie gras. I had very high hopes for this fancy sounding riesling-poached foie gras! Unfortunately, it was rather.. stinky(?) I really didn't like this. 2 points are given for the nicely displayed pieces of bread and salsify haha. Great for Instagram.  * TARTINE OF RABBIT with braised endive (3.5/5) We felt a little guilty for ordering rabbit meat but the meat was delicious...!! It's a simple appetizer to cleanse your palettes before the mains. Even though this dish had a lot of bread, it wasn't overwhelming. I'd recommend sharing this dish between two people.  * \"TTORO\" (4/5) This was delicious - I'd recommend this soup. It tastes like a squash soup with fresh seafood. Seafood included fish, mussels and shrimps. The fish was delicious! The soup was not overly thick so it didn't make us feel bloated afterwards.   * MUSCOVY DUCK with barigoule of artichokes, chestnuts, fennel and pearl onions (2/5) It's a boiled duck with watered-down flavour. What stood out to me the most were the chestnuts in the dish. Otherwise, the whole dish was quite bland in taste. The duck meat was way too soggy. I wouldn't recommend ordering this.  DESSERTS: * APPLE TARTE with calvados sabayon (4/5) Our server highly recommended the apple tarte for desserts. Good recommendation! The apples were still crispy, which paired nicely with the soft pastry for the tarte. The sauce they poured on top was creamy and light. Save your tummy for this dessert!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Friday night but was called by a close friend whose mother had passed away and all plans flew out the window. Unfortunately, I forgot to call the restaurant and tell them I wouldn't be able to make it, which was a faux pas on my part. However, the owner's response was completely out of line and downright harassment. He called me three times and texted me - when I realized and answered the phone, he proceeded to chastise me even after I apologized and told me how terrible I was (his words) and that I will never be welcome at his restaurant again. Ever (his words). I am honestly appalled at this treatment, I understand that you are a small business owner but you are also a human being and simply confirming that I would not be coming would have been enough. You never know what someone is going through and I am absolutely disgusted at the way I was treated. Good luck with your small business, Niall. I hope that you will eventually be able to let go of your anger."}
{"text":"I've only had the pleasure of coming here for dessert, and it is amazing. The service is incredible.   We were greeted at the door with smiles, the host took our jackets and we sat at our table. The whole restaurant is very very small, it maybe seats 20 people.   We had the Crème Brûlée which was amazing, exactly the way it should be. Creamy Creme at the bottom and the top had a perfect crust.   Next up... WARNING... The Apple Tarte with Calvados Sabayon. FUCKING PERFECT.   This came much later as it takes about 25 minutes to cook. The pastry itself is perfect, buttery and crisp. The thin apples are then topped with the Sabayon which is a custardy sauce that has a bit of liquor. The Combination of flavours is overwhelming.   It's a great date spot and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great French food, just felt like being in a small Parisian restaurant. The food is driven from the southern parts of France...check it out!"}
{"text":"Good reviews from Chabrol brings me to this little French restaurant in Yorkville.  Please note that this is a very small restaurant with limited seating inside and outside at the patio, and I recommend seating at the patio.  This restaurant has a little different environment than most of the other restaurants.  There are two open kitchens, one inside and one at patio.  As you walk in, it immediately gives you the feel that you are eating at the street restaurant in France, and you will forget you are still in Toronto.  The service is excellent, they are all very polite.  We had the oysters and trout tartar for appetizers, oysters are from PEI and they are very fresh.  We ordered the Ttoro and Braised Lamb for main.  The Ttoro is very delicious, although the portion is a little too small at that price point.  Finally we had the apple tarte for dessert which is one of their signature dessert.  The tarte itself is very soft and the apple fills up with the taste and smell of wine.  I personally like italian fine dining more, but this restaurant changes my thought, French inspired cuisine can be so taste too.  I will definitely come back to have another visit, sitting at the patio and enjoy the outdoor environment.  One tip for yelpers is you will need to spend at least 2 hours for the dinner as the dishes come out slowly."}
{"text":"Always love their food here, from the appz to the main to the desserts. They are all each very unique and tasty! Everything made to perfection. Excellent service too, make sure you make reservations, they are not good for walk in as they have very limited for spaces. There are only 5 small tables and less than 10 seats The bar."}
{"text":"Loved it here. Great service, amazing food, intimate setting. Everything on their menu was delicious and beautifully presented. The restaurant itself is really small, so make reservations early. Great for birthdays, anniversaries or anything romantic."}
{"text":"Though small in size (so make a reservation) Chabrol's voice can be heard echoed in the praise from their patronage. The mouthwateringly well thought out menu is  undoubtably french but not heavy. Their service is friendly and accommodating and was always there when needed.  I was there with a small group and we sat on the patio, one of the few patios in the city that feels like it is both indoors and out, bringing that welcoming feeling along with that characteristic. I personally would recommend the Mushrooms à la Grecque with Cauliflower and Pearl Onions which is one of the cold mains (there are three) and done just perfectly. I also urge you to try the Gratin of Escarole, Celeriac, and Savoury as its flavour was on point and not overly rich. The table ordered all three deserts so that we could try them all and you really can't go wrong with any of them, they were so good I forgot to take any pictures.   Overall Chabrol is one of Toronto's fine dining experiences that must be had to be understood. Whether you sit inside its intimate 20 seat interior, a few feet from the open kitchen or on the patio sheltered from the elements, you won't soon forget the indulgent flavours that will grace your pallet."}
{"text":"A totally unique drop of authentic ambiance in the heart of the city.  Many more bottles on the wine list than seats in the restaurant.   The way it should be.   Interesting offerings.  Expertly managed.    Casual but curated.  Can get expensive, but worth it.  A perfect special night out or fun moment on the town.  The kind of spot that you tell your friends about but make sure that they don't spread the word too loudly."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Chabrol two weeks in advance, but when we actually arrived there were still a few seats left at the bar. The atmosphere is lively and incredibly loud, so you end up shouting for your friend to hear you.  The restaurant is quite small and the kitchen is even smaller. You can see it from the bar, and it's literally one chef busily making delicious dishes. If you want to use the washroom it's downstairs.  My sister and I split the appetizer (pork liver mousse, quite yummy) and the dessert (the famous apple tart!). For the dessert they pour the fluffy cream over the tart right in front of your eyes. We got the lamb and the duck, both of which comes with bread to soak up the sauce. We ended up packing them to go because the portion was quite large.   I'm giving Chabrol a really high rating because their service is so friendly and wonderful! Their staff is chatty, always smiling, and attentive to your needs. I dropped by on my birthday and they gave me dessert with a little candle on top.   Usually after your meal the restaurant will serve you a mint or a candy, and at Chabrol they gave handmade lemon... cookies? I'm not sure how to describe them. As well, the waiters were very generous with the lemon cookies! If you wanted extras they will gladly give you more.   It's a lovely restaurant with great staff, pretty good food, but it's a tad noisy. I might drop by for a special occasion again."}
{"text":"This was a really good dining experience, and a nice place to go for a special occasion.  Food was delicious, french classics but often with an interesting twist or different flavours. Apple tart is very good and fun to eat. Very tiny restaurant, which makes for a unique and intimate experience - neat to be so close to food preparation behind the counter, and to be in one single room with other patrons - but can also be distracting, as you're sitting very close to other tables. I held back one star mainly for the service, it was fine, but could have been more attentive, especially considering it is a small restaurant and is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"What a lovely little restaurant! I was there for lunch and everyone (chef and wait staff) were so happy they were dancing at times, they were all very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious! I went by myself so I only ordered one dish: the papillote of whitefish, and a chocolate raspberry marquise for dessert. They have a nice patio which allows for more seating. Overall it was a great experience and would love to come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for dinner. The restaurant is quite small and cozy as there are only 5 or 6 tables of 2s. In the summer I think they will have their patio opened which would be quite nice. However, if you are looking for privacy, this would not be the place as the tables are very close together and you can literally hear the conversation the table next to you is having.  I ordered the foie gras for appetizer, the white fish wrapped in parchment paper for the main, and apple tart for dessert. I personally prefer pan fried foie gras over the raw mousse type, so I might not have enjoyed it as much as other reviewers have. I enjoyed the white fish, however, which came in a sealed parchment paper envelope, so the fish was left juicy and just cooked to perfection. The apple tart was good and our server asked in advance if we wanted to order it so we didn't have to wait long.  Overall the food quality is there and is a great place for French cuisine."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a quick lunch here today and it was perfect. The food and service was phenomenal. I felt like we stepped into a little nook in Paris. We had a few different things but what stood out was the quality of everything. The quiche was perfect, oysters were excellent and the salads were very tasty-even for my hubby :) The tarte to end everything off was beyond... This is now our go-to place!"}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant to Alo and is easier to get a reservation here than Alo.  I love the foie gras here as well as rabbit and whitefish."}
{"text":"I love French food and this was no exception. The restaurant itself is quite small and you can watch the magic happen as the kitchen is on full display. There are only a few tables at the restaurant, several bar seats and the rest is patio seating. I ordered the oysters, foie gras and ttoro and shared the gratin. For desert we shared the creme brûlée and apple tart. All dishes were exceptionally good. If I had to choose one desert to try I would do the apple tart. The restaurant is not cheap, but well worth it for the delicious food and stellar service. The ttoro dish is very good - the broth is amazing. I shared the gratin with my friend and it complimented the soup well."}
{"text":"Based on only one experience, I don't understand the extent of the praise for this establishment.  Perhaps because we were clearly \"business\" customers, we were pushed to one of the most expensive wines on what is generally a very fairly priced wine list.  When I asked about less expensive options, I was again directed to the more expensive (and admittedly very good) wine.  The mushroom, cauliflower and artichoke dish we started with was absolutely wonderful (that deserves 5 stars), but the short rib entree was too tough and too bland to earn even three stars.  My friend and I had this same entree, so maybe we just got unlucky with this dish.  Such a small and charming little place, I hope for their continued success.  But also hope others find more consistent food preparation than we did."}
{"text":"The patio is very nice. It's nicely lit in the evening. Marble tables, herbs in planters. Very close attention to detail for the aesthetics of the patio.   Service is friendly. The wine is good but seems to be priced a bit high for what you get. Lots of French options. The beer is good, too, and they have Belgian Trappist beers available.   The food seems hit or miss. I liked the Papillote of Whitefish. The presentation was awesome--they open the bag and pour butter on it at the table. Solid dish.   Unfortunately I can't say the same for the Braised Lamb with Fennel. The lamb wasn't what I expected for braised lamb--it seemed almost boiled. The flavours were somewhat bland and very mediocre compared to other lamb dishes I've had in Toronto and around the world. I definitely wouldn't come back for that.   Overall, a pretty good spot. If I had ordered the fish instead of the lamb for myself I probably would've given it 5, but the lamb dish was disappointing. The decor is gorgeous, the service is friendly. The patio has a nice romantic feel and would be great for evening drinks or dinner.  I would definitely come back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"With a love for fine dining, a propensity to shop Chanel, and an inherent joie de vivre, I think I may have been Parisian in a previous life. Granted I may not be a Sartre-reading, chain-smoking intellectual, but the Francophone lifestyle has always intrigued me ... which is probably why I'm smitten by Chabrol, a charming boîte in the heart of Yorkville.  Hidden away in an unassuming little alley on the popular Yorkville Avenue, Chabrol has all the charm and quaintness you'd expect of a cosy French bistro, sharing it's space with a chic boutique.  The open kitchen houses just two induction burners and a small convection oven. This is where the magic happens. Sitting at the bar allows you to take in all the action -- like a well-oiled machine, plates are served, admired, enjoyed, cleared, drinks are poured, and before you realize it, you're in a mutual admiration society with the anonymous diner beside you. It truly is something to watch.  But the food ... oh, the food ... is where Chabrol truly shines.  The Riesling-poached foie gras with black currant and salsify was decadent and buttery goodness. And we watched in delight as the whitefish, wrapped in parchment, was delicately cut open, releasing a light aromatic steam and welcoming the generous drizzle of Vermouth-infused butter. While the chicken may have been the understated dish of the evening, it in no way failed to impress as well.  But the true piece-de-resistance was the Ttoro, a southern France take on bouillabaisse which had me returning for more. Mussels, shrimp, mackerel and snapper fish bathed in saffron-scented broth, and it took all our energy to not lick the plate clean.  Our dashing sommelier schooled us on the origin of the word Chabrol - a term that roughly means to empty one's wineglass into the dregs of a soup bowl in order to draw out the meal - something Frenchmen would do to sneak in a few more glasses of wine during dinner and not anger their wives!  But whatever you do, don't skip dessert. Watching the sabayon being gently poured on top of the warm apple tart is what dreams are made of.  Perhaps it's the ingenuity of a restaurant that claims no need for a fully equipped kitchen, or the appeal of a space that can only fit about 19 diners indoors (the restaurant has about 20 outdoor tables during the summer months), or the handsome sommelier with his rolled up sleeves and tattooed arms oozing that irresistible Frenchman charm....but Chabrol, you had me at \"Bonjour\"."}
{"text":"Packed little spot in a small laneway off of Yorkville. You have to sit at the bar to truly experience the magic of this tiny gem of a restaurant. Chef is working in the smallest space I have ever seen overlapping with the rest of the team and the bar tender is doing a thousand things at once all the while attending to the needs of everyone at the bar counter. Seamless service from all and food to match!"}
{"text":"A wonderful 4.5 star experience ... service is very good and elevated this from a 4 to a 4.5  Chabrol is a small dining gem in Toronto.  It's menu, like its space, is small but extremely well thought out & curated and very well executed. Service here has the perfect balance of being friendly and refined.    Chabrol is not an easy reservation to get ... it is popular but also there's only 5 tables of 2 and a few seats at the bar.  It is a tiny spot in Yorkville where you'll be amazed at the chef's \"kitchen\".  It is the size of a closet and yet some of the most wonderful big flavours come from it.   We arrived and walked through their patio courtyard area which houses some 4 person tables.  It had been raining hard that day and though it was covered, watch for the little puddles!  We were warmly greeted by what seemed to be the sous chef who is outside the restaurant in a temporary bar area.  Quickly we were shown to our seat and possibly the most cheerful wait staff attended to our table. I can understand previous comments about how it is possibly too intimate.  You are within inches of your neighbouring table and your table is very small.  It can barely hold two dinner plates, a side dish, and an entree plate.  Much negotiating with the dinner ware was needed.  We decided to split all the items to enjoy the various flavours and in some ways, I shouldn't have!  I really did want to keep the Ttoro to myself!  We did order the Ttoro (Basque seafood stew), Braised Lamb, Escarole Gratin, and finished with wonderful Apple tarte.  Ttoro - This Basque stew was quite amazing on flavour.  It is a stew based on fish, tomato, shellfish, and normally a paprika of some sort.  Perhaps my mind was slipping but I thought I heard the staff describe saffron being added and no mention of paprika.  The fish and shellfish is added last minute to poach just before serving.  The broth is delicious... they give you in house made crust bread (pain de campagne?) to scoop every last drip of the wonderful soup and trust me, you'd want to lick the plate.  It is a vibrant bold spiced flavour.  It wasnt overwhelming on the shellfish but I was surprised how the white fish, mussel, and shrimp took little of the broth flavour.  I wouldn't call them tasteless but they just didnt any noted flavour.  The mussels were quite small... about a half the size of the ones we had at Kiin.  The shrimp was a touch bordering towards rubbery.  The fish was a touch too dry/firm instead of moist and delicate.  The broth is a 5+/5 but the seafood was ok.  So overall 4/5  Braised Lamb - Another solid dish ... the lamb didn't need any knife to cut through it.  It was incredibly tender.  An interesting thing about the lamb, it wasn't remotely gamey or had the typical strong 'lamb' flavour.  It was well complimented by the fennel and asparagus.  The fennel had that licorice note but instead of making everything taste like black licorice ... it added a nice earthy herbal note.  The overall flavour was muted and comforting... this is a dish I would welcome on a cold day.  Well done but comparing to the Ttoro, it just haven't the same 'wow' flavour profile. 4/5  Escarole gratin - This eclipsed the braised lamb completely when they were served together.  Thinly sliced celeriac is treated like a potato and layered with escarole, savoury, cheese, and bread crumbs to top.  This was soo good.  Crunchy flavourful breadcrumbs covered the creamy cheese and tender pieces of celeriac to create a better and more flavourful version of potato dauphinoise.  It is quite a generous plating of this side dish.  5/5  Apple Tarte - It is rare for me to say the must order dish is dessert but in this case, this apple tarte deserves that recognition.  Buttery flakey pastry that puffs around a tower of thinly slice and tender apples  then enveloped and drowned in an amazing sabayon that is perfectly sweet and notes of cider popping out.  This is one of the better desserts I've had all year and I've possibly had too much.  You can see the chef use a double bain marie and put some serious work in whipping the yolks, cider, and sugar to get that incredible creamy texture that can easily fool you to thinking its cream.  5/5  Overall, this is a wonderful fine dining experience with the service possibly overshadowing some of the food. It's not often you find a good balance between refined & thoughtful service and kicking out the pretentious attitude of some finer dining places.  The Apple Tarte is truly amazing though!"}
{"text":"There are raccoons all over the place at this restaurant. The raccoons come out at night. About 15 raccoons on the building to the right of this restaurant are walking all over the roof. And while I was eating one jumped down and almost bit me. This is disgusting. The place should be shut down."}
{"text":"I think this place is a bit over rated. Giving 3 due to high expectations. We ordered foie gras, cured trout, Troto, lamb, and apple tarte as recommended by the staff. Everything was good, but not as great as the food critics said. Definitely no wow. The chairs are UNCOMFORTABLE. It was hard and squeezing my butt. Table is too small. Decor is plain. Service was nice. Overall, not a place I would specifically visit."}
