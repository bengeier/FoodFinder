{"text":"We decided to go try out Marben for summerlicious as they had the John's Burger on the menu. Summerlicious lunch was $23 which included an appetizer, main, and dessert. Overall, 3/5 as I had expected the burger patty to be more juicy. I would come back again and specifically ask for medium rare next time.  AMBIENCE [5/5] Great design and trendy. Marben has an outdoor patio as well as a indoor sitting area with nice couches and chairs. There was nice lounge music playing and at the right volume.   SERVICE [5/5] No complaints here. Our waiter was very attentive and answered all the questions and concerns we had. We mentioned that the burger patty was more on the medium well than medium rare side and he relayed that message right away to the chefs.  FOOD [3/5]  Chilled Cucumber & Snap Pea Soup - Appetizer I usually do not order cold soup but on this particular bright sunny day I decided to give it a try. I must say this soup was delicious! Take a spoonful of the soup with the mint, pickled red onion, ginger, and cream and the soup comes alive.  John's Burger - Main I was so excited to try this burger out as my chef from culinary school said this was the best burger in town. Well, let's just say that was not the case and I was disappointed half way through eating it. The waiter told us it was made medium rare but we felt that the burger patty was medium well on this day. I was looking forward to a medium rare patty with some pink to the meat and some juice to trickle down my fingers but these elements were not there. Other than this, the burger itself was one of the better ones in Toronto. The choice of the bun used was perfect as it was soft and fluffy. There was branston pickle inside the burger and it was just the right amount to give it a unique taste. Fries came with the burger and it was alright.  Strawberry Gazpacho - Dessert Didn't like this dessert but this could be a personal thing. I never had gazpacho before so I didn't know what to expect. Personally, I thought it was too sweet. Also, there were chilled fruits sprinkled in the centre of the gazpacho which were too frozen making it difficult to chew on."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  tapas is my favourite style of eating - so much more interactive and fun. the atmosphere is live, the food is amazing, and plus great service. i also love that you can sit at the place facing the kitchen!  forget the exact name but their burger was AMAZING. and same with their beet salad. try everything as long as you're into it.  was there for dinner but will be back for brunch/lunch next time.  only bummer for me was their bathroom lights =( i know that may be the style they're going for but i don't like it when its dark in there. spooky."}
{"text":"After hearing how great Marben was post-reno, I was very excited to check it out. The meal started off great: We had the patatas bravas and goat cheese with beet salad to start. Both dishes were phenomenal. The patatas was simple, original and full of flavour, a definite score. The salad was totally divine, and so beautiful too. From there however the meal went downhill: I had the fish tagine for a main, and while the quinoa side was delicious with a wonderful texture and unique flavour, the fish was bland and seemed overcooked. Furthermore, most tagines I've ordered in the past were served in an actual tagine, while this one was simply served on a plate, and in a very small portion. For dessert, I had the milk and cookies, a definite disappointment: the cookies were flavourless and tasted like they came from a mix (seriously!!!) and the fudge was forgettable. Most disappointing: according to the menu, this dish comes with petit fours, however, there were no petit fours included. When we mentioned to the wait staff, we were told the dish was no longer served that way. We were not comped for our dessert, but were given a few bites of chocolate truffle to appease us. The truffle was mediocre and didn't go with the dish at all. All in all, a disappointing end to a meal that started oh-so-well!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try their burger, as I'm a huge burger fan, almost any restaurant or pub/bar that has a burger on their menu, I know what I'll be getting.  After reading Toronto Life list of Toronto's top 25 burgers, this was one on my list that I hadn't eaten..until May 3rd. My birthday of all days, and what better way to celebrate than having a delicious burger.  Went with a couple of friends this past Friday, while it was already decided I was getting the \"John Burger\", we also got the charcuterie board, that various meats and sauces, which was fantastic. Great sharing platter amongst friends  Now on to the main course, the reason why I wanted to go to here, the \"John burger\".  The burger had a tale of two halves, my burger was cut in half for better presentation.  The first half, I thought was a bit drier than I was expecting, and bit salty, and I was starting to think there is no way this burger is as good as it's hyped up to be.   Took a few more bites of that half, and wasn't overly impressed.   However 2nd half, seemed like it was more tastier, and less salty, I have no idea why or what, but didn't care, left a much better lasting impression.  I ate the 2nd half in like 2 bites I think, which leads to my biggest gripe, wish the burger was bigger.  It also came with with fries which was crispy, and some sort of mayo mixture which was quite tasty, and a spicy coleslaw.   Thankfully my other friend could see the hunger in my eyes, and offered to give me her other  half of \"John burger\" saying she was full, which I doubt, but I wasn't about to argue,  I happily took it, and devoured it in a second.  The place is very nice, after their recent renovation loved the rustic-yet modern decor,.  The wait staff was super friendly, and attentive to our needs. The food came out in a timely manner.   Overall fan of the burger, but its not in my top 5 burgers in Toronto.  Happy Eating Ya'll!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch!  But even better on a Friday/Saturday night before/after the club scene.  Tucked away on Wellington in an area I'd never think to venture off for a walk through.  But I did and the food was upscale without the upscale prices.  Portions are decent and in the summer the outdoor patio provides a nice atmosphere under a star-lit sky for a glass of wine and some hor d'ouevres with a date!  Service is great, menu is unique, chef is superb!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Marben recently for dinner to celebrate her birthday. Neither of us had visited it previously, so we weren't sure what to expect.   Marben is located on Wellington St. in a commercial-industrial part of town, and we initially had a hard time believing we were in the right place until we found it. Apparently it is quite the bustling place during the week, but we arrived for dinner on a Sunday around 5:30pm, and were probably the first two customers in the restaurant. This was actually really nice, as we felt like we had the place to ourselves for a romantic meal.  The ambience at Marben is really unique and cozy. We were seated by our server at a booth near the front of the restaurant, across from the bar.   For our appetizers, we decided to split an order of the house baked breads ($5) and the cheese board ($16). The house baked breads were served with beet hummus and pistachio dukkah, both of which were delicious. The bread was fresh-out-of-the-oven warm and gooey. As for the cheese plate, if you enjoy gourmet cheeses (and who doesn't?), then you'll want to try this. An assortment of three cheeses were served on a board that included candied walnuts, toast, and orange marmalade. We devoured it.  One of the good things about visiting Marben on a Sunday, besides the quiet ambience, is that they offer a discounted wine list. We ordered a bottle of their Riesling for $30 (regular price: $50). Normally I avoid Rieslings, as they are typically too sweet for my tastes, but this one paired very well with our main course dishes.  For our main course, I opted to go with the Moroccan Fish Tagine ($24), which was served with a side of spiced quinoa in a tomato sauce with apricots, cilantro, and almonds. The spiciness of the sauce was just the right amount - and gave the dish a nice extra 'kick'. The fish was flaky and tender.   My girlfriend, seafood lover that she is, ordered the Scallop and Crab Agnolotti ($25), served with mussels in a saffron broth. Everything on the plate was amazing. Seafood lovers would definitely enjoy this dish.  We ended the meal with a manchego custard and cheesecake, both of which were incredibly rich and mouth-wateringly tasty. Our server added a candle on top of the custard, as we mentioned that it was my girlfriend's birthday, which was a very sweet touch.  Throughout the meal, our server was very friendly and helpful at explaining each of the dishes we ordered. She was a bit too eager to sell us more wine, mentioning that we should buy another bottle a few times, but we didn't mind.  Overall, we were very pleased with our meal. If you're looking for a romantic restaurant with delicious food and excellent service, look no further than Marben."}
{"text":"Marben's brunch was fantastic. I went with my girlfriend one dreary Saturday morning and had my spirits lifted immediately when they brought a platter of freshly baked bread with strawberry-rhubarb jam. It was unexpectedly sublime and paired well with their coffee.   My girlfriend ordered the bread pudding french toast (but skipped the accompanying meat). it was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious (a little too rich for my tastes in the morning but perfect for the person with a sweet tooth). I had the eggs benedict and asked them for a side of hashbrowns instead of the salad it normally comes with. The potatoes were fantastic- crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside, and coated with a wonderful spice rub.   The eggs benedict was one of the best I've had in the city. The egg itself was poached to perfection (firm with a runny yolk) and the hollendaise sauce was light and regretless. And while the pemeal bacon and quality white cheddar slice are what normally caps off a fine ol' benny, it was the english muffin that really stood out for me. Seriously. It was so good I asked them where they get them from. Turns out they make them *in house*.   Slam. Dunk."}
{"text":"Let me start it by saying I debated writing this review, but at the end of the day food poisoning is food poisoning and since I rely heavily on yelp I thought I should be accurate.  I organized a corporate event at Marben for about 10 guests, we were all foodies and very much looking forward to it, heard amazing things about their steak and burger. Asking the waiter for suggestions between those two, I ended up with the burger that typically comes under cooked (medium rare for me). The quest to uncover the best burger in the city continuous.   While the service and the experience at the time were great, the food poisoning overnight was terrible. I am really sad to say I likely not be going back."}
{"text":"John's Burger at Marben is a contender for the best burger in Toronto. A patty of beef and braised short ribs packs an incredible amount of flavor. Complement this flavor with aged cheddar a nice bakery bun and a unique topping of Branston pickle. The ingredients are simple, but the complexity and layers of flavor they put in each bite makes Marben a favorite in my book. Combine John's Burger with some great fries, fantastic outdoor seating, and a premium drink list and one could spend quite a bit of time at Marben."}
{"text":"Ordered the burger as I had heard much about it. To me, a burger is big, and flame grilled. This was more like a small, rounded meatloaf on a bun. For a meatloaf it wasn't bad, but don't come here expecting a traditional BBQ burger by any means. It's an upscale place for the sophisticated diner."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out Marben and Bevette for a long time but never seem to get down to Wellington.  I finally went today and I really liked it.  The place looks great.  I love the roof and the careful mish mash of art.  We sat at the back and we had a view of the kitchen which was cool.  At one point they brought out huge pieces of frozen beef - I think they literally had a whole cow right on the counter.  It was kind of weird to see that but whatever...  For the food, they brought out some hearty bread with a nice oil and chili sauce.  For the meal, I had the plat du jour which consisted of pureed carrots, broccoli and I think turnups and the chicken (you order a side and protein separately).  The veggies were really good.    The service was great - very friendly!  Didn't get a chance to go to Bavette, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Marben. I went on a Tuesday evening with a friend. Very nice decor, a lot of light wood, antiqued decorations mixed in with some modern flair. I had the John's burger, which was very tasty and my friend got the mushroom risotto which was also very good."}
{"text":"Marben is painfully mediocre.  First, the attempted Queen West vibe doesn't quite work in this King West setting: the industrial aesthetic and tattooed waitstaff end up serving a moneyed and far less interesting clientèle. Marben: you're trying too hard!  Second, the food is only OK. Our appetizer--pulled pork croquettes--tasted more like pork-based chicken nuggets with none of the savoury, sweat deliciousness of pulled  pork. My venison entrée was respectably good, though my girlfriend's duck was almost uneatable and overcooked. When she informed the waitress as to why she was finished but her plate was still largely full, she received a polite \"sorry\" and nothing more. I'm \"sorry,\" but that's not an acceptable response. Our creme brulee dessert was respectable, but that's about it.  Thirdly, the service was polite, but the servers were slightly overwhelmed and their outward friendliness seemed contrived...a bit too nice.  Lastly, the warm and dark room seems like it ought to be perfect for great conversation, but we spent the whole night yelling across the table and asking one another to repeat ourselves.  Marben: try again!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and had pleasant experience.  We ordered the cheese board to share and I had the \"Mexican Hangover\" which were both very good.   It is  pricier than other brunch places but that was expected.  I dont give it 5 stars because it was quite hot in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant during Winterlicious having heard good things about it and my expectations were definitely met. The atmosphere was pretty laid back, the decor looked great and staff were friendly and welcoming. Being a Winterlicious menu, sometimes you'll find out that the food quality is compromised. This was not the case here. I really enjoyed everything served and now I can't wait to come back to try out their brunch menu,"}
{"text":"Only been once but from that one experience, I am completely willing to go back again.  Had their braised shortrib burger and it is just fantastic. Want to know something neat?  Their new exec chef after the reno, Carl Heinreich, used to work as a sous at DB Bistro Moderne, which supposedly has a damnedly good shortrib burger made with sirloin and truffles. While this burger isn't quite as fancy, you'd think you can trust a man like that to know how to make a burger like this and you most assuredly can.  Portions are kind of small but considering the effort they go into sourcing their food and coffee (Stumptown!), you are definitely getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"Great dishes that are creative and taste amazing. Kind and food-educated staff. Chef made some adjustments for my vegetarian date. Definitely did not expect this, but was pleasantly surprised. You'll pay a decent dollar, but it's a nice place to go and enjoy a well prepared meal with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided on Marben for Sunday brunch today.  Expecting the epic Sunday lines seen at almost every other brunch spot in the city, we went for noon and were pleasantly surprised to be seated within minutes.  The place was busy, but not overflowing and we weren't rushed.    The service was phenomenal.  The staff was welcoming, friendly and attentive.  The decor was amazing - my friends are designers and we spent a decent portion of the brunch marveling over the design.  My only critique was the darkness of the bathroom.  When I went in, I turned off the light, thinking I was turning them on - that's how dark the light was.   Brunch itself was amazing.  Delicious freshly made bread with butter and homemade strawberry rhubarb jam to start - it was an amazing beginning to brunch.  I had the traditional breakfast.  The eggs were amazing, the bacon was thickly cut and suitably crisp.  The homefries were also excellent - crispy, potatoe-y and not overly salty.    For the level of service, atmosphere and quality of food, it was very reasonably priced.  I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"We went to Marben for brunch last week and it was pretty good.  Food was really good.  I had the french toast and my friend the burger.  Both were fresh and tasted great.  I have to take off one star because there wasn't much fruit available with the toast (though the bacon option does provide quite a bit).  Service was great--the waitress was constantly making sure we had bread/water while the food was being cooked.  Overall I'd say it was one of the better brunch places I've been to in Toronto.  Still, compared to some of the great brunch places I've been in NYC, the limited selection and (specifically for brunch) limited amount of fruit-friendly options keep this at 4 stars."}
{"text":"One Friday after work, my boyfriend and I were trying to figure out where to go for dinner/drinks and decided to give Marben a try. We sat on their nice patio in front of the restaurant, which most people seemed to be doing.  After ordering we were served some bread, which is house-made daily. It was delicious and was a great way to start off the evening (as was my white wine sparkler cocktail - super refreshing!).  We started off with Ryan's Charcuterie (all their menu items start with a person's name) for $30. I'm always a sucker for house-made cured meats. The charcuterie consisted of venison and heart pepperoni, a pork terrine, Moscow sausage, capicolla and bresaola. It was served with mustard, crostini, pickled vegetables and a delicious caramelized onion chutney. All the meats were fantastic! My favourite of all the items was probably the pork terrine and the venison/heart pepperoni. The two of us were getting pretty full after this... it was a lot of meat!  Next came Alex's Pork Rib Fritters ($14). There were five bite-sized fritters which was served with a chipotle aioli and topped with cilantro and arugula. When I first stuck my fork into one of the fritters I was surprised by how soft they were. Turns out they were mostly potato filled with bits of pork. Nevertheless, they were pretty darn tasty. Similar to the charcuterie, this makes for a great sharing dish.  Lastly, we shared John's Burger - braised ribs, aged cheddar, coleslaw and fries ($17). The server came by and told us that they take their braised ribs, ground them up and build a burger around it. The burger also had the tasty caramelized onion chutney on it.. and oh my god, what an AMAZING burger. Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was so juicy and flavourful... my goodness! Looking around at the other tables, almost everyone else had ordered this burger. Definitely says something if you ask me.  Overall, Marben far exceeded my expectations! For some reason I always thought it was a lounge and the food was second fiddle. Boy was I wrong. Not only was the food delicious, but the service and atmosphere were excellent. Highly recommended! Just remember... the burger is a must-order!  Next time I'll be back for the pig roast - held the last Sunday of each month!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend Marben for a group over 8. They don't do split bills, and servers even rejected our request to move from patio to indoor restaurant to continue on the evening with desserts as it was too cold to sit outside at 10pm. Their reason was due to short staffing. How many servers take to serve desserts? Unbelievably rude! Very disppoiting!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Love the \"dishes to share\" concept. The staff is really great, whether evening or brunch. Love sitting at the bar. Crowd is very down to earth, blending in well with the \"decor\". DJ ramps up the music around 11ish.   I recommend starting with some oysters. They also have amazing cod cakes as well for a starter.  Main meal: I recommend the duck and/or the trout."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a nice weekend brunch here. The food is prepared with care, and their home fries are so good! Very crispy on the outside. Everything tasted very fresh.  Their decor and layout is quite interesting. For the quality and amount of food you get, and the atmosphere and its downtown location (although it is a bit out of the way), I'd say it's not overpriced."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner at Marben on the weekend! It was so wonderful. We started with the bread board with beet hummus and smoked butter. Then I had the potato ricotta gnocchi. Both were divine and our server was sweet and attentive and funny! They have ginger beer on tap so I had a dark and stormy which was to die for! Love Marben and the staff, thanks for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 girlfriends from work based on a recommendation. The menu is small but I typically believe the few dishes are done very well , and that was the case with Marben. We ordered the  Tequila Ceviche Cones and the Potatas Bravas which were both good but the Potatas Bravas were a little dry and not my favorite in the city. As a main I ordered the Smoked Risotto with Seared Scallops. This was the first time I had a Risotto and this restaurant has made it one of my favorite dishes now. It was very rich and creamy which was a nice compliment to the scallops and the chorizo added a nice spicy contrast. My mouth waters every time I think of this dish! I was happy with my main so I would definitely go back to try more."}
{"text":"OVER PRICED and UNDER SERVICE and HUGE MISTAKE  Having reviewed Marben's menu online, our visit for brunch was highly anticipated...and our novice move of not reading reviews in advance of going to a new restaurant will never happen again.  The food described on menu did not match what was actually served.  We ordered, however what was served (the duck hash and the highly acclaimed burger) was beyond disappointing in presentation and taste: Both meals were completely inedible.   The duck \"hash\" was a bowl of overcooked and dry duck meat on a bed of overcooked limp spinach swimming in a pool of undetermined liquid; the two poached eggs on top looked like two prairie oysters - their pink hue attributed to 'wine poaching'.  Upon cutting into the egg, we expected a beautiful yolk to salvage the aesthetic of the meal, however to our great surprise only the congealed whites of the eggs were runny and the yolks were hard as rock.  The burger can only be described as a greasy, salty mess of raw meat.  The coleslaw, also a curious and unnatural purple hue, was completely tasteless and devoid of any flavour whatsoever.   Yes, the food was inedible, however the calibre of the food was eclipsed by the incredibly inadequate service.  To be fair, there were two servers attending our table. One was clearly run off his feet, looking after the entire restaurant while his spiffy colleague waxed poetic with various members of the kitchen staff and select customers.  Clearly, Marben's staffing model does not endorse a teamwork approach, but rather, lets one person look after the entire restaurant while the other server looks entirely after himself.   There are so many great brunch options in Toronto, do yourself a favour:  When you get to the front door of Marben, walk away immediately."}
{"text":"Very meaty place but I really enjoyed Marben. The serving staff was stellar, as was their burger. Their fries are also awesome. I would just ask the server what to order...they were bang on and I had a great meal."}
{"text":"Marben is my new favourite restaurant in Toronto!!! I took my husband to Marben for his birthday and both of us were thrilled with the atmosphere, service and especially the food!  Walking in I was really impressed with all the natural wood, interesting art, the soft lighting...We sat at the chef's table and it was awesome to both talk to the chefs and see them work their magic.  They told us a lot about the food and made some excellent recommendations.  Our server was also very attentive and even went out of his way to make me different mocktails that I just loved.  Every single item we ordered was amazing.  The oysters with the cucumber mignonette were my favourite app.  The chacuterie, the gnocchi, ceviche and yam chips were also just so good and fresh.  We also ordered the burger and it was truly the BEST burger either of us had ever had.  for dessert I suggest the apple bread pudding.  My mouth is already watering at the thought of going back.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I went to Marben for dinner the other night and it was really great. We had the charcuterie which seemed sort of expensive ($30) but it came with five different meats that were well portioned and really delicious, especially the duck terrine and the corned beef.  We had the roast beef for our mains and that was also really delicious, the gravy was really dark and rich and the meat was all medium-rare.  My only complaint was that their wine list is a little small and so I hard a hard time choosing, but the server was really helpful and I was happy with what we ended up with.   Oh and the dessert was amazing, I was totally stuffed but had it anyway. It was this chocolate concoction that was sort of a brownie-pudding-fudge hybrid served with a cookie and cream."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and generally a good time.  Can be loud but that doesn't bother me.  Johns burger is the best but so many great items!"}
{"text":"Good bye, Marben.   We arrived at 6 pm, and we could talk. As the room filled up the management raised the volume of the music, to the point that only people next to each other could talk. I saw several tables with people just leaning back, unable to hear what their friends talked about.  A total waste of time and money.  It gets worse. This is the law:  \"Ontario is banning employers from taking a cut of tips that are meant for servers and other hospitality staff.\"  Our waiter told us that the management STILL takes over 30 % of his tip for themselves, in spite of what the law says.   I will not support a restaurant that steals from its employees, and neither should you.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/employers-to-be-banned-from-taking-employees-tips-in-ontario/article27631694/"}
{"text":"I've got a major problem.  I've been to Marben way too many times and become a \"regular\" which I think disqualifies me from writing an objective review. If I gush, well maybe that's because I imagine that me and Carl are pals and I don't want to disappoint him. If I condemn, won't I be afraid that Carl will read this and send his Russian sous-chef to murder me in my sleep?   The truth is that Marben is just this kind of place-- not so stuck-up that they won't remember your name unless you buy the 05 Domaine Romanee Conti each time, and also awesome enough to make it your secret little hangout that you bring all your out-of-town friends to.  Too many crazy awesome things about it to really do it justice-- but here are a few:  - Beet salad -- just buy it. Every single time. - SAUSAGE LEAGUE! - Pulled pork croquettes -- crazy good. A crispy exterior that falls apart when you bite into it then melts in your mouth. - Chef's table (dang, gave away my secret!)  The only complaint I have is the dessert selection. I am getting pretty sick of the ice cream sandwich and the bread pudding. I might have to buy them a gelato maker or something eventually.  Well, I honestly think that Marben deserves a five-star rating, so I'm giving it to them. And hopefully saying that means that I don't wake up in the middle of the night to a bald Russian wielding a Santoku."}
{"text":"We came for a late-night dinner because we heard the restaurant turns into a pretty good bar after 11 p.m. Overall, I think Marben is a lovely spot for dinner, but I wouldn't recommend the bar scene.   The ambience is quite nice. It's very bright and has a few industrial-looking light fixtures hanging across the back wall, an enchanted forest theme in the (gender-neutral) bathrooms with large cauldron sinks and fake trees on the walls, and lots of wood.  The menu changes daily based on what they have fresh. Everything is locally grown and the meat dishes are selected based on what cut of meat is left (they apparently use the whole animal - \"tip to tail\" - I'm a vegetarian so I zoned out during most of this explanation).  Meat does seem to be their specialty, but I was happy to see they have a few vegetarian options - a squash soup, a spinach/goat cheese salad and a squash gnocchi.   I had the gnocchi, which were very soft and delicious. They came served with a sauce made of squash (maybe the squash soup?), brussel sprouts and crispy shallots. It was a good size of gnocchi as it is very filling. My friends had the hamburger and the roasted chicken. My friend loved the burger (it was also recommended by the waiter), and two of my friends who had the chicken said it was very tender and fell apart as soon as soon as they touched it with their forks. The chicken is served with potatoes and arugula, and the burger had french fries and a coleslaw.   While the food quality was excellent and everyone really enjoyed their meals, I agree with some of the other reviewers her who say they need to either increase the portion size or design plates that are more condusive to sharing. While our waiter said he recommended we all share, we all wanted different things, and items like a hamburger or a piece of slow-cooked chicken isn't that easy to split up.   They had a couple of dessert options - a flourless chocolate cake, a cheese plate and an apple tart. We really wanted to try their ice cream sandwiches, but apparently their ice cream machine was broken, so we passed on dessert! (Don't worry, they ordered a new one from Italy)!   After about 11 p.m., the restaurant became very busy with the nightlife crowd. It became very difficult to sit and chat once this happened because they play the music incredibly loud. It's also very difficult to get a drink because there is only one bar upstairs and people crowd the front lobby. If you have a table, I recommend staying there because it's much easier to get served by the waitress (although you will have to scream to talk to each other)."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch. The experience left something to be desired. I ordered the eggs benedict and the poached eggs weren't runny at all. The yolks were cooked solid. I thought that my dish might have been a one-off but two other people at my table ordered the same thing and their eggs were equally overcooked. Hey, at least they're consistent! The accompanying salad was lackluster. It was pretty much just naked greens. I consider myself to be a foodie generally but a brunch aficionado in particular. This place just can't compete with all the other awesome brunch spots in the city. Marben does have a great patio. I'll give them that. If you're looking to just hang out in the sun and not eat anything, Marben is for you."}
{"text":"Really just ok. Very nice inside. Inattentive service and seemed understaffed. The food was salted pretty heavily. Takes reservations and has a cool atmosphere. Likely wouldn't return amidst so many great brunch spots in T."}
{"text":"Loving brunch at Marben too!  It's surprisingly quiet on Saturday mornings.  This baffles me because people line out the doors for Cora's.  It's a different feel in the restaurant, in the morning with the sunlight streaming in.    The English Breakfast is quite large and reasonable to share between 2 people. 3 eggs, a large selection of different breakfast meats.  The bacon was sucking pork - so major win for me!  I think they change up the meats in terms of flavours.  Fries Kennedy are fries that are pressed and fried in a cube stack.  It's reasonably priced for so much food - $15!  Michele's Eggs Benedict was delicious.  The hollandaise sauce had flavour and wasn't too heavy or oily.    Bread pudding french toast - very good.  It's thick, dense and sweet.  Comes with 3 slices.  I only had 1 slice and I was stuffed (of course, I was already full from the full English Breakfast).  Great prices for some quality brunch!"}
{"text":"Restaurant and atmosphere was very nice. Wasn't very happy with the food service. Went as a group of 8 and left it up to the waiter to order for us as to do a sharing menu with 4-5 services. Apparently this is this is what they do best...The dishes were very small and not distributed across the table. Some never got a chance to try all the dishes or ar least get a good taste of them. Basicly $80 per person and I left still very hungry! Dissapointed with the food service. Had much better sharing menus elsewhere. Would not recommend for this. But the restaurant was very nice and what I did have a chance to taste was good."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Toronto restaurant scene. Everything worked; the service was friendly, great ambiance, food, and price. Even if you don't sit by the open kitchen ~ charcutterie, swing by for a look. It's the real deal, and you enjoy your lunch knowing it couldn't possibly be fresher.  I'd describe the ambiance as loft meets pub but with an edge. Exposed brick, creative lighting, and whimsical art. It's all really well done without going over the top. A wonderful neighborhood style restaurant that you can visit often. The emphasis is on local. There is even a map that highlights the origin of various ingredients, farmers, and suppliers. Fresh! The soybean oil with balsamic vinegar and fresh house made bread rocks to start. We had two burgers and one special of the day, a ham sandwich on crunchy house made brioche style role. Three thumbs up! Starters included oysters (fresh, can't imagine a better experience) and salad that featured grains and fresh lettuce.It could have been a meal in itself. Fries and onion rings are worth saving room for.  Couldn't do dessert, but make sure to try a coffee. Big flavor, whether coffee, latte, or cappuccino.  Graham greeted us at the door and was our server. Nice job.  We'll be back often."}
{"text":"An enjoyable NYE spent at Marben. They had a simple price-fix menu with great choices. The canapés were served first, including a yummy quail egg on sprouts with the perfect amount of salt; a crepe with mozzarella and a bite of beet salad with a mustard flavor. We did have to ask the server to explain what each was...which you would think they would do.  The first course was a choice of a duck consommé or something else...we both had thud I, which was nicely finished with thin slices of chestnuts. Second course was the lobster salad...with a cauliflower purée. The server did not take the time to figure out which one of us had an allergy so he put the wrong plate in front of me. Careless, but we figured it out. The food was good, so I am not going to be angry.  Third course, I had the cod. The plate was super hot, the food was the correct temperature. The cod was cooked perfectly, topped with a salsa verde, over a variety of mushrooms with something sweet on the finish. My partner in crime had the venison...it was gone before I looked up.  Dessert was a raspberry jelly or a very deep chocolate with other chocolate. The server again failed to explain even though we asked.  Our waiter made it by once or twice, but with a few large parties, the maitre d and others paid more attention to us.  Since we are just visitors to Toronto, not sure I would go back, but I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 and the server handled us all well, and even talked through the gluten free options for one of us who has such issues. Thank you!  There was an oyster special last night, get a dozen for only $20. They were fantastic, fresh and perfect. But I can't attribute this praise to Marben as they were from Rodney's.   Then the heirloom carrot salad came. Literally a bowl of full sized carrots smeared in sesame seeds. Not what I expected but I try to be open to new food experiences. This was blah and uninspired.  For my main I ordered the market special Bouillabaisse. It was a bowl of seafood, no soup. They attempted to ceremoniously pour the soup over the seafood from a jug. I'd generously say I got three ounces of liquid. Only what little soup there was, was stone cold. I didn't order vichyssoise!  When I asked about it, they asked if I wanted my dish replaced, and I said no I would simply like more broth that is hot. They complied within a couple of minutes, but it was only warm at best. I couldn't be bothered to complain more. The seafood morsels themselves were tasty, but obviously not infused with the broth flavour. Perhaps I'm thankful for that as the soup broth was more like a strange gravy. As I looked around, only one person at the table seems to be eating with gusto, and that was the one who ordered the burger. I tasted my boyfriend's rabbit ravioli and was underwhelmed by the same gravy flavour as my Bouillabaisse. Weird.  I'll end on a high note here because my meal did too:  The dulce de leche panacotta was perfectly delightful!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Marben is a must visit for anyone in Toronto. The food was fantastic, original, local and fresh. Sarah (GM) and the staff were incredibly friendly, entertaining and the service was bang on. Great decor.... great crowd. We'll return next time for the Saturday night after dinner party. Thanks Sarah!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!  Between the delicious food, creative cocktails and boutique style ambiance I was thrilled by my first experience at this restaurant.  I will definitely be returning!! :)"}
{"text":"The johns burger was amazing, ordered peach salad, peaches werent in season so they were substituted with pears, still wasnt so great. The small menu is charming, but a bit more selection would be nice. Had a really nice Zinfandel suggestion with our food. The place has a great atmosphere. The server was a bit rude and unhelpful at first, but she warmed up later on. Would come here again mainly for its proximity to home and the burger."}
{"text":"BEWARE the hamburger is served almost raw and they don't warn you. I got incredibly sick (food poisoning) and when, after recovering, I went to the restaurant to tell them, they were arrogant and said \"that's how we serve it\". I think they owe it to their customers to at least warn them that is how it's done.   Avoid this overpriced faux hipster restaurant, the food isn't that great anyway."}
{"text":"Marben is one of the best trendy restaurants around the  neighborhood. The environment is amazing ..mostly yonge professionals. Best place to go on a date. Very cozy patio. The food is amazing too. If you are a beef person definatly get the \"braised beef\" or if you prefer fish go with the \"Moroccan salmon\". The service is friendly and great."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusted and disappointed with a recent experience at Marben.  I called for a reservation 2-3 weeks in advance for myself and 8 business colleagues from out of town.  The reservation was booked and I was assured a great spot in their \"hot box\" (apparently this is something special).  When I called the morning of our reservation to confirm, the guy tells me they are closed for renovations!  I then frantically tell him about my reservation.  He puts me on hold and never returns.  I call back and of course he avoids my call and it goes into their message service.  Here's the thing, the outgoing message stated nothing about renovations occurring.  WTF?!  Who does this? If it wasn't for me calling the day of the reservation to confirm, it would have been disastrous for me, (i.e. me and 8 fellow senior execs from out of town showing up to a restaurant that's closed). How embarrassing!  Thank God for le Select Bistro. We booked there instead and had a wonderful experience.  Marben: Ya blew it with a passionate Toronto foodie.  Not only will I never visit, but will tell my network to avoid a restaurant with atrocious, uncaring customer service!"}
{"text":"We were staying down the street at the Thompson Hotel, and this restaurant was recommended as a good restaurant to walk to from the hotel.  The decor was funky and fun, but the service was lacking, and one of the waitresses was flat out rude. We went for dinner and sat outside (while it was still light), but as it got dark, the lighting got very shadowy and dark and it seemed that they were relying on a nearby streetlamp for their outdoor lighting. Also fyi, there are lots of mosquitoes in Toronto this time of year! I didn't get the memo on that, and got eaten alive while sitting outside at Marben.  Now on to the food, I ordered the burger, my husband ordered the gnocchi. The burger was definitely tasty and had a very delicious flavor to it. The gnocchi on the other hand was bland, mushy, and didn't live up to it's decadent description in the menu.  Since the service was subpar, it was hard to track a waiter down in a timely fashion to share our disappointment in the dish.  So although the burger was good, we most likely won't be going back to Marben. There are so many other delicious and interesting places in all of Toronto, that this just didn't stand out above the rest."}
{"text":"I've been to Marben twice now. Both were very different experiences, but both were memorable.  First Dinner: My fiancee and I went with another couple for a few share plates before heading out for drinks afterwards. It was suggested by our friends so when we arrived we were a little surprised at the prices and ended up not ordering enough. To be fair, the prices aren't really that high, I'd say \"upper-middle\" but the quality of the food is top tier.  We all shared the burger, a vegetarian ravioli, a charcuterie, and I can't remember the fourth dish. All were excellent, but the burger was out of this world. Definitely the best burger I've ever had in Toronto. The service was solid, the decor is very rustic and relaxed, and the experience was overall positive.  Second Dinner: Vivek's birthday! You've probably already read his review because it's surely at the top, but I'll give my take as well. The waitress offered to bring us a series of platters recommended by the chef. They started early and often and didn't stop. I can't even remember everything I tried, but here's a list of the most memorable: - the burger (the best, I say, the best!) - oysters (standard, nothing special) - roasted sunchokes (the root of a sunflower....yes, we had to ask the wait staff) - gnocchi with brussel sprouts (delish...mom would be proud) - beet & endive salad - crusted bass (amazing!) - fries with truffle aioli (the fries were nothing spectacular, but the aoili left me weak in the knees)  The wait staff (all except one) could give a full, non-stuffy description of each dish and actively encouraged discussion.  Speaking of the wait staff, one waitress, in particular, was fantastic. I ordered a bottle of wine with 3 other dinner companions at one end of the table. As it turned out I ended up completely at the other end. The waitress found me and poured my glass of wine without missing a beat. Later, she made sure to include me in the second pour as well.   If you're looking for high-end food in a relaxed environment at a fair price, head to Marben. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"five of us went to marben last friday night. one had been before, four hadn't.  service was ten on ten. attentive but not overbearing. get up for what felt like five seconds and turn around to have your napkin neatly folded.  food was excellent. music was great, crowd was cool. i recommend."}
{"text":"I booked a party of 10 recently because of the reviews and the location. First of all, the location for this restaurant is great, close enough to the downtown core yet tucked away on a side street with plenty of street parking. I was worried about the parking at first and parked a block away from the restaurant only to realize I could have parked right in front. Once arriving I was greeted by the nice hostess that took our jackets and showed us to our table. I had made a 6:30 pm reservation for 10 and informed my guests we would have to leave by 8:45 pm due to a second seating.   All my guests arrived on time, minus one strangler who showed up 1 hour late but was the 11th person in our party. Right away I noticed that we has 'prefix' menus in front of us and I called the waiter to tell him we would be doing a la carte this evening. He informed me that all parties of 10 or more had to do a prefix menu. I told him that I had spoke with the manager prior to my booking the reservation and she said that a la carte was fine. He didn't believe me but went to check anyways. Upon realizing his mistake he apologized. But it had bothered me that he didn't believe me.   He came around to take the order and uncomfortably tried to upsell us on apps. I've been a server for 4 years so I know all about upselling. But when one of the guests ordered bread his response was \"would you like to order a few of those for the whole table?\" an awkward silence happened. I didn't like my guests hassled to spend more. In the end I did order a few apps for the table and some wine.  A friend of mine ordered me a bourbon and the presentation was great, nice glass with a huge square ice cube in the center. Only problem was that after a few sips I notice there was something frozen inside it!! I looked closer and I think it was a bug! I called over the waiter and he got me another bourbon but I think he just pour the old bourbon into a new glass. He apologized and told me he'd find out what it was... I didn't really care what it was, but it was disgusting... In the end he said it was a raisin. But I think it was more likely an olive pit or a bug. If you were a restaurant owner would you admit it was a bug?? Doesn't matter either way because there shouldn't have been anything in it...  Dinner was served in a timely manner and all the food came out at the same time. Dinner portions were very small. I had selected a dish that the server recommended, a porketta. It was dry. I should have ordered the scallop risotto but the portion for that was very small, same with the burger, about 1/3 the size of the regular burger. My girlfriends dish came out cold (frozen in the center)...  After dinner I asked if another table could be set aside for our party since a few people professed interested in having drinks. They said we could just head to the bar instead. So I decided to leave. The bill was around $475 for 10 people, plus add another 15% for tax and 18% automatically added for tip!!...   In the end, I think Marben is a nice place for drinks (minus a bug or two) and the atmosphere is nice. If I lived nearby I think this would be a nice place to bring visitors. But I would not recommend this place for larger parties or people looking to get their money's worth. 33% of your bill is tax and tip alone so beware..  My rating, 2/5, come for the atmosphere but go elsewhere for good food and service..."}
{"text":"Not up to expectations...for a highly regarded restaurant with a small menu we expected nothing but the best. Amazingly the disappoint came in the shape of the supposedly ranked #2 burger in Canada, which was a massive miss.    I understand that the new Chef  doesn't want to follow Chef Carl Heinrich footsteps and I'm cool with that, but don't undersell your talents with a burger my student daughter would have turned out.  On the positive side the decor is fantastic and the service is excellent., the avocado and lobster snack was good and the duck was delicious, but it wasn't enough to entice back."}
{"text":"i LOVE me a good burger and this was THE BEST i've had in the city. The Jack's burger is to DIE for - it was simply unbelievable. We had to have seconds - i just couldnt get over it and will definitely return for more.  Its a sharing menu here and the burger comes in 4 pieces making it easy to enjoy this little piece of heaven. The burgern bun is fantastic!  the fresh bread they bring to start with soy olive oil is really great as well.  All sides are $5 each which is a great deal and the gnocchi simply melts in your mouth - divine!!   We had the fish as well which was good but not memorable. The waitress insisted we try the pommes kennedy which were glorified potato chips - nothing special.  The ice cream sandwich was good - great size but nothing special. I wish the sandwich part was softer would be easier to bite into"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of burger but I actually enjoyed the 'john's burger'. The service was friendly. I also try the lobster and that also a nice one to have. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Went here for a group event (12 people) and were good to accommodate and the space is nice, but the food wasn't up to par. Marben used to have great food, but has gone down hill. The flavours were decent but the portions were tiny. Half a burger, or 3 tiny salads split between 12 people doesn't cut it. Bad value for the price. If you're going to be stingy with the food, at least serve bread (which they don't have). I left very hungry and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Got to sit at the counter that overlooks the kitchen, which added to the experience. Getting to interact with the waiter, Head Chef, and everyone else in the kitchen made this an awesome experience.   Charcuterie was excellent, as was the Steak, and the salt-baked Bass (daily special).   Great food, great service, great experience. I live around the corner and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If I had a dollar for every time I was greeted by a server in Toronto, and told \"our plates are meant for sharing\" I'd be a rich man. And if, in turn, l  was granted a wish for each time I left a \"tapas-style\" restaurant disappointed, I'd be both rich, and happy.  My first wish, of course, would be to forever banish every cook, chef, and hipster waiter who took part in serving me food that was in fact impossible to share, meagrely portioned, and designed to fit the appetizer/entree/side framework.   But perhaps a method of cooking and serving food designed for sharing isn't quite as apparent as I imagine it to be. Perhaps I'm a fool, and in fact a single croquette, roughly the size of my pinky finger, served atop a miniscule salad of baby spinach and garnished with 3 slices of cured trout is perfect for \"sharing, tapas-style\" in some alternate universe filled with ironic sweatshirt-wearing bearded twenty somethings who think nothing of butchering entire sides of beef on the kitchen pass.  Seriously Marben, give me a break. And go away. Visit Spain, and Greece. Eat cicchetti in Venice. Learn how to count, to add, and subtract.   When you come back, if you still insist on a \"sharing\" menu that bears a closer resemblance to a typical 3 course dining experience than it does one of the world's great small plate/shared eating traditions, please design your menu thusly:  Appetizers 1. app 1 2. app 2 3. app 3  Price for 1 persons=x Price for 2 persons=x Price for 3 persons=x Price for 4 persons=x  Entrees 1. entree 1 2. entree 2 3. entree 3  Price for 1 persons=x  Etc, etc.  Get my drift Marben?   Even better still however, would be that you come back with the resolve to entirely redesign your plates so that they can in fact be shared by tables of two, six, ten, whatever. Of course this would mean that you might need to serve multiples of some things on a single plate, or that you put your knife skills to good use and divide whatever is on the plate into bite-sized portions, or even expand your cooking repertoire to include things that are already, in all of their natural glory, bite-sized.  You'll have to put an end to your self-congratulatory navel-gazing too. I kind of expect, given the price-point,  that your provisions are of quality, and that your meat comes from farms.   Do all of this and you can keep the bearded waiter and the girls in the vintage granny dresses. They at least were kind of cute."}
{"text":"My wife had her eye on Marben for the past few weeks after seeing them at a local food festival, and having old friends in town gave us the perfect excuse.  To start with, Marben is a feast for the eyes.  It is one of the most pleasing, eclectic and delightful settings I have experienced.  I was instantly comfortable, and didn't experience any of the overly-formal stiffness that some \"nicer\" places give off.  The staff was all incredibly friendly, laid back and attentive.  Our server took time to walk us through the menu, give us a little history of the place and just chat.  And the food.  Whoa baby, I'm not a foodie by any stretch, but I know good when I taste it.  And Marben is all good.  All local, the menu has changed a bit from what's on their website.  As others noted, it's mostly tapas style, so our group of 4 ordered 6 dishes, but the highlight for me was the hamburger - I can't praise this enough.  Our server said a regular comes in and orders two every Saturday, and I  can see why.  Local beef butchered on site, rolled around slow-roasted spare ribs.  Terrific.  Combine the food, atmosphere and solid drink selection (trending towards mixed drinks, beer selection was small) and you can have yourself a very memorable meal.  All told, it cost $170 with a generous tip for 4 people, 1 round of drinks included (with a pricey but worth martini in the mix)."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Toronto, I came here with a couple of friends for a farewell lunch. We came in early afternoon one Thursday and it was pretty quiet. The space is thoughtfully decorated, with a rustic, warm feel. The chicken sandwich with fries and salad was delicious, and the bread was amazing! I'd definitely come back to Marben next time I'm in Toronto. Love the crazy sinks in the bathrooms, something that has to be seen to be believed."}
{"text":"Ambiance good, food ok, too expensive for what it is. Had burger: ok... Ceasar: ok Octopus: not enough food Drinks: expensive but very good :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor.... Food not so beautiful. My $20 burger was pretty dry and unimpressive.... Pork was also dry.... Not juicy at all. Would go back for drinks but not to eat"}
{"text":"Great food, decent portions (not quite big enough to share IMO but big enough for one).   Save room for dessert!  Love chocolate cakey thing in the tea cup.  Bread pudding is just meh.    Service is always great-we've never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"*EDIT* the Basement of Marben is apparently called \"Bavette\" and was reviewed by BlogTo the same night we were there .( we are in the top left of the photo) http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/bavette-toronto  A group of us visited Marben for a birthday party, and to be honest, it was not at all what I excepted.   With all of the press and reviews that I had seen, I was expecting a much more \"rustic, comforting, family style\" experience and less of a \"King St W nightclub\" experience. I had read that all of the menu items had peoples names with this lovely implied backstory that the chef was inspired by a friend's cooking. There were no names on the menu, just a selection of standard nicer restaurant offerings.  The service was, however, really good. Not outstanding, but good. Our water was always filled and the server was friendly enough. They did run out of bottles of red wine, which was strange, and we had to order a more expensive bottle. To be fair, a decent bottle was $35-50 which isn't too bad.   For appetizers, the table shared two cheese platters. Each came with a small side of baguette chips (we could have used more), 2 slices of cheese and a marmalade and chutney, both savory. It was nice, but not mind-blowing at $12. We also enjoyed some of Rodney's oysters at $3.50 a piece that came with a herb vinaigrette and fresh lemon. The star of the appetizers was the house made sour dough bread with a pinot noir reduction and soybean oil. It was delicious, and we were brought a second helping.    The mains were disappointing for non-meat eaters. Meant to be shared \"Tapas\" or Family Style, the vegetarians had a very limited selection. There was a seabass dish as the only seafood for $17, a Squash and Brussel Sprouts Gnocchi with Sage Butter and a Squash Soup. While I appreciated the creaminess of the soup, and the crunchy onion bits, it could have used some stock or more depth of flavour, it was lacking seasoning. The gnocchi was clearly made in house which was nice, but was smallish in portion and not very exciting overall. The meat eaters were all enjoying their burgers and fries, but the veggies were left a little hungry.  Even the only salad on the menu had chicken.  We didn't have dessert, as we brought our own cake. Originally they wanted to charge us $6 a person to serve it for us, but thankfully we had that waved.   We had been seated in the cozy basement, with booths covered in lavish fabrics and tonnes of pillows. Bicycle Seat and handlebars wall decorations were mistakingly used as coat hangers three times during the time we were there, which was pretty hilarious. As soon as the bill hit the table our waitress disappeared, the room cleared out and a dj set up a MacBook turning the room into a dance party. A bunch of drunken twenty-somethings showed up and did shots  NOT what I expected. All of a sudden there is security at the entrance to the bathroom.  Farmhouse Cafe? Seasonal Offerins? Localvore Haven? Dance Club? Marben has a serious identity crises. Whatever works I guess.  Bonus points for the decor. The Mason jar light fixtures are brilliant. Bonus points for the REALLY nice barstaff downstairs.     Minus points for not having many options for those on meatless diets. I was carbed out.  Minus points for the lack of seasoning in the gnocchi and soup Minus Points for expensive cake fee.  Overall, Ill be back for breakfast, lunch, or quiet intimate dinner upstairs."}
{"text":"had the bass, duck breast, charcuterie, and apple pudding. Bass was seared PERFECTLY (not even exaggerating). Wonderful meal. Love this place"}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch during summerlicious and I must say I was quite disappointed.  Overall their food is VERY SALTY.  I ended up tried everything on their summerlicious menu except the chilled soup, and basically every dish except for the desserts was salty - even the salad!  I guess the chef likes his foods on the saltier sides?   For the first course we had flat bread and the dips- and breads were sprinkled with big salt grains when they were already accompanied with olives. The salad leafs were also salty and the cheese didn't make it better.   For the main course we ordered all different things - the risotto, John's burger, and the mackerel escabeche. Our server mentioned that the mackerel dish will be sour and pickled, and I was okay with that - except the fish was litterally balls of fried salt. The risotto was already on the saltier side and the added cheese didn't help. So I asked the server that my dish was too salty, and she said \"that's why I said it's pickly,\" but in my opinion pickly is not the same as salty. So she was like \"then what do you want instead?\" so I went for the burger. And even the burger patty was salty too! Omg!   The desserts were alright. Nothing too amazing but I was just glad that they weren't salty at that point.   Then the bill came, and I was surprised to see that I was charged twice - for the mackerel and the burger. I asked our server and she apologized and removed the charge for the mackerel, but after all that experience I wasn't quite happy to see the preset tipping option of \"20%\" honestly.   The only reason why I still gave 2 stars were because the restaurant looks pretty and has a nice atmosphere, and the hostess I talked to for reservation (Claire, I think?) was very friendly and nice.  Other than that, I don't think I will return to this restaurant, and I probably won't recommend this place to people unless they like their food salty!"}
{"text":"Was there with a friend of mine during the week for dinner. It was busy, but our waitress had enough time to crack a few jokes with us and really explain the menu. The drinks were crafted to my liking, the service was pleasant and cheery (Thank you Malerie & Candice), and the food speak worlds for itself. Will need to go again to make sure I wasn't dreaming."}
{"text":"Marben may be good for couples or dinner out with a spouse but they blow for large parties. We reserved more then a week in advance a table for a party of 12. We were asked if a table near the bar was ok, which it was, however when we arrived there was a booth for about 5 people then the rest of us were seated AT the bar. Strike one! If you have a large party you typically want to all sit together.  The waitress came around asked us for our drink orders and we ordered a few bottles of wine to share. Because we were a large party we had to order from a pre fixe menu, so we had appetizers that we had chosen from prior - tequila ceviche in little baby cones, lobster paella balls and basically potatoes with tomato sauce and aioli. The apps were pretty good until one of my co workers found a hair in her lobster ball. To which the waitress said in a mono tone voice \"oh, that's too bad\", thanks for caring! She took it away and brought us more - as if we wanted to continue eating them after. The lobster ball prior to the hair was pretty good, crunchy on the outside, nice lobster flavour a little bit of spicy rice however the outside was quite salty. The ceviche was good not fishy at all, avocado was creamy but there was too much cilantro. The potato were nicely done but how can you really screw up potatoes?  They came around asking what entree we would like, I ordered the yucatan beef, advertised with lime, beets, sweet potato purée and beef bacon. It was so fatty I couldn't even finish it, I know you need some sort of fat in order to make braised meat nice but I pulled my fork away and the fat came off in a string that looked like melted cheese. I had one teeny piece of \"beef bacon\" on my plate.  Our pre fixe menu was suppose to include dessert but we kept waiting and waiting finally we asked the waitress about dessert and she said it wasn't included. My co worker who arranged the party said that the GM had sent her a menu with dessert. The waitress said she would send her over. The waitress came back said no that was the $55/person menu as per the GM. Why she couldn't come over and speak to us herself was beyond me. Finally she came over and stated first and foremost we were 30 min over our allotted time (apparently your only allowed 2 hrs for large parties) and then that dessert was not included. She still argued even after showing her the email correspondence that SHE herself sent. Finally she caved and said she would send us out dessert. Like holy! What a hassle. She also stated we would have to leave the table by the bar because it was booked for someone else. So we all crowded around the bar chatting, when wanting to order another $60 bottle of wine we were told she had to check because we were suppose to be leaving soon, really? I thought that was our choice or do you make it a habit to kick paying customers out?  Overall I was really disappointed with marben, the fact that I didn't really enjoy the food all that much is one thing but the rude waitress and the even ruder GM was appalling. For spending the amount of money we did on food and wine you would think they would encourage us to stay not kick us out the door. I wouldn't recc. this place to anyone else based on the food and especially not on the service."}
{"text":"Another night to eat our sorrows away. This time, we are here at Marben. It was a romantic restaurant, dim lights, large paintings and fancy furniture. The server was really nice, explained everything on the menu. The menu was simple, not too many selections but one of every kind. We first started with the Tequila Ceviche cones  with avocado, tobiko. The cone was made from fried wonton wrapping shaped in a cone. Avocado at the bottom with ceviche on top and tobiko. It was a very refreshing appetizer, cute presentation and very fresh fish taste.  For the mains, I ended up getting the scallop and dungeness crab agnolotti in saffron broth. It was like a big ravioli. It was packed with lots of crab meat, you can really taste the crab but not so much of the scallop. It didn't look that filling but it was, I was so full afterwards. My friend had the leek & ham risotto, it was very creamy and flavourful as well."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ... This place is so ridiculously overpriced for the portion size. Came here with a group of 7.  Ordered 10 apps, 7 entrees, drinks and dessert for $625.  Can you say disappointed?  I myself ordered the steak entree, which literally consisted of 3 slices of steak, 1 potato fry and 2 sprigs of asparagus for $27.  Never again."}
{"text":"We used to live near Marben and went regularly because of the great food and nice patio. We moved and just went again after a year break and the service has gotten inattentive. Our waiter didn't take any order after being seated for 40 minutes-- we had to stop him to as of we could order food. He took it, we got our food and he never came back to check on how it was or to take drink orders. We had to stop him again to order drinks, when we were done meals. Most places ask for a drink order first. He has pleasant enough, but not great at his job. Food is still good, minus a star for inattentive staff."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the food was very well prepared and presented. The prices were a little on the high end but worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding experience here with my family a couple of weeks ago. Got great advice from the server, and just ordered a ton of dishes. Each one was unique, perfectly cooked, and had us wanting more. Even the cocktails were inventive and perfect complements to the meal. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Perchance to dream?   I was welcomed at Marben early one evening and attended to by a waitress whose name now escapes me, but she seemed like she had a good head on her shoulders.   I elected to grab a table near the kitchen, and enjoyed my time at Marben with a full view of the goings-on of the staff. I noted great camaraderie among the Chef and his colleagues, all of who seemed to have temporarily escaped this hellish joke we call a \"life\" as they embraced one another's company and fielded all incoming meal requests.   I started with a beer, I don't remember the name of it but I'll drink anything that doesn't kill me so perhaps I'm not the best one to ask for drink recommendations.   As an appetizer, my guest and I decided to order the cheese and charcuterie board. Great presentation was accompanied by succulent flavors as I alternated between chewing on meat and cheese.   Onto the main course, my guest and I decided to order the \"family style beef\" selection. We were served an approximately 18oz rib steak cut, cooked to the satisfaction of my guest who prefers a medium cook. I'm a blue rare man myself, but I was also raised a gentleman so when afforded the opportunity, I succumb to the culinary requests of my peers.   The meat was cooked perfectly. I'm no food critic, but my guest was, and found the beef to be of exorbitant grade and to have the perfect blend of aging and seasoning to deliver quite the pleasing experience to the palate. We had a lot left over as we were only two people, and the waitress was kind enough to provide a box in which I was able to place the remains of the steak for later consumption at 4AM in my hotel room after I had been afforded enough time to collect my thoughts for the day and reflect on the successes and failures of my life.   For dessert, we were served with a marshmallow chocolate dessert. It was sold as a \"vegan\" dessert, and I usually stay far away from those types of foods. My father was a religious meat-eater, as was his father before him. Also I am not really a fan of fruits or vegetables aside from the occasional hard lemonade at the local saloon. Nevertheless, I was PLEASANTLY surprised that the taste of the dessert was not hindered by the \"vegan\" label; and in fact, I enjoyed it a lot more than non-vegan desserts I have consumed over my years as a struggling bachelor.   I had to leave early to attend a sports entertainment event at the nearby Ricoh Coliseum, and once again my waitress was kind enough to promptly bring me the bill. I was given many options in terms of payment - cash, credit, debit, you name it. I elected to use the ol' Mastercard and bank me a few Air Miles.   All in all, I quite enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and customer service at Marben. It's also in a really neat location that I am sure I have seen in some movies before."}
{"text":"I love how the city empties out during long weekends!  My best friend and I had brunch plans and decided to meet up at 11am for brunch.   After riding our bikes through the city to check out a couple of our favorite brunch spots with no luck...we ended up at Marben.  She had been there before, I had not.    It was a beautiful, sunny day so we sat on the patio which is raised a little bit and super cute.  We didn't have to wait at all and got a table right away. Bonus!  I'm a meat eater, she's not.  She ordered Simon's Omelette and I had the Traditional breakfast with sunny side up eggs and extra crispy bacon.    Before your food comes, they bring out fresh baked bread, home made butter and jam.  She remembered how great it was from last time, I was very pleasantly surprised.  Wow, it all tasted amazing!  We devoured that bread in a few minutes!  When our meals came out, I noticed there's no toast served with the traditional breakfast...but having that home made bread moments earlier totally made up for it.  Who really needs THAT much bread in one meal, right?  :)  The coffee was really good too.  Very fresh!  At first glance, our portions looked a little small.  But I think our eyes were just bigger than our stomachs as it was the perfect size.  There are technically only 3 little pieces (not strips) of bacon on the plate...but they're cut super thick, which is pretty much the equivalent of 3 longer (more conventionally cut) strips.    The only thing that's keeping me from giving a higher rating is the service.  Although it was pretty attentive, I think our server was just having a crappy day or maybe just in a \"blah\" mood.  It's not her fault at all.  I think I was just a little surprised, that's all.  All in all Marben's brunch was delicious.  I've heard great things about their dinners and will try it out sometime this summer for sure."}
{"text":"Although I feel like the chef must be tired of making burgers (it's the only thing on the menu that doesn't change), I admit that it was pretty good. It was flavourful and surprisingly light.  We did, however, find their salad and fries to be too salty-- and we are salt-loving people, so this was slightly baffling to us.   For those needing a break from the bustle of King West, Marben is a good respite."}
{"text":"We decided at the last minute to go to Marben with a party of 8 people!  So two hours in advanced of dinner, we called and found out it was full because it was their monthly pig roast night (last monday of every month) but that they could accommodate us along the bar. 100 lbs of Berkshire Pork roasted all day long sounded like something I'd eat standing up or sitting :)    Wow, for $25 you get some deeeeliciously made pork plus two sides (kale, butternut squash/apples, baked beans, fries, coleslaw).  5 of us ordered the pig so it came out family style and we ate it like at a cocktail party (standing up with lots of drinks).  I really enjoyed the pork, never had anything like it.  I'd complain a little about the small portion but it's probably good not to eat so much.  The sides were all really good too - most notable for me would probably be the roasted butternut squash with apples.  COME FOR THE PIG ROAST!  Some others in our party had the burger which I never got to taste but their comments were a resounding: this is the best burger I've ever had!  Paul, our bartender was super nice, accommodating and gave us great recommendations for wine, champagne, and tastings of a local Muskoka beer that tasted like Chocolate Milk!    Once there was a table, they set us up to drink some more.   We were also still hungry and asked for some of their famous home made bread and decided on the meat (charcuterie) platter and two desserts.  The meat platter was so good - included was a duck terrine which apparently is another awesome dish on their menu!  The banana pudding dessert was just heavenly - the other dessert had chocolate cookies and some kind of cream, it was just alright.  I quite enjoyed our time at Marben and definitely want to go back after reading Catherine L and Karen S's reviews to try everything else on the menu!!  One star was knocked off for having 8 ppl sitting at the bar and how all of us had to eat something extra later that night to be full!"}
{"text":"So disappointed with Marben! We went here on a Thursday night for dinner and drinks close to 10 pm. The ambiance is awesome, they've made the place look really pretty. Our hostess seated us and this is where it all started going downhill.   Our server for the night took forever to come. She took our drink orders and disappeared again. I mean it wasn't a busy night and there seemed to be more servers than patrons. We finally got our drinks and ordered the mussels. The mussels were flavorful and the broth though salty was tasty. The server offered to get us some more bread for the mussels. Unfortunately, the lower part of the bread was soaked in water, probably coz the plate in which it was served wasn't completely dry. We would've brought this to our servers attention but she disappeared again.  For the main course, we decided to split the burger. When the burger arrived, it was rare to medium rare. We were never told that's how the burger is cooked at Marben! We had to send it back and cancel the order. unfortunately, the sequence of events left a bad taste."}
{"text":"No problem making a group reservation. Table was ready when we arrived. Hostess didn't offer to hang our coats even though we saw a coat rack near the entrance.  Waiter didn't introduce himself. Cocktails were average priced ($12 and up) and decent but not remarkable.   Apps were good- charcuterie and cheese platters, ceviche cones were well-presented and tasty. We got a complimentary amuse bouche of trout crudo. Disappointing that the server didn't explain any of the dishes. We picked at the jellies, cheeses and meats but didn't know what we were eating. Octopus salad was excellent. Burger juicy but salty. Ribeye okay. Nutella Creme brûlée nice.   Overall, good place for groups except for 18% auto gratuity for disinterested service."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious. Had the burger. Food was good. It's like an upscale pub. The decor and service were pretty good too. But for the price, you can probably get better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had an awesome meal here. The winter greens salad was large, bitter greens sweetened up with pomegranate seeds and pumpkin seeds with a very bright and delicious dressing. For an entree I had braised veal with sunchoke purée  - delicious, and sunflower seed \"risotto\", a grain free marvel! So good, very flavorful and perfectly prepared. The service was warm and friendly. I walked in without a reservation and was promptly seated at the bar. I'm in Toronto four times a year, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and it was very nice!  The service was great.  I asked our server to recommend a sparkling wine and it was faaaaaaantastic. So fantastic that I ordered two of them, which were $12 each. I got Dennis' beef and it was very delicious. The brown butter sauce was really sweet but I liked it. The fries were good. The truffle aioli was awesome.  My bf also got the beef and got fingerling potatoes.  The potatoes weren't that special. Average. For dessert we got a sampler with caramel ice cream, candied walnuts, chocolate tart, almond shortbread cookies, and the apple bread pudding.  The bread pudding was my fave, but really, they were all amazing. I think the only thing this menu needs is a bit more selection for the mains."}
{"text":"I went to Marben for dinner last night with a group of 11.  The group was great, but the restaurant was really... 'just okay'.    The restaurant itself is lovely and the patio is spacious. I have nothing negative to say about our server, except... we were presented with the option to tip 20% on top of our group auto-gratuity that was already incorporated into our bill.  I know why restaurants do this... They do it on the chance that guests forget about the auto-grat. Seriously?  Am I really going to want to tip almost 40% on my meal?  That's ridiculous and VERY presumptuous.  A lot of restaurants do this, not just Marben, but i always think it's incredibly devious and rude.  So, that was a bit annoying, but likely not our servers fault.    Apart from that, the food was okay. The menu was different from the menu on the website, so they didn't have the dish that I was looking forward to eating, which is totally fine, but leads me to the point in the evening where I rate Marben low... The menu lacked a range of options. So much so that it took a couple of us a solid 20 minutes to figure out what we were going to eat. There was nothing that seemed overly appetizing to us, which i think is a big problem for a restaurant. And especially because it isn't a low-cost restaurant.  So, if I'm paying a lot of money for a menu option that I wasn't looking forward to eating, then...  I will never go to Marben on my own accord, but it's not 'bad'."}
{"text":"I was so happy to finally have tried @MarbenResto . For some reason my understanding of the place was way off - that it was a just another overpriced restaurant downtown.   This was one of the best meals I've had in Toronto. Rolled in on a Monday night - and just so happened to be the monthly Pig Roast.   What luck. For $25 you get a plate of fresh of the spit pork plus two of 5 sides. Two of us were eating, so we were able to try: the fries, sauteed kale, sweet roasted vegetables (squash, apples, etc), and baked beans.  The pork was a perfect mix of crispy/fatty/lean pieces and the accompanying BBQ sauce was fiery, beautiful and bold (I like my BBQ sauces like I like my women).   There is an option for a \"Jug of Beer\" also for $20. That's just a pitcher that you pour into Mason jars. Not really a steal there - but it was a good addition to all that manly meat.  The normal menu looked great, too. No mains were over $21, if I remember correctly.   Outside of the food - the space itself is comfortably cool, organic feeling, with lots of wood accents and vintage signs.  You gotta go to Marben.  ALSO to Note:  They host butchery classes once in a while. One has been Cow and one was Wild Boar. $70 to learn how to slice up a wild boar? Invaluable."}
{"text":"Marben is one of my new favorite in Toronto. They have been open for two years and super busy. I'm worried that they may change because of their success! Prices are very reasonable to cheap for the  superb quality and taste. Love the burger and the sides are also well done. Service is great once u get past the hostess. Don't let that deter u. All in all a very recommended place!"}
{"text":"Yesterday there was a Yelp event at Marben promoting the worthy charity Mealshare, an organization whose mission is to end hunger in Canada and around the world. Mealshare has partnered with PARC (Parkdale Activity Recreation Centre) to provide meals in Toronto. Partner restaurants such as Marben (and others such as Khao San Road, Pizza Libretto, and Richmond Station) are giving a portion of the proceeds of certain dishes at their restaurants to Mealshare allowing for #Buy1Give1.   Here are those dishes that will be making a difference:  John's Burger Braised Beef, Branson Pickle, Cheddar  John's Burger - I loved how this burger was served medium... The braised beef was very flavourful and melt-in-your-mouth.  Great bun selection... It was fluffy and soft. The cheese brought everything together. It was a bit on the salty side though.  It also comes with a nice helping of fries.   Barley and Rye Kernel Risotto  Fresh peas, asparagus, golden beets, puffed wild rice  Barley and Rye Kernel Risotto - This was my favourite dish of the two!  The risotto was flavoured with an asparagus sauce and was perfectly \"al dente.\"  The barley, rye kernels, and puffed wild rice elevated the dish by adding a delicious crunchy texture. Terrific!  There were two options of drinks: a classic gin & tonic as well as the creative Dark & Stormy - 1.5 ounces of dark rum, 1/2 ounce of lime juice and topped up with ginger beer!  Go check out Marben today and support Mealshare!"}
{"text":"John's Burger Private dining at the bar in the basement. $18.00 burger. Probably the rarest burger we've had. Texture of a pulled pork . High quality beef topped with a pickled marmalade. Cheese was a very mild mozzarella or unaged cheddar. Solid bun. Overall smaller than what we are used to for a burger. Came with a side of fries and coleslaw. Slaw an fries tasty. Likely wouldn't share next time as portion was smaller. Service was incredibly fast and friendly. Ordered a pork belly and Sarano ham risotto which was good. Overall lost points for size and price tag ratio."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner last month and it was an extremely pleasant and sophisticated experience.   The proximity to my building was a huge plus, literally took 2 minutes to walk there. It has a pretty unassuming exterior but once you go inside you're transported to a place with a lot of wood things that look cool. I'm not going to get all crazy with design talk but it looks very slick and cool and dark and moody which is my favourite atmosphere. Much like the Great Northern.   Everyone on the staff that we interacted with was courteous and friendly and knew a lot about the food items on the menu. Wait times were not long at all, certainly not moreso than the norm. I was wearing a Dior Homme suit from the 2004 Victim of the Crime collection along with new Tom Ford shoes, belt, and Oliver People's horn-rimmed glasses which perfectly matched my Jean-Paul Gautier leather attache case. Needless to say I fit in PERFECTLY.   I had a full bodied red from Prince Edward Island. Very smooth. For the main I had the duck breast featuring sweet potato puree, arugula and cherry jus. I was very impressed with the assortment of flavours engorging my 'buds' but I wish there was more sweet potato puree. I've been on a big sweet potato kick recently.   Background music included Talking Heads, Brian Eno, and TOTO. There's also a basement for additional tables."}
{"text":"Such a magical night at Marben!   My boyfriend and I rolled in around 9:30 on a Sunday and found the place buzzing enough, but with no wait at all. Lucky for us, we got the best seat in the house- a cozy, raised, half-moon booth by the bar. All the staff were incredibly warm and welcoming. They helped us with our pick of wine and were casual, but clearly knew what they were talking about. The design of the place is wooden and built for comfort and yet it has a luxe feel.   I had the duck with mushroom risotto, bok choi and blue plum reduction. Wow. It was the perfect portion of a duck breast sliced and flayed over a mound of mushroom risotto. The duck was tender and juicy with a slight crunch in the crust. The risotto was not lacking in the mushroom department, as seemingly every bite contained a mushroom that tasted woodsy, like it had just been plucked from the forest. Strewn throughout were bok choi segments, perfectly cooked and a welcome addition of greenery on the plate. The blue plum reduction added the right sweetness to tie the entire dish together.   I love being able to share! John's burger made this easily possible by being cut down the middle. Old cheddar cheese oozed over the side of the meat, containing hidden braised ribs. I get such a kick from seeing a rare burger in front of me. The french fries perhaps could have been warmer by the time I go to them, but they were still good. They came with a garlic aioli and ketchup for dipping- perfect for a girl who likes options when dining. Safe to say, together we devoured both meals.   It was all I could do to not lick the plate clean. I would certainly return to Marben anytime, any day, any way."}
{"text":"Took a gang of friends for brunch here on a Saturday, it's a nice atmosphere... lovely patio, and a great looking menu. However, nothing else impressed unfortunately. The service was okay, a little snobby but that's to be understood when you're dealing with King West clientele daily. I wish the food was better, then I'd actually go back, but it wasn't good enough for a second visit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Casual with a laid back vibe.   Walking in without reservations, my party and I were worried but managed to snag a table. We were told we had to be out by a certain time (2 hours) because another diner had made reservations. We were put off by this but agreed and were seated. Two hours later, despite a few empty tables, we were not rushed to leave or given the check. Appreciated this as our server gave us the time to finish our meal. A nice way to end the night despite the initial encounter.  We ordered:  Patatas Bravas $7- potatoes, spicy tomato, smoked paprika, aioli- the server told us they are prepared three way- boiled and double fried- great complimentary flavours- LOTS of aioli and could do with less. The potatoes were not cooked to the same consistency-  some were softer than others.  Both ordered a John's burger $19- two types of meat with branston pickle- the main source of flavouring for the burger sandwiched in between a light and fluffy milk bun. All flavours speak for themselves without adding every imaginable topping there is for a burger. The burger was served cut in half with a small coleslaw side salad and fries topped with sea salt. Definitely one of the top five burgers I have tried! And I do love me some burger!  Heavy meal to say the least- didn't quite think through our apps and main course but the burger was the way to go. Packed half our portions to go- a nice midnight snack!  The serving sizes were generous and easily sharable as smaller plates were provided.  Helpful server with choosing our menu options.  Local beer options with a few on tap- although not a whole lot of options.  The bar seating was large and wrapped around the entire bar- would opt for this seating rather than a table."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time last night. We were seated quickly, but then waited a while before anyone served us, but the service was good. Unfortunately we were seated close to the front near a large group of people standing in the bar area talking, so the noise level was quite high for a restaurant, hard to hear the person next to me. The place has lots character and the food we had was quite good, but the portion size was surprisingly small, i've had appetizers much bigger.   I don't consider myself cheap but when the bill is over $75 and you're still left feeling a little hungry its a little disappointing. I would eat there again, but probably not for a while."}
{"text":"Had the:  - Hachi's Butter & Sage Gnocchi served with crispy zucchini flower, bacon, peas, and goat cheese - Evan's Charcuterie served with pickles, mustard, crostini, red onion chutney - John's Burger served with branston pickle, braised ribs, aged cheddar, coleslaw, and fries - Pommes Kennedy - Lobster & Saffron Risotto served with squid ink aioli, sweet peas, and cherry tomato  The gnocchi and pommes kennedy were my favourite. The lobster and saffron risotto was interesting; the squid ink aioli was savoury and interesting.  Seated almost right away. Service was timely as each dish was presented at just the right time. Not too quick, and not too slow either. The environment was lively, yet conversations were kept at a decent volume to hear ourselves talk."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for two thinking Marben would be packed during Sunday brunch hour, but was surprised that it was relatively empty.   The brunch menu was short with limited options, so I quickly decided on the Mexican Hangover which sounded amazing - Jalapeño spiked scrambled eggs, guacamole, espazote, queso fresco, crispy corn tortilla, cilantro, & roasted tomato salsa ($14). My tolerance for hot food must have gone down considerably because I could not handle how spicy this dish was. Honestly, the Tabasco sauce was unnecessary since there was already jalapeno in the dish.    The portions are small, so even as a girl, I did not leave with a full belly. I also wished that there were more options on their brunch menu. The John's burger is supposed to be amazing, but I didn't want a burger for brunch.. maybe next time.   Service was disappointing - our server didn't pay much attention to our table and they weren't friendly at all. Even if they had great food, I wouldn't come back for the cold and dismissive attitude of the servers."}
{"text":"I had some great news at work, so we felt like celebrating. I had a craving for a burger, and remembered reading some great things about the Marben burger on Yelp. We headed over, ordered a couple of beers, and spent the next 2.5 hours chowing down on oysters, burgers and beer. It's a modestly sized burger (which I really prefer), and it's one of the better burgers I've had in Toronto.  Ambience was really nice, and the service was great. Will definitely go back to sample other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I visited Marben last night with a few of my gal pals and we had a fabulous time.  We ordered various items on their menu to get a sampling of what they had to offer.  Food  Appetizers  Cod Fritters - so yummy, potatoey and fishy all at the same time.  I was expecting a greasy appetizer but that was not the case.  The red sauce it came with was a great accent to the fritters.  Charcuterie Board - what a fun and interactive appetizers, great selection of meats, cheese and pickles.  I loved the presentation.  The gals and I gobbled the appetizer up.  Mains  John's Burger - wow - one of the best burgers I have had in the city.  You must try their burger.  Juicy, flavourful and melt in your mouth.  Sides  Gnocchi - oh so good, kinda small for sharing, I wished there was more.  The gnocchi was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The fried onions and roasted brussel sprouts added a nice crunch.  Yukon Gold Fries with Truffle Aioli - lots of fries to share, the gals and I could not finish the side.  The fries were well-executed, the aioli was delish.  Drinks  Sangria - great drink, it was like drinking a fruity punch.  I did not realize how much i was drinking until my glass was empty. Oops.  Service  Quick and super friendly.  We had to hunt down our server for more water and our bill.  Atmosphere  Cozy, intimate yet loud.  We were tucked in a corner and I had trouble hearing my friends.  Overall, I had a great time with my friends and the food was wonderful. I will definitely be back to try out the other items on their menu and their desserts.  We were too full after our meal."}
{"text":"I've had two bad experiences with this place and I've only been there twice. The first time the bottom of my glass fell out, and glass and my drink went all over my lap. Freak accident I know! So I wasn't about to hold that against them.  Last night I attended a birthday party for my friend there.  The reservation was for 9:30pm and unfortunately that meant the entire time we were eating we were being rushed by our waitress. Hey, if you need us to finish before 10:30pm then why are you taking reservations at 9:30pm in the first place? The waitress rushed us so much that she decided to keep our change, which meant we ended up wayyyy over paying and she was nowhere to be found after she got our money. I guess she thought she deserved a 30% tip. Normally, I would make a stink about this and speak to another employee there but my friend who's birthday it was, was already feeling really bad that she picked this restaurant.  So we all pretended it was no big deal. The food was good, although sparse.  We would've ordered double the recommended amount but again, they were rushing us to finish up. DJ was excellent, the bus boy really nice, but the waitress really killed it for us."}
{"text":"Cute decor and service was very nice.  I had the mushroom and sun choke plate.  It pretty good but not outstanding.  The buttermilk fried cauliflower appetizer stole the show.  I'd come back just for that!"}
{"text":"There are no vegan options on the menu but the server (who was also vegan) was very attentive to my concerns and the chef made me an all vegan meal!!! 90% of the meal was good, except for an unidentified freen veggie that lasted bad.   the atmosphere is very elegant. a great spot for a fancy dinner date or dinner with clients.   I recommend, even if you are vegan."}
{"text":"Amazing service, atmosphere and food. Will defiantly be back again. I haven't had a good restaurant experience like this in a long time."}
{"text":"It's not easy finding a restaurant downtown Toronto that can handle a very large group that also serves incredible food, on a Saturday, at dinner time.  Did I mention I had less than a week to work with?  Enter Marben.  You'll catch me saying the name with the emphasis on the second syllable (I'm part French) but everyone I know emphasizes the MAR.  Allowing 16 people to order food could easily become a disaster.  Luckily, the servers told us the chef had a sharing/tasting menu in mind and we did not object.  The amazing waitress checked with everyone for dietary restrictions and let those affected know which dishes they could enjoy and which to avoid.  There was lots of food coming so no one would starve.  I have often been told that Marben is very expensive, some say too expensive.  Therefore, if you have 15 friends (acquaintances will do), I highly recommend this long list of food.  It was very affordable considering the quality and quantity of food we enjoyed.  About $40 per person, INCLUDING tax and tip.  And we were all more than full.  Also, we didn't even finish it all.  18 oysters = $45 3 charcuterie boards = $60 3 beet salads = $30 3 cod cakes = $36 6 DNR burgers = $78 3 DNR bass = $51 3 DNR toulouse = $39 2 DNR trout = $36 2 DNR lamb = $42 3 squash = $15 3 fries = $15 3 sunchoke = $15 3 broccoli = $15 3 gnocchi = $15 2 spaetzle = $10  My favourites:  the burger, the sunchokes, the gnocchi.   Honourable mentions: charcuterie, beed salad, lamb, squash, spaetzle, broccoli.  Notes: beverages were on a separate bill.  They will let you each use a different credit card, if necessary.  This was a great way for our large group to dine.  This gave everyone the opportunity to try several items of the menu and also saved us lots of time by not ordering individual meals.  On a second visit I was seated at a high top on the main level.  We ordered the burger and the gnocchi.  Both were as good as I had remembered.  The service was spectacular, yet again.  It's good to know their quality is consistent.  I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The reason why I do not give it five stars are many, including one of the worst lightings ever. if it were any darker, you would be at O'Noir!  This restaurant is so noisy, with a combination of chatter and loud music that you think you are in a nightclub. We were a group of 7 (no, not THAT G, including some that had never met but to talk was an exploit that  demanded bionic ears, if you wished to understand everything the other person was telling you. The wine list has very interesting choices, but the choice by the glass is abysmal. If you don't want wine though, they have a very nice selection of expertly-made cocktails that are worth even stopping at Marben only for drinks (bar area at the front)I managed though to order for a very nice glass of Niagara Riesling ($10) that was really a great match to my meal. And here is really the only thing that would bring me back to Marben: the superlative food.  I had 3 very fresh, tasty oysters from Massachussetts ($10), the name? I could not understand as the noise was so damn loud, but it was great. I then followed with a wonderful octopus salad. A grilled in blood orange, spicy, delicious, non-chewy tentacle, tossed with red pepper, new potato, chorizo and scallion. Truly a superb and satisfying dish.  Would I go back? Probably for drinks on the patio or an alfresco meal. However, since my impression of the restaurant area was \"dinner in a dance club\", I  doubt I would repeat the experience in the dining room."}
{"text":"Marben definitely goes under one of my favourite Toronto eats. A cute little date spot, with an awesome ambience. Their burger is a classic, and one of the best I've ever eaten. Their menu is a little limited and does change often- but you can never go wrong with a recommendation from the waiters. They recommended pork chops and it was delicious! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Needs salt... Pepper... Something!!  I ordered the hangover nachos... It was good! It was nachos, eggs, hot sauce, sweet peppers and guacamole. It was a bit bland!... I had go ask for salt and then it was really good... Please note, I don't cook with salt, so it was weird that I asked for salt.   Dave ordered the duck eggs with duck hash and spinach. Same thing, it needed salt. I liked his. He likes mine...we switched.  The duck egg was a bit overdone but still runny when you cut through it. I enjoyed it because its something I would make at home for breakfast,  but I think that says something because the only thing that set it apart from what I can make for myself is the duck egg.  We got the nutella French toast to share. Now finally! A winner!!! The only thing was the nutella was only one small section... So most of it was French toast with berry compote. But the bit with nutella was amazing!! I just wish there was more of it!   I'm not ready to completely write marben off. I love the neighborhood and I'm always there. So I will be at marben again... Maybe to try to john burger and a drink.  The atmosphere was cozy and waiter was very helpful at suggesting items on the menu."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Came during winterlicious for lunch. The food looked good, and the atmosphere was pretty good. But the food quality did not seem as good as it looked. It wasn't bad, but for the price, it definitely did not seem worth it.  The venue itself is pretty cramped, there isn't adequate room between tables. I probably won't come back again, but the burger did look good. It's also a bit out of the way to get to...  Service wasn't the best either, as the waiters didn't seems to be very attentive, as I tried to flag them down for the bill.  Hopefully this is only the case for winterlicious for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled-pork (the best we've had in Toronto), great home-made bread served with the meal, good brunch options.  Nice atmosphere; service a little inconsistent (some servers are great, some not so much).  Price can be a little high as is common in Toronto, but you get a good meal no matter what.  With our favorite brunch place - Hoof Cafe - gone for good, we were looking around for another place that had some of the panache & quality, and we have settled on Marben as our new favorite.  It is great for brunch, but we've also enjoyed dinner there as well.  They are very meat-oriented, and you can watch them cutting up the pigs in the kitchen.  Cocktails are creative and good.  Generally the food is a standard selection, but quite well-executed at that.  I would say the food is consistently good (which is more than I can say of most places), and that's really what keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"While wandering around downtown, a local told us to try this place. We obliged and went looking for it. Since we were walking, and we don't know the area at all, we were growing skeptical as we trekked down what seemed like a residential street. When we found it, we instantly grew insecure about not having reservations. It definietly seemed like the type of place. After my boyfriend lunged me through the doors and curtains (yes, curtains), I akwardly announced that we did not have reservations but was told to come here. The woman who helped us was very kind, and did not bilittle us for not having reservations. She showed us to our table and set off to grab us some water. I loved the decor of the place, reminded me of a warm cabin on a cold day. We took our sweet time with the menu's but that didn't seem to offend the server, even on her fourth time coming back to see if we were ready. We had the cheese platter to start, which was as it advertised: cheese. Now I love cheese, and so was impressed by the platter but can see why some might not be. It is after all, just cheese. My main was the duck, and it was extremely tasty; complimented by sweet potato puree and sweet potato fries. Boyfriend had the streak which he proclaimed to be perfect. For desert we shared the crème brulé which we inhaled quicker than they could check on us. \"How are things....oh. You're finished.\" All in all, it was a pleasant experience with good food, and lovely service."}
{"text":"mm mm marben  the octopus in the GRILLED OCTOPUS SALAD is t-e-n-d-e-r. everything about this dish was so tasty (chorizo, potatoes, just sweet-enough dressing), wished there was more!  JOHN'S BURGER hides a delicious shredded braised rib surprise within. the meat within a meat (meat-ception??) offers extra moisture and flavor. meat-to-bun ratio was appropriate. served with a side of slaw and skinny fries [which came in a really cute vintage scale -- points for creativity :)]  lighting is definitely on the dim side (even though we sat across from the open kitchen, which I imagine offered some extra lighting) and the music is quite loud, which made for difficult girl talk for our table of 10. but considering the size of our table, service was quite quick."}
{"text":"Two visits to Marben and two superior experiences that earned them a 5 star review!  My first visit was early on in the summer for a calorie damming dinner with a friend, it was walking distance from their place and the summer weather allowed for us to enjoy their great Wellington Street facing patio. I especially enjoyed the communal table theme where you shared a long picnic style bench with other folks - it definitely helped to create conversation and allowed us to make new dinner friends!  On this particular visit we ordered their famous burger which is a mix of chuck and higher end cuts of meat (I wanna say brisket?). Bar none... this is in the top 5 for burgers I've ever eaten, in my life... even better than the first time I had a big mac at age 5 (I was a fat kid... what of it??!?!?!!?).   ....The juices ran down my fingers and I forgot my manners as I licked them up one at a time. Don't like it? Don't look! This is #foodporn at its most primal form, get a camera and capture that ISH, because it doesn't happen often  *pant pant pant pant... gasp...* AHEM!  Prior to the burger we ordered their meat charcuterie board and while expensive, was tasty and had grainy mustard, preserves and crispy baguette chips...a paté, prosciutto and duck sausage, all three of which were excellent.  This all said, the winner far and above all the amazing food was the specialty cocktails that they offer. I would HIGHLY recommend you order the \"bespoke cocktail,\" where the server/barchef asks you which alcohol and flavour elements you enjoy in a drink (smokey, alcoholic, bitter, sweet, etc) and you choose a price range ($13-15 or $18-21). They disappear for a few minutes and then emerge with a drink custom made to you preferences.  I asked for a smokey drink and I was presented 10 minutes later with a locked chest.  I was told to let it sit for a few moments as it was not yet ready. Opening it up I discovered what I was told was a manhattan sitting in a bed of espresso beans. That was not the amazing part, what wow'd me was that the cocktail was actually being smoked with chips of burning beach wood in the dish next to it. UH-mazing!  This drink was so epic that when I returned a month later with a buddy in town from Chicago I brought him right away and he too was equally amazed!  Service is tops, food is amazing, staff is knowledgable.... what else could you want!  If you haven't been here... do it.... do it. DO IT!  Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"I went last night at about 5:15. We were told that the kitchen doesn't open till 5:30 but that we were welcome to have a drink.  We were shown to our table and given drink menus, I had to ask for the food menu.  All the staff were hanging out around the open kitchen which I had  a clear view of. I am still not quite sure who our server was. Everyone kind of seemed all over the place yet no where at the same time. They took our food order at 5:30, we received our soup appetizer at 5:45 and our entrees at 6:15...we were finished and ordered the bill at 6:21.   Food Butternut squash soup- 5/5 amazing Marianne's duck- 3/5 i don't think I am a duck fan dennis' beef-4/5 very tender caramelized root vegetables- 3/5 was the highlight of my meal and a sore disappointment"}
{"text":"Went to Marben on a Wednesday night. There was enough people to have a nice ambiance. The food was okay at best. We had the charcuterie platter, oysters, Jamon Serrano and the Patata bravas as appetizers. The charcuterie platter featured 3 choices and had nothing special. The patatas bravas were also just okay. The Jamon and the oysters were great (but how can they not be, there is no preparation involved). We also ordered a salad that they forgot to bring us.  I had the burger as a main, again nothing special.  Overall the food was very average, the waiter was kind of annoying... He kept calling me \"pal\".  I would go to plenty of other places before going back to Marben."}
{"text":"I tried the deep fried cauliflower, roasted brussel sprouts, venison tartar, and chicken liver mousse. All delicious, particularly the liver mousse. The tartar though, could have been a bit more finely chopped, it was a touch too chunky and chewy. Outside of the food, the service was good and the patio was nice and cozy, definitely good for a Thursday evening hang out."}
{"text":"Mon 4 étoiles va au décor et a l'ambiance de ce bistro chic où le monde est beau et souriant. La nourriture très bonne mais on y retourne plus a pour une soirée entre amis ou en couple assis au bar! J'ai pris les croquettes de morue en entrée très bonnes mais mon chum a moins aimé son tiramisu au foie gras. Il a pris le burger qui est dans leurs plats signatures et il a adoré. Le ravioli de canard très bon mais pas a se jeter par terre. J'aurais opté pour du vrai chocolat dans la crème brûlée et non du Nutella mais le gâteau au fromage était extra. Bref dépendent des plats vous y trouverai votée compte. Belle carte des vins mais assez High price et peu de sélection au verre."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to its reputation. Won't be heading back anytime soon.   Just got back from a winterlicious prix fixe dinner. I started with the roasted beets - they're listed as coming with smoked bacon, but there wasn't any on the dish. Made it a boring option that I could have made at home. Next was the albacore tuna - the fish itself was tasty and nicely cooked, but the fregola was awfully spicy and this should have been written on the menu. My dessert was the hazelnut cheesecake - a lighter version of the well-known dessert, but delicious nonetheless.   Service was fairly poor - we had a reso for 8 and waited at the bar til 845, though the we were given free glasses of champagne. The waiter only came by to take the orders and drop the food, which meant that it took another half hour to pay the bill.   All in all, a mediocre meal with not great seev"}
{"text":"Went to Marben for a meal share launch and had been there once before. At night the restaurant turns into a bit of a bar/lounge/club and had a really good DJ (about 2 years  ago) playing a lot of old school and hip hop.   The place itself is small but has a warm cosy feel to it. Fast forward to present day when I had the opportunity to return for the meal share event hosted through Yelp!  That day we were served burgers and fries. I didn't try the burger but the fries were burnt and soggy. We were also served the risotto which is underwhelming and the burnt rice bits on the top did not agree with everyone at my table.   That night I also was hit by a migraine (I don't even get mild headaches let alone a migraine) and realized that the lighting is a bit uncomfortably dim. Everyone else on my table was fine. I just have some sensitivity to lighting and it was disturbing me the entire night. So be aware of that if you have photophobia.   Having said that I plan to return for their full menu and will update my review at that point.   What a fantastic idea though about the meal share."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype about Marben prior to my first visit last week for dinner, particularly from Yelp Elitist, Kent P. I was keyed up having skimmed a recent BlogTO article about sausage fest beginning at Marben on Wednesday's (article link below), however, I neglected to read to the bottom of the article listing the dates in which sausage fest was taking place: EVERY OTHER Wednesday. Of course, the Wednesday I show up, it's not happening.  Nonetheless, my dinner was fantastic. Roasted beef on a thin bed of mash complete with shallots, roasted winter vegetables, and an allspice jus to tie it all together. It was like Sunday dinner, only better (sorry mom). The beef was cooked to perfection pretty rare, but on the verge of medium-rare doneness. Ice cream sandwiches for dessert. Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate as this cold little Sammy had chocolate ice cream pack in between two soft chocolate cookie wafers, with a side of warm chocolate and vanilla sauce for dipping. Heaven.  On the other hand, I wasn't overly impressed with everything else. Our dinner reservation was for 7.30 but the kitchen had already run out of a number of the star entrées, leaving some of the others in my group unsatisfied with their meals. The restaurant wasn't packed, but as a group of 5 ladies we were squashed into the back corner in front of an elevator (?).    I will definitely give this place a second chance as my dinner was fantastic. Until then, 3.5/5*  Honourable Mentions:  - well rounded selection of cocktails and Canadian wines - pig roast the last Monday of the month: $25 - The Exec chef looks like a high school boy but don't be fooled, he's a lot older than he looks! Plus, he runs a mean kitchen!  http://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2011/05/the_toronto_sausage_league_begins/"}
{"text":"Where to start with Marben?  I guess in summary, the food is amazing, but the service really needs improvement.  I went with a large group for a birthday party, so that might have also impacted the service as well. I'll start with the positive.   Food: the food was great, and is the only reason Marben gets more than 1 star. We got platters for everyone which included a variety of salads, their signature hamburgers, and the mushroom risotto.  I really liked the contrasting flavours in each of the dishes, except for the mushroom risotto, which just really tasted like mushrooms and wasn't as good as the rest. The dessert variety plate was delightfully gratuitous, my favourite being the cheesecake.   Service: my friend made this reservation a month in advance. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived and we had to wait an hour before we were seated. An hour!!! While I understand accidents and problems arise, they could have at least offered us a drink while we stood and waited. When we finally were seated, we were served by a young guy who was pleasant enough, but kept calling us 'beautiful people' which I found rather superficial. Drinks also took a long time to come which I thought was strange.   Overall, the food and ambiance of the restaurant were great, but the service was amateurish for a restaurant of this calibre. I doubt I'll return again, but I could be convinced.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was bookmarked for a while as their burger had quite a few good reviews. I had tried to make a reservation in the past but it was hard to get a last minute spot at a decent hour. This time I planned ahead and booked in advance.  We walked in and the host walked us to our table unfortunately this was a high chair table (not preferred by moi) and seeing there were quite a few normal tables empty we asked to be seated there. The host made off putting comments that we have to leave the table at 815 (almost 2 hours from our arrival) I was like huh! I understand that they need the turn over to maximize sales and they don't want to have people just linger around but there is a nicer way to say that (besides we had reservations as well and not just a walk in). Ah well we were planning on leaving soon anyway as had a movie to catch. Not a good start IMO by a person who is supposed to be welcoming and accommodating.  Anyway on to the main attraction the menu is simple and short (not a bad thing if one does it right).  We ordered a Burrata Salad and burgers as main.  The Salad was good as burrata lends itself to simplicity which IMO benefits a salad.  The main attraction the burger. The fries were good. Nice combo of crunch and thinness. Salted well too. The mayo was quite garlicky but one can portion control if its overwhelming. The main burger was served on a nice bun with good meat to bun ratio. Done medium rare with cheese. Had a sweet finish to it. I think its decent not amazing.  We decided to order a dessert as well. Unfortunately the ice cream was rock hard and couldn't be consumed in the state it was in. We asked the server to change it (who was very helpful) but unfortunately the dessert chef said it would need to thaw a lot more so we could get another offering.  I would say 3.5 stars but with the initial off putting remarks I would deduct a star and won't be back."}
{"text":"My second favourite burger in Toronto! Marben is perfect to enjoy a bite, a few drinks in a laid back setting.   - Service was excellent on a Wednesday evening around 8 pm. Our server explained the menu and made great suggestions. They were masters at refilling water glasses!  - The burger is FANTASTIC. Ya... I know the original chef left but it's still a kick ass burger. Cooked medium to medium rare (standard) and packed with burger goodness. The beef is made from their braised ribs - which are also amazing. Next to the Harbord room - this is the best burger in the city in my opinion.   - Our  server recommended the braised ribs which immediately melted in your mouth. So incredibly tender and delicious. Highly recommended.  - We started with the Charcuterie board. I recommend asking what's on it first as the selections change frequently. I was a little disappointed that one of the nightly selections were blood sausage but I should have asked first (no one at my table was a fan). The board has all the fixings - mustard's, chutney and pickles. Other meats included pork and a capicolla - both top-notch.  -  Decent beer options - I went with some Beau's seasonal brews.    - Good atmosphere & decor. I felt very relaxed and comfortable during my visit.  - Some of the seating is a little close together which can be be a little awkward.  A fantastic overall experience. Perfect for meat lovers. As noted, the burgers are fantastic but try some of the other menu options - you will not be disappointed.  BK"}
{"text":"Marben is known for their burger.  It's not a typical burger mind you, but it sure is yummy!  It's served with amazing fries and a small dish of coleslaw.  $19.  All of their brunch dishes are very well portioned.  You won't leave hungry.    I tried one of their cocktails too and it was quite good.  Although they were short-staffed, the servers were still attentive.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I really like going to marben The food is always good and interesting  The service is great and the atmosphere is really pleasant The burger is always a must have!"}
{"text":"Good but not great.  Service was very hands-off.  We had a 9:45 pm reservation, but the hostess claimed we couldn't switch tables.  I'm in the industry, I know that you're not getting any more seatings out of any more tables, so that was strange.  At 10:25 pm they came around and told us the kitchen was closing, which seems extremely early for a Saturday night in the heart of downtown.  Food was good but not inventive at all, duck salad could have used a crunch to balance textures and I wished the burrata came with a savoury match up like tomatoes instead of a sweet equal like strawberries.  Fries were great, but the mayo was way too garlicky to enjoy.  Doesn't seem like a place I'd go back to."}
{"text":"Burger was *thumbs up emoji*  Service was *thumbs down emoji*  Upon originally posting this review I was told it was too short. I've added in this paragraph in the hopes that it will meet the requisite length for an actual review."}
{"text":"Marben has a great rustic feel and has the exact atmosphere you want for a light brunch. Being new to the area, you don't actually expect a restaurant to be there as most of the buildings on Wellington are residential, but it still seems to fit in perfectly.  They provided a range of typical brunch items (benedict, eggs/bacon, huevos rancheros, etc.) but I was a bit disappointed in that if you wanted something besides eggs that there were few options for brunch. There were a handful of sandwiches and salads, but just didn't seem like enough... I had the huevos rancheros, which had some great spice in the salsa along with a very light salad (as if the person knew I only wanted 8 leaves of lettuce!)  Regardless, the service was pretty awesome. One of the waitresses even helped me put together a list of other restaurants to try while in the city that were characteristically Canadian, so I definitely appreciated that. She was also gorgeous, but that shouldn't really factor into the ratings =P  Long story short, great place to go, you'll likely really enjoy it, don't expect a \"cheesecake factory-like\" menu.  Side Note: I love how \"hipster\" is now an adjective we can choose below for ambiance. How ridic!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Marben the evening of the launch of their new menu.  I was sadly disappointed because they ran out of most of the new things on the menu (ceviche and foie gras).  What we did order was Meh - Ok. Nothing special like I usually experience when I go to Marben.  Though we did order the beef and as always it was delicious & perfectly cooked.  Since I go to Marben quite a lot, I wrote them to tell them how disappointed I was in the meal and got no response at all which I found surprising.   I won't be going back there again - too bad really but there are better restaurants in the city - this place isn't one of my \"go to\" places anymore...  Also - update your website with correct opening times and a current menu!"}
{"text":"Marben has been in my top 3 Toronto restaurants for many years. The menu changes but I have loved every dish I've had here. I have particularly great memories of a Huevos Rancheros with chorizo sausage. The prices are quite reasonable for the quality of food and I highly recommend booking the chef's table to watch the kitchen staff work. My wife and I were served personally at the chef's table by Chef Rob Bragagnolo when he did his Spanish menu to celebrate his first Michelin star. Amazing experience.  Service is usually quite good and the restaurant is beautiful. A great place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu looked so good my friend and I agreed to share everything.   The oysters were excellent.  The chicken liver mouse was yum.  The fish entire was just ok, but as a whole the meal was delicious.   Good wine and j retesting after dinner coffee cocktails too."}
{"text":"Not worth the money and poorly executed dishes. Very nice atomsphere though."}
{"text":"WOWEE!!  I was SO NOT EXPECTING what Marben has to offer. - high-class, exquisite food tasting like perfection - attentive service - cool cool coooool atmosphere - fantabulous music on a Friday night  This is the place to be in the Tdotty on a Friday night - well, that's if you're my OLD AGE. It's a wicked place for those thirty somethings *ahem*, I meant those... UM... YEA... twenty something folks looking for a place to chill with friends, eat some awesome food, lounge with drinks and upbeat, all type of genres music.  And if you're lucky one summer night, the Summervicious menu may be available. Choose 1 item on their regular menu in each course (appy, main, dessert) for only $35. What a STEAL!"}
{"text":"This was one of the better meals I've had in a long time. Yes, the decor and atmosphere are great- but the food was freaking delish. I love that you can get a ton of different things to try. A table of 3 of us got 4 sides and 3 mains and we all left stuffed. The fries with truffle aioli were kick ass and a good value at 5 bucks. The gnocchi with Brussels sprouts - ditto. I had the beef-  sliced thinly and cooked rare, and so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. The brown butter sauce drizzled on the side was rediculously awesome. Epic. Service was beyond 5* I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Four of us went for brunch at Marben and the invoice was not even close to matching both the food and service.  The fries were over cooked and hard, the salad was a bunch of kale thrown together with some old chicken and an egg.  Once we received the food we had to go find a server for the bill. We would not recommend to have  brunch here and would hope dinner would be better."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and worth every penny!  The food... oh my gosh, the food!  I was trying to think of something that would give this place anythiing less than 5 stars, and I really can't think of anything.  For our party of five on Friday, i emailed reservations on the Monday, and was very promptly confirmed.  On Thursday, I emailed again to change the time and the number of of party  and was again very readily accomodated.  I would recommend making reservations just in case, because the place was pretty packed when we finally left with people sitting outside on the patio in the chilly September night air, drinking and I guess, just waiting for a table.  The food!  We had the charcuterie spread ($30) and 5 other dishes that were all absolutely delicious.  The portion sizes here are a bit small as they lean towards tapas-style rather than a full heavy meal.   - Heirloom tomato salad - surprisingly different, very fresh and so so yummy - Sea bass - just cooked to perfection - Duck breast - a delightfully generous portion, juicy, tender and super flavourful - Mushroom pasta - the least favourite of everything we had here, but still good - THE PORK BELLY!!  GET IT!! GET IT NOW!!  It's mostly pork fat, yes, pork fat, but ahh!  Absolutely fabulous!!  I really can't tell you anything more than its something you'll have to experience for yourself.  The service was friendly and fast.  The drinks were yummy.  The atmosphere is fun and the decor all woodsy.  Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"We loved the street, the decor and the atmosphere. Perfect music and ambiance. The food is not large so if you are picky you will have some trouble choosing. We opted for some beers and the Jon burger that was delicious, perfectly well made and not heavy or greasy. For sure this is a place I recommend. The clockwork located in the base,net of the restaurant is closed on Mondays an operates separately from the restaurant offering only cocktails and finger food, maybe some other time.  https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d790489-r409404448-Marben_Restaurant-Toronto_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"Was in Toronto and asked a friend to take us to a local place. Very pleased with the unique and apparently constantly changing menu. The charcuterie was very good. Enjoyed the burger that is stuffed with braised shortrib! Never had a turkey dressing fritter before but I know what I'm making with my Thanksgiving leftovers this year! Very good and not terribly expensive. Short but good wine list."}
{"text":"Amazing food! G ot to sit right at the kichen and watch it being made. Chef's would come by and explain what everything was. Great vibe there and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I don't understand the mediocre reviews for Marben on here. I love this restaurant and talk it up to anyone who will listen.  Beyond the ambiance and informative wait staff, the food is excellent. They have an eclectic menu that changes with the seasons (good and bad - I miss the risotto so much...please come back). The drinks are also delightful.   Stand-outs are the cheese and charcuterie boards, John's burger and the risotto (the brunch ain't bad either)."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked on Yelp for the longest time and I finally got a chance to go. We went for my wife's birthday and it did not disappoint.  The venue was smart and cozy. I liked the space and the lighting was perfect for a intimate setting. We had a fabulous waitress who attended to our every needs and answered all of our questions about the sharing menu. She even had (which I think was) an Irish accent which I think was charming. Our plates were taken away when we were done and our water was always constantly filled. I would say it was one of the better service I've gotten at a restaurant in a while. Or they were just making sure we left before the next reservation arrived. Either way, no complaint here.  Here's what we ordered (table of 6): Butternut Squash Soup, Cod Cakes, Pull Pork Croquettes, Tofu Tempura, Sea Bass, Braise Roast Beef, Fries, Rice and Beans, Roasted Fingerlings, Stir Fried Broccoli, and Gnocchi. Overall, the food was tasty and perfectly cook. Their cocktail drinks were top notch as were their beer and wine selections. A couple of complaints I have would be the portion size and the sides. Even though they were sharing dishes, there just wasn't enough to satisfy for a group and the price seemed a little bit hefty for the portions. The sides seemed more of an afterthought and there were misses here and there. They should have sides accompanied with the mains instead of separate dishes.  Didn't have desert here but heard they were marvellous as well. Must try some next time."}
{"text":"This is a particularly difficult review for me.  We were served by the general manager, Sarah, who was just about as perfect as a server could be.  I'm rating this place based on what it strives to be, which is a really high end restaurant.  The decor is nice, service impeccable, and food presentation superb.  What's missing?  The food just isn't prepared correctly.   I ordered the Halibut, beef tortellini, heirloom tomato salad, Venison and duck pate.  The only plate worthy of 4 stars would be the Halibut.  Nearly perfectly cooked, flaky, but lacking in flavour.    The beef tortellini looked amazing but was overpowered by itself.  \"Wow, this is BEEFY.\"  I can't explain it exactly, but it wasn't good at all.  The Venison looked amazing yet was bland, dry and without merit.  The heirloom tomatoes were nothing to write home about either.  I want to give this place 4 stars but I just cannot do it.  Restaurants are foremost about food and in this respect they fail miserably.    This place is two stars without the amazing service.  The atmosphere, while warm and inviting at times can ultimately be described as cheesy.  All it takes is one song to blow it.  I don't want to remember a restaurant by a crappy early 90s song they happened to play, but by the food.  Overall the server made the night for us which happened to be my wife's birthday.    I don't see the point in returning here."}
{"text":"Thank you Shannon for the best seat in the house and the fantastic drinks.  Great atmosphere, music and vibe... food was amazing... literally am sitting at the corner booth looking onto dark sexy room.  Thank you Marben for an amazing dining experience before departing Toronto.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Although it may be easy to walk right by Marben, I would definitely recommend taking the time to stop in. Located just off Wellington and Portland, Marben is great for an intimate dinner or a post-work brew.  Highly recommend trying their burger (I'm not typically a burger and fries gal, but this one is unbelievably good). Not feeling red meat? Try out their oysters - unreal."}
{"text":"Best Cut of Steak I have had in the city, exciting menu and excellent staff, everything was tasty, I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday with a couple of my girlfriends. Ambience is chill and nice for a lazy, Sunday brunch. Their brunch cocktails sounded amazing but as we had plans to venture out to the AGO after, we stuck with coffee and tea (good as well).   2 of us had The Fry Up, which I thought was really nice. Everything was cooked perfectly and despite my reluctance to try that orange marmalade, it slowly won me over (made in house and not your average, nasty marmalade). My other friend had the pancakes which she thought were good but expected more. The brunch menu is a bit untraditional - there were several items on the menu that lost me with one ingredient (like avocado toast having sour cream involved).   Our reservation was at 11:30 and by 1pm they had another party booked at that table so the ending felt a bit rushed, however, overall I feel a 3/5 is accurate for this location for brunch."}
{"text":"hands down - one of the best experiences in terms of service I have ever experienced in the city!!!"}
{"text":"It's difficult for me to write a review for a restaurant that left me baffled, shocked and with extreme resentment. It's very rare that I write about my horrible dining experiences, mostly because I haven't had many to begin with. Even when I do, they are resolved by the restaurant and I have a clear understanding of why and how things transpired. The issue becomes a side point and I continue to review what really matters to people who want to eat there. I forgive and forget.  To be forced to shift my attitude and tone for this review about Marben, and about food experiences in general, is a very upsetting and big deal for me. I have never in my life resented a restaurant due to their management team.  I WILL ABSOLUTELY NEVER GO BACK TO MARBEN.   Out of all my dining adventures across Toronto (from hole-in-the-wall, to high-end and upscale eateries) and through my 139 reviewed restaurants, Marben provided me with THE WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever witnessed due to their lack of fundamental customer service skills.   It started with a reservation 2 weeks prior to the actual dinner date. All that was said and done was normal.  I received my confirmation call 4 hours prior to my dinner on the day of my reservation. The manager confirmed the time and number of people arriving, I agreed and we hung up. Moments later, she calls me again to mention a fee for every no-show in my reservation. I was confused. It sounded a bit made up and in the moment because I've personally never heard of something like this before. I asked what that exactly meant. For every person who did not show for my reservation, they were going to charge me $25 per person on top of our final food/drink bill. That seemed ridiculously steep. This \"little\" detail managed to creep by two weeks ago when I first made my reservation. It was extremely unfair for them to put me in that position and to be faced with the stress/dilemma. I contemplated and after voicing my concern I went through with it.  In the end, we had 14 people show out of 15. The 15th wasn't able to make the trek from Guelph after work in a reasonable time. which is forgivable.   Issue: When the bill arrived, it wasn't separate (unfortunately and really sucked, but it happens) so we calculated our own items, taking turns adding things up, adding tax, adding 18% group gratuity and then tip. The bill totaled around $530.  After paying, we were short (the trouble with no separate bills for a 14 people group). When we got down to it, we saw that there was an extra item called \"$25 prix fixe\" on the receipt which explained the missing amount. So we called the waiter over and told him about the mistake. The waiter mentioned that we had 14 out of 15 people show, the $25 was for that one person. We were perplexed, but we also tried to reason that it was an honest mishap, only one person wasn't able to show, 14 people is a lot of business with an attached hefty bill, some sort of understanding here?  He didn't budge. He insisted that we understood that there was a no-show fee enforced. We did, but it was mentioned a bit last minute and as a \"reminder\" call after all was said and done. I believed 1 omission would be forgivable for such a big party. My guests were completely enraged, and we spoke with the manager.  I explained why we had an issue over such a small mistake and I suggested that perhaps, they could be O.K. with letting the fee go. She began her defense with no apologies but to-the-point facts with what I have already mentioned in my explanation. One point was untrue though, she claimed that she mentioned the $25 fee 2 weeks ago, when in reality, I booked it with a gentleman and not with her, a girl.  I was shocked that Marben was relentlessly unforgiving. That the manager of all people was so unsympathetic and was focused on telling her side of the story instead of offering any kind of understanding or solution. I left it at that, annoyed after a big scene, paid, and was about to leave when another manager arrived? The situation worsened, she made comments like \"we want to make sure all of our customers are happy\", which was unnecessary amidst our argument.  In the end, I was deeply annoyed, my 14 guests were too. We just wanted to leave. She did the exact opposite of what she prided Marben for. The second Manager prolonged the problem without offering new input or solutions. It didn't help that the first manager was standing beside us, continually defending herself either.  She took it very personally. She told me that she felt like she was being attacked by the group, that she was insulted and that it was unacceptable.  I was upset with her confused mind-set. Her stubborn decision to gauge us for a measly $25 was purely a business decision, but now, she focused on her personal issues and wanted sympathy from me. Extremely hypocritical.  Overall, Marben has terrible customer service augmented with horrible management. Don't go if you plan on  group booking. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Marben has undergone a total remake and I can definitely say that the proof is in the delicious pork! Gone are the ultra sophisicated decor of under-lit alabaster tables, dark wood panelling and 'dressed up' atmosphere.  The room is now replete with rustic wood beams, brigher lighting, exposed brick walls and rustic but comfortable seating.   Gone too is the menu of elegantly prepared fare - replaced by 'family style' sharing plates of scrumptious and very satisfying dishes. Monday happens to be pork night and so we were met with a feast of roast pork accompanied by  various side dishes (squash, fries, beans, kale, coleslaw, etc.)   Slaughtered no more than a few days ago and roasted earlier in the day, the locally raised swine sure is enough to firmly confirm any carnivores status.  The pork was tender, flavourful, juicy, crispy in the right areas and finger lickingly piggie delicious. As were all the sides that accompanied our feast.  The charcuterie plate was also delicious as you are met with generous morsels of porcine goodness. I'm definitely liking this trend in restos towards simple locally sourced fare.   I had already enjoyed a meal in Marben's sophisticated environs and have now enjoyed Marben in this new iteration.  Yayy! I'm most definitely a fan and will be back for more.  OINK!"}
{"text":"\"The space was beautifully tied together by a long wooden ceiling structure - starting from the bar and going all the way to the end of the long room.\" \"John's Burger was the only all-year round menu item. We thought we must try this classic and also ordered their Porcini Crusted Albacore Tuna.\" \"Marben is an restaurant which targets many of one's senses. Starting with the adventurous excitement of entering an unknown, unlabeled place located off the beaten path.\"  Just a few bites from our full experience.."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a glowing review for Marben 4 months ago.  I have been dining at Marben regularly since 2012 and like both the food and the ambience.  I've been to the patio more than once already this summer but had a horrible experience today at Marben when I tried to go for brunch with my family.  I will share this as a cautionary tale and would advise others to avoid Marben unless hoping to experience verbal abuse from the hostess.  At 1207, I spoke to the hostess and advised we were looking for a table for 5 (parents were in town to celebrate a graduation).  At that time, the patio was empty and everyone was seated at tables indoors because it was raining.  No one else was waiting.  She took my name down, advised of a 30 minute wait, and suggested I take a seat at the bar.  I did as suggested and took a seat at the bar to wait.  A few minutes later the other four members of our party arrived and we waited quietly near the bar.  The hostess approached us and advised that she could not guarantee how long it would be before a table opened up.  We said that's fine, no problem.  She then went on to ask us to leave, saying we could not wait inside the restaurant because it was blocking the space.  We pointed out that it was raining and asked where to wait, she simply said we needed to go elsewhere, we could not wait for a table in the restaurant.  Fortunately, we noticed four seats opened up at the bar and then four of us sat at the bar.  The fifth person (my dad) was not allowed to stand with us at the bar as the hostess said no one can stand inside while waiting.   He waited outside the restaurant under the awning.  Despite all this, we continued to wait patiently for a table even though we found her conduct to be rude and bizarre.  The male bartender was lovely and very pleasant but the hostess continued to harass us.  My sister in law who was, as instructed, seated at a bar stool stood up momentarily to speak to her husband (one stool over).  The hostess immediately ran over and said, rudely. 'Excuse me, you are not allowed to stand.  You have to sit down.'  Needless to say, we were not impressed.  At this point, we had had enough nonsense from the hostess and decided dining at Marben wasn't worth the abuse.  We had REALLY wanted to have brunch at Marben with our parents and had waited patiently until 1245.  Despite the time we put into waiting, we left, literally chased away by the rude hostess.  I should mention that when we left, the hostess smirked and laughed - seemingly happy that we were leaving?  We were glad we made the decision to leave as she was working hard to ruin our day (and a happy occasion).  We had brunch at Cafe Bouloud at Four Seasons instead (which was fantastic with impeccable service as always).   The hostess did not introduce herself by name or wear a name tag.  She is tall, slim, brunette with hair in a top knot and was wearing a horizontally striped shirt.  She should be fired.  I should mention I've had one previous poor service experience (fall 2016 at a birthday dinner) at Marben but disregarded it as a one off.  After today's experience, suspecting it may be a pervasive issue with service standards at this restaurant which is too bad.  Nonetheless, with an abundance of great restaurants in Toronto with good food, ambience, AND service, there is no reason to dine at a restaurant with abusive staff.  Happy to take my money elsewhere and would suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and warm staff--especially sweet bartender. Enjoyed my pisco sour as I ranted about my life at the bar with my date."}
{"text":"Marben is my favourite place for brunch in Toronto. Sometimes I go on Saturday and Sunday. The fresh, in-house baked bread is reason enough to go. I also love Elaine's Big Salad. The yogurt and granola kicks ass.   Basically, everything is fresh and delicious. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"It was the Group of Seven actually.  We had +2 Ladies beside one of our late arrivals of the night.  If you look at Rafi N's photos, you'll notice they were Twins and one was fully dressed while the other naked.  (http://www.yelp.ca/user_local_photos?userid=jUs4iTWJAjGGMSWp6QV8UQ)  Looking at the Menu, I didn't see my Name on it anywhere(http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/GqSA5t_OD1uxDZMwVLpoXA?select=CvMJkqSFQNw00uF-7Xt40Q).  Decided to get a taste of Marben by random-sample method instead.  Otherwise known as let the Lady choose while I lay back and enjoy the interaction between Friends.  Flavour-wise, no complaints whatsoever.  In fact, Boar Belly was Pork-fat chicharrony crunch savoury oily cholesterol bite of death.  Well almost because the Pork Belly portion size was equivalent to an Amuse Bouche/Tapas, hardly going to make anyone OD on Fat content or Food volume.  911 not required.  Sugar Momma/Poppa optional.  Btw, the place was quite romantic dim lighting which made everything that accompanied the protein to look like brown vegetation mixture.  Make sure someone has flash on their cellphone to make sure you don't get any additional surprises.  Either that or ask for a candle per person instead of per table.   2.5'd  Service was a better part only that I wish I knew if it was their mistake or the kitchens mistake on the extended delay firing of our dishes.  The waitress must have gotten a HINT actually when you have the 1000+ review Yelper tell you someone is hungry, that is by no means a small hint.  They must have made it a strategy to fit in a few more Beers into the western girl?  Ryan's Charcuterie($11.00) John's Burger($17.00) Fred's Crispy Wild Boar Confit Belly($12.00) Marianne's Duck Confit($23.00) Evan's Warm Apple Pudding($7.00) Ervinna's Ice Cream Sandwich($7.00)  Summary:    I enjoyed the Food/Ambiance but in that time between servings I could have eaten a Burger nearby and returned before the end of second-intermission.  I've had empty stomachs leaving high-end restaurants before, I guess I'll add Marben to the list.  I would have thought differently if it was bonus paycheque season during my diet phase and I'm in a jolly mood."}
{"text":"There are some really great places on Wellington !  Marben is one of them.  Came here on Friday night to have dinner. My friend and I planned dinner at Marben last week and made reservations then - the only time available was 6:15. A little early for dinner, but since one of our friends was joining us from work, it worked out well. The drink menu is extensive - it's a little on the pricier side, but they have some unique mixed drinks. I had a glass of rose, but my cousin had the Peach Princess and she said that it was really good. As my main, I had the mushroom risotto with scallops - what an awesome dish! Portions are really generous so you should be fine with ordering just an entree. One of my pals ordered an app for the table, but it wasn't necessary. Service was excellent - you can tell that the team here work really well together. If any server noticed that our water glasses were empty, they would stop and fill our cups. They were all very attentive.  I can't come here often, but will try to come back again soon.  Good for: groups, out-of-towners, drinks"}
{"text":"IN YOUR MOUTH T.O.! Toronto has a mad foodie scene! And here's WHY ...  Being a semi-newbie in town, I had never been to Marben Restaurant and only learned of chef Misha Nestreneko's upcoming departure from the Toronto dining scene only a few days ago. So needless to say, I was excited to sample some of this renowned chef's creations!  Having been here for only a few months, I have already been fortunate to attend some amazing food events downtown. Enter: Ken Samuel from In Your Mouth TO! One of Toronto's prevalent social media contributors in food & dining, Ken's events are top notch, always taking place at fabulous settings, and consistently offering an appetizing set menu. What's more, his events not only brings foodies together, but the set up is such a way that it encourages meeting and chatting with everyone that attends. Every event involves personalized and creative name tags, followed by various games, usually involving trivia questions pertaining to the event, via twitter. Only one person always walks away with the grand prize, but everyone leaves smiling from ear-to-ear!  And tonight was no different! Tonight we feast! In collaboration with Great Lakes Brewery, the main feature is the succulent roasted pig with homemade BBQ sauce, paired with a handful of side dishes, and various types of Canadian beer, \"The Crazy Canuck\" being the one we sampled at our table. This is a west coast pale ale with an aroma that has a bit of bounce, a lingering bitterness and balanced by a subtle malty flavour. C'mon Canucks! Let's support the Great White North!  POSH NOSHINGS  Who would think of eating roasted pig in such divine surroundings? Marben Restaurant! That's who! The venue was tucked away downstairs, where the toasty coloured brick walls and plushy red velvet banquet seating along the parameters made for a cozy, intimate, and stylish setting.   ALL ABOUT ... THE PIG ROAST!  Juicy, meaty, and dripping in it's own fat and oils, the roasted pig was succulent, flavourful and simply, delish! It was recommended by Andrew at the next table to dip the freshly baked bread with the roasted pig juices and top it with chunks of fatty pork pieces. Result? mmm, mmm, and mmm!  Side dishes that complimented the roasted pork were very creative:  Kimchi Apple Salad - with toasted cashews, house fermented cabbage  Braised Kale - with yukon gold potatoes, pork drippings  Baked Beans - with cranberry beans, smoked pork  Kennebec Fries - with truffle aioli, ketchup  Creamy Coleslaw - with grainy mustard, sunflower seeds  With a full array of tastes from spicy, sweet, salty, and smooth, the side dishes paired wonderfully well with the roasted pig and induced all of your taste buds!  WAVE YOUR HANDS ... TO CHEF MISHA!  And finally, to chef Misha Nestreneko, we bid you farewell! Though he has parted from the T-Dot, you can still enjoy the culinary legacy he has left behind!   Two words, GET HERE!"}
{"text":"If I were to rate this restaurant on everything else EXCEPT the food, it would be a five star review. The service was perfect. The presentation was beautiful. The newly renovated space is beautiful. I love that all the ingredients are seasonal and sourced locally (within 100km, according to one waiter).  Unfortunately, the food is a solid two stars. My overall impression of the food was that it was bland, lacking in inspiration as well as innovation.  What I had: - Duck Pate: Very chunky and dry. - Heirloom Tomato Salad: The tomatoes were nice and ripe but accompanying dressing and lettuce (iceberg??) did nothing to accentuate the sweetness and juiciness of a good summer tomato.  - Beef Tortellini: The tortellini was a bit overstuffed with beef, so that flavor drowned out the flavor of the pasta, egg, and sauce.  - Venison: Cooked to a beautiful medium rare, but the meat itself was a little dry and on the cold side (perhaps it had been sitting for awhile?). The accompanying jus was extremely salty. Like, suck all the moisture out of your mouth salty. On the up side, the potatoes that accompanied the venison were toasty and perfectly roasted. - Halibut: The only standout of the entire evening. Perfectly cooked: moist and flaky, and in a nice (though underseasoned) broth.  - Ice Cream Sandwich: Simple and delicious, but nothing special.   It wasn't a bad meal, but it wasn't a great one, either."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with no wait. That simply cannot be beat! Ambiance is casual and the place was pretty full. Little patio out front that will be great in the summer.  The bread to start was simply fantastic, served with butter and fruit preserves, I just couldn't stop eating it.  Eggs Benny and the traditional were next. Eggs Benny were great, side salad is awesome. The traditional eggs were nothing special, but the sausage was good. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I should be sleeping, but instead am yelping...  I went to Marben last weekend. I sat on the patio, it got full quickly. The wait staff were exceptionally friendly throughout our meal, to the point I felt I was at a friends place for dinner :).   We started with the duck empanada's-omg I highly recommend as an appetizer, absolutely amazing taste.  i then had the gnocchi...it tasted good but the serving size was on the small side. what put me off slightly, was its lime green colour! like a health shake with...peas and gnocchi.  for dessert, my friend and i shared goat cheese cake. YUM!!! it tasted like goat cheese but still very sweet, and fresh tasting.   I'm giving Marben a 3.5/5. I liked it, but would say its slightly overpriced for the style they are going for, as well as their serving portions (its comparable to swan or czehoski but $$)."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite restaurants in the city.  Staff is very hip, helpful and totally unpretentious.  They even once opened for me on a Monday when I needed a venue for a large work party,  which was totally amazeballs.   The space itself has a very reclalimed rustic vibe, and is very cozy. The food is orgasmic, from the charcuterie plate and cheese selections to the burger (life changing) and home style mains I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal here.  Plus they host a number of really cool events from Sausage League in the Summer, to i-Yellow wine tastings, monthly pig roasts and Social Feed events there really is something for everyone."}
{"text":"I went to Marben with my family, without knowing that it actually only had pretty mediocre reviews on Yelp. And I'll have to disagree with some people here, I really enjoyed it!  Very creative food, trendy atmosphere, great drinks and wine.   I can definately see myself going back there many times from now!"}
{"text":"Tomatoe appetizer--fabulous. Mushroom risotto--outstanding. Dessert--not so good. One was sold out. Another had marshmallows in a cheesecake--weird. So I ordered the third option and it was a jelly like roll that tasted as bad as it looked. Atmosphere--loved it. If they kick up the desserts a notch I'd be in heaven because the rest of the meal was great."}
{"text":"Made a reso for the hubby and I on opentable and when we got to the restaurant we asked to be seated on the patio, as there was an empty table in clear sight. The hostess informed us that they do not take resevations on the patio, and so I asked if there was a waitlist, assuming that the empty four-top table was already spoken for by someone on a waitlist. Her response was no, there is no waitlist, we are just waiting to fill the four-top with a party of four!! Clearly they do not understand the value of a customer that made a targeted effort to visit them and let me walk out the door. Out of principle I refused to sit inside knowing that there was a table available where I wanted to be seated, all  because some short sighted server wanted to make an extra 20 bucks! Management needs to re-train and reincentivise the servers so they do not turn away paying and Loyal customers in the hopes of making more tip money. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch a few weeks ago, can't remember what I had (I'm sure it was great!) but I do recall the service: I wanted some Earl Grey tea, which they didn't have... so they were happy to improvise by steeping blood-orange rinds together with some English breakfast tea.  Turned out amazingly well!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch Specialty: Carnivorous Paradise Menu items: John's Burger  Vegetarians be aware! Marben is a carnivorous paradise. Although they offer salad options, the smell of meat goodness might overpower your own will. Known for their charcuterie, meats, pig roasts and the fact that Marben's butcher is non-other than Ryan Donovan (former Chef and famous Toronto Butcher); Marben promises to make your meat-eating experience worthwhile.  I was lured into Marben just to try John's Burger. Get this! They use braised ribs instead of ground beef for their patties (mouth watering). This burger is definitely all about the meat and its flavour; so much so, that the burger only comes with branston pickles (made from a variety of diced vegetables), aged cheddar and a specialty house-made sauce to butter the bread, which I am sure contains a lot of butter.   The aged cheddar is perfectly melted on the braised rib patty and covers it in its entirety. When you get your burger, you can barely see the cheese, it is only with good lighting that you are able to see it as as well my camera did. One bite into the burger, and you know you have just entered dangerous territory - otherwise called addiction. The flaky pieces of braised rib mixed in with the branston pickle mix and topped with the nice coating of cheddar, deserves an applause.  The bread is also soft and moist and just a perfect pairing for this patty.  Marben's accompaniments - fries and coleslaw - are also good choices, but once again they just compliment the burger. If they wanted to up the ante with their fries, this for sure will have crowds coming in for more. All in all, a great Burger Quest experience and another addition to my list.  Buen Provecho, Viviana"}
{"text":"Went to Marben for a Sunday night birthday dinner. Thank God Buca was booked because I would have never found this gem! I called 20 mins before to see if I could get a spot and was reassured that their were spots available! Phew!   Marben situated on Wellington stands out. I loved the decor very nice, low lighting, loved the open view of the kitchen. Seeing the chefs do their stuff is awesome.  The staff was friendly and knowledgable about the menu and they should be as the menu is quite small but this is also because  the menu does change frequently. I decided to order the Crab and Scallop Ravioli and it was amazingly delicious!! Very rich in flavour but surprisingly very light. It was such a refreshing dish.   My companion got John's Burger and I have to say that's the best burger I've ever tasted (sorry Holy Chuck)! When I go back I'm definitely getting the burger. Overall this place was excellent! One of the best dinners I've had. Next time I'll get the dessert they must serve up a mean milk and cookies dessert!"}
{"text":"Marben! An incredible example of true Canadian cuisine! Service A+, atmosphere is very intimate. Great spot to cozy up in the fall, winter and on the patio in the summer. Food is awesome, super tasty, huge portions! Good selection of Canadian wines. Number 1 date spot in the city! If you want to impress go to Marben!"}
{"text":"Had a company party in the private section downstairs.  Excellent food, from appetizers through to dessert.  Portions are small.  Presentation very nice.  The owner gave our party excellent attention and was professional and personable.  He gets it.  Followed up the party with drinks upstairs.  Well-stocked bar.  Very cool atmosphere.  Great scene to see and be seen."}
{"text":"oh PUUHHLEESE. this place is SOOO overpriced, and SOOOO extremely overrated. who goes here and honestly gives it 5 stars? Family style my arse hole. went here for a \"family\" style dinner with a family of 8.  we got a great recommendation to go so we were really excited to eat here. in order to feed even HALF of the table you have to order 2 of everything you order. which is about one sliver of meat, or crab ball, a person. Just everything about this place screams annoying. The nice \"family style\" dinner turned out to be almost 600 dollars by the end of the evening..and that was with everyone ordering 1 drink each, and a few of us having coffee with dessert. (one star for the french toast bread pudding) We came, we saw, we spent. Never again. If you are looking for family style DO NOT GO HERE. I don't care how trendy you want to be. Move on. OH and if you love to get RICK-ROLLED mid meal...by all means you probably will like this place. music selection sucked."}
{"text":"Love the chicken sandwich - probably the best in the city. Also, the burger is pretty special.  Staff is usually great, although can be slow sometimes at lunch."}
{"text":"Visited for a Sunday brunch birthday there was about 30 of us. Other than us there was maybe 4 other people in the restaurant. It's a cute hidden spot that isn't too pricey. Where we were seated we were able to see the cooks prepare our food which was nice. I got the John burger I believe it was called. The burger was average but the ribs on top was perfection. The fries however were extremely salty."}
{"text":"Me, my brother and my father all had the burger and oysters and all agreed it was very good!  There is a nice patio out front and didn't actually see the inside. The service was friendly and relaxed.  The price was quite reasonable for the quality of food.  Would go back."}
{"text":"I have been to Marben several times for dinner and have never been disappointed! When you walk in the ambiance is relaxing and intimate, the patio has a great view of the Toronto Sky line. The staff are warm and welcoming.  This is the perfect place for a first date or to celebrate an special occasion. They have a great array of fresh ingredients and some innovative dishes. The top dishes I've had so far are:   Tiramisu Foie Gras Tequila Ceviche Cones Grilled Octopus glazed in Blood Orange (Best Octopus I've had to date)  Go in for dinner tonight and I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had to do it; I had to try their burger again to see if it was as good as I remembered it.  It's come up a lot in conversation recently as a candidate for the coveted title of \"best burger in Toronto\", so I gave it an order.  And for $27 (including tax and tip), it's a pretty expensive burger.  I had it carved up into 4 pieces (each about two bites) and I realized that each bite I was taking was about $3... not a cheap burger by any standard.  It was good.  The aged cheddar melted on the burger definitely added a nice taste...but I couldn't get over the price and I don't quite think it lived up to my memory.  Oh well.  I still really like Marben and often drop by here on Friday or Saturday nights.  Their server staff are really cool and friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Was at Marben's basement resto, bavette, on Saturday night. We were about a party of 40 people and we had a fixed-price dinner. Not sure if everyone has access to it or if it's special for big groups. Started out with raw oysters (yum), then you have a choice - I got a charcuterie plate, which was lovely, though I heard that the soup was also delicious. Then they have burgers that are quartered, and then a choice of a main - I went with duck leg confit and it was just fantastic. Crispy skin, juicy and fall-off-the-bone meat. I can't remember what vegetables it came with because the duck was just so good! Then dessert, choice of either an massive chocolate ice cream sandwich (very dense, brownie-like sandwich part) or a deconstructed apple pie, which is what I had. It was tasty but it came with a mound of cheesecake-flavoured ice cream, and I don't norrmally like cheesecake, so that was too bad. Service, given our large size, was quite good, although they didn't come around to fill our water glasses as much as I would have liked them to. Also, the quartered burgers arrived after our mains did, so no one really wanted to eat them. We left probably around 11, so I can't comment as to whether it turned into a good bar. But I liked the food, so I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have dinner here before heading to the bar - The Cloak.  This is a lovely restaurant owned by Mary and her husband John (last name has Ben in it, hence the name of the restaurant- Marben).  This place bills itself as a nod to British hospitality per their website.  We had a table at the back where you can see the chefs preparing the food so that was nice.  I always enjoy open kitchens because it's so fascinating to me to watch people cook.  While we were hungry we weren't starving and the apps looked more interesting to us than the mains so we decided to order a few of the apps and share.  We had the oysters; fried cauliflower; trout and the aged beef carpaccio.  Everything was fresh and delicious- the cauliflower was nice and crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside- not overlooked or mushy - these little bites were addictive:)  The trout was fresh and light - perfect when you don't want something heavy.  The taste of the fish shone through the other ingredients (beers, horseradish etc) which was nice.  Service was friendly and everyone answered the questions we had with patience.  I'd definitely come back to see what their brunch is all about."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto not too long ago for work.  My first visit to the city.  And wow, the restaurants, quality, service, etc. made one amazing impression.  On the first night, kicked things off with Marben.    It was an amazing 77-80 degrees outside, so definitely opted for the patio.  Enjoyed a couple of excellent cocktails, started off with the Beef Tartare, which was delicious, but let's get down to it...the burger!  John's Burger - $18  Branston Pickle, Braised Ribs, Aged Cheddar, Coleslaw, Fries  It has my name, the burger literally demanded I order it!  This is flat out one of the best hamburgers I have ever had.  It was perfect and unique in every way.  And what the @#$%, it has braised ribs in the middle of it.  It is just flat out incredible.  When I have dreams about hamburgers this burger is in the dream every single time! Ok, I went to far, I don't have dreams about hamburgers, but if I did, I'm sure it would be there.    So top things off with incredible service and my first restaurant experience in Toronto gets one of my extremely rare Five Star Yelp awards.  From beginning to end, the experience was great, and I can't recommend it enough.  And to give credit where credit is due, a big thank you to Toronto Life for the below review from their 25 Best Burger list.  This is what started my all day hourly rant and rave to my coworkers that we had to go to Marben the first night there, and then concluded with my all day hourly rant and rave to my coworkers about how great it was the day after.  Check out Marben now!  \"In-house butcher Ryan Donovan breaks down a whole side of beef from Dingo farms in Bradford. Then chef Misha Nesterenko braises the short rib and neck, shreds the meat and blends it with the lesser cuts. He drapes the patties with sharp cheddar and adds sweet-and-sour Branston pickle. Extra napkins are essential for sopping up the juices from your chin. $18.\"  Source - http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/from-the-print-edition-daily-dish/2012/05/16/25-best-burgers/attachment/tlburgers2012_2/"}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to Me, Happy Birthday to Me, Happy Birthday to meeee, Happy Birthday to me :)  What a pleasant surprise to see that this restaurant right by my soon-to-be-home was the location of my surprise party, planned by S :). As I walked in, there was this long table with familiar faces... boyfriends of my roomates...  and then I see them - MY ROOMMATES from university.... it's hard enough to get all of us in the same place and for all of them to be here was truly wonderful!  Another bonus - all their food here is sourced locally and their menu changes based on what their suppliers / friends give them... which is awesome! Known to be a place of sharing, we all shared several appetizers and also each got our own dish as a main.  The bread was fresh with a dipping sauce tasting like maple syrup. We had run out and the waitress said she was going to bring us more.. but it never happened. Oysters were 3.50 / piece supplied by Rodney's Oyster House in Toronto, and also sourced locally.... So i am a bit of a seafood snob and didn't think this oyster would live up to my expectation.. but prove me wrong.... nah that didn't happen. The oyster was pretty small and didn't have any plumpness to it. The cucumber mignonette was too bland imo, as I like the usual vinegary taste that adds a bit of bite.  The sharables included the gnocchi - top of mind because I thought it was delicious.. it was chewy and puffy, different from what it seems to be the usual buttery and lightly friend gnocchi. They reminded me of little pillows, which is what I think they should be. Although starchy, it did not feel heavy at all.  The beet salad was actually an orange/pink beet which was very refreshing..... the shredded asparagus with fresh cheese was okay, with the asparagus as the hidden element becuase the pieces were too fine, and had lack of taste. The cheese however, was nice and creamy... but i was hoping for more asparagus. We got some softshell crab to share, which was nice - good to have a little crunch in your meal. I'm cannot judge whether it was done well or not because I do not usually eat it by itself (but in sushi), but overall it tasted pretty good.  For the main - I had the duck with kale and puree of some sort.. if I remember correctly... it was seasoned nicely.. the meat felt a little tough - not sure if that's how they cook it, or if that is just Ontario meat? It was still very tasty. Everyone else also raved about the other dishes, including the burger, jerk chicken (which could use more heat), and the gnocchi once again.   Little did I know, S ordered dessert for everyone which included a very large portion of Chocolate ice cream sandiwiches - there are two in one plate .... definitely enough for two people and comes with chocolate and vanilla sauce. I'm not sure what was so special about it as I found it to be a typical chocolate ice cream sandwich. I was excited to try the apple bread pudding (you know... me and my apple pie). I'm not sure if the bread is supposed to be fluffy or light or heavy and saucy, but mine was definitely on the heavy side.. not warm... is it supposed to be? There was a dollop of rich rich marscapone cheese which had both sweet and pinches of saltiness to it... it was very delicious, but cannot eat the whole thing. I didn't want to waste as everyone was so full so I ate more dessert than I could handle!  I have to say that the food was great and so was the company. as much as the server was really nice and patient... there was also a lack of service. Our water glasses were never filled and no one ever came to check on us. We were supposed to get more bread, but it never came. The service between servers was very inconsistent. I'm guessing this is how the friday night service works?  Come for the food, don't be in a rush. Enjoy your company. I will be back."}
{"text":"Nutella creme brûlée is heavenly. This is my go to spot for drinks and desserts in this neighborhood. Great ambience and good service"}
{"text":"Came here for the pig roast (every last sunday of the month) and was very pleased. For $25, you get a plate of pig roast (moist, juicy, flavourful) plus 2 sides. We thought it was a great deal and were all stuffed by the end! The sides we chose were all really delicious too. The baked squash with leeks and kale were the two sides that were the highlights. We also finished the meal off with a great panna cotta and creme brulee. mmm"}
{"text":"Went for brunch one day. Didn't have the YOLO feeling so we opted for regular priced brunch.  Really good service. Was really quiet.   What we ate:  Steaksky and hatch: pretty good, organic duck eggs are a nice change. Enjoyed this dish.   A bird is a bird dude: not bad, but not too memorable.  One day i'll be back for the $450 YOLO if I win lottomax! See pic for YOLO."}
{"text":"Best scallops ever.  Went for dinner on a Saturday night, we had reservations and it was quite full. We had scallops for an app and I had them in my mushroom risotto.  They were a good size and they were perfectly cooked!  The mushroom risotto was also amazing on it's own."}
{"text":"Have been to Marben a few times before tonight and loved it (except for brunch). We visited for Winterlicious and I ordered the Sweet Potato & Apple Soup, Duck Egg & Ricotta Ravioli and finished with the Hazelnut Cheesecake. All tasted very good except for the fact that I got only 3 pieces of ravioli for my entree! That was very disappointing. Other than this, the atmosphere is great at Marben, service is very friendly and helpful and food is mostly always on point. Would recommend more for your average day dinner, but not for Winterlicious."}
{"text":"A warm, cozy, dim lit space.  I ordered the Smoked Beetroot Risotto with Scallops. 2 large scallops, a little charred taste, medium rare inside. The risotto is a bright red from the beet, but doesn't taste like beets. Creamy but not too heavy, with bits of tomato and dark chocolate (couldn't taste/see?). I liked it but wish it was warmer."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks during the week at around 530/6.  It wasn't busy and able to get a table right away.   Service from his place was top notch.  But then again I think we were the only ones here at first :)  but still.  The waiter i think was the bartender also, knew his drinks.  Ordered a few types, all were on point.  I am always very picky on my cocktails, so i was impressed.  Food was good.   Ordered a dozen oysters from out east.  Oysters were standard prices from restaurants (3 bucks a piece) even though these are the same buck a suck variety.   The shallot and vinaigrettes was pretty damn good though.  I had the burger and was very suprised it was cooked medium (I love my burgers Medium, and it seems most places in Canada just bring out medium well to well).  So was super happy about that.  Fries were meh.   My date had the Beef bourguignon?  I found it a bit fatty though.  If i could i would have given this 3.5 stars.  Service 5 Stars Cocktails 5 Stars Food 3 Stars"}
{"text":"I have been to Marben twice: once for dinner and once for brunch. For dinner I ordered the infamous Marben burger and was seated downstairs with my group. Upon entering, the woodsy, rustic-chic decor is fitting for the meat-driven menu, but the downstairs seating area, unfortunately, is so dimly lit that you lose site of it. The burger was pretty good and so were the apps, but their special ice cream cookie was a bit of a letdown. It just wasn't that special.  I decided to return for brunch since it seems to pop up on many lists amongst the best brunch places in the city. It's a very egg-heavy brunch menu, and as someone who doesn't really like eggs, I am maybe not the best person to judge it. However, the brunch I did order, less the eggs, was pretty disappointing. The \"bacon\" was more like a chunk of pig fat and its accompaniments were pretty bland.   I won't refuse an invitation to go back, but I don't think I'll be returning on my own accord anytime soon."}
{"text":"Always great service and wonderful food.  We had a great time, thanks!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about Marben so we finally made the trip. I am a big fan of their neighbor, Le Select and I went there with friends on a thursday. The decor is great and we ordered the famous john's burger, the lamb tagine, the tuna -avocado app and the duck. The burger was tender and decent but I wouldn't put it in the same caliber as Burger Priest, Harbord Room, Habits, Queen and Beav et all. I tried the lamb but it didn't really jump out at me as anything special although the tagine was very decent. The duck was good although it reminded me more of chinatown duck than a bistro duck dish. Still very good and my friend who ordered it said it was very filling.  The cocktails were great, especially the chili pepper infused gin n' juice.  Service was great and we got the chef's table overlooking the kitchen but maybe it was because they weren't that busy? Either ways, we were content.  Overall verdict: while no single dish blew me away, it was still decent value for money and worth a second visit. Definitely a place you can take a date though."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends for Summerlicous 2015. Two of us ordered the Mackerel Escabeche and the other two ordered John's Burger for our main.  Definitely try the burger! The patty is really juicy and flavourful, while the fries are fried and salted perfection.   On the other hand, the mackerel was a disappointment. It was dry and too sour/salty. Props to how management handled it. We mentioned it to our server after she asked how the meal was. She said she'd mention it to the chef.  Afterwards when our bill arrived, they mentioned that the manager took off 25% for the mackerels.  We did not have the intention of asking for any sort of compensation, but rather to just inform the restaurant about it. Despite the mishap with that dish, the service was great. I feel like I picked the wrong items.   For the dessert, I got the Dark Chocolate Brownie cardamom crème fraiche. The brownie tasted like the packaged bite sized brownies, nothing too impressive.   I would still give Marben a chance in the future, so for now it gets three stars."}
{"text":"Great selection of microbrews. The fish tagine is amazing. They cook it with quinoa instead of couscous, which is unusual, and use tomatoes in the sauce, which is also unusual. Perfect if you've got a gluten problem, in other words. The service is excellent. Washroom is on the same floor, but there are lots of steps into the restaurant, so it's not wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"I couldn't help but walk into Marben feeling excited and anxious for the meal to come, as the place boasts an almost incredible number of positive reviews on this site.  We arrived around lunchtime on a rainy Saturday and the place was hopping, so we were definitely quite pleasantly surprised when we were shown to a spacious booth.  The service was super slow, but the menu does contain a warning that the small kitchen can't handle too many orders at once, so it wasn't really a big problem for us.  I decided to order the Fry-Up (\"two sunny eggs, sage & apple banger, bubble and squeak hash, cremini mushrooms, baked beans, roasted tomato, sourdough toast, orange marmalade\") because I was curious to see how such an acclaimed restaurant would handle such a common dish.  Not too well, it turns out.  The presentation was fine, if a little spare. And most of the components were prepared competently enough, although the egg yolks were a little overdone (i.e. there was hardly any runniness). The baked beans were edible but too sweet and kind of tasteless, the soggy mushrooms tasted like they came out of a can, the sourdough toast was way, way too crispy, and the sage & apple banger, though tasty, was almost comically tiny.  The bubble and squeak hash was easily the highlight, ultimately. I'm not sure exactly what was in there, but it was pretty delicious.  Look, I cleaned my plate but when I'm paying $18 for such a simple breakfast, I expect more than just competence. So color me baffled by Marben's sterling reputation."}
{"text":"marben highlights:  * the charcuterie board. ours came with some kind of sausage in the middle -- i didn't catch the description, but it reminded me of kielbasa, albeit much larger in diameter. pleased my polish heart. (the duck rillette: also fantastic.)  * the lobster guacamole. it's just a solid app.  * the mushroom risotto (which i topped with a scallop). heavy on the truffle, which i consider a positive.  * the \"john's burger,\" which i did not order and caused serious food envy when my friend's was delivered to our table.  * friendly service and a clean bathroom with a very  cool, deep metal sink that i wanted to climb into.  i'd go back."}
{"text":"On June 2nd Friday last week, I made a reservation (8pm) to visit the restaurant once again for my 4th time.  The first time I was there was about 4 years ago for a friend's Birthday.  Food and Service were great, and truly loved the overall ambience as well.  I then decided to go back a couple more time throughout 2014-2016.   When we went last Friday for dinner for a friend's Birthday (June 1st), we had a party of 8, and decided to take the patio table.  The initial server was great but around 8:30pm, when everyone arrived and we were ready to order our food the service went down hill.  As we were ordering, there were two other tables were seated.  While we were waiting for our food,  we noticed that our drinks were taking a long time but could not find our first server to check on our drinks.  In addition, we also noticed the both tables that came after us, started to get their food before us (one table was a group of 6 who ordered same items as our table).     After over an hour and 15 minutes of waiting for our food, I asked the new server about our order. He explained that there was some mix up.  From what I saw, it seemed that the table of 6 that was seated and ordered after us, were given priority (given the items that were ordered were the same as our table) and were given preferential treatment.   When our food finally arrived,  the new server said, \"don't worry, we have a surprise for you guys\" but to be honest, I had already arranged at the time of reservation that this was a birthday dinner for a friend and the dessert reallly was not a surprise - it was expected...  Based on past birthdays that I had attended, the dessert did not make up for the poor service as it was already arranged with the hostess.  Food was definitely not as good as how it used to be.  The lights under our canopy were not lit, food took too long, the service is underwhelming.    After disappointment was communicated, the least that could have been done was to take off the 18% gratuity as I did not feel that this experience warranted any gratuity. Unfortunately, I will no longer be recommending or going back to Marben.  The other 7 people who were also there with me will also no longer be going back or recommending Marben as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience; cf. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/marben-toronto#hrid:aN7DH9JdCMq-gvadNgMMig  However, I will deduct a half-star as our long table was broken up by a mighty wooden post. Coulda done without the post."}
{"text":"Suggest getting to this place early if you want to take in the front patio. Sun hides rather quickly behind the building if you're a stickler for that sort of thing.  Definitely try the oysters--they serve it with this awesome cucumber mignonette. Completely new way of eating oysters (at least for me).   Venison was good, although it could have been better if accompanied by a side of some sort (apart from just beets and greens).  Mac & Cheese was delish and the rabbit was a great touch.   A little on the pricey side but enjoyable locally sourced food."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for drinks & food on the patio one Sunday afternoon after hearing wonderful things about Marben. It certainly didn't disappoint!  The patio is nice and quite pretty, and by the afternoon the sun is setting behind the building, so you won't be roasting in the heat.  The menu is the smallest menu I've ever seen, and if you're not feeling too adventurous (like me) you may just stick to the burger or fries. I opted for the fries, and was immensley surprised by how good they were. For the price, the portion was quite large, and they tasted incredible. My friend ordered a tuna dish & let me try a piece. It was good, not dry or overcooked, but her portion was farily small considering the price.  To drink, I ordered the Dark & Stormy. It was delicious as well, and I will definitely be back to try out some of their other cocktails and to order those fries again!  Service was also good. Very prompt, polite, and helpful. They do not split the bill however, so if you're dividing the cost between two or more people, you might was to bring cash."}
{"text":"Overall it was a very good experience. When I arrived, both host and waiter were both attentive to my needs. The food took a bit longer (and we were the only ones in the restaurant at that time) but I enjoyed my Johns' burger very much. They gave us complimentary mayo for our French fries. :) the decor was very beautiful and clean. I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was hip and cool. The music a little loud and the lights a little dim, but we were there late after a long road trip.  We both had cocktails-- mine a bit bitter and his not worth writing home about.  My quinoa salad was delicious.  Our kids' meals-- burgers and ravioli yummy.  The Brussels sprouts were flecked with pork which I had to send back but they fixed it.  My risotto was tasty.  Staff was polished and attentive.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed nice service and the fresh tuna. However, benches on the patio could be replaced with chairs but then the would need to decrease number of seats. What's the point to come to a quite pricey restaurant and share a table with strangers?"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday and two of us sat on the patio. It was a windy day but for some reason, their patio blocked the wind and provided a comfortable outdoor brunch experience! It wasn't busy at all, inside the restaurant was empty and everyone sat out on the patio. We had made reservations anyway just in case.  The servers were knowledgeable and very friendly. Mimosas had just the right amount of champagne and juice, so it wasn't too sweet nor was the alcohol too strong.  We ordered the Spanish omelette and The Mexican Hangover. Both were tasty and a good amount for a light brunch. However, nothing too special.  The bill came to $54 before tip, so I thought it was quite pricey for a couple of egg dishes, but that's expected when you're in the area.  The menu isn't extensive and it's very simple. I think I would like to try other brunch restaurants near by first before returning again."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for Marben's Winterlicious menu.  - Food 3/5 - The food was average in my opinion. We all had the Sweet Potato Roasted Apple Soup which was the highlight for me. My main was the Short Rib which was totally average in my opinion. One of my friends got the Ravoli and finished it in literally 3 bites. It wasn't particularly good according to her. Dessert was good but nothing memorable. - Service 4/5 - Service was good, we had a great time with our server and she (being new) tried to help us with drink recommendations and was very friendly. - Atmosphere 3.5/5 - Atmosphere was classy and nice.  Overall, I will likely not visit again in the near future."}
{"text":"I was told by one of my foodie friends that this used to be his fave resto before Carl Hendrich left to open Richmond Station.. which I now want to visit after being disappointed by Marben :(  Marben's menu changes regularly so I can't find the names of the dishes we ordered anymore - but the app we ordered was a salad with fennels and greens, and a delicate duck egg sitting in the middle.  It was an interesting dish - for the lack of a better word because I had more fun poking at the egg and trying to eat it with my salad than how much I actually enjoyed the taste of the salad itself.     For our mains, we had the grilled octopus and John's Burger.  The burger didn't have anything special to it, I wasn't a particular fan of the burger nor the patty.  The octopus was fairly delicious with the artichoke chips and overall stood out to me more than the burger.  Also should note the portions are small.  We decided to forgo dessert here after the not so memorable apps and mains.    Not sure if I'd revisit even though the decor is quite beautiful and I loved the ambiance. Maybe if something new pops up on their menu, it's a resto for a special occasion but not one for foodie ventures"}
{"text":"I came here for a family dinner since it was one of the few places we could find that is open on Sunday nights. The place is really cozy and the food was hearty and perfect on a cold winter's night. I had a delicious veggie soup and I had to try the burger which multiple people have recommended, and it did live up to its reputation. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something in the sauce they put on the burger that was really interesting and different, almost sweet. The service was relaxed and personal -- the chef even came by to ask how our dishes were. We sat near the back of the restaurant, close to the open kitchen, where we could see people actually making the burger patties by hand.  Great vibe and atmosphere - they were playing lots of Canadian indie bands. The perfect place to enjoy excellent food in a laid-back environment."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to try out their Winterlicious menu. Not sure if I was just hungry but I felt that the food actually tasted pretty good. I tried the Sweet Potato and Roasted Apple Soup, Albacore Tuna, and Hazelnut Cheesecake for dessert.  Overall I enjoyed the Sweet Potato and Roasted Apple Soup which was kind of sweet and tasted almost like a puree. The Albacore Tuna was pretty good as well. I liked how the outer edges were cooked and the inside was more raw and soft like sashimi. It actually tasted pretty good. As for the Hazelnut Cheesecake, it was just okay. Not much hazelnut flavour and not too dense but it was still good.  I loved the warm cozy atmosphere and the waitress was friendly and helpful. The booth seats are pretty comfortable as well. Overall I would rate this place 3/5 and would come back again"}
{"text":"My new go-to neighborhood restaurant. And i'm not just saying that because I live literally around the corner. I don't just recommend it every time a friend suggests we meet up - brunch or dinner, because it is around the corner.  Disclosure: I live around the corner. I've also been there 6 times in 2 months. I almost went again tonight.  But it is really really good food. Everything comes from local farms, and they make their own bread and even CHURN THEIR OWN BUTTER. All I can say is.. I ask for 2 helpings of bread and butter each time because I love it!  For brunch, they do a great traditional brunch (eggs, bacon, salad, potatoes), but everything is just a little bit better. Their \"bacon\" is crispy pork testina - crispy juicy pork fat wrapped around pork meat... that melts in your mouth! Their potatoes is their fries Kennedy - delicious herb fries stacked into little neat rounds.   I also really enjoy their dinner - they are all small plates for sharing, and range from $9 to about $18. Their pork belly - OMG. Even better than the testina - melt in your mouth goodness. And i'm the girl that normally gives away my tendon at PHO - even my mouth waters at the thought.  I also really loved their heirloom tomato salad and Marcus' Mushroom Fricassee - little bits of pasta sauteed in mushrooms. It has a rich woodsy flavour finished off with some crunch - that's the hazelnuts.  Anyways, the food is solid, the price is right (for a girl like me, a single dish would be enough, which is under $20), service has always been great (servers are friendly and knowledgeable), it's a very nice trendy place with a great patio, AND it's around the corner. Nothing less than 5 stars!  Give it a try next time you're in the neighborhood and support your local farms!"}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch and ordered John's Burger and Evan's Bread Pudding French Toast.  John's Burger ($17) came with fries and a coleslaw. The braised ribs in the burger was very juicy and tender. It didn't come with any toppings such as lettuce or tomatoes, which was fine because it was delicious on its own. The fries were very crispy and for shoestring fries lovers, you'll love Marben's fries. The coleslaw was also good but I think there was a bit too much vinegar taste to it. Nonetheless, it was good.  The real reason why I came here was for the Bread Pudding French Toast ($9). I really enjoyed the French toast! This is definitely a dish to split with a friend because it's very sweet.  If I ever come here for brunch again, it'll definitely be for the Bread Pudding French Toast and not so much for the burger (I'm not a burger fan, to be honest, I'm happy with fast food burgers).  I think the service and atmosphere were very nice so I'll probably come here for dinner one day."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner Able to get reservations on the same day, which was great  I wasn't too hungry so I decided to try some different sharing platters -  had some oysters (delish!), the bread platter and the cheese platter and we decided to share the duck main  everything was super tasty and the service was very attentive we did have a few different servers but I was fine with that... someone would check on us regularly, refill water, ask if we need anything  one guy in particular was very nice and knowledgeable - told us what type of oysters we were having, explained a few different things we asked about and was just really pleasant and helpful  we had a really enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Marben for two, service was extremely attentive. Sat at the chef's table and the chef was very knowledgeable and in good humor. Food was excellent, from the appetizers to the dessert. I would return for sure, excellent value."}
{"text":"Nice place... Love the woodwork and they have outside seating. Wine selection is just OK, but the food totally makes up for it. I had the pork and the mushroom burrata. Great flavors. Nice local spot and great for date night"}
{"text":"Gord and I were in the area yesterday and stopped in at Marben for a drink.  We'd never been there before.  It was really warm in there ... too bad the patio wasn't open or at least have the windows open to let some air in.  They only have three beer on tap (Muskoka Brewery).  I ordered a cream ale and Gord ordered and IPA.  They weren't very cold at all ... not refreshing.  I like beer but didn't like mine so gave a lot of it to Gord ... that's when we realized that I had been drinking the one he ordered (he likes a hoppier beer).  No wonder I didn't like it.  I'd asked for a glass of water and got a small glass (3/4 full) of room temperature water and no ice.  It's a cute spot, though.  The bathroom was funky.   All in all, I wasn't crazy about this place and won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Great food at a great looking restaurant, just the service is a bit lacking...  Went here for Summerlicious on Sunday for dinner with a group of friends, and I had actually encouraged the choice because of how much I enjoyed the \"John's burger\" during my other visits at the restaurant (Winterlicious 2015) - as it was one of the top burgers in the city from an article I read a year or so ago.   From the outside, the restaurant had renovated to become much more accessible compared to its previous setup, and it looked like a nice place to sit and eat had it not been so humid this past weekend.   I ordered the Mezze Platter to start, followed by the John's burger, and ending with the Dark Chocolate Brownie. I decided to pair my burger (or at least I thought I'd be able to pair it together) with one of their craft beers on tap (forgot the name, but the server recommended it as I was looking for Creemore...) This is where the experience starts to go downhill for my group.   The appetizers arrived fairly on time - within 10min or so of ordering, with the drinks coming a bit earlier. The platter with its flat bread and humus were good - a touch on the salty side personally - but not overly salty. Two pieces were perfectly cooked, however the third piece of bread was definitely overcooked and much more on the crispy side, almost like a slightly overcooked thin crust pizza.   Then the wait. Oh the wait...   We arrived at 630 for our reservation, served with our appetizers by 650ish, but the mains did not arrive until almost 8PM! Almost a whole HOUR had gone by from when we finished our appetizers until we received our main dishes (which were all burgers by the way), and we were only told once, maybe 10 minutes before the food arrived, that \"Sorry folks, your food is coming in a minute\". The restaurant was not even close to being packed, as there were empty seats around, and there looked like only one or two other larger parties than us.   I mean the burger was amazing - juicy, cooked medium rare, soft with the right amount of toppings (if you hate pickled anything, DON'T skimp on them - they taste amazing!) and the fries were flavoured so nicely, but the patties seemed smaller than the last time I had them (during winterlicious). In addition, the wait just KILLED the whole experience! I wasn't even eating it slowly to enjoy the flavours anymore, I was just eating the burger because I'd been starving.   The brownie was nothing special either... it reminded me of those two bite brownies you'd get at Loblaws but with a slightly darker chocolate. The berries and the mint paste were a nice subtle addition, but it wasn't spectacular.  In retrospect one of my friends and I regret getting the Summerlicious menu, and probably should've just opted for the burger on its own (which is $19 if I remember correctly vs the $35 for the summerlicious menu) as we could've done away with our apps and desserts had we known they'd be a bit lacking.   My first visit - a non \"Licious\" day - was probably my favourite experience at Marben, and I'd like to give the restaurant another shot simply because of that experience alone. The last two licious visits have not been so kind - especially on the service side - but I'm hoping it can be turned around sooner than later."}
{"text":"I tried Marben this year for Winterlicious 2015 and came for lunch. Everything was delicious and service was very attentive (probably due to the small amount of diners present at the time).   We started off with appetizers:  * PEI mussels in lemongrass and chorizo * smoked potato and celeriac soup  * manchego cheese and apple salad  I thoroughly enjoyed the steamed mussels which came in an extremely sizable portion. The broth had the right amount of spice although the chorizo pieces were small. The soup and salad didn't disappoint either. The soup was creamy though the smokiness made it taste a little like bacon.   For mains, all of us went for their John's Burger. I know this is also part of their permanent menu and I cannot recommend it enough. It came sliced in half and was just melt-in-your-mouth delicious with a little sweetness, complimented with the melted cheese. The only let down were the fries which came as little nubs of potatoes.   For dessert, we had:  * nutella creme brulee * vanilla panna cotta  The creme brulee was basically just nutella cream since it was under-cooked with a very thick crust. It was still tasty but the toasted sugar top layer was way too thick and scraped the inside of my mouth. I didn't sample the panna cotta but the verdict was positive from my friend."}
{"text":"This is probably more like a 2.5.    Cheese plate: Nothing out of the ordinary and I hesitate to give too many points to something I could put together at my own house (if I wasn't too lazy to go shopping, that is)  Lamb: Cooked to the appropriate doneness but very stingy portion for the price (it isn't East Side Mario's so I'm not expecting an entree so bit that it should be on a serving platter, but this was pretty tiny compared to similar restaurants with similar price points)  Creme brulee: Amazing, with just the right amount of lavender not to taste weird and soapy.  I thought the raspberry sorbet was a really weird pairing with lavender though, and I would probably not order it again on that basis.  Service: Terrible.  It took approximately 20 minutes to get a drink and 45 minutes to get our entrees (the latter of which resulted in free dessert).  Also, our entrees were brought out at completely different times (long enough for the first person to get quite cold).  I probably won't be back.  There are too many restaurants that I like much better in the city or haven't tried yet.  I especially wouldn't come back again in the winter.  It was intolerably cold at my table."}
{"text":"Only so-so. Lovely decor and decent food but the whole experience felt a little rushed and uneven. For a nice dinner out, you really want to be able to feel relaxed during your meal. Wait staff kept interrupting us mid-conversation and then shifting away while we were still responding to their questions. No rudeness intended I'm sure---I got the feeling that they are just spreading themselves too thin. Speaking of which, the menu in the restaurant is NOT the same as the menu listed on the website. It is smaller and the dishes are completely different. It's not that hard to keep the online menu updated, and it makes a real difference to the customer. The food and drinks were good but not outstanding. The decor and ambience were probably the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants with a seasonal menu. Everything is delicious and the service is attentive. I enjoyed the extensive wine menu and locally sourced meats and vegetables. A must visit in Toronto"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time at Marben, but it came highly recommended. The space is super cute with a casual vibe. The outdoor space is really nice with lots of flowers and greenery, and the interior had lots of rustic wood and unique found items. Our server/bartender was Tyler who was super chill, very nice, and accommodating. My favorite part of the drink menu were a list of words you can use to have a custom drink made for you which was really fun.  The food was very fresh, flavorful, and prepared perfectly. I would definitely suggest the charcuterie board, and the burger."}
{"text":"Marben is my neighborhood go-to.  Excellent food.  Excellent service at par with comparable businesses in cities like NY or LA.  Great decor & dining concept.  Staff/kitchen are great with food allergies & dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I love this place. This place is farm-to-table and food is locally sourced; you can really taste the difference in the ingredients.   If you get the chance, ask to sit at the kitchen bar where you'll get to see the  kitchen staff busying themselves (and if you're a nerd like me, you'll start asking them to tell you about what they're doing and more about the food)."}
{"text":"Each year, my one my food highlight is the arrival of Toronto Life's annual Eating and Drinking list.  They comprised a list of the five best gourmet burgers in the city.  Marben's John Burger just happened to make the list.  We were able to grab a table on a Sunday night.  Upon walking into the restaurant, it was less busy then expected.  The vibe was very New York, with the low lighting, and the lit votives encompassing the space.  We started our meal with wine and cocktails, i had the Raspberry Royale, for $10.  The combination of bubbly, chambord, and elder flower was very satisfying.  My one complaint, was that the elder flower was lost in the beverage.  After putting in our order for our entress, we did wait quite awhile four our food, we were glad that we had the cocktails to sip on while we waited.  After finishing our drinks, we had nothing better to do than people watch in the restaurant.  We were slightly put off, after watching the bar tender continuously put bottles to his nose.  I can understand that they are looking out for the customer. They do not want to serve wine that has turned, however the turnover rate of liquor should be high enough to eliminate this concern.   I ordered the John's Burger, which was topped with Branston pickle, and aged cheddar.  One word to sum of the burger was tender, it was lacking any texture. The idea of the Branston pickle is that it is a new and creative way to replace ketchup and mustard, and it was successful.  The picture in the magazine definitely illustrated more cheese than in reality.  The bun was a great vessel for the burger.  I just wish that their was something fresh on the burger to prevent it from being one note.  My sis had the sausage stuffed quail with sweet potato puree.  The quail arrived, and it look and tasted wonderful.  Since quail is traditionally lean, we welcomed the extra fat and flavour provided from the pork.  The puree was velvety and delicious.  One complaint was that that the dish was garnished with crisp shavings of vegetables.  After resting in the puree, the crispness dissipated, and they became soft.   Our server throughout the meal was very friendly and quite informative.  After he left us with the cheque, it was as if he forgot about us.  Our table was directly across the bar, which was where he was stationed.  Not only him, numerous other servers continued to walk by our table with the credit card clearly sitting atop the bill.  One of my biggest pet peeves in a restaurant is to have to ask to pay. Overall, the main reason i came here was to try quote unquote the best burger in the city.  No doubt that it was good, but do i think it deserves that title, probably not."}
{"text":"They had some kind of sausage fest happening where 2 restaurants were competing with each other. Valdez and Caplansky were the ones that night. It was good, but the chorizo was better than the other one.   Their wine choices are great. I had a really nice Gewürztraminer.   Their own food they make is also quite nice but I liked one of the sausages more than the main dish I ordered. I think next time I'll try something different there.   The patio is very nice. A great spot for dinner or lunch on the patio in the summer. I would say that it's romantic. The street isn't busy and it's far from the road it seems, which is nice, or maybe the patio fencing made it feel that way.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here with a few girlfriends and really liked the atmosphere. the staff were super friendly and attentive. The food was good just didn't like how they brought out the main meals tapa style (one at a time) even though they weren't shareable dishes (like a burger or a fish dish)."}
{"text":"For an entertaining night, sit at the chef's table looking into the kitchen. It's better than any foodtv reality show (and alot friendlier)"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there with friends. Pretty good. Had risotto, braised beef, ceviche cones (they are so tiny!) and fritters (presented poorly but tastes okay). Dessert we had creme brûlée (not so good) and their version of cheesecake. Will visit there again but portions are small and pricey. Ambience was a bit dark and sleepy. Music a little too loud sometimes."}
{"text":"Attention burger addicts. The marben burger blows my mind. Take an already delicious tasting burger, and fill it with braised ribs, and top with aged cheddar, served alongside fantastic fries with truffle aioli and, sadly, a forgettable coleslaw. As you take your first bite, a light shines down from above and you know you are entering burger heaven.   I have only been to Marben for lunches, and find the atmosphere relaxed, and friendly. The only gripe I have is that more than once I have succumbed to the idea of blueberry lemonade and then received a very expensive pink lemonade with muddled blueberries that had the distinct hue and taste of my childhood frozen lemonade.    Stay away from the lemonade, go for the burger!"}
{"text":"We were here for Mother's day.  When we first walked in, things looked promising, as the place is very attractive with nice lounge music playing.  But things quickly went downhill.  When we booked online, we received no indication that there would be a set menu.  It turned out there was a set menu for $40 pp.  This included:  1. Two types of bite-size appetizers 2. A selection for a \"main\" from 4 options 3. Two sides for the table (of 4 diners) 4. A dessert 5. A complimentary Mimosa for Mom.  This all sounds good on paper, but was very sad in practice.  All the dishes were tiny and uninspired.  The appetizers were really the size of amuse bouche.  As for the main, the \"Mexican Hangover\" was one single corn tortilla (!) with a little bit of egg (1-2 eggs), some feta cheese (what does feta have to do with Mexican?), and about a teaspoon (!) of guacamole.  The spinach fritatta was about the size of golf ball - I kid you not.  The sides and dessert were equally tiny.  All of the food was quite dull and unexciting.   The service was much below par.  When we asked to change one of the dishes, our request was received with a sour face and \"I'll try my best - I'll see what I can do\".  When the bill came, the only suggested option for tip was 20%.  This place seems like a cash grab and little to no care for the customers."}
{"text":"3.5 for their brunch, rounded up because freshly squeezed orange juice is always a plus.   I had their Benny with peameal bacon. Nothing incredible about their hollandais sauce, nothing wrong with their poached eggs. The peameal bacon was unfortunately a little dry. I enjoyed the salad that came with it, though I'm not really sure what dressing it was. About $20/person after food and drinks, which is okay i guess. My favourite part of this place is the decor though. All the benches and tables seem to be made out of real pieces of logs and the atmosphere is really enjoyable."}
{"text":"My friend and I had brunch here on brunch day (aka Sunday) and we probably wouldn't have gotten in if we didn't make reservations. Like most restaurants on a Sunday around 11:30am, it was very busy.  Our hostess and our waitress were all super friendly, which stood out to us since most busy restaurants lack good service.  We both got a mimosa, mine with orange and my friend's with grapefruit. The grapefruit one was a lot sweeter than the orange which seemed odd since grapefruits are known to be one of the bitter fruits. But still yummy and boozy!   I had The Fry Up, and my friend had the Marben Cobb. They were both good but I would not say they are worth $16 each.  We had two other guy friends join us shortly after, and they had the streak burger and fries. They admitted it was pretty good, but it was $20 and they were still hungry.  I wouldnt go to Marben every Sunday, and I definitely wouldnt take my boyfriend or male friends here. They will leave hungry. But your Instagram girlfriends will love it here because the interior is cute and bright, and mimosas are bomb."}
{"text":"Had the best time. Sat at the bar and met a lovely bartender who made me the best cocktail I have had in a long time. I had the hummus and crumpets for brunch and it was mind blowing. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Terrible food. Nothing close to what it used to be. Paid $20 for clams in dashi broth, tasted very mediocre over salty, lacked flavour, and massive pieces of ginger as garnish was sloppy and not appetizing. $14 fried cauliflower was also very average. Had ordered a main but once we had two bites of the clams I cancelled the main and walked out without finishing that dish. Used to love this place, will not be back"}
{"text":"Normally you can make online reservations for Marben on Opentable, but recently you have to call. Lucky for me that meant they actually had a table 4 days before my event after trying 20 other places. Planned a surprise birthday dinner where we sat at the end of the bar but the way it was set up was actually the perfect amount of space for a table of 7-8.  The ambiance had a homey trendy feel to it and a lot of Edison type lights. The noise level wasn't loud, making it easy to talk to everyone at the table. We had the cauliflower as a share plate and it was delicious. I'm not a spicy fan and despite having chili peppers in it, there weren't enough oils to make it too spicy and it had the perfect crunch. My medium tri-tip was done to perfection with just the right amount of pink and not chewy at all. Everything was very fresh.  The staff were super accommodating with helping with the surprise and not charging us a plating fee to serve our own cake. The service was quick and the bartender kept our drinks rolling in. Everyone had a great time and thorough enjoyed the food and atmosphere. We did get charged a group tax and gratuity fee but we expected it for our group size. Only downside is the single stalled bathrooms but at least they are on the main floor!"}
{"text":"Our mission: conquor the 25 of toronto life's best burgers.  Marben: spot # 2 on the list.  the item: John's burger.  Okay straight to the knitty gritty. This thing was very tasty. It was cooked VERY rare that the thign was almost mooing. I really liked this burger but damn couldnt John have had a larger appetite? this thing was SMALL. it came with fries which were nothing special. We also rodered risotto which was no big deal. At the end of dinner we were STILL starving and headed off to conquer anothe rburger on the list at Parts & labour. That review to come.   I would recommend people tryign this burger for the taste of it... but dont expect to be full. maybe order 2. At the price point of 18.00 i expected a mroe decent size.   the E11even burger still is #1 in my books."}
{"text":"Venue - 5 Service - 4 Food - 2  Came here for Summerlicious and sat in the patio area. Upon arrival, our initial thought of the interior space was beautiful, but with perfect sunny weather, we opted for the patio. Now onto the food which is the essence of this review. The food was nothing special and nothing deservingly to note on the execution. The mackerel for the main was terrible. It was really dry/rubbery, salty and overly pickled, which seemed to resonate with the majority of their flavours which we weren't particular fans of. The desserts were very basic and although not terrible in flavor, did not appear very refined. Not sure on their regular menu, but I would not recommend this place for their Summerlicious menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner here over the weekend and I was pleasantly surprised! We got a seat at the patio and our waiter came by with the menu and specials. Service throughout the night was excellent, attentive but not intruding. The decor was typical to what you see in the area. I thought it was really nice, laid-back and casual.    We ordered the crab tartare to start which was delicious. Bright flavours and very fresh. I ordered the octopus salad which was also very good, the octopus was perfectly cooked and the salad was exactly what I wanted to eat that night. My friend had the scallop risotto which he said was pretty good. For dessert we had the Nutella creme brulee which was quite good. Creamy but not too rich with the perfect amount of torched sugar on top. Overall, I was pretty impressed and would come back again. I've heard good things about their brunch so maybe I will come try that next time."}
{"text":"I went to Marben during my very first time in Canada. I think the place is perfectly in line with the atmosphere of the city: nice food and cool people. My best culinary memory of the night is undoubtedly the burger: simply the best I've ever had in my whole life! Definitely a place to recommend."}
{"text":"2.5 star   Telus Tuesday Specials Restaurant #3   I am a little confused... I made a reservations for 7:30 pm for Marben... and ended up some of my guests showing up at 7..and some showing up past 8? And I ended up drinking all the Jennifer's Coronas that my wallet can handle while waiting till 8:30 before I can have my dinner...   This is the only Telus Special restaurants that have a \"Special and Limited and Pricer\" menu. And our waitress assured me that the portions are a little bigger than their regular tapas portions.   I have to tell you their Tapas versions are really small... small in portions but big on prices..   Telus Specials  - Ryan's Charcuterie (free) meh.. Black Hoof's Rule!!  - Marianne's Duck Confit ($23).. only decent choice and waitress' recommendations  - Ervinna's Ice Cream Sandwich (free)... skip go for Warm Apple Pudding!   John's Burger ($17) and Fred's Pork Belly ($12)  - Tapas small size.... and $17!! for a burger..with fries...(now I need to have another drink!) and Pork Belly is like 1 small piece...(great if you are on a low cholesterol diet!)   I feel sorry for my guests.. they were all feeling hungry before, during and after dinner... I didn't feel like a good host... All Marben's fault!   Marben's interesting choice of paintings deco makes the evening's conservations one of the more interesting one I have for awhile.. as how often when guys start talking about waxing?? Brazilian waxing?"}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious. The service was attentive. However, the Rodney's oysters were grainy and not cleaned properly. I've had much much worse in Toronto. Overall, this was a decent meal and we'd go back in a heartbeat.  It's got a great (masculine) vibe and was a good experience for a date night!"}
{"text":"Small gourmet restaurant. Very well located near downtown Toronto. Menu is not extensive, but the quality of everything we tried was great. As an appetizer we had the charcuterie board, and it was outstanding. Nice mix of homemade sausages and pate, along with a couple of types of mustard and pickled beets and cabbage. We also tried the grilled octopus and Moroccan fish fish with quinoa, and they were both very good. To finish off we tried their manchego cheesecake, and it was one of the best desserts I have had recently. Very creative, with an excellent mix of flavors."}
{"text":"What a great resto. Stylishly rustic decor--modern and nostalgic. The smell of maple syrup infuses the place. Staff are welcoming and friendly without being cloying. The food is adventurous and the cocktails are aromatic and superb. Apps were great--food gras tiramisu! The meal was quite good, though the mains were more pedestrian than expected--octopus grill and scallop beet risotto. Still, tasty. Loved my time there. Would go again."}
{"text":"Almost fantastic.  Nice looking place, for sure. Tons of light wood throughout the entire restaurant, good soft lighting, some pretty interesting touches here and there.  Some other reviews mention reservation difficulty: I had no problem getting a reservation through OpenTable for the next day, and they called to confirm it about 4 hours ahead of time. The service from everyone except for our actual server was really solid; she was a bit on the confused & distracted side.  Food: pulled pork croquette, venison ragout, lamb shoulder confit with wild leek tortelloni, and the warm apple pudding.  The pulled pork was very good, not overdone in any way, just a great appetizer with top notch quality ingredients. The ragout was really disappointing and pretty much tasted like Hamburger Helper, and totally not what I expected.  The lamb shoulder confit & leek tortelloni was out of this world. Seared with some sort of cinnamon, clove, cardamom ish spices and with some fantastic tzatziki-like greek yogourt on the top, every bite was amazing. The tortelloni with it was filled with perfectly done leek. Everything about that dish was good.  For dessert, the apple pudding was incredible. Light and almost creamy, not too sweet, with caramel and sea salt on top and then dolce di mascarpone - dolce de leche folded into mascarpone cheese (!) - on top of that.   Excellent wine selection, too, a pretty wide variety of reds perfect for most of the dishes at Marben, including the Niagara red we had.  It was really a 5-star experience, other than the ragout and the server, and they could fix those things and I'd give it five stars in a second.  $150 for two, with a really good bottle of wine and moderate tip."}
{"text":"I booked Marben for a Sunday brunch for my husband's birthday. It started out great but then went down hill. They only had 4 servers for a restaurant of like 200. We had a fixed menu with the first course being baked goods, not made in-house. it took an hour or more to get just those baked goods. It took us another 45 minutes to get our food. And when asked if they could rush the cake at the end (all they had to do was put in on a plate) the kid plating the cake sat there contemplating how to do it for at least 5 minutes. When the lady who made the cake asked if she could plate the cake (which meant just taking out out of the box and putting it on a plate) she was given attitude. So not impressed. This is place used to be a fav but not anymore especially for a party - they clearly can't handle the volume. And we were only 9 people. Also no one needs hipster attitude."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great front patio for the warmer weather! Friendly staff, some items a bit slower than I would have thought to arrive. Good selection of cocktails, we stuck with straight spirits so can't comment on the tastiness of them.  Food was good, however not as flavorful as I would have expected for the price point (we shared the family style chicken meal). The family style plates can feed 3 comfortably, 4 would be a stretch (unless you aren't hungry).  Would definitely come here to hang on the patio in the warm weather, less eager to come back for meals."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great and the service was amazing. The food left something to be desired. The food was good, but not great. It presented well, with nice plating. Had fresh ingredients and locally sourced items, however the lamb I ordered was quite bland and the steak my husband ordered was just ok. For the price, I expected better."}
{"text":"Six-thirty was kind of early for a dinner reservation I thought, but Marben is a fairly popular restaurant. As we checked our coats at the door I couldn't help but notice empty booths and tables in the seating area. \"Good thing we made a reservation,\" I chuckled to myself. When we followed the hostess down some stairs I was confused. Hearing a table full of my friends yell 'surprise' cleared up the matter immediately. How do I keep falling for stuff like this?  Anyway, I visited Marben for the first time on Saturday night and what a night it was. Marben is in a rather weird part of town on that disjointed strip of Wellington St near Portland. Taking a cab seemed like the most sensible option. Once we got their we were treated to a beautiful space. Lots of natural wood, healthy noise level and fairly casual. We were seated downstairs (in the Bavette room) which is a cave-like space with a dedicated bar, dim incandescent lighting, and dark corners. Great place for a party.  Our server was charming and waxed enthusiastic about the menu. As an alternative to ordering à la carte, she offered to have the kitchen assail us with \"a bit of everything\" from the menu. While we recognized the risk of such a proposition, it seemed like a logical choice for a group of about twenty. In hindsight, it was the only choice. A brilliant move.  After inquiring about food allergies and preferences, our server disappeared to load the food cannon. We ate a lot.   They brought out charcuterie boards, fresh oysters, fish cakes, duck fat fries, a crispy sea bass, roasted sunchokes (these were killer), roasted brussels sprouts and buttery gnocchi, generous carvings of their amazing burger, a sausage made of like six different meats, broccoli tempura, spaetzle, slabs of juicy beef, and there was a salad in there somewhere (which I obviously avoided). I was impressed with every bite. Everyone was talking about the smoky beef tongue on the charcuterie board, and the burger was maybe-the-best I've had in the city.  Fabulous dinner.  Obligatory Title Pun: Get 100% of your MARB-ohydrate intake.  Menu Readability: I didn't have it for very long, but I remember good leading and lots of rounded sans-serif.  Need to mention: Since I was treated by friends, the value proposition was high. YMMV.  What this place teaches me about myself: Another year older, another year closer to death. Especially when you eat like I do."}
{"text":"Ordered a John's Burger and a bottle of wine. I didn't tell the waiter I wanted it well done and he didn't ask so I got a medium rare with pink in the middle. Could not eat it or was to grossed out to eat a new one that was thoroughly cooked, which they offered. Still got charged full $20 even thought I just eat the fries and one bite of the burger. Not impressed. Service was good and waiter friendly. Quality does not match price."}
{"text":"Just got home from their Valentine Day dinner.  Only prefixed menu was available. I had the raw tune, grilled scallop on soup, braised beef, and chocolate dessert.  Taste/presentation-4 Portion-2.5 - just right for girls. Another piece of tuna and scallop will do. Dessert-2.5-both chocolate desserts tasted pretty much the same. Class- 2- should tell the customers it was 75$ per head. Market price for v-day in the area. No complaints about the price. Service- 2.5-Got the job done. Always enjoyed this place, will go back on the weekdays."}
{"text":"I went for lunch. $17 for main only, $18.50 for course starter and main. Ok. Quite expensive for lunch.   I don't mind the price if the food is good.  Food was horrific.  John's burger? Overly sweet and buns were toasted in so much butter that it crumbles the minute you touch that. And the size? It should have called John's sliders, not burger. (Size was more like McDonald's reformed quarter pounder size, or a value pick cheese burger size)  Open braised beef broiled something? So disgusting... I think Niagara casino buffet roast beef is better than this!! So bad I want to puke. We wouldn't even get through 75%.... Wtf....   So disappointed, never coming back. Would never recommend to anyone, even to my foes if I got one."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First experience was one of the best dining experiences of my life. The vibe in this place is amazing. Second experience- I found the food not quite as high of standard as my first trip. It's possible they were just having an off night. Would still definitely return."}
{"text":"Chef Rob Bragagnolo (@RobBragagnolo) took over the kitchen of Marben Restaurant (@MarbenResto) about a year ago and completely reinvented the men from a meat centric menu to a Mediterranean version and it's all inspired by his travels from the pass 10+ years.  The brunch menu was no exception, it was a collection of the chef's favorite dishes from his travels around the world  It's our first time back since the change of chef/menu and their mini renovation, so I am very excited to see what they had to offer (see my previous visit here and here).  The space just look brighter and more open with the bare brick wall at the bar (used to be shelves full of alcohol  bottles) with simpler light instead of Manson jars light all around.  This was unplanned for and we just drop by at around 2:00pm and was glad that there was no wait.  Mary's Caesar $12 ~ ginger + cilantro infused vodka, hellfire shrub, Worcestershire, clamato ~ Love how it packed quite some heat while the ginger and cilantro flavor was very subtle but which I could still taste it. Great wake me up on a Sunday.  Burrough Market Duck Hash $15 ~ 2 red wine poached organic duck eggs on a duck confit hash w/ baby spinach ~ Got kale instead of spinach here which I think works even better.  ~ Love every part of this dish, never knew you can poached egg in red wine and it's amazing.  ~ The duck egg was perfectly cook with the perfectly runny yolk, I find that duck eggs has a thicker denser yolk.  ~ And the combination of duck confit, potato and mushroom with the egg yolk was just so perfect together.   Stockholm Syndrome $15 ~ 4 minutes organic hen egg, Lobster crème fraiche, dill, red onion, grainy mustard, celery on toasted flax seed sour dough ~ The toast at the bottom was still pretty crispy which was a surprise in spite of all the creamy lobster goodness on top.  ~ It's a very light and refreshing dish with a very lemony lightly tossed salad.  Verdict : ~ New Space & New Menu which is just as awesome if not better ~ Would love to come back when the patio is open ~ I find the portion to be a bit small, we were so tempted to order a 3rd dish to share ~ And definitely need to come back for the Nutella stuffed French toast"}
{"text":"I came to Marben for their sausage league.  My previous two dining experiences here had been fairly pleasant, but unfortunately, I had some issues with the service this time around.   The menu for the night was significantly different from the online version, and I was rather disappointed because some of the dishes that I wanted to try was no longer on the menu (pulled pork croquette!!!). Although I appreciate that they change their menu frequently, it would be nice if they updated the menu online as well!   Everything came within 2 minutes of the bread's arrival! I wished the wait staff could've given me at least 5 minutes to sample the bread before bombarding me with all the food! However, my mom, who tried a piece later, told me that the bread was not very good at all. She also commented that the dip tasted like Chinese soy sauce.   We shared Julia's butternut squash soup with chantilly, croutons, and sage oil. The soup actually arrived last, after the burger and the two sausage dishes, which didn't really make sense to me. In addition to that, we weren't provided with spoons or a sharing bowl, despite explicitly stating that we planned to share the soup. I guess it wasn't a big deal, but it was slightly annoying. Now, onto the soup itself, which was actually quite delicious. It was creamy and sweet, but not too thick, and I loved that wonderful crunch from the croutons.  From Pizzeria Libretto/Enoteca Sociale, chef Rocco Agostino presented us with the Italian \"chili dog\" with mild fennel sausage, rabbit chili and pickled shallot. I really loved this dish! The sausage was pleasantly sweet and incredibly juicy! The rabbit chili and pickled shallot were great additions, even though I couldn't really distinguish the taste of the rabbit itself. The tangy pickled shallots were particularly refreshing.   From La Palette, we had wild boar Andouille in duck neck confit with Esplette ratatouille, arugula, Cerignola olives and capers. Unfortunately, the Andouille sausage was too dry, although it had great flavour. It tasted great when paired with the ratatouille, but by itself the sausage was awfully dry. I thought that the various components of the dish worked quite well. The arugula salad was lightly dressed and very refreshing, and the duck neck confit was tender and had that wonderfully intense duck flavour. Overall, I really liked the extravagance and creativity of the dish, but the components weren't as well integrated as it could've been. So in the end, I put my vote on the other dish.   Now onto some ranting about the service. Since $25 included a bottle of Steamwhistle, and neither my mom nor I are big fans of beer, I asked if I could take the bottle to go, and our server said she'd asked. She only informed me at the end of my meal that this wasn't possible. I mean, I understand if you won't let me take it home, but at least tell me earlier so I could have it with my meal. Regardless, I didn't want to waste, so I asked to have it anyway. Our server completely forgot about it, and I had to ask for it again while we were getting bill.  After I finally got my bottle of Steamwhistle and the bill, I anxiously waited for the ballot so we could vote! It turned out that our server completely forgot to give us the ballot, and I had to (yet again) ask for it while we were paying the bill. I mean... I thought the whole point of this sausage league event was that we, the diners, get to pick the winners!   There were also other minor issues, like pacing of the dishes, the wine glasses weren't taken away (our table already had no space for all the plates) and the extinguished candle wasn't relit for half the meal. So altogether, I wasn't very happy about the service, even though the sausage league event itself was pretty fun."}
{"text":"Really solid neighborhood restaurant that uses fresh, local food.  The servers were all really friendly and were more than happy to tell me all about the food and make recommendations.  Nice decor too, with house music playing in the background.  Being from Los Angeles, I had to try their charcuterie plate since this is something I specifically came to Toronto for in the first place.  I was really happy to see they had a smaller plate available on their brunch menu and ordered their homemade granola and yogurt as a perfect offset for the saltier cured meats.  Their food did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Every single dish we tried here is excellent, and the decor is interesting and lovely. It is on the pricey side, but justifiable for that special occasion.  We went with 5 people, and so were able to try an assortment of entries - braised beef, the burger, risotto, and seafood ravioli. And two amazing desserts paired with excellent expresso to end the evening.  Only two things kept this from being a 5 star review. The wine list markups are bordering insane. And the service, though attentive at first, petered out as the night wore on.  Too late in the season to take advantage, but the patio looked wonderful - something I'll keep in mind for next summer."}
{"text":"This was probably our fourth time at Marben, having come only for dinner before we decided to try our their weekend brunch as a family. Overall the experience was great.   Ambiance: 4/5 - We had a relatively large group (6 + a 2 year old) so we were seated in a small wrap around booth at the back of the restaurant. The booth gave us a nice amount of privacy as it was nestled behind all the other tables and also offered a great view of the kitchen. The only drawback was that the music seemed quite loud from our table, but the stuff kindly turned it down after we mentioned it.   Service: 5/5 - We had originally asked for a high chair for my niece when making the reservation but the staff had not noted that on the reservation, although they were quick to provide one once we asked, so this wasn't a huge issue. What really made this stand out was actually the service provided by the kitchen. Upon walking to the bathroom a member of our group noticed some love looking sausage rolls that the kitchen was preparing, but we couldn't find them on the menu. I decided to ask what they were and if we could possibly order one or two to try. The kitchen staff seemed excited that we had noticed and kindly obliged. I was expecting them to provide us with one or two so as to not through off the number of servings that they had prepared for dinner service that night, but instead thy brought out a whole platter for our entire table. This was a delightful surprise and made our brunch seem all the more special. Beyond that our waitress was very attentive without being intrusive.   Food: 5/5 - Marben has never disappointed us on the food, and this time was no different. I had the sunny side up eggs, with hash and baked beans and it was great. They do a wonderful job with their hash integrating a mix of root vegetables to give it a nice flavor, and then frying it into a cube shape so as to give a good mix of crunch on the outside and mash on the inside.   Overall this was a great meal and left us with a wonderful impression. Furthermore the price seemed incredibly reasonable.  We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place and we weren't disappointed.  The Ceviche Cone was beautifully presented, and just the right size. It starts out spicy, then you get the fish, and a smooth finish with avocado. Yummy.  The Flatbread with tomato and cilantro was still warm and aromatic, and a beautiful presentation of Serrano ham accompanies. I wish I had ordered two and gone without salad.  The lentil and crunchy cucumber salad with  greens was both simple and sophisticated..   For our mains we has Ravioi stuffed with Rabbit and marrow. It was very comforting; rich and creamy with beautiful layers.  The braised beef with puréed sweet potatoes, beets and a spicy drizzle was almost perfect. I only wish I could have had a bit more of the sweet potato purée.  The portions were just right; small enough to leave us with room for dessert, but large enough that we wouldn't be hungry if we went without."}
{"text":"Last night we had a bit of everything at Marben and it was delicious! Three of us went to celebrate a friend's last night in Toronto, so we let ourselves go all out.   Their menu is designed that everything is share-able and comes with side plates - even the burger is in quarters and the steak cut. This is ideal for people who want to try everything, like me.   We had: Oysters - they came with a lovely cucumber sauce, but I asked for horseradish. Charcuterie plate - nothing too intimidating on it (no emu hearts, etc.), and they brought extra bread. yum. Burger  Roast Beef Gnocci   I recommend ALL OF IT.   We also drank a lot, many of their signature cocktails. I forget their names... because we drank a lot of them. But the booze is wherein Marben loses a star - I wanted to give them 5 stars so desperately because everything was so great... but the mark-up on drinks is ridiculous. $14 for a 2 ounce cocktails? $50 for their cheapest bottle of wine? It appeared to be a decently curated wine list, but still. Even our server agreed the mark-up was a bit insane.   The service was lovely. Very casual and amusing waitresses get cozy with you about the menu. Not in a dirty way, though our waitress did tell us some inappropriate things about the staff... but hey, who doesn't love gossip about strangers?  NB: If you have an earlier reservation, they will want your table again."}
{"text":"We came to Toronto for vacation and found this cool, friendly spot. The menu is brief but everything we tried was unique and delicious. They really take the time to prepare interesting and yummy food. The atmosphere is very hip and there is a 1920s speakeasy on the lower level. The staff was very friendly and clearly enjoy talking to their cliental. Even the owner came over to chat with us. It was a charming evening."}
{"text":"I tried Marben during the Winterlicious event for lunch but I thought they compromised the quality of their food to make more money. My friend and I were truly disappointed with the whole experience and the food did not make up for the slow service.  I ordered: - Appetizer: Steamed PEI mussels. I found this to be the most decent course of the meal. Mussels were cooked perfectly and the spicy chorizo gave it a little kick. - Main: Spanish seafood stew. I felt like the stew consisted mainly of chickpeas, one prawn, and a variety of octopus/squid. It felt hearty but it was a letdown due to how long we waited for the main course (maybe around 20 mins?)  - Dessert: Nutella creme brulee. The most disappointing dish ever. It was not executed properly nor was it cooked all the way through. First of all, the sugary crust on top was burnt and very thick. Secondly, the brulee was not cooked - it was still very liquidy. The restaurant had probably cooked the brulee under a broiler instead of preparing it the proper way since the ramekin was still hot. This was a huge letdown and it signaled to my friend and I that the restaurant really didn't care about the good quality of the food. Instead, they gave us undercooked liquidy creme brulee with burnt sugar. We couldn't finish the dish and quickly left afterwards.  I will not be coming back to this restaurant even for it's regular menu."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my friend's upcoming marriage. The wait staff were all very friendly and informative.  As a group of 5 ladies we decided to order 1 appetizer (mussels) and 4 mains (mushroom and sunchoke, pork belly, black Angus sirloin, and cod) to share. Every single dish was delicious. I don't even know how to choose a favourite.   We took a peak at the dessert menu and couldn't decide which dessert we wanted most. In the end we got the dessert platter (2 ice cream sandwiches, ginger cake and rhubarb & apple crumble). The saffron vanilla gelato with the brandy tuille was to die for, so good! One of my favourite desserts is anything with apple and the crumble was done so well. I found that the ice cream sandwich was a bit plain in comparison to the other 2 desserts.   It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was full with people lining up waiting for tables so right off the bat the server told us that there is a 2 hour time limit to our dinner. I liked that we had a booth across from the bar and felt like we had our own private area."}
{"text":"Went to  Marben for brunch this weekend, and was surprised at how sparse the dining crowd was over the noon hour. I ordered the Fry Up which was just ok. It consisted of toast, 2 eggs, hash and ONE banger, the size of a cocktail weiner !! For $16 , definitely not good value and I would not return."}
{"text":"Marben - what a disaster! :-(  Well before I start complaining, there is one thing to be appreciated - the servers. Those guys are great, and their work and attention are worth saying \"thank you\" out loud. Very positive, nice and fun, they are the only good thing at that stupid place.  Now for the rest of it, in one word - avoid. There are few places so totally worth closing as Marben is. One just can't fix or tolerate anything except for the service!  Portions are not a joke, they are an insult. FIFTY DOLLARS for a 2x7\" plate of vaguely fried pork? And this is a special of the day?? In a place that looks like an abandoned rehab??? For hell sake...  Fries are burned, and the oil for them was probably dumped from a 100M km chevy impala. Beans and other stuff was ok. It is hard to spoil the ketchup. Pitcher of beer helped to survive the \"dinner\".  \"Design\" of the place? You must be joking... Rathole-tavern thingy, which probably cost a fortune to build but looks like kwap.  The cook was sucking his fingers and then going on cutting the pork and working with the dishes.  And they have 20% as a default tip. Okay I do respect the work of the servers, but taking in account all the rest - no way. Sorry for that."}
