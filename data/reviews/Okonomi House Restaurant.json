They looked like an authentic Japanese restaurant that got stuck in time, aka hole in the wall, but I prefer restaurants like these like ones with fancy decorations. Unfortunately the dish that gave the restaurant's name was just average."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Friendly staff, clean and tasty food, and the quality is consistent. I just keep going back usually once a week at least.   I can finally spell the name Okonomiyaki is meant to be great. I also order their green salad quite often good except too much dressing I prefer delicate taste. I also reckon beef/chicken teriyaki are good.  My favorite Japanese restaurant so far though specializes in pancake without sushi. What I appreciate is the consistency of their food quality."}
{"text":"First time here, very cozy restaurant. I am a big fan of okonomiya , and I went to Osaka , Tokyo and hiroahima. I would say this is one of thw top 5 in Toronto. The best was the one I ate at summer festival, but I am not sure if they have restaurant. I remember its something called \"okonomiya on fire\" at night it up night market at Markham civic center. Anyways, I tried the seafood deluxe and beacon, and all tasted really good. And I have spend 15 dollors per person with drinks."}
{"text":"The people working here are really friendly and helpful. We went there about 15 minutes before closing on a Saturday night and they allowed us to order. Additionally, we didn't know the difference between a few dishes and the older lady working there took the time to explain the differences without talking down to her customers.  The food was well priced and the portion sizes were large. I ordered a couple of things thinking that one might not be enough, and both dishes that came out were very well sized.  Next time I'll try some things that are more traditional Japanese dishes, like the pancakes."}
{"text":"I recently had my first experience with the Okonomi House and in fact okonomoyaki in general. The restaurant is an interesting little place, it has the look of a lunch joint and quite a casual feel. I would even say the restaurant has a \"well-worn\" look, which may turn some off, but isn't exactly a negative.  The menu here is very basic, a few staple Japanese sides (like miso soup, edamame, etc...), what seemed to be some teriyaki bento boxes, and the eponymous okonomoyaki.  I can't tell you how \"authentic\" theirs are, or even how good they are in the gamut of other okonomoyaki, but mine (with shrimp inside and bonito shavings on top) was quite good. Not the best thing I've ever eaten, but I would come back for lunch sometime.  One thing to bear in mind, however, is that the size is perfect for a lunch or a slightly heavy snack but not really dinner worthy. If you're extremely hungry you'll either need a side or another dish (and in that case probably another restaurant as okonomoyaki are what they seem to specialize in).  The miso soup was good, if a little salty, but there's rarely much to say about miso other than, \"It tasted like fermented soybeans diluted into a soup, and I liked it.\"  All in all I'd recommend it to my friends, but with the caveat of, \"if you're really hungry, try it another day instead\"."}
{"text":"In an area were good cheap restaurants are few and far between the Okonomi House is by far the best option.   I've been going here for a long time, and my mom says it hasn't changed since she was going in the 70's in her college days.   The food is great, and if you've never thad an okonomiyaki it's definitely worth a try. One of my favourite places to eat in the city"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the middle of the downtown core.  This place puts a unique Japanese dish called okonomiyaki as their flagship product.  Okonomiyaki is a thick and savory Japanese pancake snack/meal.  A must try for anyone with a sense of curiosity in food.  Note that because this is a specialist restaurant, you won't find anything else here that is all that good."}
{"text":"Worth ONE try if you've never had okonomiyaki and if all your party is not allergic to any kind of seafood."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place! I go here once a week and absolutely love it! I always get the beef okonomi with bonito flakes and seaweed, and would definitely recommend it. Don't skip out on the bonito flakes, they're the best part! They also do take-out , and if you phone in they can have your order ready in just 15 minutes. I would definitely recommend this place :) The women who work here are also super nice!"}
{"text":"If you want AUTHENTIC Japanese comfort food, this is your place. I got the seafood deluxe okonomyaki and instantly was reminded of my experiences eating okonomyaki in Japan. So filling, so good. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"Sitting at the counter. Watching your food being prepared. Is there anything better than this? Great price and nice staff."}
{"text":"Yummy.  This is the only place that I know of that specializes in Okonomiyaki (japanese pancake.)  I had the scallop pancake and it was... really tasty.  It's a nice departure from the standard sushi/teriyaki/tempura.  And prices are very fair as everything comes to less than $10 with tax and tip.  Be warned that if you're really hungry you might not be satisfied with ONE pancake.  I would consider it more on the lighter side but it's the perfect amount of food if you're feeling a lighter lunch."}
{"text":"If your definition of Japanese food begins and ends with the sushi - teriyaki - noodle triad, it's time you were introduced to another fine Japanedible - okonomiyaki. From the Japanese okonomi which means \"as you like\" and yaki which means \"to fry, bake or broil\", okonomiyaki, is essentially a flat, eggy pancake traditionally cooked tableside and dressed up with any combination of meat and seafood, cabbage, noodles, and condiments, before being cut into quarters and eaten, usually, straight off the griddle/counter. The most renowned varieties come from Osaka and Hiroshima, and I have been lucky enough to have tried both in the original. On a trip to Hiroshima I once visited a place called Okonomimura - a building of 4 floors dedicated entirely to okonomiyaki, where about 30 different establishments vied for patrons' business with tasty touts, called out through the smoke of their griddles and the cacophony of restaurant clatter and chatter. With this kind of okonomi-stalgia, it was a welcome treat to find a local place to order up this hearty Japanese comfort food just a few subway stops away.   Yorkville's Okonomi House is a cozy, lantern-lit institution which has been specializing in this savory griddle cake since 1978. On the menu are various seafood, meat and vegetable varieties of Japanese pizza (as it's otherwise known), that - though not cooked at your table here in Toronto - are prepared within eye shot in the traditional way and brought to you piping hot, slathered in okonomiyaki sauce (a sweet, thick Worcestershire-like condiment) and garnished with the requisite dollop of mayonnaise. Make sure to request some katsuobushi (bonito flakes) and aonori (ground laver seaweed) to sprinkle on your pancake dinner, for the utmost in authenticity.   Besides this signature dish, Okonomi House offers a menu of Japanese stand-bys such as bentos, sushi, and all the miso soup and edamame you need to round out a good Japanese feed. Wash it down with one of the Japanese beers on offer, or satisfy your sweet tooth with a custard pudding or green tea ice cream. For much less than a ticket to Osaka, you can have the experience of a bona fide Kansai izakaya, just off the Bloor line."}
{"text":"I lived right around the corner when I went to UofT and still have fond memories of this place. I love how non pretentious this place is. It is a simple and humble mom and pop joint selling reasonably priced great food. Try the namesake okonomi yaki along with a cold beero and you've got a raging friday night partay!"}
{"text":"Had two different okonomiyakis...too much egg and too much dough...not enough cabbage and other vegetables.   It was too much like a Western pancake. I have tasted authentic okonomiyaki before, and this is NOT it. And it's not like it's one of those tasty fusion foods, it's just bad okonomiyaki. The sauce tasted better than the actual okonomiyaki...  It's pretty big, but not very thick. What seemed like a huge okonomiyaki was just a very flattened one that lacked the width.  It's not like I found hair or it was too dirty or anything, but it just didn't taste good.  Service was OK."}
{"text":"Tried the pork okonomi yaki with extra vegetables. I'd never had this anywhere before but had heard from friends that this place is great. The okonomi yaki was delicious, I'll definitely be back to try the other ones soon. The price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I haven't found better Okonomoyaki in Toronto, but this will have to suffice while I continue my hunt."}
{"text":"Greasy food?  Forgetful wait staff?  Check and check.  The food is tasty, but it's heavy and oily, and the waitress never brought out the miso soup I ordered (though they remembered to bill us for it).  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Good food. We have to come here every time we come  to Toronto.  It is becoming our tradition."}
{"text":"Do you have a food soulmate? Someone with whom you share a deep affinity in all matters edible? And when you read each of her Yelp reviews, you blurt out, \"Yes!\" \"So true!\" \"I love this girl!\" even though you're at an Internet cafe and people are shooting you strange looks as you practically snort coffee through your nose laughing at her comedic genius? No? Well, it's amazing when you feel like someone out there \"gets\" you on some level.  I have long sung the praises of my food soulmate: janelle \"if you only eat american food, i'm not interested\" p. (jjsp.yelp.com) in Detroit. And when she told me she'd be visiting Toronto, I jumped at the chance to meet her last night for dinner where we were joined by her husband, and TO Yelpers Deanna W. and Christine C.   Mr. and Mrs. p. decided on Okonomi House, and because she's my FS, she instinctively knew that I love okonomiyaki, the savory Japanese pancakes that are the specialty of this restaurant. Okonomi House is located in the culinary dead zone just south of Bloor & Yonge, and the interior gives the impression that a Japanese family took over a small down-and-out coffee shop that had a big griddle for eggs and flapjacks, so they decided to put it to good use by cooking up their native style of pancakes. They left the formica tables and menu board intact but strung up a bunch of red paper lanterns to give it that ole Land-of-the-Rising-Sun touch.*  We ordered two okonomiyaki by writing in our choice of fillings on the order slip; one with bacon and shrimp and the other with pork and squid ($8.55 each). Instead of cooking it ourselves on the tabletop, the okonomi-maker/short-order cook fried them on the big griddle and they arrived on our table moments later for us to share. Okonomiyaki usually comes pre-loaded with katsuobushi and aonori toppings** but for some reason, we had to order them for 50 cents extra. (Shrug.)  The pancakes were puffy and moist, but what I loved most was the combination of the sweetened Worcestershire-y sauce, dollop of Kewpie Japanese mayo, enhanced by the awesome umami-ness of the toppings***, chased with swallows of cold Asahi beer. The pork and squid filling was good but it was outshined by its smoked pork belly brother so we ordered two more bacon and shrimp--which unfortunately arrived as one bacon and one shrimp okonomiyaki because our not so fluent in English waitress misunderstood :( So remember to stick to the pen-and-paper ordering system!  It's not the best okonomiyaki**** I've ever had but Okonomi House has a certain quirky charm that I like and their prices are ridiculously cheap so I will definitely come back here.   Actually, I lied. What I loved most was meeting janelle p. and her hubby. They're adorable! I met my food soulmate and she didn't try to kill me. Or does that only happen when you meet your doppelganger?  (See photos.)  __________________ *I have no idea if this is true or not. ** shaved bonito flakes and dried seaweed powder ***especially cool when the gossamer katsuobushi topping dances on the hot okonomiyaki ****that would be the DIY okonomiyaki I had in Tokyo's Monja Street where every restaurant serves this dish!"}
{"text":"Been here only once but I have to say that their yakisoba was very good stuff. It came with miso soup, which I can't say I'm a fan of but my buddy who is into that stuff says is pretty good. The place is clean, modern looking and has a nice atmosphere. Our waitress was very friendly Would go again. Also, they accept debit (thank god)."}
{"text":"Nice and cute restaurant. The interior design is not the greatest but the okonomiyaki is quite decent and priced fairly. The other dishes are not good at all, I can easily make them within 15 minutes in my own kitchen and I'm a noobie when it comes to cooking. But nonetheless, the okonomiyaki is worth a try for a small but nice meal."}
{"text":"Located just behind the Manulife Centre, this is my go-to restaurant if I want to grab a quick dinner before a movie at Varsity. The service is quick and the prices are super reasonable.  If you haven't had okonomiyaki before, it's savoury and similar to a pancake, except that it's filled with cabbage and protein and anything else you like. It can get a bit greasy and is by no means fancy, but it's very filling. I usually get pork or seafood and veggies, along with a generous helping of bonito and seaweed flakes for 50 cents. (Total bargain!)  Even though I have made okonomiyaki at home before, it's a real treat to come here and have one made-to-order and served up on a little skillet."}
{"text":"Like London, Paris, & New York, Toronto has it's own Okonomiyaki establishment. It's delicious. Try this place if you haven't yet, and indulge in the Japanese custard they offer for dessert. It is certainly one of the more unique (and affordable) places to visit around Bay/Bloor and Yonge/Bloor. Be wary of restaurant hours."}
{"text":"'Pancakes' definitely work for dinner, if that's what you're wondering. Not breakfasty."}
{"text":"More Japanese comfort food!! I was having a rough week at work: tons of critical tech issues to fix. So, I just wanted to cuddle into a booth and eat my sad heart out.  Anyhow, this time, it was Okonomi House. I did not even know of this restaurant until I stumbled upon it after hitting up Burger Gourmet Co (sweet potato fries are DELISH) and, subsequently 'yelping' it to find out what was being served here.  I don't really know what to make of it - it is essentially a cabbage pancake that is mixed with your ingredient of choice (mine was scallop). Seasonings include seaweed sprinkles / huge bonito flakes / mayonnaise / sweet Okonomiyaki sauce.   I didn't mind the taste so much but I was a little bored of it after a few bites. I didn't find the flavor intriguing in any way. I would like more salt and spice. The presentation seemed meh as well (a big blob). Perhaps I was already in a foul mood and was nitpicking on the poor pancake for my disastrous morning. Maybe the little thing didn't have a chance in hell to satisfy me. Perhaps I should have downed a beer or two while I was at it. The waitresses did make my visit enjoyable by being attentive and friendly, and I did leave the place feeling a little bit more loved.   So, I will give this one another go: round 2 will involved bacon and perhaps shrimp (to increase the complexity of flavors). FYI, I did google this baby up when I got back to the office. Apparently there is another Hiroshima version that is layered rather than mixed. I think I would like to try the former so if anyone knows of a restaurant that does that, PLEASE message me. I also googled up some recipes and might try this out on my own (doesn't appear so hard). So, my Okonomiyaki story has just started ... and I can thank Okonomi House for that!"}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese anime has one episode in which the characters hang out and eat monjayaki. So I was desperately tempted by it and found out this is the only one in Toronto. Even though they are not monjayaki, I still had a really high expectation. After I finished my Toefl test, I went there( pretty close to my test center) I love the deco, so Japanese and warm. The menu is pretty straightforward which I really appreciate( I am pretty straight mind)  I had the bacon one. Mediocre. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Okinomi Yaki are, basically, a disgusting concept. Weird giant cabbage and egg pancakes with your choice of meat, smothered in barbeque sauce and a dollop of mayonaise - gross, right?  NO. Holy lord these things are delicious, and cheap. I can't say I know much about the other food on the menu because I only every have the okinomi yaki. I've been with people who have had teriyaki and other dishes and they seemed satisfactory, but really, we all know why we're there. Weird pancakes, decor that hasn't changed since my father frequented the joint in university, and Asahi and Sapporo that are (at least the last time I was there) imported, which you don't see often.  If you're in the Yonge-Bloor area, there is literally nowhere better to go (although that's not technically saying a ton, since that area is a waste-land for food)."}
{"text":"After reading BlogTO's article about Toronto's Best Japanese Restaurant, we paid Okonomi House a visit. Okonomi House specializes in okonomiyaki, traditional japanese savoury pancakes, and this is very different from all the japanese restaurants we go to. We were also surprised to find out that this restaurant has exceptionally high reviews.    Located in the heart of downtown, this restaurant is pretty small but home-like. As usual, we requested to sit at the bar.    JW ordered their scallop okonomiyaki without green onions and onions and I had their shrimp okonomiyaki.  We also added dried seaweed and bonito flakes for a$1 that came on the side.    Overall, I really enjoyed the okonomiyaki. It basically tasted exactly like takoyaki but in a pancake form. The onion in the pancake elevated the otherwise doughiness/blant texture to something more crispy.  Thus, compared to JW's okonomiyaki which didn't have onions, mine definitely had more interesting texture and didn't taste as heavy (partly because of the shrimps as well) . We also highly recommend one to pay an extra dollar to get the dry seaweed and bonito flakes as they add another dimension of flavour that complemented the okonomiyaki sauce very well.  The okonomiyaki was definitely not very filling as JW claimed he was \"still hungry\" after eating the entire pancake. Some of our friends claimed they would order another rice to go with the okonomiyaki. But for me, I felt very satisfied.  Verdict:  Roasted!   Definitely a gem! A cheap eat in downtown. We will definitely visit when we crave for okonomiyaki again.  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/07/06/okonomi-house/ for pictures of all the food i mentioned above! :D"}
{"text":"Tonkatsu sauce + mayo + bonito flakes + aonori = the best.  It's been a while since I've eaten at Okonomi House and I'm glad we rediscovered our friendship! Neither the location nor interior is very exciting, and definitely not the service... the red lights give me a headache. BUT don't let this deter you!   Regardless, their food is a thumbs up. If you are curious what authentic okonomiyaki tastes like, try it here and you'll know anything less is not good enough. Being a huge fan of scallops, I always have the scallop okonomiyaki. I was quite surprised and impressed with the large scallops they gave! My girlfriend had the squid one and discovered a squid mine as well. It was her first time there and she kept saying how good it was and how happy she is to have been brought there!   I hope the owner dude gets a nice letter in the mail or wins a small lottery or something because the whole experience would be so much better if he smiled.  Atmosphere - 2/5 Service - 3/5 Food - 5/5 Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"Cheap okonomiyaki. It's not a fancy place and it's pretty small. But if you're into the homey style where they mostly just serve okonomiyaki fast,  this place hits the spot. Get the nori and bonito flakes.  I usually get the squid or meats. Request extra mayo.  They have the burger steak but I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch spots to enjoy an okonomiyaki and yaki soba.  They also make an excellent chicken teriyaki.  For dessert, the Japanese-style pudding hits the spot.  Been coming here for over 30 years now and hope they never close up!"}
{"text":"The teriyaki sucks. the pancake tastes a little bit better but still not good enough. Though the price is fair but they provide not enough amount. the been sprouts take more than half of the plate and the meet are not tasty. I will never visit it again."}
{"text":"I went here because of the reviews. I was disappointed a little. The food was okay. I have had better okonomiyaki other places. The presentation was not that great. They did little to make the dish look special like they do at other places. At lease the price was decent. And the waitress girl was very nice.  I do recommend going to this place. It beat McDonald's by a long shot. They have been around since 1978 there must be a reason why. I only had a chance to have one dish during my stay other dishes might be better."}
{"text":"This place is very overrated. I think I've heard way too many times that this is a must visit place when you come downtown but I've had friends from elsewhere who've heard this to come and try the food here and got disappointed.   There is nothing that taste bad but there aren't anything that really taste all that good either. The price is on the cheaper side so I guess that's one of the pros for eating here. But the taste itself it not that impressive and I wish there were more okonomiyaki places downtown."}
{"text":"Met up with my friend here to finally try out okonomi!  Restaurant size: It can be a comfortably sized place, with table seating along the windows and bar-style seating which overlooks the chef(s). Since we got there around store opening on a Saturday, it wasn't that busy or cramped yet. However, it may be a little more difficult to accommodate parties larger than 4, or start to feel a little claustrophobic when things really start to pick up.  Portion size: We ordered a chicken teriyaki, seafood okonomi (w/ bonito flakes! of course!) and 2 calpicos. Both being big eaters, we felt satisfied with the portion size!  Food quality: We didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into, but I taught my friend the meaning of \"oishi!\" that day; it was unanimous. The chicken teriyaki was lighter in flavour, but also wasn't over-drenched in sauce. We probably should have gone with the beef instead.  Service: Since there weren't that many others in the restaurant yet, the server came by quickly and was quite attentive. We may or may not have had a brief friendly staredown with our big eyes.  Also, if you're paying by card you'll need to go up to the register.  Final thoughts: We left the restaurant enlightened and satisfied, and would visit again one day."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to oko in Japan while it is quite different there this place is good. For those who have had it before it is like a pancake but savoury. On top is the BBQ sauce and mayo. Once you try it my guess is you will like it. I really like it after a night of drinking. Hope you enjoy it"}
{"text":"Overall, a cute semi-hole in the wall kind of establishment that serves up tasty japanese pancakes. Would recommend if looking for cheap eats and a chill environment :)  The okonomiyaki (4/5): I had to opp to try the bacon, beef, and chicken okonomiyaki where all 3 were very delicous! I have had seafood okonomiyaki in japantown in SF before, then again at Guu Izakaya, but was never a fan, until I tried the japanese pancakes here! I'd say beef was my favorite, then the bacon,  then the chicken. The beef was so tasty I was happy that the flavour wasn't lost in the pancake batter kind of how the chicken did. Bacon is bacon, c'mon, do I even have to elaborate? But yes, BE WARNED! You have to order the seaweed and bonito flakes separately,  it does not come with an order of okonomiyaki!  Cost (4.5/5): At approx $7 a pop for a pancake this was def worth. I was full after eating half of each of the 3 types so I'd say that 3 pancakes between 2 women is a fair portion. Maybe 4 if its between 2 men haha. So yes, it was definitely a fair price!  Service (3.5/5): Could be better? I guess it is typical for the kind of of place it was. Semi-fast food, semi-resto kind of feel. Though you will have to ask them to refill your water for you, they won't watch for it.  Ambience (3.5/5): it's very casual and the japanese laterns outside the restaurant are beautiful at night. The crowd has a large variance from young people to the older folk who just want to enjoy an fast and chill meal. I went during dinner on a Thursday night (and stayed for 3 hrs, but thats another story), and all through the night the tables turned fairly quick and there was never a line up, so I believe everyone was fairly if not very happy."}
{"text":"A place to go for Japanese comfort food at very reasonable prices. Small selection of sides and  specials, but something for everyone.  Their specialty is the okonomi-yaki.  Okonomi-yaki is a Japanese pancake made with flour, egg, milk, chopped cabbage, green onion, pickled ginger and topped with sauce, but you can add choice of  protein topping or just choose vegetables.  Service was friendly and welcoming upon entrance.  The place seemed like a family run business with a small staff of four and ordering by a menu-card.  The decor was simple with tables surrounding the circumference of the restaurant and counter seating for five. Only decorations were lanterns hanging along the windows which gave the authentic Asian feel of redness atmosphere.  It was actually quite zen feeling and cozy.  Perfect setting for a casual romantic date.  For a party of two, we ordered the edamame ($3.25), squid okonomi-yaki ($7.35) and beef terriyaki ($12.75) to start.  The edamame didn't look fresh or were they just overcooked? The squid okonomi-yaki was flavourful and had chunks of squid in almost every bite, but the beef terriyaki wasn't too impressive and quite disappointing.  Too much bean sprouts and not enough beef which was a bit chewy and flavourless.  I knew we would definitely be ordering more food since the portions were small.    Therefore, we ordered additional seafood deluxe okonomi-yaki ($12.95) and yakisoba (noodles $8.75).  The seafood okonomi-yaki was tasty with a variety of mixed seafood (tiger shrimp, scallop, squid and crab stick), but the yakisoba was another disappointment.  It was bland tasting, not enough noodles,  too much onions and cabbage with perhaps a few pieces of meat.  We didn't have a chance to finish the second portion of our meals since the restaurant was closing at 10pm on a Saturday night.  We were given the bill early at 9:45pm and was told they closed at 10pm which we paid and acknowledged closing time.  At 10pm we were reminded that they were closed.  Most restaurants won't be rushing customers out while they cleaned and prepared for closing, especially when we haven't finished our meals, but at 10:15pm, we were told again they're closed and we were rushed out.  They did offer to give us containers for the remainder of the food which was more than half remaining, but by this time, I had lost my appetite as I felt rushed.  Therefore, we didn't take our food to go, but I did managed to finish my beer before we thanked the staff and left the restaurant.  I was quite upset that we felt rushed making the dining experience not enjoyable, but I may come back just for the okonomi-yaki because it was simply delicious.  Perhaps I'll return just for lunch, so I won't feel rushed, unless I find another restaurant that makes a good okonomi-yaki."}
{"text":"I love this place SO much. I've probably taken everybody I know here. The food here is so delicious and reminds me of home. I always order the beef okonomiyaki with bonito flakes and seaweed. Would definitely recommend it!  The one thing about this place is that a lot of guys don't find the okonomiyaki filling enough and need to order something with it. So, if you're a guy with a big appetite maybe order a side or something? But for me I always find that the beef okonomiyaki is more than enough food!! Sometimes I even have some left over.  Best affordable dinner spot!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot to have lunch when you're shopping around Bay & Bloor since it's just one street south.   It's a cute little family-owned restaurant close to the UofT campus and their prices are very afforable to those on a student budget. Average menu items are about $5-6 for okonomiyaki, and a cup of green tea was $0.50. The bonito flakes on top of the okonomiyaki costs a little bit extra ($0.50 for a generous portion!), but it's worth it! It amuses me to watch them swaying on top of my food, but it's very tasty. Their yakisoba is delicious - very authentic and the portions are very generous.   The restaurant is quite small so it can crowded during peak lunch hours. Don't bring a large party of people with you or they will be scrounging for chairs and will have 5 people mushed into a bench area that usually only fits 3. The kitchen is completely open so you can watch them making your lunch - it's also nice because they have nothing to hide.   Highly recommend this little gem! (I wish they were open on Sundays!)"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend of mine who recommended it.  After being to Japan, it's hard to see any Toronto Japanese food the same, but Okonomi House is great. It's a cozy little diner where the food is inexpensive but tasty. I wouldn't say it's life changing food, but it has heart to it - a great go-to.  The okonomiyaki was cooked well and delicious! We also ordered yakisoba and washed it down with a couple of beers.  The staff were very friendly, the food came quickly, and despite spending a couple of hours there on a Saturday, we never felt rushed.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice.  Food: On my first visit, I tried the seafood deluxe okonomiyaki, it was not super tasty as I hoped. On my second visit, I tried the beef okonomiyaki and had a sample of the pork and the chicken from friends and they tasted superb. My friend advised to me before my order that the seafood may cause the okonomiyaki to be slightly watery, which could affect the texture. I usually see a lot of people opt for take-out. I ate a bit of the burger steak and it was yummy too. Note: You won't be creating your own okonomiyaki.  Service & Atmosphere: If you go during the day time, the lighting is nice. When nightfalls, the red lanterns cause the entire place to look really red. Service is great!  Pricing: Very fair and worth it!"}

Okonomi House looked very run-down and seemed as if they've been there for awhile just looking from the outside.  I dropped by the Okonomi House for a quick lunch and they gave me a menu and a paper order chart to fill out. Their menu was very old and sticky from some type of food....I did not want to touch it.  Ordered: SCALLOP OKONOMIYAKI 2/5 *Japanese pancake made with scallop for $6.55 *This is very small in size, so if you are only having this for lunch- you might want to order a side of rice *I found it kind of ridiculous how I had to order bonito flakes for extra 50cents *It's not that I don't want to pay extra 50cents, it's normally just served on top *Okonomiyaki is very thin and there wasn't much cabbage *There was decent amount of scallop and they weren't those tiny frozen ones either *I think this might be good for a snack *Personally, I just thought their Okonomiyaki was really sad and disappointing *I had okonomiyaki in Japan, as well as tried making it at home, and it tastes so much better *This lacked in cabbage (which is not expensive at all) and in texture (it was too mushy) *Didn't live up to my expectations especially when they are suppose to specialize in this dish  Ordered: SEAFOOD YAKISOBA 2/5 *Japanese style fried noodles with seafood served with miso soup for $11.95 *This was just like your regular yakisoba served at food court *Came with shrimp, scallop, imitation crab meat and strips of squid *Good portion and it had lots of seafood but it was nothing special  Throughout my meal, I realized how weird their store layout was. It's shaped like L, which makes it so hard for the server to see customers and vice versa. I had to wave my hands and twist my neck so many times just to ask for some more water. The restaurant is old (which I don't mind) but it doesn't look very clean (which I do mind).  Clearly they need to go under renovation. I comment on the state of their restaurant because if they were some kind of authentic Japanese restaurant that focuses on quality of food over their interior and surroundings, it wouldn't matter but that's not the case here. And I would like to add that usually I am not a picky person when it comes to sanitation of restaurants- sure, I don't want to get food poisoning or see bugs as extra condiments on my dish. But I am one of those people who actually prefers dingy hole-in-the-wall places because it always makes me feel like I've descovered a hidden gem. Plus I do believe that many of the authentic restaurants lack in the atmosphere department (at least asian nes). But obviously, Okonomi House failed to impress in both departments, taste/quality and atmosphere.  Summary: I would never go back to this place. Just with their quality of Okonomiyaki, it  might as well be served at a food court (and I still wouldn't go). Maybe I expected too much but honestly, I can make better okonomiyaki at home."}
{"text":"Great place! Love getting the beef or chicken teriyaki. Great vibe and staff are really nice"}
{"text":"The Okonomi is unique and tastes good, ingredients used all are good quality. Worth a try, everyone."}
{"text":"As a Japanese from the Kansai area, it was a little disappointing. The sauce was a little sweeter than authentic one, and not so filling :P I enjoyed the texture thou :)"}
{"text":"A wonderful and slightly odd grease pit serving Japanese comfort food,  The air in this place is saturated with what they fry, and they oil-fry the pancakey okonomi-yaki in its various forms as well as the Teriyaki that I usually get instead. The grill behind the plexiglass is constantly at work. The chicken Teri is not bad and substantial too with enough veggies. I don't quite get the appeal of fried savory pancake with dark goo. But where else can you?  Can also try a Calpico which is a lactose-based soda drink made from a mix that you can buy in asian markets. Think Japanese Spritzer. I'm amazed this place has been in Toronto longer than I have, I assume earlier eighties because it's not necessarily great but you must give it authenticity.  Your clothes might need to be aired after! And you gotta be ready to digest a little mystery grease. All in a cold winter's day while seeking hearty sustenance in snowy slushy Hogtown."}
{"text":"a little authentic japanese eatery tucked in a little corner intersecting charles st and yonge, specializing in okonomiyaki but also serving other fast food type japanese like yakisoba and hamburger steak with rice.  i usually have their okonomiyaki when i visit, and make sure you include the seaweed topping (loaded with MSG goodness) and bonito flakes. choice of okonomiyaki toppings include scallop and shrimp, and of course there's beef, chicken and pork.  service is quick, price is cheap (expect $10 per person excluding taxes) and it's quite hearty. and okonomiyakis are always a good experience, especially if you've never tried it before."}
{"text":"Yummy, with a very warm and intimate experience. We had a scallop Okonomi and a Yakiniku dinner, they were both very good."}
{"text":"I love okonomiyaki, and this place serves some good ones. Don't expect ones like they have in Japan, since the ones I had in Tokyo were better, but if you want a cheap savoury pancake, this place is a solid choice.  I had the shrimp okonomiyaki ($7.35) and could have easily eaten another since I enjoyed it so much. The shrimp wasn't overdone and the Japanese mayo complemented it perfectly. Service is fast. I'll be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Okonomiyaki portion is quite small and pretty thin (1cm thickness) with very little cabbage actually in the batter. Even with the sauce on top it is still quite bland. I ordered shrimp for around $8 or so (which is of course cheap considering it's dt Toronto) but I don't think it is really that worth it. The service was fast and very friendly though."}
{"text":"Decent, It's good to have a specialized place in okonomiyaki.. since is not a easy thing to find..."}
{"text":"I came to Okonomi House for dinner with a friend since we were planning to get the Magnum bars for dessert. This is a definitely a place worth trying.  We ordered a scallop, shrimp Okonomiyaki and a seafood salad. The prices are just right and not expensive. It's basically a Japanese pancake (an egg pancake!). Service was very fast."}
{"text":"Nice place to try if your in the area to perhaps see a show at the CAA(Panasonic) theatre. It gets pretty busy, but we had no problem getting a seat around 6pm on a week night. By 7 it was full.  Tried Yakiniku dinner (beef bento box)which was a good size portion and tasty. The okonomi yaki with beef aonori and katsubushi was something I had not tried elsewhere; think omelette with some crumbled beef on top, along with fish flakes and mayo condiment. I enjoyed it, though it reminded me of bar food and not really a meal.  Check this place out, it something a little different."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such high ratings other than the fact that it's fairly cheap and frankly is the only place I know of that sells okonomiyaki in Toronto. I had the beef okonomiyaki, pork okonomiyaki, and yakisoba to share with my boyfriend. The miso soup that came with the meal was way too salty and I didn't find any of the dishes to be anything special. Of the three dishes, beef okonomiyaki was the best but I think money can be better spent elsewhere. Won't be retr"}
{"text":"My very first okonomayaki experience and got the chicken and tiger shrimp. Not sure if I didn't pick right; it was just ok. The sauce on it made it soggy and my shrimp were baby shrimp - not meaty tiger shrimp. The flavors were a bit bland and the bonito flakes gave it a fishy flavor. Maybe I'll try something else there.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the past few years. It's a low key Japanese restaurant that specializes in making Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) and fried noodles. It has a basic interior setting and open concept kitchen where patrons can watch the chef make each meal. The Okonomiyaki was well cooked, however it was a bit doughy at times.  Our Yakisoba was a good portion and had a solid balance between carbs, meat and veggies. Definitely recommend this place if you need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This was our first time visit. We went after our tour of Royal Ontario Museum. It's a small establishment with authentic feeling. We liked that they had a small menu. Just like their name, their specialty is okonomiyaki. We ordered squid which we liked very much. Yakisoba was good too. Chicken teriyaki was nothing special. Next time we go, we will just order a couple of okonomiyaki for quick lunch. Their matcha green tea was good also. Miso soup was too salty however."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars because it was was first Okonomiyaki experience so I don't know anything better. I had a great experience here on a Tuesday evening with my sister. We did not have to wait for a table,  service was great and my bacon okonomi was even better. I added the Aonori and Katsubushi flakes as recommended by others and was absolutely mesmerized watching the Bonito flakes dance around. I have never seen anything like that before especially when it comes to my food. I stuck to ordering an Okonomiyaki because that's what their specialty is and I would definitely come back again for just that."}
{"text":"Like Ronseal, it does what it says. Great Okonomiyaki, make sure you pay the 50¢ extra for the seaweed and dried fish (which writhes about in the steam of the hot Okonomiyaki 'pancake'). I've been here a few times, and will be back whenever I get a craving. I don't usually order the Teriyaki dishes in a Japanese restaurant- but they looked pretty awesome and generous portions from what I saw. The Sunomono is good for the price, and the tea is cheap and lovely and fresh (with your own teabag)."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever ... well, maybe not forever, but a long time and it hasn't changed a bit. If you've never experience Yaki Okonomi before you are in for a treat.   The specialty of the house is a type of Japanese street food best described as an omelet filled with your choice of seafood, chicken, beef, or vegetables and served piping hot slathered in a tangy Japanese BBQ sauce and homemade mayonesse. It is delicious.  The service, as you would expect in a good Japanese restaurant, is efficient and swift. An Okonomi will fill you up without emptying your wallet. Without drinks, you can get away for under ten bucks.  However, who goes to a Japanese restaurant and doesn't have a drink? They only serve Japanese beer or hot or cold Saki. If you want a fancy cocktail head to Trader Vics."}
{"text":"Like most people have said great place for okonomi and yakisoba. Portions are great for lunch or a light dinner. You can also watch them cook if you sit at the bar ish area."}
{"text":"If you really like okonomiyaki, this is your restaurant. However for my taste, I found there to be too much sauce so it made the dish too soggy. We also had some fried udon and it was way too oily."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! I've been going here with my friends for years and have NEVER been disappointed. The staff are very pleasant and the service is fantastic. Not fine dining but delicious comfort food. Go!"}
{"text":"Just like the name suggest, they specialize in okonomiyakis. The restaurant is kinda small and have virtually no lineups. Seems like that's the case cause they're tucked away on a street west of Yonge.  The okonomiyakis are alright, better quality than most night markets. You get barely any meat with them tho. Ask for more sauce.  If you're not up for okonomiyaki, their hamburg steak is also a good choice. You get to feel healthy since they load the shit out of the plate with bean sprouts. Make sure to ask for more sauce cause otherwise the patty taste kinda bland.  Other than that the wait time is a little longer than other restaurants. Be sure to know what to get before going in."}
{"text":"My first time trying okonomiyaki, the Japanese savoury pancake with your choice of either meat or seafood, was enjoyable. It's served on an iron plate and a wooden tray. The presentation looks very rustic and authentic. I ordered the side of bonito flakes and seaweed which you add yourself to the okonomiyaki. The pancake is glazed over with some teriyaki like sauce and a dollop of mayo. Thank goodness it didn't taste like teriyaki but more of a savory Worcestershire sauce. The texture might not be appealing to some because it's more crispy on the outside and creamy gooey in the middle. I can't say if this place serves the best or the worst as I have absolutely no previous experience to reference. At least I wasn't having the \"runs\" an hour later...that's always a good sign I guess."}
{"text":"I tried homemade okonomiyaki, and this really puts my opinion of this place in perspective. It's su much better if you make it at home, and it's so easy.  The dishes at this restaurant are SO oily, and they skimp out on the seafood."}
{"text":"It's a small, quaint restaurant that seems to have a good flow of business. I had the squid okonomiyaki and it was delicious! The squid was soft and there was a lot of it in there. With their sauce and mayo, and also the Bonita and seaweed, it was absolutely delicious! I only had the okonomiyaki and all in it was about $10. Didn't like that you have to pay extra for the bonito flakes and seaweed.. But nonetheless, must try!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and ingredients are very fresh there. We had the okonomiyaki seafood delux and it was quite good. The visit met my expectation and they offered good service too. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Been here a while back but forgot to write a review. I think this is a really nice place, with kind service, and an efficient ordering system where you just tick off what you want on a sheet and hand it to one of the nice ladies. Food is great, filling and comes quickly. I also love the variety of okonomiyaki (yay options!) and the reasonable pricing, though I do wish that I didn't have to order the bonito flakes separately, not because of the extra cost (just 50 cents), I just forget to mark it on the sheet is all. Also something that is, in my opinion, a hidden gem at this place is the pudding! Similar to what most people know as flan, it looks like something that just jumped out of a manga/anime and tastes great too! Love it !"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has 1 $, it's definitely $$. Not worth the price. Ordered about $30 worth of food (2 okonomiyakis, and a yakisoba) for 2 girls, and we still weren't full. Close to 9 bucks for a palm-sized okonomiyaki is not what I as a poor student would want to do. Not going back..."}
{"text":"The okonomi (Japanese pancakes) they serve have nothing similar to the ones I had in Japan! Taste was all from the topping (sauce, basically) Not returning."}
{"text":"Pancakes are bland. The food also took forever to come even though the restaurant had only half capacity. The staff was nice though so props to them. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has been here for so many years and I've never stepped foot in it.  The menu is pretty simple: small starters/sides, a few varieties of okonomiyaki, some teriyaki dishes, and yakisoba.  We ordered:  Yakisoba.  This comes with an ice cream scoop of rice and a bowl of miso soup.  I noticed there was a decent amount of shrimp, chicken, and beef.  We tried 3 types of okonomiyaki: chicken, scallop, and bacon.  We also ordered the toppings of seaweed and bonito flakes.  You need those people!  I don't find it cheap on their end especially when I'm sure not everyone likes the flavours of these two ingredients.  If you want a traditional experience, then throw down your quarters and just do it!  Overall, I liked it.  It's simple.  Portions are not huge, so if you're looking for a light meal and having something different, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"A good selection of teriyaki and rice dishes, cooked fresh using quality ingredients. This has been a long time staple for me and have enjoyed it for more than 15 years"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was impressed overall with the good food and quick service.   I got an okonomiyaki with scallop and chicken. I enjoyed the consistency of the pancake but the toppings I chose didn't really add a lot of flavour, especially the scallop. My brother's pancake, a beef and bacon one, tasted much more flavourful (and it's probably the combination I'll get when I go back here).   Overall, it's a nice place for a decent meal. I haven't tried any of the rice/noodle items on their menu, but I'd definitely return for more okonomiyaki!"}
{"text":"I've walked past this unassuming little place in my 'hood 1000x and didn't bother trying it, and I will regret that decision for the rest of my Japanese bacon filled pancake eating existence, which I expect to be long and fulfilling.  I tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks back and it will NOT be the last. Ordered the baconator Okonomi pancake ($8, that's absolutely not what it's actually called) and it's meal sized, delicious and both surprising in concept and comfortingly familiar yet fresh in delivery in a way that will both please your foodie friends on a chilled out \"let's just eat something\" kind of night as well as your \"I refuse to eat things that aren't potatoes and meat\" pals trying to be slightly more adventurous,  maybe even at once. Maybe they'll even get closer for it, resolve their differences and stop ruining dinner night by disagreeing.    WHO KNOWS.    I also ordered the sukiyaki because I love sukiyaki, and it was what you'd expect, as well as a large beef filled bowl with a nice, spicy Japanese cafeteria ish sauce that was both delicious and way, way too much food.   So, a few things:  1. this place is pretty simple, but it's nicely lit and cozy, so you can go for a casual weekday catchup date/dinner and feel thoroughly pleased with your decision.  2. the staff are lovely, the lighting is super red... but TBH...  pancakes. come here for delicious, delicious pancakes."}
{"text":"I love okonomiyaki here The service was very nice. We came here few times. The poor thing was the side noodle soup! Terrible!!! It was pieces of instant noodle that you can buy in convenient store  tiny bowl is $2 (as I remember)"}
{"text":"Never knew about this place until someone recommeded me to try it since it was tucked away on Charles Street even though I pass by the area really often. I tried the pork okonomiyaki, it was good but would prefer less sauce next time. Custard pudding was delicious for dessert and the price was not bad."}
{"text":"Right below our new building a place that serves traditional Japanese pancakes as well as noodle dishes. We tried the bacon, the shrimp and a few others. All were very nice but a bit bland. Many reviews have recommended the seaweed flakes for more flavour so I will try that next time.   Nice sake selection and beers as well. Service was also very attentive."}
{"text":"I had a nice okonomi here. Word to the wise-order okonomi when at okonomi house. It's definitely there specialty. Maybe not the greatest of it's kind but it does the job at a cheap price!"}
{"text":"As a former resident of Osaka, Japan, I do love my okonomiyaki. I can cook it myself at home but the smoke alarm goes off every time.   For $5.85, I sample a bacon okonomi here on Charles Street. As I eat, I fall into reverie: so many happy memories of enjoying this dish in far-off places with far-off friends...   I like my okonomiyaki to be big, thick and crispy on the outside. This Okonomi House one is not. It needed way more special sauce, too. Next time I have a craving, I'll cook my own. I just have to remember to take the batteries out of the smoke alarm."}
{"text":"I like the place is run by Japanese because they are serious about their food and services. Pros - Okonomiyaki (Pork) is awesome - Yakisoba tastes ok but comes with pork, beef, chicken, and shrimp . worth the price ! - homey? comfortable environment Cons - could potentially line up during rush hours due to limited space (if u don't like to wait)"}
{"text":"We had the seafood udon and the okonomiyaki. The seafood udon was simple, I wouldn't say it blew me away but was serviceable. I was excited for the okomiyaki but it was more floury than I preferred. The type of palate that the restaurant serves is more towards western tastes. If you're looking for something traditional then this isn't the place."}
{"text":"This place is a jewel.  They have the best Okonomiaki in Toronto at an exceptional price.  It seems to be made in the Osaka style which is fine by me.  There's a good selection of sides and reasonably priced beer.  Having had the real deal in Japan I'm glad I can get it outside of an Izakaya or more expensive restaurant setting.  This place is the real deal.  Friendly staff, reasonable service and amazing Okonomiaki.  I don't know why you'd ever order anything else at this place."}
{"text":"Open for over 35 years, OHR is a Charles Street institution. Quite the hidden one too, unless you are neighbour or a regular thanks to their delicious pancakes.   Now, don't be fooled, this is a simple restaurant. Do not come in expecting some great decor. The simple tables, inexpensive chairs and tight quarters are definitely a bit of a negative since the place gets 'packed' and sometimes service waivers.   But in Yelp, most foodies are not so easily dissuaded by decor. Oh no, as first and foremost if you are a foodie, then you know it is the food what comes first --in a hygienic environment, obviously, that really should go without saying, we want food not salmonella.   Anyway, I digress, where Okonomi House really shines are their delicious Japanese pancakes. Which in case you never had them, are sweet and savory dishes stuffed with different meats and painted over with sauce. Truly, an ocean removed (see what I did there?) from the definition of a 'pancake' which many in North America hold so dear... along with bacon.   Personally, I come here almost exclusively for the pancakes and I have never been disappointed. They come filled with either meats, seafood or veggies but remember this, whatever you do: DO ORDER THE BONITO FLAKES. As they add so much to the dish, yet too bad they are an extra charge where in other places they are complementary. Do try some of their other dishes, just maybe not the green salads.  In a sea of sushi restaurants, trust me, I have been to many, it is a great treat to visit Japanese eateries which provide us a greater insight into a cuisine most North Americans are never exposed to. After all, there is so much more to their taste profile than maki, sushi or just fish in general. I love me some Japanese curry!   OHR has been a great addition to downtown for decades bringing inexpensive dishes along with the fairly hard to find Japanese pancakes ($7). Definitely worth the visit. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing. I've been to Japan and have had traditional Okonomiyaki (Hiroshima and Osaka style) - this is just as good, in my opinion. Read other reviews say it's nothing like what you find in Japan - my guess is, is that they've never been to Japan. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Simple, cheap, fast and delicious!   I went yesterday for an early dinner. The place is small but super homey and clean. It was a simple menu that did not have an array of choices but certainly you will get what you want. It's staple food like chicken, beef choices of the okonomiyaki pancakes.   I also ordered the beef patty dish. It was incredible. It came with bean sprouts and rice! For nine bucks it's filling and super tasty.   I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"My friend and I shared 2 okonomiyakis. One pork and one scallop. To our surprise, the 2 okonomiyakis were actually quite different.   We asked to have all the sauces and toppings on the side. We were worried that the amount of sauce put on the okonomiyaki would overpower everything. It turns out that we found the okonomiyaki sauce to be quite strong. We ended up not having to use much at all.  The scallop okonomiyaki was more runny and had a creamy consistency in the batter. It's probably because scallop holds more water than pork, which was then released into the batter when it was cooked. The pork okonomiyaki was definitely more dry, meaty, and firm.   Both okonomiyakis were quite nice but we liked the scallop more than the pork. The scallop tasted fresh and added a really nice scallopy flavour. If you want to have a legit okonomiyaki, it must have bonito flakes and sour seaweed flakes on top!"}
{"text":"Okonomi House is great Not only one of the only places to get okonomiyaki in Toronto, but fantastic quality too.   Its good for people who dont like sushi or other Japanese cuisine, Okonomiyaki is quite a different culinary experience.  I would recommend this place without reservation to almost any type of diner. its not an upscale place, but still a great place for a date, unpretentious and tasty."}
{"text":"Lit by an eerie red glow from lantern decors, this authentic little Japanese restaurant is tucked away on Charles St W just off of Yonge.  Arriving at around 8pm on a Thursday night, our party of 6 had to wait 15ish minutes before we got a table. Understandable, since it's such a small restaurant - but keep that in mind if you're coming with a larger group!  The food was quite good. I shared a scallop okonomiyaki and a burger patty meal with my friend.  The okonomiyaki came freshly served on a hot plate and was stuffed with considerable pieces of individual mini scallops. Its texture was fluffy and soft, not too sticky or floury, and was topped with a dollop of mayo-like sauce that complimented the overall flavours well.  The burger patty was huge, and sat atop a bed of bean sprouts and an ice cream scoop portion of rice. The teriyaki sauce that they drizzled on top was delicious. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savoury and definitely added a nice touch to the juicy meat. The patty was more moist than what you would regularly get in burgers, and the chunks of ground meat came apart quite easily with slight aid from cutlery. There were a LOT of bean sprouts and they were a bit more watery than desired, leaving a pool of liquid behind by the end of the meal.   Overall, food was great. Service, though, was just ok - I felt unwelcomed by the owner by his lack of interactions with us. He would reply us one-word answers or just nod and walk away. He also never smiled.  Too bad this place doesn't specialize in takoyaki too because I bet they would be amazing. Though not cheap, I'd definitely come back for their okonomiyaki the next time I'm craving one."}
{"text":"Taki is delicious and good quality. Price is reasonable.Source is tasty."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! Beef is so tender and the Okinomi is fantastic. It's a classic spot to hideaway and fill your belly."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in the downtown core that you could likely live in Toronto all your life and never know it existed. This cozy restaurant only seats about 20 and some counter space, and serves some of the best Japanese comfort food. If you come here, you must get the Okonomiyaki that the place is named after.  I had been going here a few times a year with my parents as a child, and this was the first time I returned as an adult. I tried the yakisoba as well today and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Okonomiyaki is a Japanese dish that doesn't get a lot of press - this place is a must-try if you've never had it. Otherwise, the 'Nomi Hizzle is a great occasional lunch option that hovers around 3.5 stars for those just-had-salad-yesterday-having-sushi-tonight afternoons. Parties of 2 can get comfortably full on 2 or 3 pancakes (around $6.50 each). ***2016 UPDATE!*** All pancakes are $8+ now, making this lunch less of a steal.  I don't know why they have an additional charge for bonito flakes and seaweed, because those are definitely mandatory toppings. But you do need to order them. There's no two ways about it. If  I find out you ate your okonomiyaki plain, I'll be very disappointed.  If you want any vegetables with your meal, you're S.O.L. \"Stir-fried vegetable\" ($3.65) is a plate of bean sprouts and approximately one piece of broccoli.  PRO TIP: Ask for the sauce on the side if you want to control the amount of Worcestershire and mayo you drown in."}
{"text":"Braved the cold last night and went to this amazing little restaurant.  I ordered the miso soup and a chicken and bacon okonomiyaki with extra bonito flakes, sauce and mayo.   The miso soup was perfect. The chicken and bacon okonomiyaki was delicious however, I hardly tasted any bacon. The bonito flakes, sauce and extra mayo made it even better.   Excellent service and reasonably priced food. I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"OHR is a very homey restaurant that serves very homey food. In western culture, fine dining is often associated with high quality food. In Asia, this is not always the case. A lot of times the best food is found in a hole in the wall. Is OHR such a place? Probably not. But it remains the only Okonomiyaki place in Toronto (that i know of). The staff are Japanese too. So if you haven't tried Okonomiyaki before and don't want to fly all the way to Japan for it, this is pretty much the only place to do it.   For about $7-8, you get a pancake, okonomiyaki sauce, and mayo. You can choose stuffings from meat to seafood. You can add bonito flakes at extra cost. The ones I've tried in Japan are definitely better. But this one is not bad.  If for some reason you come here and don't get Okonomiyaki here, they also sell stuff like teriyaki. I recommend sticking with the Okonomiyaki because it's their specialty."}
{"text":"I have been here about three times and I just can't find myself liking it. My group had five people and they would only let us sit in a 4 seater without a 5th chair on the side. They wouldn't even let us combine a two-person table to the one we already had. Essentially, three of us had to squish onto one side....Good thing we were slim enough! Aside from the lack of elbow space, the staff members didn't check up on us and never smiled.  Maybe they had a bad day, but their demeanor made me rather apprehensive.   Food-wise, we tried the okonomiyaki in shrimp and pork.  Each time I've been here the okonomiyaki always tasted rather bland. It was difficult to taste anything but batter and thus it made me regret not getting the meat dishes instead. The neighbouring tables ordered meat dishes and I was drooling with envy.   Overall, I don't think I'll be returning.  Although the meat dishes look delish, I would rather go to meat focussed restaurants like the Wvrst or Gyubee. The star here is the okonomiyaki, but with them being so bland, my 2 cents are to pass on them."}
{"text":"I'm now simultaneously happy and sad to say that I've sampled the salmon teriyaki here - happy because it was nicely done, and sad because my tearing into it meant that my loved ones managed to make me temporarily abandon my vegetarianism!  Guilt aside, the fish came in several sizeable pieces (enough to render my guy full, compelling me to stuff the rest into myself), was not overly soft (but still came off the skin nicely), and packed a lot of fresh flavor."}
{"text":"Came here an hour before closing. We got the squid okonomiyaki, scallop okonomiyaki, and the yakiniku dinner set (comes with miso soup). The wait was kind of long for the food but I believe it's cause the chef makes all the okonomiyaki to order.   My yakiniku set was worth the $14, as it did fill me up quite well. I really liked the sumomo salad. The okonomiyaki was the perfect comfort food; although the seafood in it wasn't fresh.   I'd come here again, probably during the day as the red lighting is a bit strange."}
{"text":"Love this place. Satisfied those takoyaki cravings. Their menu is reasonably priced, opens late and food is on point. Japanese owned and offers a wide variety of choices. Best katsu I've tasted thus far! Curries really hit the spot. The snacks offered there add to the meal. Only down side is service is a little slow but well worth the wait..."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for ookonomiyaki! I love the seafood and chicken one - the sauce is sweet and slightly sour and every bite is delicious! I have also tried their yakisoba and it's quite good as well. Their ookonomiyaki is one layer though, so they don't really do other styles of it. They also have a custard flan that is a great finish to the meal."}
{"text":"If you're around downtown on a cold day, you need to eat here.  There's nothing more satisfying than warm homemade Okonomiyaki on a chilly day.  (It's also one of the OGs of authentic Japanese food in Toronto.)  The food gives me serious happy and fuzzy feelings; you can taste the experience, and attention to detail that goes into each dish."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had authentic Japanese food. Like, a Japanese man cooking on a large teppanyaki hot plate, using Japanese ingredients and flavours.  It's been a while.... Okonomi House provided the authentic experience I wanted. It was like Pikachu had a baby with Godzilla and gave birth to this Japanese beast of a restaurant. When I say beast, I don't mean that the interior is large because it's not. Those were just the first Japanese icons that came to mind when I thought of Japan...  Anyways, it's small and decorated like a Japanese restaurant, one you would from in Japan.   All of the workers spoke Japanese. The menu items were typical Japanese dishes. Their specialty is of course the Okonomiyaki which is a savory Japanese pancake that has some kind of seafood or meat in the batter. It's topped with Japanese mayo, Tonkatsu sauce, Nori slivers and bonito flakes. These are so good. I've had some in Vancouver, and these are on par.   I also ordered the Yakisoba, which is a stir-fried noodle with chicken. Delicious as well.   Okonomi House is authentic Japanese. It had the qualities I look for in a good restaurant, and then some. I was happy eating my food with Japanese speaking owners and servers. I was starting to get tired of Chinese speaking waiters at Japanese sushi restaurants.   This was a refreshing experience, one that you should try soon."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. I've been meaning to try here for a long time, and it's one of those you see all the time, but never get a chance to go.  Thursday evening, there was a few tables left. It's a lot smaller than I thought.   Menu consists of Okonomyaki ($6.95 the flour, soy, with sauce and a choice of beef, chicken, bean sprouts/veggies, shrimp, scallop etc - or all at a cost + 0.50 seaweed and bonito flakes), some bento boxes and appetizers.   It was really good, just a patty with some sauce and mayo on it. Real tasty tho. Lower expectations will make it really good.   We also got a bento box ($10.95) comes with soup, very minimal salad (like 5 leaves), some carrots/radish floating in some ice water (??), beef/onion/teriyaki sauce/bean sprout stirfry, and scoops (using a ice cream scoop) of rice.  Was ok, beef was a bit dry.   I'd come back if in area. I liked the egg on it in the photo! I want to get that next time!  and P.S. what's up with the suggestive logo?! We had lots of fun trying to figure out what it means."}
{"text":"A decent place that has been opened for many many years, the restaurant is a bit run down, however the food quality and price definitely worth you sitting down.  I had the Okonomi Yaki and beef teriyaki, both taste great, service is above average, and food comes fairly quick,  I have to say I am surprised they cleaned the bean part off the sprout, which not a lot of restaurant do anymore.  Will be here more often"}
{"text":"Don't miss this charming place which offers Japanese pancakes.  It's a cozy well distributed space in where you can watch the chefs in action, look through the window, read, and the most important thing: enjoy fresh food.  We ordered a miso soup, a seafood salad, and the deluxe seafood pancake. Although we both shared everything, we ended up extremely happy and satisfied.  The salad was crunchy, with iceberg lettuce, crab sticks, and tomato topped with a tasty vinaigrette.  I absolutely recommend the seafood pancake. We cut it in small slices, each of one felted creamy, tasted harmonic, made us comment about how big and succulent the shrimps were. It was made with love, graciously topped with mayo and some red sauce that I couldn't tell if it was ketchup or something else... (Added to my good list).  The service was fast and friendly. I also liked the vibe, so I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The bacon okonomiyaki taste so good! My friend doesn't really like cabbage but she really liked it too. Reasonable price and really friendly service!"}
{"text":"Small quaint and cozy joint.  Staff is very friendly. Ordered miso soup and seafood okoyomaki.  Miso soup is too salty.  The okoyomaki is interesting.  It's like a grilled potato pancake with shrimp, scallop, squid and some artificial crabmeat.  I didn't find them thin like others are saying.  I think it's a perfect lunch serving.    Food: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 2.5/5 (old donut shop type of feeling) Service: 3/5  Would visit again because of the uniqueness of the place"}
{"text":"Been coming here for decades quite literally. The okonomi here are the best in Toronto as this is the place that introduced the dish to the city  You do get more than you can eat.  The service is good, the food is excellent and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I walked in somewhat greeted by a nonchalant older lady and a somewhat interested mid-age lady but didn't notice the MAN that Chris P. conversed.  I chose my own spot on this Wednesday afternoon with only one other table of 2 having Burger Steak($7.55) and Yakisoba($7.55).  I was given an order list to check off my Shrimp Okonomiyaki($6.55) and Aonori & Katsuobushi($0.50) where I saw the Cook behind the OILY glass display cook on the Teppan.  While I wait I notice the decor is definitely fitting of a Fast Food restaurant but however notice on their sign outside they define themself as Fine Dining.  The Shrimp Okonomiyaki came and I was somewhat underwhelmed as it didn't have the overall appearance I had imagined or had during my past trip.  The PANCAKE was unusually thin with the uncharacteristic dollop of Mayo rather than the \"Well\" pattern which is the criss-cross, as well the Aonori & Katsuobushi was given on the side rather than placed on top.  Maybe I had too much high hopes?!? Not really!  The GOOD part of the Okonomiyaki was that the Shrimp was perfectly cooked but still I am reminded of an Omelette here rather than an Okonomiyaki.  For the size of this item, I would say it is an acceptable Snack or Pre-snack which was my intent as I was heading for the next meal.  2.5 *Stars*"}
{"text":"Loved it! The lighting and the atmosphere made me feel like I'd taken a plane to Japan for dinner. I ordered the veggie okonomiyaki and sat on the bar facing the griddle. I was excited because this would be my first okonomiyaki since I'd had a Hiroshimayaki for the first time in Japan ages ago. But I was also nervous, well .. because this would be my first okonomiyaki since I'd had a Hiroshimayaki for the first time in Japan ages ago. Outcome: I loved it!   As a vegetarian it was an awesome treat to be able to enjoy this popular snack. I paired it with a ginger ale and some edamame and had one of the funnest, most authentic and unpretentious dinners that was totally worth the money in Toronto."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often -  don't expect fine dining, but if you live downtown and you want quick okonomiyaki, then this is where you should go. They have many options - beef, pork, chicken, squid, scallop, shrimp, and veggie.   My GF and I often split the Shrimp, Scallop and Veggie okonomiyaki - so I can vouch for those. I recently had the Squid, and it was excellent.   Absolutely recommend. Especially if you love perfect circles. Also, when you put the bonito flakes on the pancakes, they dance around like they are alive, but trust me they are not alive. Definitely don't give each bonito flake a name and definitely don't anthropomorphize them or you'll find it difficult to eat your meal. Don't name any of them \"Bonzo\" or \"Tony\", those are fine names, but come on. They're just flakes."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe how many times I've passed this place over the years and dismissed it as some regular normal Japanese restaurant!  This was my first okonomiyaki experience, and not bloody likely to be my last!  The shrimp okonomiyaki with extra veggies (and bonito flakes) went for about $8, enough to quench my appetite on an empty stomach.   For those who don't know, okonomiyaki is a delicious Japanese pancake made with egg, topped with a bbq like sauce and a dash of mayo.  Can you say flavor explosion?   There's really nothing bad I can say about this place; the prices are great, food is fantastic, staff is nice, and the service is FAST!  Correction, one bad thing I can say is that there's limited seating.  I don't recommend going in groups larger than eight."}
{"text":"This is a pretty no frills restaurant; we were seated quickly and our orders were taken promptly (ordering is similar to Vietnamese pho places - checklist style). I had the chicken okonomiyaki and my partner had the seafood deluxe. Like previous reviewers, adding the bonito and seaweed (+$0.50) is something you should definitely do; it adds an umami-oomph to your okonomiyaki. My chicken okonomiyaki was satisfying - chicken wasn't dry and there were pretty sizeable pieces. The seafood okonomiyaki looked like it had pretty large pieces of seafood in it as well (I saw a juicy piece of shrimp emerge from my date's plate). Although the portion size looks like it's a bit small, the okonomiyaki is filling, and you won't leave hungry!   TLDR: I would come back for a quick, delicious and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"It is always a great experience when I come down to the original okonomiyaki house.  I had initially been introduced to it a decade ago and very little has changed.  It is very small so seating is limited but turn around times are pretty fast.  My favourite dish there is the pork okonomiyaki and the green salad.  The green salad is a true Japanese green salad and is very refreshing to say the least.  The pork okonomiyaki comes with a sauce and mayo that give it a perfect combination of tart and just all around melt in your mouth goodness.  Definitely the best okonomiyaki in Toronto hands down.  We got my kids the yaki soba and that was delicious as well.  All in all it is one of my favourite places, quick and delicious."}
{"text":"They provide a nice selection (about 8-10) different okonomiyakis for you to choose from.  I enjoyed the scallop okonomiyaki along with the shrimp variety.    I recommend getting the additional nori and dashi toppings to sprinkle onto your okonomiyakis as well!  They were cooked well and the seafood wasn't overly cooked or rubbery.  The okonomiyaki had a tangy note from the sauce they brush onto during cooking as well the dollop of mayo they place on top.  Service was fast and efficient but there is less seating than what the storefront would seem to offer.  This place is good to just drop-in and grab a quick and filling bite.  :-)"}
{"text":"The price was a little above regular for the amount given. I was satisfied with the serving but could have ate more when you think about the price for the amount given. I shared two okonomiyaki's and three puddings with two other people (my friends). I had to wait a little but that was fine. The service was nice as well."}
{"text":"Very good ! I felt like I was in a little NYC joint. Always a good sign when you go to a Japanese restaurant and there are lots of Japanese people there :). Will definitely be back. Not a place for a date but good for a quick friendly dinner."}
{"text":"Been going to eat here for lunch for years. It's a great place to try something truly unique and tastes great! I get cravings for it sometimes. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for something other than the usual burgers and fries found around the city."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly staff, great vibe. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. Thumbs up, it's a must try!!"}
{"text":"Well... Where should I start... First with all my respect to the Yelp community, you guys are being fooled by this restaurant.  The \"Okonomiyaki\" that they serve is not Okonomiyaki, is not even close to the real dish at all. For that reason they shouldn't be called OkonomiHouse, the restaurant name should be just \"House\"  Overall Review: Place: It's clean, organize mmmm i guess that's it..   Service: It took them a while to make a flat pancake, sorry for calling it like that but it just doesn't deserve to be called \"Okonomiyaki\". The server was nice and friendly.  Food: Let's talk specifically about their \"Okonomiyaki\", as I said it taste like pancake with Okonomiyaki sauce bought from J-Town. That sauce doesn't even taste home made. That day i went there with a Japanese friend and even she was ashamed/embarrassed of eating that. She couldn't believed that a restaurant run by Japanese people is serving that, if they were Chinese or Korean or Filipino we might had given them 4 Stars in this review.  Final Comments: I never tell anyone to not go to a restaurant, you gotta go there to experience the place and get your own opinion, just don't order their \"Okonomiyaki\" it is a too expensive pancake and they have better stuff there to try."}
{"text":"Okonomiyaki: It's like a pancake-omelette thing, with stuff inside it and topped with a sweet-ish sauce. Cheap and filling. I recommend the Seafood Deluxe, which is chock full of goodies from the ocean: giant shrimp, scallops, and squid. I also like the burger steak, which is a Japanese-style hamburger patty topped with sauce and served on a bed of cooked bean sprouts with a little helping of rice. (It sounds gross, but it's tasty.)   Not good for groups, though, so keep your party small!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come to this restaurant on regular basis because we love the okonomiaky they serve here, always done well and as authentic as you can find in Canada. The service is friendly and the restaurant is quaint.  Great place to bring your date for a little dinner or maybe grab a lunch if you work around here"}
{"text":"We love this place. It is a \"must\" for us when we visit Toronto.  They have other Japanese fare, but you really want to come here for the okonomiyaki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki). You can watch the cook expertly prepare these delicious treats, which are served covered with tonkatsu sauce and a dollop of mayo in the middle. Fillings can be beef, pork, bacon, vegetable, shrimp, scallop, or squid. We've tried the shrimp, scallop and bacon and they are all generous in the filling.  Paying 0.50 to be presented with communal containers of bonito flakes and dried seaweed is a little odd, but whatever!   The waitresses are very friendly. I suppose you can make a game of trying to get the cook to crack a smile as he stoically prepares food on the grill. We couldn't. Service was good when we came in (the place was about 3/4 full at 8 PM on Boxing Day) ... it took a little effort to get someone's attention when we wanted to order another pancake.  Don't come here for ambiance ... it's a crowded hole-in-the-wall ... you navigate around cases of beer and wine to get to the restrooms. They don't take reservations and it looks like their capacity is to seat about 28 in twos and fours. The sound system occasionally gets louder all by itself, which is a bit weird.  Come for the okonomiyaki."}
{"text":"Very traditional decor and servers are very friendly and accommodating. The okonomiyaki are delicious - I highly recommend the bacon, beef and chicken okonomiyaki. I've tried the other dishes on the menu - they were average at best. I would definitely come back again, but only for the okonomiyaki."}
{"text":"Having travelled to Osaka, Japan recently, I've grown to miss the okonomiyaki restaurants on every other street corner. As popular as it is in Japan, it is hard to come by in Toronto, as every Japanese-themed restaurant specializes in either sushi or ramen.   Okonomiyaki is an Osakan soul food consisting of grilled cabbage, eggs, and WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT! Whether you want seafood (by far the best option in my opinion), beef, chicken, bacon... They'll mix it in for you. The result? A wonderful savoury pancake.   I opted to try the bacon. In Japan, bacon isn't prepared as crispy as it is here, but rather, it is prepared in a thicker, soggier fashion akin to ham. Thankfully, the bacon was cooked Canadian-style, because the crispiness fused wonderfully with the pancake's otherwise soft texture. At the price of $6.95, this dish makes for a great deal for lunch or dinner.   Okonomi House serves an array of meats in their okomomiyaki, all of which are around $7, with the exception of their seafood deluxe, which rings in at $13. They also have some other Japanese dishes and drinks available, such as teriyaki and yakisoba.   One thing I particularly enjoyed was the Japanese feel of the restaurant, from the tightly packed tables, to the decor, to the etiquette and treatment from the staff. It was one of the more authentic experiences I've had at a Japanese restaurant in Toronto.   Tip: Ask for the bonito flakes and the seaweed flakes, I totally forgot about them and wasn't reminded by the waiters!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant and the only place that I know of to get okonomiyaki in Toronto. There is a limited amount of seats so you may need to wait. They can accommodate bigger groups. You can place your order by marking up a paper menu. I ordered beef okonomiyaki ($6.35), extra mayo and shared bonito flakes ($0.50) with 2 others. I thought the okonomiyaki tasted great and I was satisfied with the portion although it looks small. It makes for a fufilling light and affordable meal. It was also very simple although you could add extra toppings for a price.  I would definitely go back when an opportunity arises."}
{"text":"I went on a date night tonight with my fiancé and the food here was great! The place got a little packed since it's a kinda small, but the food came out fast and service was great! I'll be sure to be back and I'll bring friends too!!!!"}
{"text":"From the outside, the restaurant itself didn't really look inviting. However, inside, the aroma of cooking food, sound of the grill being fired up is a whole different story.  I ordered the beef okonomiyaki and was surprised to see an abundance of meat inside. The bowl of bonito and sea weed also complimented my meal nicely. The portion was just enough to keep you comfortably full for the next few hours.  Only complaint would be the tiny dining area and wouldn't recommend it for a part of 7/+."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is near where I work, so I occasionally do come here for a quick lunch.  Nothing really special about this restaurant, but if you want some unique taste, feeling for some traditional Japanese snack and a quick bite, this is the place to go!  This place is known for their Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancakes) and have a few varieties to choose from.  My favorite is the seafood or chicken.  If you are ever around the area and want to have a low budget but an unique experience.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Unchanged while the decades past by,Okononomi has stayed true to its roots. A truly authentic Japanese street food experience in the heart of Toronto with its welcoming laterns and open griddle that has a 'sizzle' for each order made fresh. I've been coming here ever since a little boy, and I take every opportunity to make a stop when in the area.   Seated at the small counter and presented with the usual order sheet and pencil, I check off the chicken Okonomi and a side of rice. How can you not appreciate the experience of watching your order being made and brought to you fresh. The wizened master chef toiling for years and years over the same griddle (probably) serving up a fabulous savoury pancake with a dollop mayo in the center.   The prices are barely changed, very reasonable for that spot. You must try this piece of true Toronto bliss in the heart of the city unabashedly modest, true to its origins and a part of history."}
{"text":"I have never tried okonomi before today and now I am a devotee!  I went for lunch with a couple of friends today. Be forewarned, the lunch portions are HUGE. My friend and I shared the seafood deluxe okonomi and it was delicious and extremely filling. Huge shrimp, calamari, really generous servings in this dish. Our other friend had the chicken teriyaki and it was a very full plate of large pieces of chicken on a bed of rice.  This place is not very big and quite popular. Quick, efficient service, though and very affordable for the large portions. I want to go back and try the non-deluxe pancakes because maybe that deluxe pancake was extra-large in comparison. I'll let you know!"}
{"text":"Simple and hearty food. More on the home cooked side. Environment is casual and relaxed. Decently busy. Came here on a rainy weekday and the food and vibe felt just right. Almost like a casual diner but it's japanese style instead. It's also not that expensive, about 8 dollars for the okonomiyaki"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This is the second time that I've been to Okonomi House. I had their okonomiyaki (pork & beef) on both occasions since that's what they specialize in. The okonomiyaki was well-cooked so it had a nice sear on top of a dense sponge-like base. The fillings were also evenly distributed and in decent portions. However, there was too little cabbage which resulted in a lack of texture. The layer of sauce was also on the sour side and the mayo was too tangy. But what really bothers me is that you have to pay for bonito flakes & seaweed when they should be part of the dish, not as an add-on. I would still get it though b/c it makes a huge difference in terms of taste & texture.  Overall, their okonomiyaki makes a pretty decent & filling meal esp considering the cost ($7.99). However, I've had better-- and it would be great if they can offer it Hiroshima-style as well (ie. add a yakisoba base)."}
{"text":"I been here many times but still I don't get to understand all the hype of this place. Their okonomiyaki is just mediocre and nothing special. It's like food court food. Decor of the place isn't attractive either. And service?! Oh gosh I won't waste my time to comment on that. I rather go to izakaya for okonomiyaki since there is no other okonomiyaki places in Toronto but still they serve better okonomiyaki than this place. Save your money and go somewhere else. There are many izakayas not too far from here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both experiences were very similar although once was for lunch and once for dinner. I've tried their different okonomiyakis as well as their other fried dishes. Their Japanese pancakes are what makes them unique, so I'd suggest sticking to those. Their other fried noodle and rice dishes aren't that special and are very, very salty. For the okonomiyakis, I wouldn't suggest adding any toppings as the mayonnaise they give you already is plenty to add to the flavour itself. Service is simple and not that attentive, and seating is quite cramped. Given that it's a small restaurant, they do try to cram in as many people as possible. Finally, because their kitchen is an open kitchen, the entire place is quite oily and greasy smelling, so you will leave this restaurant smelling a little oily and greasy."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars  Ok, I confess. As a hard core Yelp foodie I can honestly say other than sushi or tempura I just don't know all that much about Japanese food. What I do know though is that one of the best all time Yelp writers Janelle P. had sent me a note letting me know that her and her honey T.J. were on their way to the Hog Town and was I interested in meeting up with them and a couple of other Yelpers for a bite to eat. Oh my gawd, I'm not worthy! I devour Janelle's reviews like they were Kobe beef so I was over the moon to say the very least at the prospect of breaking bread with such a respected Yelper.   The invite was to the Okonomi House who's specialty benchmark dish is Okonomiyaki. So ya got me here. I'm thinking Okonomiyaki is a Japanese art form involving folded napkins. What the hell, for a chance to gobble niblets with Janelle and a couple of A-One primo Yelp wordsmithers, Susan & Deanna, I'd have been ready to twist up my legs like a couple of Origami pretzels.   The simplest way I can describe Okonomiyaki is to say that it is a Japanese pancake/omelet about the size of a miniature frisbee, cooked until it is crispy and dark and then slathered with a brown savoury sauce that is a combo of some sort of Japanese mayo and what I thought was a cross between Hoisin meets Worcester sauce. It's odd but it works. Then we sprinkled added toppings such as paper thin slivers of dried fish that began curling up and dancing on top of the pancake as soon as they adorned the hot surface of them. You choose the fillings which can be anything from bacon, shrimp, squid, pork....you get the idea. Okonomiyaki is delicious, however, with that being said, ultimately what I'd prefer is for them to be a bit crispier. They are deceiving because at first when I dug into them I was expecting the crunch factor because they are dark and on a cast iron plate but in fact they were soft, much like an omelet.  Hands down my fav was most definitely the bacon option.    This small little restaurant is tucked in behind the madness that is almost Yonge & Bloor meets the Manulife centre. If you go in the evening just look for the orange glow. The biggest upside of this little spot is the price point. Okonomi is just downright reasonable and our wallets remained safely intact and not much lighter than when we arrived. Okonomiyaki for five...cost $50 bucks.....Dinner with Janelle P. and my fellow FARC's Susan & Deanna....priceless."}
{"text":"Very limited choice. Food didn't taste good either - I had tried Okonomi Yaki - Seafood Deluxe. Pricier for this range of restaurants. Two star for the location and cozy ambience. Service is ok."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend. It was both our first time trying the place out. We've never had okonomiyaki before and it was a first for that too. I like the welcoming vibe it gave off. Nice service too.   Ordered two pancakes and the beef burger set. Really enjoyed the beef burger the most. Recommend getting bonito flakes along with the pancakes! Makes it so much better. The portions of the pancakes were moderate but it was very filling. For sure coming back."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here, but I am upset with this restaurant.  We called in advance to reserve for a party of 15.  Although they do not take reservations, they said if we showed up, they could accommodate us.  However when we arrived, they wanted to seat us in groups of 4 at staggered times.  1 star for lying.   EDIT:  I decided to go back and give this place a proper review.  To my original dismay, this place kicks ass.  It has all the 3 qualities you want when you are hungry.  Good, Fast, Decent Price.  If it is your first time, try the \"Japanese Pancake\" It is basically a pancake filled with meat veggies and topped with BBQ and Hollandaise Sauce.  We were 4 people.  4 miso soup 4 entrées:   2 beef Teriyaki   1 sea food terikyaki   1 chicken pancake 2 cokes 1 beer 1 sake  60$ including tip  I don't suggest bring groups larger than 4."}
{"text":"A friendly place with nice food. The squid okonomiyaki was good and the side portions of bonito and seaweed was huge. I kind of wish the mayo was spread out instead of dolloped on in the center, but other than that no complaints c:"}
{"text":"i ordered the vege japanese pancake and mom got the seafood teriyaki. mom said the teriyaki  sauce is awesome, and the pancake takes sooooo good, especially the sauce on the top! definitely gonna come again!!!"}
{"text":"BEST comfort food, I was in town winter time (3 yrs ago) and I was so glad to find this place. As far as I can tell they are very authentic (they have some Canadianized version of Okonomiyaki too). The owner and people working there were very nice Japanese peeps. I \"think\" they were using otafuku sauce, not bulldog(someone please find out). I had Okonomiyaki in many cities outside of Japan, but this was probably the best I had so far, including many Izakaya type place in NY or Torrance (these days most places offer frozen ones...yikes) I can't wait to visit them next time!"}
{"text":"Heard it serves really good okonomi and always wanted to give it a try, but since menu it's quite small, kinda hard to expect it to be a full dinner meal. So I came to try this one evening when I wasn't too hungry.  Its a very small gem which you will find near the busy streets of Yonge. It's family owned so it feels more cozy then fancy. There's only about 30 seats in the restaurant, considering it's big already because it's at the corner of the plaza.  Once you walk in, you get a sheet of paper as you are seated, as well as a menu. You basically check off what you want on the sheet of paper to order which I find very convenient. We ordered a squid okonomi and a yakisoba and also bonito flakes & seaweed.  You have to ask them for water or else they won't serve you anything to drink. It wasn't too long of a wait until we got our food, the okonomi smelt delicious, they bring you a small bowl of bonito flakes and a jar of dried seaweed to sprinkle on top. The yakisoba look appetizing as well. Okonomi was absolutely AMAZING! No wonder they are called okonomi house because the okonomi they make can't be beaten by any other place in Toronto! The yakisoba was just average, nothing to special about it, just some noodles stir-fried with some meats and veggies. Tasted better when you add seaweed on it. On the side of the soba, it comes with a plain ball of white rice and also miso soup.   Service is very minimal as they only seat you, take your order sheet and brings you food, also it's slow. If you want to pay credit or use the machine, you have to bring your bill to the front where the cashier is.    I would come back to this place to eat ONLY okonomi, everything else is just very average which you can easily find elsewhere. Prices are also considered reasonable for the quantity and quality of food you get, so it's pretty fair."}
{"text":"This is the only place I'm aware of in the city to get Okonomiyaki. If you've never had the stuff before, it's a Japanese savoury crepe like dish. Well sort of, anyway. It's so damn good. Thankfully Okonomi House does a great job cooking it up. There are all sorts of varieties: beef, chicken, scallops, shrimp, seafood, etc. They are all served with a sort of BBQ sauce on top, and a dollop of sweet mayonnaise.  Okonomi House serves other Japanese dishes, but it seems like a waste to come here and not try Okonomiyaki.  This place has been around for ages. It's tucked away behind the Manulife centre -- a very convenient and central location if you're in the city. The place is pretty small. I wouldn't come here with a giant group, things won't work out well. The atmosphere is very casual. It's a charming little place. All the dishes are quite cheap, which is another plus.   They serve Kirin beer, which is next to impossible to find in the city when compared with Asahi and Sapporo.  I'm not sure everyone will like Okonomiyaki, but it's definitely worth trying at least one."}
{"text":"Good food.  Fast service. It was about a 10 minutes wait at most.  Cheap pancake prices. Their other menu is also reasonable prices.   I don't know any other Japanese Pancake places so my opinion on the taste has nothing to compare it to. But, I'd go back here again and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried the pork and seafood versions of the okonomi  on two separate occasions and they were well-seasoned and cooked well. I think I may have been underwhelmed by the sauce flavor hence my lower than normal rating.   Service is always efficient and it's in a very convenient spot. I'd come again to introduce friends to okonomi but probably not on my own."}
{"text":"The server is ridiculous. We ordered 3 dishes at the start but one of the dishes never came out so we talked to the server, well the server never go back to check our order and just added one more dish to the bill. After we found out there are four dishes they just said that we did not ordered the two dishes at the beginning and said that we add the two dishes afterwards and want to change us something we did not get. Absolutely ridiculous. Btw it taste bad."}
{"text":"Delicious. Good portions, reasonable prices. Fast. Wonderful staff. Great ambience.   This place is truly a gem. Came here after work, ordered a chicken okonomiyaki. It was delicious! Also got the caramel pudding which was just as great. The servers gave us our pudding right after we finished the savoury meal.   The place is ran by a friendly woman and a chef. During our stay, two waiters clocked in on their chefs. The place isn't so busy so the staff are quite attentive and friendly.   Most customers are university students but there were some office workers and families as well. It's quite nice.   Will definitely come back to try more of their foods!!!"}
{"text":"Okonomiyaki is a japanese take on pancakes. I got mine with beef and flakes. Flakes and beef taste great. The pancake batter has a slight, but noticeable egg taste, and that makes for a horrible (to me...) and lasting \"eggy\" after-taste in your mouth. Bleh!!! So I probably will not get it again. If you are fine with eggs, then it should not be a problem.  Yakiniku is another great option."}
{"text":"Went here with my hubby for dinner on my birthday. The place is relatively small but luckily there was enough room for the both of us. We ordered a bacon okonomiyaki and a chicken okonomiyaki. Service was good, very tentative and even offered us second helpings of bonito and seaweed for our okonomiyaki. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The time has come for me to pay my respects to the joint that first got me hooked on Japanese food.  I've been coming to this place for a *minute* -- way longer than I can recall -- and it still makes me smile all goofy.  Some of us have lived here long enough to remember the time when there were like 5 Japanese places in the GTA, and this was the only place serving anything other than mediocre sushi.  It was a revelation then, and so it remains.  As Japanese cooking goes, it doesn't get much simpler than this, but something magical happens when something simple is done PERFECTLY, and that is how these guys do it.  I'm so happy it's still there for me.  And that I'm finally old and wise enough to appreciate bonito flakes and mayo.  Pancakes and pork for dinner?  Does it get any more Canadian?"}
{"text":"I come to this place time to time. Own by real Japanese and real Japanese food.This place gets busy and always have people here. Food price from 7.95. Good customer service and delicious food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, flavorful and affordable. This place hits the mark. The okonomiyaki is fluffy, tasty and filling, savory, sweet and tangy, although the okonomiyaki sauce is a little heavy on the ketchup. And for less than $10, it's a good deal, especially for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Still love this place! Small, busy, good prices, great food, excellent service! the half bacon, half shrimp okonomiyaki! You re welcome!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite place for okonomiyaki in the GTA. The food is great! The only downside is that the service is usually not so great and you have to pay extra for the bonito flakes. It's in a great location - walkable from YB but if you drive, there's parking on the side of the street and an underground parking lot close by."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend who has high praises for this place that she drops by everytime she's in downtown. Honestly for me though, I think this place is pretty mediocre and Im sure I've had better okonomi at food fests. I ordered the scallop okonomi with bonito flakes while my friend ordered a chicken one. My scallop one wasn't as tasty as the chicken, and I find the thick layer of teriyaki sauce to be too overpowering. It was great to have the bonito flakes and that seaweed sprinkle powder that they provide you on the table, but just overall, I find the okonomi to be pretty average."}
{"text":"Very savoury Japanese pancakes. If you like onion flakes and seaweed, always sprinkle those on your pancakes! It adds a good texture to it. This place gets packed during the evenings."}
{"text":"For being one of the few okonomiyaki places in north america, this place should get a 4 star for the effort.  The okonomiyaki is decent if you don't know how to make it or aren't too experienced.  However, if you are a die hard fan (had them in Japan or you make them yourself) then your experience will be slightly disappointing.  We had two okonomiyaki (one bacon and one scallops).  There was no fresh green onion and the mayo tasty slightly off (not kewpie mayo). We preferred a little more cabbage in our okonomiyaki and we actually prefer the ones we make at home. However, if you're just craving some okonomiyaki, this place might help with the craving."}
{"text":"- What I have tried: + bacon okonomiyaki (4/5): very flavourful pancake with lots of veggies and sauces. The pancake was quite thick, it did not come with bonito flakes and seaweed so you have to tell the server if you want them for an extra 50cents. It tasted very different from all the pancakes I have tried, but the bacon did not really impress me much, I felt like either they didnt put enough bacon or the sauce was too strong that I couldnt even taste bacons. My bf loved this so much that he had to ordered another one takeout + pork okonomiyaki (5/5): I like this one more mainly because I could actually taste the meat. It taste very similar to the bacon one but came with pork instead of bacon. Same sauce, same veggies and the level of thickness lol  - Portion is good for light afternoon snack, if you want to be full you need two pancakes or one pancake and something else - Price is fair, well pretty cheap actually - Location is very convenient since it is located near the bay/bloor intersection"}
{"text":"Very tasty meal.   Had great Miso soup and a good salmon teriyaki...so nice meal and cute little place..been here forever...used to go here years ago..."}
{"text":"After having eaten at so many Westernized sushi places, my wife and I craved something new. Okonomi House fit the bill perfectly, providing an authentic Japanese food experience that was different than what we were used to.  The menu isn't what you'd expect at a typical Japanese restaurant in Toronto. It is very limited, consisting of basic appetizers (Japanese soups and salads), lunch and dinner specials (e.g. different meats on beds of rice), and of course, the Okonomiyaki section. If you're going to come out, the Okonomiyaki is the feature food you should be trying.  I didn't know what to expect, but Okonomiyaki is basically a Japanese pancake with whatever feature ingredient you choose baked within it (the options being beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, veggie, or seafood deluxe). On top is a type of soy sauce, with a small blob of a sweet mustard/cream.  I had the pork and my wife had the shrimp. We made one order of the Katsuobushi (it comes as a side which you can easily split), which are very thin flakes of fish that \"dance\" on top of the Okonomiyaki from the heat. They were both delicious! Though I felt that the pork made for a better combination than the shrimp. They are more filling than they look, and you could probably leave feeling comfortably full with just this, but you're safer ordering a small appetizer along with it.  The place is pretty small, and we had to wait a couple of minutes for a spot to free up, so I wouldn't bring a large group. It's a humble place that feels like a small diner, but it has an authentic, non-Westernized feel to it. It's nice!  Trying this delicious new kind of food was a great experience, and we'll definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Okonomi House. Clearly I am not the only fan, as this establishment fills up so quickly no matter when you go. The restaurant is spacious and is manned by the same lady every time you enter the store, and you're whisked away to a table with marble-blue swirls on the surface. You receive a menu with descriptions of the food and an ordering menu, where you can check off what you want on the piece of paper. After ordering, the appetizers arrive quickly; the entrees will take a little longer, but the wait is never too extreme.   I've tried most of their okonomiyaki, which is always hot and tasty, especially with their bonito (dried fish) and nori (seaweed) flakes. Okonomiyaki is basically savoury pancake with a multitude of ingredients placed inside like vegetables and squid, and it's a must-try for first time visitors! I have a rather small appetite, but I can easily polish off one serving of okonomiyaki because it's so delicious.   Their sunomono salad is marinated in plum vinegar instead of rice vinegar, so it tastes slightly sweet. They contain generous servings of imitation crab and chopped up cucumbers in pretty bowls. Their miso soup tastes like... well, miso soup. It's hard to go wrong with it. I would recommend against ordering any teas, as they just dunk a tea bag into a pot of boiling water- it's not worth the price! I've also tried their other dishes, such as yakiniku and yakisoba. These arrive as a set with miso soup and sunomono (it's in their description). It's slightly pricier but still a good deal.   You won't find another store with better okonomiyaki than this location. It's always so homey and comfortable to eat in here, and I see customers that come in for either a family meal or for dates, so it's a very versatile restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best place for okonomi in town  A very cozy place and nice staff .  We have tried 2 different okonomi and both where very good .  Definitely going back again to try different dishes."}
{"text":"Mmm... yummy okonomiyaki just like in Osaka! (different from the Hiroshima-style that has noodles at the bottom). It's hard to find Kansai cuisine in Toronto, so this restaurant is pretty unique.  This is probably the most satisfying and cheapest meal you could find in Yorkville. Not a ton of seating room, but service is fast and efficient. Like in some Chinese restaurants, the menu is on a sheet of paper and you just tick which items you want and wave to your server when you're ready.  Okonomiyaki (literally \"as you like it\") ranges from $5-10 roughly. Vegetarian is the cheapest and the mixed seafood one is the most \"expensive\". It's served hot off the grill with lots of sauce and a dollop of mayo. It's pretty filling, but if you want to add to your meal, there is miso soup, edamame, sunomono salad, and green tea ice cream. You can drink Japanese beers or cold drinks like Calpico (Japanese yogurt drink)."}
{"text":"$10.00 (after tax and tip) will get you a plate of Okonomiyaki.  I'm still on a search for Hiroshima style, and that wasn't on the menu.  Though I'm wondering if they would create it, if asked for?  They have the ingredients...  I don't like that you have to pay 50 cents extra for the flakes.  That just seems cheap, as they're an integral part of the dish.  If you're seeking Okonomiyaki, it's your best option in the city - but I found it somewhat lacking."}
{"text":"I will eat anything in pancake form, so I was super-looking forward to trying the Japanese variety!  Ordered the vegetarian and chicken okonomiyaki and a side order of stir-fried vegetables. The pancakes were definitely the big winner, as the stir-fry was 90% bean sprouts (boo-urns!) and lacked the advertised carrots and broccoli.   The pancakes were light but dense, and mine was packed full of generous chunks of chicken. And yes, the pancakes are not like the ones you get at the Griddle - they're more eggy with a bit of flour, like a dense omelette. For an additional .50, we added bonito and seaweed flakes (you literally receive a heaping bowlful of it on the side) which was a nice topping addition.  Minor quibble: the restaurant isn't well ventilated, you'll leave with your clothes and hair smelling like pancakes and teriyaki sauce for the rest of the day (unless you like that sort of thing.)  The staff were super-friendly, warm and attentive, and I loved the charming old-school orange vinyl seats and relaxed decor. A real hidden gem amongst the bustle and pretension of Bloor Street's \"Mink Mile\" district."}
{"text":"Not bad. It's not great either. I like having the option, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it. Definitely get the bonito flakes if you're going for an okonomiyaki. It is clean inside though."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and it was really busy when I went. All tables were taken care of, we got seated right away (table for 2) and the waitresses were very helpful and kind. The food was really unique, I had the chicken pancake type meal. I really loved the sauce, and will be coming back to try something else (it was hard to choose with such good selection)"}
{"text":"Until today I didn't even know Japanese pancakes (okonomi yaki) existed. I've been working in the Manulife Center for over 2 years and never noticed Okonomi House. Today I finally stumbled upon this place randomly.  Okonomi House looks more like a old school diner than a Japanese restaurant. The service is super quick and the food is cheap. I ordered a vegetable pancake ($5.95) and had no idea what to expect until it landed on my table.  What I got was a 20cm pancake filled with bean sprouts, red & green peppers, and onions. It reminded me more of a potato latke than a pancake; there was no potato though. The pancake was smothered in a dark sauce that tasted like HP sauce and topped with a dallop of some creamy yellow mystery sauce.  At first I was a little skeptical because the flavours weren't what I was expecting. But, after a few bites, I was loving it. It was like Japanese comfort food. Definitely an interesting experience and a tasty lunch option in the Bloor & Yonge area. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has seriously helped me through the winter. Not only is this an amazing place with amazing food, the people here are just as cool! If you come to this area frequently you should be well aware of the choices for food. Things like burgers and pasta are everywhere! If you want to try something different, definitely give this place a try and you won't regret it.  The place has a very warm feel to it and although a little small, it has a decent amount of seats. The wait time is normally quite short even when it looks packed inside."}
{"text":"Tucked away on a corner of Charles Street, Okonomi House is a lovable hidden gem. Walking in on a Tuesday night, I was greeted by the warm and subdued red light of the traditional hanging lanterns as well as a quietly cheerful server who let me know I could seat myself. Everything feels personal and authentic here. The space is pretty tiny by restaurant standards, with seating for roughly around 15 people, so it's cozy and intimate (perfect for dates and possibly awful for groups over 4). The ambiance is just really really nice. Okonomi is an informal 'seat yourself' type of spot, so as soon as I was all settled in, the server glided by and dropped a menu on my table and glided away as quickly as she showed up. The menu is a piece of paper with a paper, kinda, all u can eat style where you check mark what you'd like. So off I went, check marking a Bottle of Sapporo, & a SEAFOOD DELUXE Okonomi (I also splurged on the 50 cents worth of Dried Seaweed and Bonito (or Katsuobushi Flakes for those in the know). My lil' paper was taken, and a few minutes later, I get my beer. The pacing of service here is pretty quick so it wasn't long before my glorious okonomi was placed in front of me in it's majestic pancakey way.  The Okonomi - My seafood deluxe consisted of shrimp, scallop and I believe calamari? Anyways, it was a delicious savory pancake, packed with a perfect amount of oceanic protein, it was also slathered in a thin layer of teriyaki sauce and and looked cute as heck with a dollop of a mayo type sauce. Springing for the seaweed and smoked fish flakes was well worth it since it really brought out that great fresh sea flavor.  It was such a lovely pick me up meal at the end of a COLD day (the pancake was served piping hot and stayed so untill I got about 3/4 through.)   Will absolutely return again when I am craving comfort food under the dimmed red light of Okonomi House :D"}
{"text":"It's probably family-owned. The staff is very friendly. Very affordable. You must try the Japanese pancakes. It's their speciality."}
{"text":"Was my first Japanese food experience and I liked it overall. It has a nice decor that really attracted me especially that I loved to know more about Japan. The staff were friendly and the food quality was decent. I haven't had any other Japanese experience to compare, but I could say they cared about the food quality and customers.  I do remember the waitress was very friendly and helpful. I think it's a great place to start eating Japanese food ! Japanese are amazing folks and I had to try their food :-)"}
{"text":"It was my first time getting something like this, and I was a little nervous that I wouldn't like it. It was great! Though the service was a bit slow, the food was really good.   The portions are smaller than I expected, but priced fairly. We should have ordered three pancakes between the three of us, because one wasn't quite enough."}
{"text":"Got the salmon plate for lunch. Ran me over $16. Tiny, like really tiny, thin piece of dry salmon (which was cooked right before I ate so I thought it would be better). Okonomiyakis from the look of it definitely did not look legit or authentic at all. They are not supposed to look that doughey or pancakey. Obviously unfair since I have not tasted it yet but that is not how good okonomiyakis are supposed to look. So for anyone who is saying that this is authentic - like whats your basis?"}
{"text":"Perfect Okonomiyaki ya for T.O.  The Okonomiyaki was good, inexpensive, and they have fast service.  Too bad the atmosphere is not nicer - it's a bit \"fast food\" like.  Also, seems silly to charge extra for bonito flakes and seaweed.  However, they do what they do well - very tasty okonomiyaki."}
{"text":"Just visiting Toronto for a few days and happened upon this gem! I've never had Okonomi Yaki before and this was definitely an excellent first experience.  The restaurant isn't huge, but it has a good vibe and it's cozy. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food (and at very good price)!!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and delicious. You will definitely want to add the bonito flakes as it doesn't come with it by default. The service is prompt and courteous.  If you are in a hurry, you can be in and out in under 15 min."}
{"text":"Why don't more Japanese restaurants offer okonomiyaki? To try it is to love it, at least at Okonomi House.  It was surprisingly crowded at 5:30 on a Thursday, but we once we made it through the line-up and were seated we were served quickly.   Okonomi offers high value in its very affordable menu. Don't miss the \"custard,\" which anywhere else would be called creme caramel and cost twice as much."}
{"text":"Everything sums up to one sentence- The okonomiyaki is AMAZING~~ The other food on the menu are normal, nothing special.  The restaurant is small, seats about 30 people and the food takes about average time to come."}
{"text":"Yay for Toronto for having an authentic okonomiyaki house! Not even NY has that.. Well, we have Otafuku ko but it's not a sit-down place.. The okonomiyaki here is so so good! Definitely go for the deluxe special with the meat and seafood toppings."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner with friends! Always wanted to try this place long time ago as it used to be there wasn't many place in TO that serves okonomiyaki!  Found the okonomiyaki to be very canadianized even tho the staff there seem to be all Japanese! They were small and very pancake-like compared to authentic Japanese okonomiyaki which got more shredded cabbage resulting in a more sweeter taste! Okonomi house makes it more like pancake with savoury sauce and toppings! Also can't believe they charge $0.50 for bonito flakes! Makes it so stingy! Almost like going to a hamburger joint and charging you extra for the pickle, when it's such a staple ingredient!   Unlike my friends which offered the tiny okonomiyaki which was equivalent to the size of a diner pancake! I had the yakiniku set $11.55 which came with soup! It arrived bento box style! I had originally wanted the beef teriyaki but that was one of the few entrees that didn't come with miso soup, even tho it was the priciest entree on the menu $12.55!  My bento box rice was served quite weird! Instead of a serving of rice filling the rice section it was serve in two tiny scoops  like ice cream!   Overall, doubt I will be back! Once to try is enough! Plenty of other restaurants to try! So many choices nowadays...am surprised they stayed open this long! I guess it's a relatively cheap place to dine around Yonge & Bloor!"}
{"text":"I was looking for lunch in a non-sushi way and decided to give Okonomi House a try at the recommendation of Yelper Ell C.    Arrived around 12:30pm on a weekday and it was busy but was still able to grab a table.  I ordered the shrimp okonomiyaki with the side of bonito flakes and seaweed ($10 including tax and tip).  Awaited a few minutes before a steamy pancake was delivered to my table and then I dug in.  The shrimps inside were tender and hot.  Should have remembered to order the sauce on the side as I found it too overwhelming.  I probably would have preferred just a few dashes of soy sauce.  A filling lunch but left reeking with the scent of food.  The guy sitting next to me in my afternoon meeting kept sniffing my hair and saying \"Now, I have a craving for deep fry\".  Wonderful."}
{"text":"A bit pricey considering it's just Okonomiyaki but have to admit that it's pretty authentic and it's made perfectly. Reminds me of what I've had in Japan. Also, bonito flakes are an extra add on (weird I know). You can also get other entrees like teriyaki chicken and noodle dishes."}
{"text":"A tiny establishment that always seems to be packed. Their okonomiyaki are definitely top notch, they're jam packed with seafood! However, I'm not likely to go back as I find it to be a bit expensive for what it is. But if you love okonomiyaki than this is the place to be."}
{"text":"HOLY PERFECT, BATMAN!  Allow me to explain.  I am from Vancouver, where there is a lot of Japanese food.  My favourite restaurant for many years was The Modern Club, a teppan/okonomiyaki place run by a wonderful lady named Haru-san.  We became friends with her, her food kept us happy and healthy for many many years.  Then... she left and went back to Japan.  She sold the restaurant to someone who had no clue, and it went down the tubes.  Sobbing, tearing of clothing, wailing, etc.  I didn't even get to go before this happened so I went there one day and HONK HONK she was gone.  =(  Anyway, there were certainly other places that served okonomiyaki around, but none that was plain, simple and traditional.  Heck, even non-traditional would be okay if someone did the basic cooking right, or the right proportions, etc.  Vancouver is a great sushi/sashimi city, but not always so hot on the regular Japanese food.  I resigned myself to probably never finding real okonomiyaki again.  Until TODAY.  I had a pork okonomiyaki, and I am proud to say that Haru-san would have been happy to eat here.  I am satisfied appetite-wise, thrilled emotionally to have found a place for my okonomiyaki looove, and generally feeling great because it's not expensive either.  A very hungry person might want two, but they're only $7 for the average okonomi, so splurge, why don't you?  I told the waitress and the chef how happy I was and he was thrilled to pieces, and started clanging his implements around to show off after I talked to him.  I feel pretty happy about that part too, because he deserves it - that was truly fantastic traditional stuff, and I am going to eat here again and again.  So. Happy.  If you like okonomiyaki, and can live with mostly okonomi with only a few side dishes, this is the place for you.  And me. =)"}
{"text":"I don't have anything really unique to add to what's already been said.  I thought this place was OK. It's a cool place because you can't really try okonomiyaki anywhere else around here. But I didn't think it was anything too fantastic.   I tried a scallop okonomiyaki-pancake-mabob with extra veggies (add $1). It was decent. I could have probably eaten more, so I imagine big boys could easily eat 2 of these, which would make it not so cheap."}
{"text":"I ordered squid okonomiyaki, seafood salad, miso soup, canned Canada Dry .  Squid is raw and fishy. The source of okonomiyaki is small and it is hard. Seafood salad is only seaweed and vegetable. I paid $ 21. It is very expensive. I will not go again ."}
{"text":"Many reviewers wrote it... it does not worth it! their pancakes are far from the real and so goood nippon okonomiyakis... well, I should have trusted them and (not those who said it was OK but never went to Japan) and I should have gone somewhere else. In addition, I would not be hungry now, looking for what is left in my fridge to survive (for the same amount of money I paid there, I am usually OK for at least 6 hours!!). Well, this place is good Ok, but what I got on my (not really hot) plate was a thin (so thin!!!) pancake, as compared to what I ate at Kyoto and Osaka, and it was not even tasty at all indeed. I want to go back to Kyoto and have a real one!!! The waiters are nice (but not the old lady!! and  she will not hesitate to pick up remainings on the left clients' plates, and put them on the next clients' ones! I saw her through the kitchen glass window (stupid idea to have a glass wall, if you want to do this), and I think it even was for my own plate.... (she might have thought I was a dumb tourist, easy to abuse...maybe I am???). BUT not sure, so... perhaps I just imagined it, so take this last remark with caution. It can be fun to go there if you do not know what okonmiyaki is (it looks like this, but tastes better), but otherwise, don't be such an a...e. as I am. Trust those people who tell you it is NOT okonomiyaki, AT ALL, and SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE (or spare it for your next trip to Osaka, and taste a real one _ see picture of what you will NOT eat at this Toronto simulacre) ."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch on Saturday around noon, and luckily got a seat. The place got packed quickly after that.   We ordered the okonomiyaki with bacon option and added $0.50 for bonito flakes and seaweed. It's thinner than what you'd normally get from Osaka, but it definitely hit the spot. It was delicious and we'd be back for okonomiyaki when we're craving it!  The yakisoba comes with beef, chicken and shrimp, and a side of rice. It's a comforting dish, but okonomiyaki is definitely the dish to try when you're here!"}
{"text":"The key to this place is to come with low expectations.  It has the appeal of a Japanese cafeteria, so don't expect much in the way of décor.  But, it 's located at a street corner and has large windows, so it does have a nice view of the street.  While you're sitting, you can also enjoy overlooking the chef cooking up a storm over a large Teppanyaki stove, reminding a bit Jerry Lewis as the Japanese chef.   The Okonomi pancake is very tasty and quite unlike anything I had before or since.  It's lathered with Japanese mayo that is finger-licking good.  You can have bonito flakes sprinkled on top which dance with the heat of the pancake.  It looks like your meal has comically come to life.  The teriyaki beef is also very tasty."}
{"text":"Cheap & delicious! I have been craving okonomiyaki for a very long time and saw that this place had good reviews. I got their beef pancake with bonito & onto flakes. It was hot and sizzlingly GOOD! I will for sure come back here by myself to try their other flavors."}
{"text":"I always pass this place but decided to drop in. Their okonomiyaki was ok. Service was slow and there wasn't much flavour.  Maybe I went on a bad day but mine tastes very bland and oily."}
{"text":"Had the beef okonomiyaki. It is pretty tasty considering there are not too too many places that offer it around here. But I may be biased because I have had okonomiyaki in Japan and there were far more ingredients and toppings. By the way, seaweed and fish flakes toppings are extra 50cents"}
{"text":"My place to go when I'm craving to okonomiyaki and I'm never disappointed. Like Idan R. says, don't have high expectations for this little restaurant and you'll enjoy your time. The food is good and although it looks small, it's pretty filling. I generally stick to chicken or bacon okonomiyaki since I find the extra charge for seafood isn't worth it."}
{"text":"This is a one star review simply because the guy I talked to lied to me. We went here for a UYE. There were 15 of us which is a rather large group for this small place. Kat F. had called ahead and though they don't take reservations was told that it wouldn't be a problem to accommodate our large group.   Upon arriving I went inside to see how long we would have to wait. The gentleman I spoke with told me it would be a half hour, if not a little longer before he could seat us AS A GROUP. A few minutes later when Kat arrived she went in and spoke to the guy. He then told her that he would not seat our group together and would not hold tables for our group and would continue to seat small groups/couples as they came in.   If you can't accommodate a large group just be upfront about it, don't waste our time when someone calls ahead and tell them it won't be a problem when obviously it is."}
{"text":"Okonomi House is mediocre. I've been here four times, either because my friends wanted to eat here or it was a quick bite before shopping or class. I always ordered the okonomiyaki with bacon- the pancake was too thin, lukewarm, not filling and the chef skimped out on the bacon."}
{"text":"Hmm~ Yujie and I tried two different one squid and beef. they have amazing sauces~~~~~ like it~~~~"}
{"text":"Came to try okonomiyaki for the first time, it was really good! served on a piping hot plate and garnished perfectly. must try the bonito flakes, great contrast to the gooey insides of the pancake. Also ordered a little bottle of sake, good stuff!"}
{"text":"Love the old-school decor and the casual vibe of this place, which specializes in Osaka-style okonomiyaki -- the pork and the seafood are the best.  The sauce that they brush on is the perfect balance of western-style BBQ and sweetness, and though it sounds weird even the little dab of margarine on it works great. I like to watch the tiny bonito flakes actually shimmer and dance in the heat of the dish.  The teriyaki dishes aren't as memorable."}
{"text":"Had some super tasty pancakes here. I would definitely recommend it, it was very flavourful and cooked perfectly. We had tried the seafood one and my friend had the beef one and said it was good. I also tried the Hamburg which I'd say was okay. I would definitely recommend the pancakes because it's what the place is known for. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken and beef okonomiyaki and they were both very good although I preferred the chicken over the beef. Good amount of meat on both okonomiyaki. Would definitely come back. The area in the restaurant is quite small but it's very comfortable."}
{"text":"A nice deviation to the typical bento boxes and maki lunches, this Japanese pancake house churns out very tasty pancakes served with your choice of meat including shrimp, chicken and pork (my personal favourite) and topped with a tangy barbecue-like sauce and mayonnaise.  The layout is really neat as you can see the chef preparing your food though it does tend to get a little warmer inside as a result.  There are other items on the menu but skip those and try the pancakes if you never had one.  If you have 2 or more people, order a few types to sample the different flavours.  I've never had room for the desserts but they look just as tasty."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot! Overall great pricing on the food, ordered the beef okinomiyaki it was delicious! A great place for a quick bite to eat. For desert ordered the custard it was very good!"}
{"text":"Something about this place makes me want to keep coming back. It could be the bonito flakes that melt on top of your omelette, or the dashi flavor coming through the delicate egg. I don't know exactly why it's so nice. But it reminds me of Jiro Dreams of Sushi when Jiro tries to explain unami. On that note, a lager would probably be a great complement to your meal here."}
{"text":"Where to start? I can't even say the name of this place without smiling. 1st off, this is clearly not a 1st date place. I would suggest this is a 3rd or 4th date place. It says that you are fun and don't take stuff too seriously, but still enjoy good food. We all know good food can come in many forms and it doesn't require fancy or pretentious surroundings. Okonomi is about as unpretentious as you'll find.  Inside it is cramped. Finding the bathroom is an adventure unto itself. I was lucky enough to have my Indiana Jones hat on which I am sure helped me immensely. The whip, as always, is optional. You are bathed in a warm orange light from the hanging paper lanterns and sit at small tables obviously designed for the Asian stature. While I find that atheistic pleasing, you do become somewhat acquainted with your neighbours quickly as you will be touching elbows. Try to keep your conversations to safe topics, avoid any recent sexual adventures or medical conditions. Also refrain from picking up their glasses of beer as you are describing a recent jaunt to the ER for a rather embarrassing condition. The signature dish is called an okanomi yaki. Hard to explain to Westerners, it's considered \"fast food\" in Japan. It's a hearty savory pancake with optional fillings (pork, shrimp, beef chicken) topped with a sauce called tonkatsu and a dollop of mayo. The 1st time I had one I loved it, and figured that it must be a rice batter, since it's from Japan and everything from Japan is rice based correct? I fell off my chair when I found out that the batter is actually cabbage, well that and several nice warm bottles of sake, which IS rice dammit so my point is valid. After professing my love to the owner and that I thought his place was lovely, his staff was lovely, the food was lovely and that this was in no way related to the aforementioned influence of sake. He gave me a quick tour of the \"kitchen\" I say that because in keep with the Asian theme here, it was tiny....I mean small! I couldn't believe how much food they bang out of such a small place. The sides were all good and standard fair, miso, udon, were all fair. It's hard to screw those up. This place is charming, affordable and unique. If your date turns their nose up at being there dump them. They are high maintenance. If they like it there you've got a keeper."}
{"text":"My first place to eat a Japanese okonomi house and probably the only place that I could find a real tasty Japanese Osaka-style okonomi in Toronto."}
{"text":"I took my friend here on our long-time-no-see date. It was around 12, so we witnessed the restaurant get full with nearby office working folks. The waitresses were indirectly telling us to leave, but I didn't catch their \"drift\" until maybe 10 more minutes after they gave us the bill (that I didn't ask for) hahaha, but no complains from me :)  Their ordering menu is a very small piece of paper to check your items. They have a menu book that explains the 10 dishes of food they serve. welllll maybe not 10, but I just remember it being small... I've never had okonomi, so I had that with squid I think. My friend ordered teriyaki chicken.  The okonomi was very very good :) very filling. Definitely WONDERFUL for lunch in a work day, cheap!!!!! I've had better teriyaki chicken elsewhere, but theirs was still okay. Lots of bean sprouts, and only a small scoop of rice. I looooveeesss bean sprouts, so no problems on that.   Small little place, gets absolutely full during lunch hours. Loud! Quick service. Clean place :) Good price, I had to pay for tea.."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but can leave you a bit nauseous if you have too much of it (the batter is a bit much).  Staff was very friendly; a bit stuffy in there, perhaps they should think about better ventilation."}
{"text":"Yakisoba is great even though is not excellent, still recommended!! Feels like home. Misosilu tastes good as well!"}
{"text":"It may not be comparable to those you have tried from Japan, however I do respect this place cook it freshly from the scrap (unlike many other places just bought frozen one and fried it then serve you overprice ...I can just microwave at home by myself)   Okonomiyaki and takoyaki are popular street food in Japan, therefore we don't need to bring our Zagat Michelin star judge eyes in here. However, I do think there's a lot place to improve in this restaurant.  For instance, cabbage( main ingredient) ratio should be more than the dough, you don't have to make a \"big fluffy pancake\" with little ingredient, it can be half of the size but more cabbage and meat. Also, we should be able to customize it more, like add yakisoba base. There's no need to spread the sauce all over the top, it will reduce the crispness texture. Button line...Benito and seaweed should be part of the Okonomiyaki not add on... ( you know it's not right)   This restaurant should take a leap of faith, since there's no competitor, and people live here are open to try new food."}
