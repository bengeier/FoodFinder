{"text":"Live nearby and finally popped in for a salad on the run. Delicious!! The vibe is relaxed and friendly, making me want to go back for a proper sit down.  Good job guys!  Mission accomplished.  ... can't wait to have my cookie"}
{"text":"A middle eastern twist to their salad dressing had me smitten!!! It's been two weeks and Im still dreaming of it!!!  amazing job to such a simple meal like salad!!"}
{"text":"What a cute space!!!! My 2.5 year old son loved the open kitchen concept and loved sitting on the stool drinking a coconut water and watching the busy kitchen work. Friendly staff, good coffee. We are not vegan, but we enjoyed the meals regardless. Great flavours and filling."}
{"text":"Healthy food (salads, wraps) and friendly service. I would probably give these guys 3.5 but rounding up to 4 as there isn't much out there like this. My biggest complaint is that I don't love their sauces.. they're not as special or unique as that at Aux Vivres. I also found it odd to charge $6 for a steamed carrot in a bun. Great if you're not too picky with the sauces but I'd avoid their \"carrot hot dog\". As with all healthy places, I wish there was more gluten free selection other than salads. They do have some gluten free cookies that are decent although crumbly."}
{"text":"While meandering back to Mile End from an on-the-canal client's place this morning I spotted this biz and stopped in hoping to find Eggs Benedict.  Instead, i found a super conscious vegan and gluten free purveyor of high octane food fare.   Really a catering company, the front side of the space is dedicated to educating and nourishing the nearby lunch crowd with pre prepared salads, soup, wraps (and frozen soups and stew-ish meals in a freezer) plus a great selection of drinks, vegan desserts and barista coffee.   I tried the soup du jour, spinach and pea_ so flavourful! Thinking about it later, I was impressed that no meat broth stock was involved in the creating of such a satisfying cup of sustenance.  =D  I bought some frozen meals, along with a bottle of locally produced dish soap, and hot sauce.   Fabulous biz!!  Check it out when in the area... catering company for your next event? Beautiful food:  https://breathekitchen.wordpress.com/"}
{"text":"I love going to Le Kitchen! The staff is really welcoming. When I go I tend to try the daily specials (either a soup or a hot meal). The prices are fair :) I dont usually eat much vegetarian food but I really like going there to try something knew :) I was introduced to a hot meal they serve called Tangine! And it was delicious! Really recommend if you want to have a quick bite to eat and enjoy a super laid back and casual vibe."}
{"text":"Had their black bean burger. It was great.  They served it with a side of green salad that was lightly dressed with lemon, vinegar and olive oil.  The atmosphere was friendly and vibrant. They have meals of the day to add some variety to their 5 main dish menu.  They offer Vegan and Gluten free food."}
{"text":"I tried their gluten free vegan grilled cheese and it didn't disappoint! They even added a sprinkle of oregano to the end! The 'Tout le kit' salad has chickpea tofu and the dressing is full of flavor, a perfectly balanced salad! I would go here for breakfast every day"}
{"text":"Le Kitchen is really happily becoming a regular spot for me. After early yoga at Moksha next door this place is thankfully open early enough for me to catch a bite afterwards.  Serving up gluten free and vegan (mainly) bowls, smoothies, soups, wraps, salads, and baked goods, Le Kitchen does a great job of making breakfast and lunch fun for anyone health-conscious or with dietary restrictions. Their coffees are also wonderful. I do find their full-price fare a little costly (hence the four stars) however, if you show up early enough they've usually got great prices running on the day-old meals (which are soooooo worth it).  The space remains true to its industrial architectural roots but also stays really fun and inviting. The tunes generally range from 80s to 90s guilty pleasures at a moderately bumping audio level which pleases me greatly. Because it's an open kitchen you can see the staff all jamming out while making delicious noms, which is also fun. Counter staff is always thoroughly wonderful- the kinda folks that really make your day better.  While it's not a sit down spot in the least, the little window seats have definitely made for a nice quick chill spot while I enjoy a smoothie or a gluten free & vegan bagel and cream cheese (which is effin' fantastic btw!).  Worth a visit if you're in the neighbourhood."}
