{"text":"The place was empty at 2pm. Came with a Groupon, but owner was hesitant to serve us because we hadn't made a reservation. After awhile she agreed to seat us. I'm not sure but half the time she seemed clueless. Soup was OK.  Crepe was OK.  Salad that came with it was lettuce and not the spring mix seen on most pictures on their website. Their dessert waffle was actually the best, light, fluffy and not too sugary. Service was slow. Wouldn't cone to eat but would come if I'm craving a light dessert such as their waffle."}
{"text":"The Sandwiches here are, to put it bluntly, disgusting. The meat in my sandwich was old and tasted just plain horrible. it was an 14 dollar sandwich and I couldnt eat it because it was gross.  The dessert waffle I had was good. It had barely any whipped cream and was cold but it was good."}
{"text":"J'ai reçu un coupon Groupon de ce resto et j'ai décidé de l'essayer. Le service était chaleureux. J'ai pris une crêpe Milano et un café flat white. La crêpe était bonne, les ingrédients allaient bien ensembles. La vinaigrette sur la salade était sucrée. Un bon repas dans l'ensemble. Jusqu'à ce que je présente le fameux coupon...la jeune caissière est devenue moins sympathique. J'ai laissé un bon pourboire. Je ne pense pas y retourner."}
{"text":"Horrible service, would give 0 stars if possible. We tried to use a Groupon here and got yelled at because we didn't make a reservation and print the Groupon. The restaurant was totally empty (we were literally the only ones), and it's 2017 sorry I don't carry a printer around. Don't go here, many many better options to eat in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was in there on a Sunday afternoon. There was no one in there, but this won't affect my rating. I think this place deserves more customers. It would help if the decor was more creative... It lacks a bit of character or something.  But the food is good and the staff person was super nice. It was fun to be on the patio, although a bit busy for me (it's on St-Denis...). I had a Brussels waffle with salty caramel on top with a macchiato. The waffle was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, delicious. The price was very decent.  I plan to go back to try the Liege waffles and the crepes."}
{"text":"We had a Sunday brunch. I ordered a savory crepe. My husband ordered a waffle. Mine has roast beef inside, red onion. Side dish can choose from fruit or salad. Drinks, I chose mocha latte, and my husband had the classic hot chocolate. He hated my drink. I think mocha is a flavor that he need to get used to.  Overall the place offer decent food. The place is a little empty during the weekday evening but relatively full in weekend."}
{"text":"healthy, guilt free, gluten free, delicious leak sauce buckwheat crepe. The gauffre is also fluffy and crisp, not very thick. If you want to skip on the usually greasy breakfast and some quiet patio time this is the hidden gem."}
{"text":"Utilisation d'un coupon Groupon avec réservation la veille. Bon sandwich et excellente crêpe dessert. Resto propre mais manque de décoration et ameublement sommaire. Souhaiterions que le personnel puisse comprendre et s'exprimer en français....."}
