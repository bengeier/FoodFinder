{"text":"Very good wings!   On Monday nights, all you can eat wings for 14 bucks is a great deal,  hard to beat. Initial order on my plate was 13 wings presented. Reorders were 6 wings each.   Only negative here is that the initial order all has to be one flavor of sauce. Reorders,  however can be any flavor of your choosing.  Next time I'm there, will get some pictures and a menu shot. I was starved when I came in, and my attention went immediately to the food.  Haven't had their pizza lately, but in the past it was always good."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is a jewel almost hidden away here in Kannapolis. The food is excellent--pizza to chicken--the staff is always friendly, helpful, and competent. The special express menu is the greatest value in town."}
{"text":"Excellent wings and pizza. Large variety to choose from. Great clean family environment."}
{"text":"Small American restaurant but, BIG on taste and quality!!!!!   This place is amazing.... from their subs, burgers, hot-dogs, all the way to their wings!!!!  Definitely a favorite of mine!!!!"}
{"text":"It's been along time since I've eaten at Flyin Buffalo, but I was pleased to find out tonight that it's as good as ever.  I had a small supreme pizza and a chef salad and it was amazing. The pizza crust is exceptional, and flavored with a light garlic butter. I got the order to go which in my opinion, is probably the best choice, as their location is a bit cramped with no real aesthetic appeal. But the staff was friendly and helpful even though the place was so busy.  I didn't have to wait long either which was a nice surprise as I thought it would take longer considering how busy they were. I will definitely be back again for takeout when I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"I would like to say that I have eaten their once and will not eat there again. The place is nice enough but the owners claim to be christians and I know of a young lady that has lived with a verbally abusive husband for 18 years, recently left him and has been trying to find a place for her and her children to live. She worked very hard for this Christian family and has worked in the restaurant industry for over 15 years, they terminated her today without just cause; This is the type of Christian family that runs our restaurants in America??I just wanna let you know, Christians like that are going to fill the halls of Hell. I strongly urge you to stay away from this restaurant, for they certainly do not do unto others.  The young lady that served me, was one of the nicest women I have ever met in my life and I must say that the owners present themselves in a very poor fashion...shame on those owners for terminating a girl that was out trying to better herself... believe me when I tell you, when the owner's wife did not show this young lady mercy, the Lord shall not show her mercy."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices.  The wings are delicious.  They offer all you can eat wings on Mondays.  This comes with wings, a side, and drink for only $12.95."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  Guy Fieri should stop by this family-owned place.  Kannapolis is sort of a food desert, and this place stands out solidly.  It's beside a convenience store, but don't let that stop you.  Paw Paw greeted us at the door with change for the bubble gum machine!  Small seating area, but comfortably fit our family of six.  While we waited on our food, the line of takeout customers was constant.  We ordered everything but wings (just our taste that night), and it all was solid.  Lasagna was a real comfort food - it had great sauce and taste.  Fettuccine Alfredo was great -- chicken was legit and the sauce was not too overpowering.  Cheese steak was good, and buffalo chicken pita came with bonus sauteed mushrooms.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and this food was great! The delivery time was as expected and the food was hot upon arrival! We ordered mild and garlic parm bone-in wings,potato wedges,chips, and pasta with meatballs. All of it was fantastic. Best wings we have had in the area. The only negative was that the chips were a little soggy, but I think that was just a result of being in the paper bag and moisture building up inside the bag because they were warm. Other than that, great food! Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last time ordering from here and I am very disappointed.  I honestly think the owners have friends, family, or themselves write reviews for them on this review site and others. This place is not glamorous nor are other small restaurants that I've ate at that has good food, so the appearance isn't most concerning to me. Now the food is another story.  The only good thing from this visit was that the lady over the phone had an attitude when I was asking her about how many flavors you can get with sertain quantities you order.  I was looking to order 100 but her attitude changed my mind and I order 50. Man did she do me a favor!  Wing sauce make the wings and as long as you dont under or over-cook them actual wings your good.  I assume they fried the wings that morning and maybe flash fried them again when an order is placed.  The wing sauce taste like standard bbq, etc sauce you buy from grocery and rolled around in sauce after fried.  I ordered 50 for a small gathering for Superbowl Sunday and about 40 was uneaten and trashed honestly.  After they tried one they put the rest back...just horrible!!  I should of requested a refund but the initial attitude from the lady on the phone wasn't worth the hassle.  I'll take it as a lost. They are normally not opened on Sunday but they did for Superbowl.  I would say to anyone that dares order from here to try a small order of 10 or less so you don't waste too much of your money.  Their wing prices are reasonable, but wings are not."}
{"text":"Great place!! Today I stopped in for the 1st time and it will not be the last .  I had the wings and the homemade chips and they were amazing. The staff is extremely friendly, very clean !  Stop in and you will not be disappointed !  I will definitely be a regular customer ."}
{"text":"I have been here a lot over the years and just left there an hour ago. I got to my hotel and had no fork to eat my salad with and was given two small cups of dressing for 15 wings and a salad. So not enough dressing and no fork to eat it with."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover,, and don't judge this place by its location or building.  The food here is great! Pizza, wings, fries, sandwiches, and so much more...all of it very good.  Only downside...don't plan to eat in. It's too small and gets pretty busy. Call ahead and pick it up."}
{"text":"The owners not the employees but the owners were talking trash about us... Customers as we were eating our food..... Wonder what they do to the food for customers they don't like??? Open ended terrible customer service food is ok. If you offer all you can eat then why do they have rules as to how you can eat the food. This place is absurd. And the owner is an a#$hole."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. At first, I wasn't very impressed with the location. However, after eating there you will forget all about that. The daily specials are fantastic and the people are always so friendly. I particularly enjoyed the Thursday special which were basically chicken tenders. I got the buffa-que sauce, which is just buffalo/BBQ sauce, and it is truly addicting. They have fries, sweetpotatoe fries, and wedges as top choices for sides. Definitely try this out if you are in the area."}
