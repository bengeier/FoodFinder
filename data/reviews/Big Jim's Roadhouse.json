{"text":"As soon as I walked through the doors I felt like I entered into a twin peaks episode. I have to say it is pretty entertaining. This is the type of place where you eat a giant sandwich and shut up about."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Based on the reviews we wanted to try Jim's. Walked in, no one to be found except a few locals at the bar.  Both the restaurant and bar reeked of cigarettes."}
{"text":"This place does not look like much from the outside, and even on the inside it's kind of dated and in need of updating, but the food is first rate. once you enter the main door, you can go to the left and find the bar, or you can turn right, go through the curtain, and find yourself in the main dining room.  The menu features standard Italian American fare like Pizza, Calzones, Pastas, Sandwiches, and Burgers. We wanted some comfort food, so ended up with an Open-faced Turkey sandwich and a Chicken Parmesan. Both come with either a soup or a salad so we got one order of Wedding Soup and a side salad with their house dressing. When the dishes came, they also brought out a small tray with some rolls that were warmed up and sliced ... along with lots of butter packets. While nothing special, the soup was warm and the salad was more interesting than most with the addition of olives, pepperoncini, almond slivers and raisins.  The big thing here is the size of the portions. They are absolutely HUGE!!!. See the photos I uploaded and realize that there is enough food on each for at least two full meals, if not three. Again, the flavors were what one would expect, and nothing really special. But, sometimes, this is the kind of food that just hits the spot. And on this night, it did for us!  By the way. All of this food, and some wine, ended up costing us less than $40 - which included the tip!"}
{"text":"No ambiance at all, this lives up to its \"roadhouse\" name (but it is clean).  The prices are generally very good.  The food is hit or miss.  The hot bread that they bring to the table is really good  and served hot and fresh.  The pastas are generally okay, though they have a bad habit of not totally draining the water so that your sauce gets very watery (kind of gross).  The wedding soup is fantastic.  The kids' portions are the size of an adult meal.  The fries are served in very large portions.  The service is fair, depending on how busy it is. I have had very good service and very poor service (from the same waitress on different days).  It is what it is. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but it is convenient (and usually easy to get a table).  Oh, and the beer is about the same price as a soft drink!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty darn good.  Nothing special really.  More of a good roadside joint.  The portions were huge and I left stuffed and satisfied and so did my dad. (we are big boys)  The place left a lot to be desired in appearance but the staff was awesome and it felt like a place I would regular if I lived here."}
{"text":"We hit a lot of local places in Bridgeville looking for a quick bite. Tired of our usual haunts, we decided to try out Big Jim's.   We will be back. We enjoyed the home made food -- bread, soup, salads, pasta and a steak hoagie. French fries were a little limp though. Prices were amazingly low.  More interesting were the two waitresses whom I named Marge and Betty before they even introduced themselves. No rattling off of specials with ingredients most people cant pronounce, no walking around with a giant pepper mill. Instead we got suggestions on how ordering a pitcher of beer would be better, details of their trip to the casino the night before and how the bacon cheeseburger could possibly induce orgasms in the one waitress. Although amusing, the banter with the waitresses could turn some people off."}
{"text":"The portions were huge and tasty. It's nothing fancy but gets the job done with filling bellies. The prices aren't bad at all and we're very happy we gave this place a try."}
{"text":"Awesome burger! Probably the best burger I have had in a long time. Big basket of fries! Great Friendly Service! Lots of menu items to choose from. Price is great for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Pasta was watery not drained well at all, terrible meat sauce. Wife had fish sandwich, frozen fish, not very good. We were there at 4:30 early Saturday afternoon, no one else there.  Won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Decor was straight out of the 1980s. Style hasn't been updated since. I can usually look past decor. I wasn't so keen, however, by the choice of the staff to leave all of the customers plates on their tables. By the time we left there were about ten different tables with their dishes stacked up, just sitting there. Interesting.   As for the food?  Well it was disappointing. I had been wanting to go to Big Jim's Roadhouse for some time. The food was basic and a little bland. I thought the portions were going to big. They were just normal size ... which is a good thing.   House salads were 98% iceberg lettuce and 2% half-hearted attempt to make something different. It didn't work.   I got a chicken cordon blue sandwich. Oh, something different. Just okay.  My wife's burger?  Same.   Manage your expectations so you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love Big Jim's!! Food is great, service is amazing - love the Saturday night bartender!!!"}
{"text":"Our first ever visit and surely not our last. The food was delicious and the portions humungous. Big Jim's calzone is big enough to feed 3-4 people. The monster fish sandwich and Italian hoagie were terrific. We arrived around 8:30 on a Friday and the dinner rush had just ended so the help was a little tired but very friendly. The food took longer to come out than we liked but they were very apologetic and courteous. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Warning...GINORMOUS portions!  I ordered the Reuben sandwich with a side of fries.  The side of fries was actually a basket of fries piled high that would have been more than enough for a table of 5.  My reuben had enough meat to feed a family of four.  The reuben and fries were good, but I felt bad that I couldn't finish either.    My friend had the mozerella sticks and the blackened chicken wrap. I tired a cheese stick and it was good and she said that the blackened chicken wrap was good and was a bit spicy.  Just the way I like them - next time I'll try one of those!   FYI - It's tucked away on a side street so it's easy to miss."}
{"text":"Big Jim's is an awesome..not only do you get great food..the staff is fun and welcoming. Definitely like dinner and a show!  Have you ever met Wilma and Betty... Lucy and Ethel... Thelma and Louise!... You will here.. The waitresses deliver great service and are quite entertaining!"}
{"text":"The volume,oh the volume! Everything is big and you can plan on having a snack to take with you. Reasonable prices and wedding soup and veal parm sandwich are second to none! Spaghetti night is fantastic value.Worth the drive. I have found the service to be ok. Tavern atmosphere is so so --but hey this about the food right?"}
{"text":"Ah yes...Big Jim's.  Was talking with Gary, the manager, who said it is owned by the same people as Big Jim's in Greenfield, therefore the sign that said - Featured in Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  Waitress was super.  Tables have butcher paper on top.  Has a bar but sat in the restaurant.  Like a little roadhouse.    My veal cutlet sandwich was huge...how huge?  It was on half of a loaf of Italian bread with two large pieces of veal!   Wow!  Enough for two, easily.  The veal was nice and tasty and tender with a tomato sauce and mozzarella.   So tasty!  Big Jim's was suggested by a work colleague who works in Southpointe.  Man if you work near Southpointe or are near Big Jim's; give it a try.    Sign said spaghetti special on Monday's for $4.50 and Baby Back Ribs on Wednesday nights (forgot the price)."}
