{"text":"The best looking Indian restaurant I've been to in Toronto. Great modern ambiance, nice and quiet if you have dinner before 7pm (after 7 families start coming in with kids and it gets noisy). The manager was VERY nice and friendly and same with the service. The food was good too but we were mostly impressed with the service and the decor. Will definitely recommend it to everyone if you like Indian food and definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. First time the service was pretty slow but they redeemed themselves the second time I went. 

The atmosphere is great if you enjoy Bollywood songs. 

The interior has been done tastefully, on the walls you'll see famous movie quotes, as well as screen shots of Bollywood stars.

The food is served in funky colourful bowls but lacks spice. If you like your food even with medium spice, do mention this to the waiter.  

All in all this is a nice place to bring friends and family :-)"}
{"text":"I went there with my collegues for all you can eat lunch. The food was delicious! They serve the apps first, then they move to the mains, and finished up with some deep fried cream cheese desert. I personally didn't like the desert, but the mains and apps were really good. They only serve a specific menu every day, so you never know what you going to get. I'm going again soon. The decor and interior is modern and nice."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and vice, nice decor, friendly service and good food. I am addicted to their Raas Malai! The best ever! Their butter chicken and Naan bread are also delicious. We went on a Friday night and there was a live DJ and the waitress said that it will turn into a lounge/club on every Friday and Saturday nights. Will come back."}
