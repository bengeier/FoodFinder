{"text":"Ok. So, I ordered from Mr. Wong's Chinese Food about 5 minutes ago; delivery style. I've had a strange relationship with this greasy spoon the few months I've hit them up for eats. Some days the food is insanely good and really cheap. Today was one of those days.   Love Wong's. They go above and beyond with there delivery service. The sweet little old lady that served me, took 20 mins out of her day to find my apartment. I was running around looking for her, and she was doing the same for me.  She could have left. :) I tipped her well for being so sweet. Made my day.  I got 2 lunch specials. Pepper steak and Shrimp/Veggies Combo. Delicious. And I have to put in my 2 cents for the egg rolls. Best I ever had. I always want more after I finished a little baggie of them. All in all; I love this place and even if they have off days, if I'm over by Metro and want cheap eats, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"In terms of value Chinese food, this place is top notch.  I've not had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"Since when is an 8 minute drive, a distance of 3.3 miles, too far for delivery service? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I'm new around here and have been craving some Chinese. I'm always skeptical of trying new places, but it's actually pretty good. I got pork fried rice with no veggies, only con I have is that it's too salty for my taste so next time I will have them go light on the soy sauce."}
{"text":"This little hole inn the wall is an amazing secret. Honestly it is on the side of circle k. It had been a year before I even saw it there.  I had the Mongolian beef and my honey had the kung Pao chicken, extra spicy. They are the first place to actually make it spicy. Awesome good and inexpensive. There was enough for two meals. Definitely breast Chinese food I've had since moving to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Avoid this place I can't see why people gave it such high ratings and are raving about it."}
{"text":"The first time I went here the food was above average for basic Americanized Chinese food. The second time, it was a little below average. The egg rolls were good and the rice was fine (pretty hard to mess up white rice). The main courses didn't have very much flavor.There were quite a few people lurking around the small, dark parking lot, which made me feel a little unsafe."}
{"text":"The best fried rice In Phoenix.generous portions for good prices,fast, friendly service. Kind of hard to spot but well worth it"}
{"text":"The place seems dirty. Does not utilize the merchant services correctly. I would not eat here and if u do, u need cash! Very outdated and not modern."}
{"text":"This place is legit and awesome. Sadly, two of our favorite Chinese food places have shut down in the past year and we've been on the hunt. This even we stopped by, I ordered the shrimp lo mein and my husband ordered the beef and broccoli, as well as the potstickers and crab puffs for appetizers. Everything was delicious and the price was right. I am very pleased and looking forward to frequenting this location more often. The only very small complaint I had was my husband's beef and broccoli sauce seemed a bit too salty for our tastes but did not deter us at all."}
{"text":"I thought this place was yummy. I order a small hot & sour soup and two veggie egg rolls. They were both very delicious and filling! The small soup was enough for me to save to have for dinner that night.  Don't shy away from the outside, its a little jem inside. There were random trinkets for sale, but I thought it added to the charm of the place. I service was quick and friendly but most of all the food was yummy. I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Here's the best value on the menu as far as I'm concerned: Egg Foo Young, any kind. You get not one, not two, but three HUGE onion and sprout packed egg foo young patties, the size and thickness of a homemade hamburger, along with enough veggies and your choice of meat to make a whole second meal, all in a delicious brown sauce. Two gourmet chinese dinners for a paltry 7 or 8 dollars!"}
{"text":"Well, I am not a food snob but I do enjoy a nice lunch and if it's cheap - the better! A co-worker and I like to look at local 'off the beaten path' type establishments.  I checked on YELP and noticed this location.  It's right behind a Circle K and in a strip mall (everything is in a strip mall in PHX). Every place can be considered 'sketchy' in PHX metro - I say it gives it personality, so if you like linen table clothes and valet parking - stay in Scottsdale.     They have a menu with many items offered.  Your usual Chinese fare, so if you've ordered elsewhere, they probably have it here. If you are looking for 'specialty' dishes - look elsewhere.    Sweet & Sour everything, Lo Mein, Chicken with...., Kung Pao, Soups, Chk, Pork, Beef and Seafood, Apps, Egg Foo Young.    I've tried the Chicken and Veggies - tasty - fresh veggies.  Teriyaki Chkn - the lunch combo was HUGE - it's was ok, its seems to be their big dish for lunch so they have that ready.  Chicken lo Mein - the noodles were good -better than most places.  Egg Roll on the combo could be better and I always get the white rice (never been a big fan of side fried rice).    Combo's run around $5.25 - $6.25 for lunch.  Large dinner portions are about $7.25 - $9.50 - the interior is SMALL - three tables when I last counted.  So it's mainly a delivery or pick joint.    It's not bad for the money.  My co-worker LOVES the Hot & Sour Soup and always gets that now.   Hope this helps!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Well i just happen to see a circle k to buy something and i was hungry for lunch, i just happen to notice this crack in the wall chinese resturant called mr. wong.  Usually those kind of resturant is either great food or bad as they look, for me it was amazing food.  I had their egg foo young which was fantastic(you better be hungry cause its portion is big) and ever since that  when i'm in that area i always swing by there, i also love their sweet and sour pork, their teriyaki chicken was a little dry but the order was omg huge, well worth the price if  your hungry cause its not that expensive.  Highly recommend it, the chef was very nice."}
{"text":"The place may be small but the food and the service is second to none. The teriyaki chicken is the best in town. Appetizers are so good along with the house fried rice. This place need to be on diners drive-ins and dives show!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! What a find!!!! This place is awesome... We were at bookmans and craving chinese food. There are like 15 places and not sure what took us to this little tiny 4 table place on the dark corner of a shopping center but we have been back there about 6 times. The hot and sour soup is the best Ive ever had hands down. The house lomein is loaded with chicken, shrimp and pork. We always try something different everytime to see what is best. The only thing I didnt like were the steamed dumplings. Not the dumpling itself, they seemed very fresh and nicely done but the dipping sauce was alittle bland and no duck sauce here. VERY friendly people for sure and very reasonable. Not alot of eat ins but we are 15 miles away so we are staying. Countless pick-ups and deliveries while we were there. As bad as some of the places weve been to lately this one is a gem! Worth the ride in my opinion! Plenty to take with you too!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in town and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the ruff. It is small but the food is absolutely amazing. What's even better is the price! And the staff is so kind, generous, and polite. They are consistent every time I order from here I am never disappointed - which makes me unafraid to try new things. It's hard to find true good quality take-out Chinese food open long hours and that will deliver, this is the place to go! I love Mister Wong's!"}
{"text":"Tasty food. Not greasy either, which is great! Staff is super pleasant and for those days I can't leave the office, they deliver!!! Definitely eat here several times a month."}
{"text":"So my husband and I live close to this place and we try to try the hole in the wall places. We drove by here a couple of times and noticed that it was always busy. I am not normally a fan of Chinese food, but this place is Fantastic! I especially love their garlic chicken. The rice is usually pretty good. The chicken and broccoli is also really good!!!"}
{"text":"Did take out- Kung Pao Beef. In one word- WOW! Food is extremely fresh, not greasy at all, not salty, not anything negative to say. Lady who took my order informed me that it was Mr. Wong himself who is the chef. He is indeed a chef, not a \"cook\".      I think he added apples and zucchini as the primary vegetables. Can't rave enough! Very impressed... very!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a zero are no stars at all I would. I ordered the teriyaki chicken and it came with an egg roll. The egg roll taste it like it was deep fried in Church's Chicken Grease. The fried rice looks like it was cooked in deep Brown oiled sauce. The food was disgusting and looked nothing like the picture that they advertised. I ordered through Ubereats and when I called Mr. Wongs to request a refund the manager was very rude... an oriental women who did not want to give me her name. I had to leave work and drive up to the restaurant in order to speak with the manager. When I got there I contacted ubereats customer service for a refund and ubereats contacted the manager at mr. Wong's who denied the refund. The manager then looked at me with eyes to kill and said that she did not have to talk to me. So Not only was the food bad the customer service was extremely rude and unprofessional. I will be filing a formal complaint about this restaurant and their conditions as well. I would NEVER recommend Mr Wong's to anyone I work with or anyone else for that matter."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for chinese. Don't be fooled by it's outside appearance- everything is always fresh and delicious. Our favorite is the Kung Pow 2, which is shrimp, chicken, and lots of different veggies in a spicy sauce. We also love the house fried rice, which is your normal fried rice with veggies, bean sprouts, etc but also comes with pork chicken, and shrimp. Very generous portions, also. We always have at least enough left over for lunch or dinner the next day, as the large sized items are 32 oz."}
{"text":"WARNING  do NOT eat here? This food is so NASTY? I ordered the sweet & sour chicken combo and the chicken tastes like rubber, their rice was bland and overcooked and the egg roll was chewy. I will never eat here again. I honestly expected to get sick after eating here but I was already home and I was starving. Please ppl save your time and money."}
{"text":"We currently placed an order for delivery as we had in the past, apparently the new owners are too busy to deliver since they decided to call us back 15 minutes later and cancel our order. Not a good way to run a business. Will no longer use them in the future. They've been delivering to us for 5 years no problems and old owners were always courteous."}
{"text":"Same name same menu New Owners... I had my usual Teriyaki chicken on fried rice. Unfortunately the new owners kept everything the same except the food! I will never go back. It wasn't even good enough to say I'll give them another chance. I'm very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Chop SUEY was completely bland. Absolute no taste at all.  I thought maybe someone forgot the seasoning totally.  Pot stickers were awesome. The veggie egg foo young was decent. The fried rice that came with it was not impressive. We did Ubereats that rocked getting the food to us but won't order here again."}
{"text":"So, so good!  This is a no frills, place in the wall.  Don't keep driving by, stop and order their food.  Super fresh, hot and wonderful flavors.  As you wait for your food to cook and smell all the amazing food cooking you will want to order more food!  We take it home and have a full meal + at least to reheats for leftovers."}
{"text":"At first, I was hesitant to eat at Mister Wong's. I am being adventurous and eating out of my comfort zone. I ordered the hot and sour soup and the dinner lo mein combo. The soup didn't taste right, it was peppery and sweet. The lo mein dish is okay, nothing special. The restaurant is nestled in a shady area and inside of the restaurant is small. Overall, the food is okay."}
{"text":"The delivery driver was awesome! I accidentally gave him $60 for a $20 order an he brought the money back saying that a paid him incorrectly. That was amazing!   The meal however was really greasy and they forgot the sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"Will never order again. Never got my order - when I called acted as if nothing was wrong."}
{"text":"Tiny place, but food was pretty good and inexpensive. I also picked up some mangos and nicknacks! Food was made to order, hot and tasted pretty good too. I had the cashew chicken and the hot and spicy shrimp. Shrimp was surprisingly good. I definitely prefer this place to panda express or something to that nature."}
{"text":"I've worked 2 seconds from this place for 3 years but have been too scared to try it.  Not only is this a pretty sketchy area, but this place looks even sketchier.  It is a very small place in a shady strip mall.  There are maybe 3 tables in the joint, some pictures of their food on the wall and a glass counter where they sell a bunch of random Asian bric-a-brac which is also where they take your order.  Luckily I called ahead to order or it would have been a while to get food.  There is only one cook so things may take a while if there are more than 2 people ordering.  Anyway, the cashier/order taker lady was very nice on the phone and in person.  She was also running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to get orders ready.  This place was recommended by my coworkers but because I didn't have a menu, all I had to go on were the reviews on Yelp to use as a guide on what to order.  * Orange Chicken - came with fried rice and an egg roll.  The egg roll was pretty good but the fried rice was nasty.  It tasted stale and had a weird flavor.  The orange chicken was just ok.  I like it that they used big chunks of white meat chicken and the orange sauce a mild spice to it.  I wouldn't order the meal again though.  I could tell the ingredients weren't quality and everything was fried and overly greasy.  * Hot and Sour soup - This took about 30 minutes for this to cool down to \"won't-scar-my-mouth-forever\" temperature.  The soup was full of great ingredients including nice-sized shrimp and meat.  It looked excellent but the flavor just wasn't there.  The broth tasted sweet and was just weird.  I don't like to give sub-par reviews but I don't think I will be back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Omg! Their egg fried rice has me so happy and satisfied every time I eat it. I've never had a fried rice so good in my 21 years of living! Everything else in their menu I can do without. Delivery always takes over an hour for some reason, but the food is always hot."}
{"text":"Quality used to be better, but still decent. Area is sketchy,  but whatever. They have decent specials on wall that include a can of soda. She is talkative with me. Actually, I don't eat much Chinese food anymore. They run a local business, a family. I like the varied soda selection. Diet cherry 7up? Yes, please."}
{"text":"Went to Mr. Wong's a few hours ago because I was craving some super, extra, spicy shrimp lo mein, so the family and I walked up to the best kept Chinese take-out secret in all of Phoenix! Also I was pleasantly surprised when a younger, more Americanized version of Mr. Wong was standing in front of me, ready to take my order, as soon as we approached the counter. As I said I ordered the shrimp lo mein (as spicy as humanly possible) and both my wife and step son ordered the sesame chicken. After paying for our order I asked how long of a wait it would be as we had a few items to pick up at the dollar store -- next store, ten minutes or so is what he said. So we returned 12 minutes later and as I was walking into the restaurant, Mr. Wong Jr. was just walking out of the kitchen our food, it doesn't get much more accurate than that. The young man who was working the front end was extremely courteous and very personable. Mr. Wong Jr. Made this visit to Mr. Wong's Chinese Restaurant, the best one that we have had yet. I would recomend Mr. Wong's to anyone who enjoys good food and great service. You will not be disappointed when dining ordering from Mr. Wong's, I sure wasn't!"}
{"text":"we found this spot three years ago, after a jaunt on the bike to bookmans.... and now... i continue to stop in and continue to be amazed that this tiny little non-descript, 4 table 'hole-in- the wall' best has some of the best freshly made  no-MSG chinese food, i have eaten... hot and sour soup, lo meins, orange chicken, (non-breaded), sizzling rice soup, dumplings, and on and on.... pick-up, delivery, and dine-in, it's all good!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese delivery in the area!!! You know you'll get high quality food every time and they must regularly change their oil because their fried items never come out bad. They have some of the best egg drop soup we've ever had. Their Mongolian beef is fantastic and we order it every time. Yummy crab puffs, fried wontons and egg rolls too. Love their house chicken I just wish it was made with white meat instead if dark meat and I might ask if they can swap it out next time. I have had good luck with special orders from them (like changing the house special fried rice to our specifications). Seriously, give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review.  I have been a weekly patron of this establishment for years as my office is only half a mile away.  Last November we celebrated my birthday and the office asked me where I wanted to order from, I chose Mr Wong.  Our order came to over $100 and they forgot one order of lemon chicken.  Not only would they not deliver the order they forgot, they made my co-worker pay AGAIN for her entree (we had given ask the money plus tip to the driver who brought us our original order).  When I got wind of this, I was furious and quite frankly, embarrassed as this restaurant was my suggestion.  I drove to Mr Wong figuring that seeing me (a regular) maybe they would make things right.....nope!  The witch behind the counter refused.    You've lost a long time customer and an office that will now take its large orders elsewhere.  The food here is good, but don't place a large order as the peabrain running the joint can't keep it straight and when she screws up, it's your fault."}
{"text":"This is a total dump with average to bad food.  There is no personality to the service and the food was prepared so quickly that it had to be boxed or bagged food that simply gets heated and dumped on the customer.  Frankly it was a waste of calories.    There are too many good Chinese food options to return here."}
{"text":"I would actually give the \"New\" Mister Wong a solid 3.5 to 4 stars for their food but I ordered through Yelp's eat24 and they delivered in 1/2 the time that they quoted so that bumps them for the round up.  The $2 delivery fee is a wash, since they give you two spring egg rolls with the minimum order amount of $15. They have a tiered coupon system, so if you order $25 or more you can choose between 4 free spring rolls/free 1 Chicken Fried Rice (16 Oz)/free 1 Pork Lo Mein (16 Oz).  Prices are reasonable and portions are HUGE. As far as Chinese food goes, this is a little better than average and the \"New\" Mister Wong's will fulfill your need for that salty, greasy, savoryness that you crave from the Americanized version of this food. The flavors are spot on and I like that at least when ordering through Yelp's eat24 you can easily customize each item. Want your Kung Pao not spicy/mild/medium/spicy/very spicy and with extra peanuts... not a problem. Kung Pao Chicken is my go to when trying a new place to establish a baseline, so I ordered mine extra spicy with extra peanuts. The heat didn't blow my top, but it was flavorful, spicier than I normally get, and it was covered in peanuts. It has the expected fresh celery, bell peppers, zucchini, and onions along with a mix in of frozen corn and carrots. Overall, I was impressed. The vegetable low mein was really good as well, chocked full of fresh vegetables and nicely seasoned. As mentioned by others, the crab puffs are larger than usual, the spring rolls are smaller than other places and the egg rolls are pretty standard. None are not too greasy but they are fried so you have to expect some grease.  Another nice thing is that they have a \"create your own\" combo option. If you are like me, it's hard to pick one thing, so unless you are with a bunch of people doing family style, you have to order a ton in order to get a variety. Lunch specials run every day from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM and the full menu is available from 11:00 AM to 10:00 PM. They also have super cheap party trays if you need catering for lunches, etc. and if you order three of those, you get one free.  My only complaint is that they aren't closer to my house so I'm limited to delivery to work. But then again, that's probably a good thing since my lunch order today has enough food for 4 meals. I am most definitely a fan of the \"New\" Mister Wong. :)"}
{"text":"I had hoped for more.   I ordered orange chicken with rice, egg roll, and won-tons.   The won-tons were fried too much. The egg roll was good, the rice was old and dry and the orange chicken was OK.   They use white meat chunks lightly battered and fried with a nice flavored orange sauce.   I will try them again and hope it is better."}
{"text":"So I just got some Orange Chx (cause its bomb)....extra crispy sauce on the side. Now, this is the 5x  I have ate this item since my last review and each time it has been on point.......why did I just pick up an order of Orange Chx  get to work and my sauce is \"ICE COLD\" which lets me know its yesterdays sauce, but not anything a microwave cant fix........but what does piss me off is I called to let them know and the girl at the front tells me - Some customers want it cold.......WTF, If it wasnt so damn good I would not go back"}
{"text":"Love mr wong... and mrs wong! They both run the place and make good NY style Chinese food here.    Love the ribs and fried dumplings!   Delivery is always fast and reliable.  Our go to Chinese food place."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Chinese takeout. I've ordered delivery and placed pickup orders and each time the service has been quick and professional. The food is consistently yummy. My fave dishes are the General Tso, teriyaki chicken, and sesame chicken. The egg drop soup is delicious and goes well with fried wontons."}
{"text":"This was the second time eating their food. First time, I probably would have given 3 stars.   We called in an order at 12:30, they said it would be a 35 min wait. Which seems quick for lunchtime! However, 1 hour and 10 min later, our order arrives. The delivery driver is on speaker phone, which is blaring loudly through our house and courtyard. What if there was a sleeping baby in the house? Not cool.  The orange chicken tastes fishy, the \"fried rice\" (which is just rice fried in soy sauce, no veggies or protein) is cold, and the Hot Sour Soup tastes like BBQ sauce.  I think the egg roll and fried wontons were fine, but I was just so hungry. Don't take my word for it."}
{"text":"People who rate this place well are on crack. They couldn't even take the time to COOK MY CHICKeN WITH THE FUCKInG SAUCe. They gave me some fries chicken with sesame sauce to put on it my damn self. I could cook my own Chinese food and it would taste better than this hole. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"The ordering process was simple and easy here using GrubHub.  My food wasn little late but poor delivery guy had wrong address before me for another order.  I did phone the restaurant and they're so sweet and nice! Excellent customer service! The driver was same as well very kind and great customer service.  The food is amazing!!! Definitely worth the wait I had!  It's large portion so 2 people can make a meal out of one.  I ordered the orange chicken which is yummm! The fried wontons perfect also. Highly recommend them!  Happy Eating"}
{"text":"HORRIFIC. Do you people have taste buds? Four stars, you lunatics?! 1: crack head paradise outside of the \"restaurant\". 2. filthy inside with the yummalicous smell of old grease and grime. (why I proceeded to order I have no frickin clue). 3. pretty stupid expensive. $10 for a small plate for one 4. the food. YUCK. Got home, tried one bite of everything and threw it all away immediately to avoid eminent poisoning. Sesame chicken: unable to be chewed, tougher than deep fried leather with about the same taste. Beef with broccoli. The beef was creamy white. End of story on that one. Crab puffs: the middle was decent but the outside was so overcooked it was hard to get to. Egg roll: my sister bit down and spit it directly on the table. She's dramatic but not that dramatic. Lo mein: tasted exactly like old stinky cabbage.   The sign near the register read \"no refunds\" so I didn't bother calling. The sweaty guy working the register and the grill probably wouldn't have cared anyway."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Chinese food. I ordered one night after finding them on a delivery website and was immediately hooked. They have THE BEST teriyaki chicken in town. I've eaten at the teriyaki places like Kyoto bowl and Japan express and this place surpasses all. The portion size is HUGE and it's cheaper than most.  The hot and sour soup is incredible as well. You Wont find better in the state I assure you."}
{"text":"I love eating at Mr Wong! The Lemon Chicken is delicious! As is the King Pu Shrimp. I live and work a block away so I eat there often as they have a great lunch special. They are always very friendly and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Stopped here because all the good reviews it had. I got the orange chicken lunch special with a side of stuffed jalapeños. First of all this is the definition of a hole in the wall restaurant, it seams as it is behind a circle k. Not too sure what the rice was supposed to be, fried rice or brown rice too plain and no flavor. The orange chicken wasn't the greatest I've ever had. Stuffed Jalapeño where good, descent. Egg roll served with meal had way too much black pepper. The place itself doesn't look too clean, no restroom and they charge for extra hot sauce? Not too sure what everyone else has been raving about. I would think because it's a lunch special is a lower quality but should the restaurant be consistent?"}
{"text":"The BEST Orange Chicken I have ever had in my life!!!! Fast professional delivery.  Crab Puffs are spectacular. Love the container they deliver the chicken easy to store for the next day. Definitely will be a new favorite for me. They deserve 5 STARS all the way across the board."}
{"text":"This place is a small take out. Food was decent and came out fast. Price is very reasonable. Seems only a couple, husband and wife works there. Not that they needed more staff... However it's not my cup of tea.  If you're looking for cheap, quick, not too concerned on the quality then this is ok. It gets the job done as far as satisfying your hunger. But as far as really enjoying your meal snd quality of the food, it's not the best.  The lady was very nice though and the establishment has been there for 15 years, do I guess they're doing something right.   I'm not sure if I would go back, but I wouldn't rule it out completely. Their fried chicken wings were decent."}
{"text":"Ok so i finally tried this place, its not the greatest place for chinese. I got the Mongolian beef lunch special $7 and it was ok, meat had really not much flavor to it i had to put soy sauce on it for more flavor. Portion was ehhhh, service was nice though, it does have a small dine in area as it isn't that big of a place. Would i come back? Ummm maybe if there was absolutely nothing else available.!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy there food! I selected this place for the reasonable prices and delivery. You really get a lot of food for what you pay for.   I LOVE the potstickers, egg rolls, crabs puffs, and chicken lo mein. Others have really enjoyed the orange chicken, seasame chicken, and fried rice. I am not a fan of their beef, its a little too chewy for me, where I like my beef with crispy edges.   Compared to other Chinese delivery places in the area its definitely the best. I get it at least once a month!"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix and sick of the chain restaurant options surrounding my hotel at the MetroCenter, a quick search on Yelp uncovered Mr. Wong. Unfortunately, I could not locate a menu online so I just called and had a quick chat with the woman who answered the phone. I initially asked for Szechuan chicken but was told they did not offer it, but followed quickly with other options to consider. Since I needed to hit the $15 minimum for delivery I ordered more than I needed. I started with hot and sour soup that ended up being quite hardy and included shrimp. My main dish was hot and spicy chicken which came with solid heat and flavor. To put me over the minimum I also ordered crab puffs since the woman on the phone recommended them. I'm typically not a fan of anything puffed, but these were not overwhelmingly fried. My food arrived in under 30 minutes and there was no additional delivery charge. For just randomly picking a restaurant of Yelp with few reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by what I received. I dug it and would order again if I'm ever back in the area.  P.S. I believe the woman who took my order also delivered my food...a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Great little place you'd pass by without knowing it was there without Yelp.  My other half and I were thrilled with their food... only one place I prefer more in the area for Chinese, that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Hit with summer allergies and congestion I was craving won ton soup, but didn't want to leave the house. This place was suggested through UberEats and it didn't disappoint. This is not the standard won ton soup you get at most places which is broth and pork won tons with some green onions. This had veggies, chicken, some shrimp, and the pork won tons. They also did not skimp out on the product which is always a plus. I also had an order of fried dumplings. It seems like the dough on these were homemade as it was thicker than what I am used to, but they were delicious with flavor and the dipping sauce was dynamite. I can't wait to order some of their traditional dishes in the future. Only downside was they did not include my requested hot oil, but no biggie. I guess I might have to try Yelps delivery service as it seems you can customize better."}
{"text":"Excellent food - the only really good Chinese food that delivers on this side of town.  They just reopened after some remodeling and I am ecstatic.  Their Hot and Sour soup is the best in town."}
{"text":"So this was the first time eating here.  I placed an online order through Yelp's Eat24 and it was super easy and efficient.  The order was delivered much faster than anticipated.  The shrimp fried rice was hot and fresh and delicious but the shrimp weren't completely deveined so I will probably cut them apart as I eat them.  The sweet and sour chicken was over cooked slightly and you could tell from the color and taste of the breading and the wrap on the egg roll that the oil in the fryer needs to be changed.  Besides that the egg roll was actually very tasty.  The steamed rice was good.  Change your oil in your fryer please.  I probably will not eat here again unless I just get fried rice."}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering from the \"new\" Mr. WONG and it was delicious. I got the egg rolls, crab puff, wor wonton soup and beef chow fun. Yes, the egg rolls are a little smaller than normal, but they were very good. The crab puffs were larger then most places, and the soup had a lot of chicken, beef, and veggies, (also very good). The standout dish was the beef chow fun. Oh my tastebuds! This was, by far, the best chow fun I have EVER had! It smelled amazing and tasted just as good. Do your self a favor and order this!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food (Americanized.) We order from there regularly and you really can't go wrong with anything you order. Nice portions, fair prices and quick delivery."}
{"text":"Good food but the restaurant is pretty small so don't plan on eating there or in groups. I'd say order for delivery instead or take out."}
{"text":"This place seriously is the best hole in the wall Chinese food spot...ever. Ive been coming here over 10 years, and no matter where in the valley I move, I will ALWAYS drive over to get delicious Mongolian chicken and crab puffs.Youll probably want to get your food to go, as theres only 4 tables in the tiny establishment, and dont let the super ghetto location fool you either, it's worth it!!! AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Everything had an odd taste.  The Egg Fo Yung was this big ball of mush with that seems to have been deep fried. The sauce seemed to be more hunan/soy based instead of the customary brown gravy.  The lo mein veggies were unevenly cooked and leaned more towards  a fermented cabbage flavor.  The sweet and sour chicken...I think the grease was old as it also had a weird taste.  Spent $45 to take a couple bites and throw the whole order in the garbage."}
{"text":"It seems Mister Wong has changed their menu around a bit, and that's a good thing! I called in an order for their Kung Pao Shrimp lunch special and it was actually really good! The portions are big for lunch and it comes with an egg roll and wonton. The woman at the register was very friendly. I'll likely be back!"}
{"text":"Had my order delivered to my home. It arrived so quickly! Everything was HOT! & FRESH!  I had my two granddaughters visiting. They we so very happy with the Orange Chicken with white rice, Eggrolls and Crab puffs. The other items ordered were just as good!! I loved my Shrimp dish. Everything came in neat food containers. The main dishes were in reheatable bowls! We were very pleased with our perfect portions of FANTASTIC TASTY CHINESE FOOD!! I will be Ordering food from MR. WONGS again!"}
{"text":"Mr. Wong has the BEST ORANGE CHICKEN I've ever had. It's a tiny place on the NE corner of Peoria and 19th Ave.. in a somewhat junky strip mall. Blink and you might miss it. Because this is a food review, I'll stick to that first. Everything I've ever tried here has been just great, to the point where I've picked up takeout for the family on my way home several times. Their food is always fresh. They cook to order so if you just stroll in, you will have to wait a short bit. Worth it, though. My only gripe- they will charge you for chili, chili oil, extra soy, etc... To the point where the all-business cashier (a short Asian lady with bangs and a bob) will not budge and WILL run your card for 25 cents if you don't have any cash on ya. I found that off-putting, because to me it's worth giving a customer 25 cents in chili versus upsetting and losing them. I chalked it up to cultural and business differences. All this being said, I'll go back again. I've learned to pick and choose my battles carefully :)"}
{"text":"Exceptional service everytime i call in or dine in.

MON-THURS 11AM-930PM FRIDAY 11AM-10PM SAT 12-10PM  SUNDAY CLOSED"}
{"text":"Had lunch here at New Mr. Wongs. I ordered the Shrimp Chow Fun. Boy, that dish was very flavorful, robust & had a plenty amount of jumbo shrimp in it. New Mr. Wongs, is the first restaurant I've ever visited that has a Chow Fun section on the menu. My server was friendly and gave great customer service. The only negatives @ this location is: There's only 2 tables IN the dining area & has no restrooms for paying customers to use. Besides that, I look forward to trying something else on my next visit. Till then, CHEERS!!"}
