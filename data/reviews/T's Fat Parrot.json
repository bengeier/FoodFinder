{"text":"This place is a great time everytime!! You have your choice from horse shoes, cornhole or darts! Not to mention the ice cold beers. No food here but who needs that!"}
{"text":"Good local dive bar. Don't be afraid of the outside of the building. The people are friendly and welcoming, the beer is ice cold. They have corn-hole, horse shoes, pool tables and a fire pit out back. The large covered patio is good for the smokers. It has karaoke on Friday nights and it is usually packed. The crowd is a good mix of young and old."}
{"text":"Yes, you've seen this place driving on Mt Holly-Huntersville Rd,...on Friday, the cars are parked two deep in front of the gravel parking lot. If your're not a member...don't even think about it...you gotta have a card.

I was a card carrying member back in the day when it was just 'The Fat Parrot', not that's it's really changed that much.

If you really want to know what it's like...buy a membership...or go as a guest.
They have live music on Saturday."}
