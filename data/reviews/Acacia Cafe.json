{"text":"Great Food!!! I always have their smoked salmon & lox bagel or their Miami Ham Panini. Fresh Food, Friendly staff! We go out of our way to get breakfast or lunch here when we can! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  Acacia Cafe has won my Sunday morning breakfast-eating heart.  I love the the fresh fluffy omelets...light and tasty with fresh crisp veggies and light, nutty, buttered-to-perfection toast that is lined with sunflower and pumpkin seeds...mmmm mmmm.   I'm not sure if the packaged jelly's on the table are their own but they sure taste like it, not too sweet like most commercial types. I've also had their sandwiches & salads and you cannot go wrong with those either.  This place is a must visit if you want a yummy, fresh meal at a decent price.  The service can be a bit flaky, but I'm willing to overlook as long as the food keeps coming out hot, fresh and yummy.  Beware, if you sit inside you may smell like breakfast all day...might  be okay if you like that sort of thing.  :)"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here last week and now hooked!!! Their turkey sausage links taste decadent, their marble rye and sourdough is made from scratch, in house.... French toast is great, their Ruben-esque panini.... PHENOMENAL!!!!!! Best Reuben I've ever had. My son and I split it, he loved it! This place is amazing. Only been here twice, everything that comes out of the kitchen is fresh and looks amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Typical \"upscalish morning caf√©\" type place, with your expected menu of breakfast sandwiches and brunch fare.  The kickers are three: 1) Their bakery items rule school; even the doughnuts are great- you can tell they don't fry them in sickening soy oil like most places (owner said they do so in butter) and the chocolate frosting *gasp* tastes like and IS real chocolate!  2) This area, \"Arcadia,\" isn't much for such upscale places (besides maybe the organic eatery, Beckett's Table, next door) so it's kind of a diamond in the rough if you're in that dumb place.    3) The staff is bad-ass. I say that not in the way of positive thumbs up and smiles all-around, but in the way that they will show their irritation with you at the drop of a hat and respond rudely with no qualms, whatsoever. The owner guy looks pissed constantly, and seems the staff passes their bad treatment on to YOU. I have to hold back from laughing anytime I go in since they're so heavy with that stuff.  If you're in the area in the morn', hungry, and you don't want to die from food poisoning by eating BoSa doughnuts or the mexican \"food\" that's nearby (Cerritos, I believe), I'd say give Acacia a whirl. Just don't go in there if'n you're thin-skinned."}
{"text":"We love this place for the fab food and the great staff. Everything I've had is excellent, and it has become our favorite after church breakfast spot...and our Saturday morning with nothing to do breakfast spot... and lately my favorite got to get some studying done.   The side of couscous is amazing fresh, and the Sunday special waffle is my all time fave. And you can't beat the price for great quality food."}
{"text":"Been dropping in here for several years now, the odd lunch or breakfast. The food is tasty, plain cooking, nothing uber-creative. Fresh ingredients, always. Service can be slow or reasonable, depending on the capacity. Plenty of coffees and teas. I see all these reviews about friendly service, and I guess that's fair for the most part ... still, there is this one lady who serves and takes orders who's always busy and really hustles ... but always looks like she's just swallowed a glass of vinegar. I have NEVER seen her smile. Takes away a little bit from an otherwise pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches & salads. It's all fair priced fare at Acacia Cafe! Looking forward to trying a few more items on their menu. The Grilled Sonoran is a must try!"}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, friendly staff. When the weather is nice, sit on the patio and enjoy. I love the cream cheese, lox bagel with capers and onion. The only reason it is not 5 stars is because they are missing the exceptional factor that would set them apart from the rest of the great restaurants in the area, but you can't go wrong with Acacia."}
{"text":"Nice surprise... we had breakfast here for mothers day. What a mellow atmosphere & the food was really great! I had the veggie eggs on  ciabatta. I love crunch so the texture of that bread in contrast with those yummy eggs were divine. And my eggs had eggplant! YUM!! My sis had the frenchtoast & my aunt had the Eggs Benedict. Nice size servings & the price can't be beat! We will all be here again."}
{"text":"You can't beat Acacia for breakfast or lunch. Mike and Jeff have the right flavors and the staff is hand picked that fit the place perfect. The prices are awesome compared to others places that serve the similar dishes. Fresh tea, fresh coffer and very friendly employees and customers. Try this place as often as you can and short lines if any compared to other spots. They are the best. Thanks guys and gals at Acacia PS should have wrote a review a long time ago."}
{"text":"Been coming in for breakfast and lunch multiple time a month (be sure to pick up their customer appreciation cards, buy 8 get 1 free) for breakfast and lunch. The freshly baked bread is awesome and the menu is solid. Gotta give it a five and go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning. Food was mediocre. Older lady cashier was very rude and seemed frustrated. Younger staff were polite and helpful, it was a shame to think they had to spend their shift working with such a grump. Keep the mean one away from people"}
{"text":"Ok such a treasure is this place...amazing for breakfast or lunch,,I have never had any thing that was not really good..The side patio is an added  nice thing.Mike really has made a name for him self."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was bomb, I ordered take out and also had someone else pick it up for me. So cannot say much about this place other than I will order again for breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice comfort place for breakfast/brunch. Fresh and good tasting food. Very attentive staff. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood cafe. Opens at 5am with consistently good food. Reasonable prices. What's not to like! ubiquinol vs. ubiquinone"}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST SPOT IN ALL OF AZ!! I have been going here almost every weekend for the last year and have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Last week, I was in line with my boss for a lunch/coffee break. The guy at the register was a little defensive with the customer at the register. He was explaining that he has very good customer service skills. Some sort of incident happened, and he was lecturing on her on his great skills. Super awkward. I only had a coffee but the food does look good."}
{"text":"Tried this place after my Papa raved about it. The food is excellent, as is the staff. My Papa was a loyal customer and loved this place. Even though it's not on my side of town, I will continue to support this place in his honor. Thank you for being so wonderful and taking extra special care of my Grandpa. =)"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the Fruit and Nut Waffle, and the Eggs Benedict on Sundays.  Great prices, too!  This is my go-to place for breakfast and lunch since it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Worth it! Welcoming neighborhood cafe. We had the egg white omelets. Delicious and they didn't skimp on the ingredients. We will be back."}
{"text":"Since I had eaten in the cafe several times and enjoyed it, I had them cater a  lunch meeting.  Everything was delivered and set up on time and the food was delicious.  Thanks, Mike."}
{"text":"I went in once for a cup of coffee, I thought it was over priced then. I went in again recently, only because we were with a friend that wanted to go there. I ordered a Chicken Cesar Salad and drink. It was good, but not $6.50 good. I felt bad for our friend, he likes it there, but as we agreed the lady at the register taking orders is, let's just say, less than nice and pleasant, which you need to be. He ordered a sandwich and side salad, she says, which one, very rudely. We went in a 1:30 and they close at 2pm on weekends... ODD... We do not frequent there, because their food is bland and overpriced, quite frankly I won't go somewhere, where people are rude. If you want to have that kind of attitude STAY HOME... It's not like there was a long line of people, in fact there was no one behind us. She had this hurry hurry attitude, I'm trying to close... I will never go back...  On the other hand, Mike was very nice. He saw that a few of us were trying to get refills before we left and the lady had already emptied the ice from he machine. He came over kindly with a big cup of ice and offered it to us. Thanks Mike!!!  P.S. Front counter Lady, If you don't want to take 50% off coupons, don't offer them. She acted as if it was a total inconvenience..."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix was made amazingly enjoyable by getting to eat at Acaia cafe! They have a wonderful selection but on top of those yummy options the owner chef made a special dish of breakfast for my friend who has a very restricted diet! Thank you thank you everyone at Acacia! Delicious food friendly staff and amazing owner."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was very warm... Everybody is super friendly... i enjoy their breakfast sandwiches and their orange juice other than that i have not tried anything else... i have come in and noticed that when they are busy at lunch it tends to get a bit confusing among the wait staff as to what dish goes where..."}
{"text":"Been working on filling up my frequent customer card at Acacia Cafe, still in love with the little place. Turns out Sunday's are special because they've got a few extra menu items for their Sunday Brunch, including an awesome Fruit & Nut Waffle, with cranberries, raisins and walnuts baked right in. Yum. Other Sunday specials include Eggs Benedict and Eggs Albuquerque. If you've never been to Acacia on a Sunday, check it out."}
{"text":"Its one of my favorites for breakfast when I'm in the area. The food is good and reasonably priced.  They can get busy at times but service is always quick so I don't have to worry about getting back to work in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Love this little place!  My boyfriend and I have been here quite a few times since trying it out a little over a month ago.  It's quaint and has great food.  I love the turkey sausage!  I love supporting great local businesses!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific familial atmosphere & service, even better food."}
{"text":"Been to this cafe several times for breakfast and lunch.  Food is very good.  Eggs benedict on Sunday mornings are my favorite.  Last visit had a mix up on my order.  Not 100% the cafe's fault, but the staff handled it very professionally.  Comped the entire order and provided a coupon for a free breakfast.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"What a perfect place for breakfast. I had an amazing veggie omelet and hash browns. Food came out quickly and hot and the toast was almost like a whole grain texas toast. All the veggies were fresh and the omelet was loaded. Prices are very inexpensive for the portions.  Kim at the front counter was very sweet. It's a very small place so I understand why on weekends there would be a wait. When you have great food and service everyone wants the experience. I am here on a friday morning and zero wait. This is a must go."}
{"text":"I've both eaten in the store and ordered catering from it. Dependable, fresh food. The salads are really good. I could eat the Cashew Chicken Salad every day. Service is more hit or miss, depending on who's working and the time of day."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably a hundred times over the years and have always had great service. Their gourmet grilled cheese sandwich is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Cafe. The owner is super nice and  goes out of his way to make you happy. Everyone that works there always has good attitudes. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!! I never been and trust me, it is not easy to impress me.  I found this place on Yelp, got there, ordered, good selection (not overwhelming!), great ingredients, friendly faces and they made me feel welcomed.  Prices are right, coffee is good and food tasted great.  I'd totally recommend this restaurant to anyone I know.  GREAT JOB!!!"}
{"text":"It was a good place with decent food and solid service. Nothing spectacular but conveniently located. Prices were cheap and my omelet was what I expected!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and even better prices! I have had everything from breakfast to sandwiches to salads and soups - all the items I have had are very tasty. And you definitely cannot beat the prices.   Although the order line can get long at times, the service is very good and the manager is always rushing to get customers their food.   This is one of my go to places for lunch!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh, inexpensive, and quite good.  The baked goods especially stood out in my mind.  I have only had breakfast but I look forward to see how the lunch menu stacks up.   Give this place a shot and see if it suits your pallet."}
{"text":"Been here several times for breakfast and lunch.  Great home made food.  Soup is extra good.  Try the chicken salad sand. and potato salad."}
{"text":"Average food, reasonable prices but horrible  customer service. Tried this place for a 2nd time, trying to like it because of the convenience of being in my neighborhood.  My biggest pet peeve at restaurants is when they don't take accountability for punching in the wrong order and argue with you in front of the entire place. Trust me register lady, I know what I ordered! I'm a easy going soul that doesn't like to be the center of attention and honestly who does that? So annoyed! I knew I got a weird vibe from this lady on my 1st visit and she sure proved me right the 2nd time."}
{"text":"Met my hungover breakfast/bacon needs. The philly  panini is really good. Everyone was very attentive and nice to all customers."}
{"text":"Had a great eggs Benedict this afternoon for brunch. The place is kept clean. The staff is friendly. Although, they are only open for breakfast and lunch, I think I will return. Next time will go there early, so that I can sit out on their patio.  One note, you order at the counter, and they will bring the food to your table. A little awkward if you do not know what you want, but they do have paper menus that you can sit at a table and look over. Then when you decide, you can go to the counter and order."}
{"text":"Acacia Cafe is great because the food is simple, tasty and fresh. Breakfast is great here, and I haven't had anything bad yet.   I usually get the eggs benedict, which comes out perfectly sauced and with avocado. They don't drench the eggs with hollandaise like some places do, and I appreciate that. Most entrees come with home fries, which are good but could use a little more zip.   They have a small selection of pastries, and while i've never tried them, the cinnamon rolls look heavenly. I have had the scones- lemon cherry- and they are very good and not overly dry like most scones.   This is a great spot to go for a mid morning meal on a lazy weekend when the weather is nice. The tiny side patio has a few tables, and while it's nothing fancy, it's a nice option to have."}
{"text":"Great food at very reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"Great food.  I had breakfast and requested egg white vegetarian omelet and had the best.  Stuffed full and delicious, quality products, good service.  The orange jelly is great.  I enjoyed this small cafe."}
{"text":"I visited this cafe 5/18/12 while i was waiting for my clothes to finish washing at the laundry mat nearby. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon sourdough bun. :) very good. I met the manager Mike (I think he is the owner but i'm not sure). Very friendly and professional.   While i was eating my sandwich, two cops came in. I guess cops like the coffee here and the breakfast sandwich.  Will visit this cafe again in the near future."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Saturday morning brunch to go. Waited longer than I wanted for my to go order but over all the breakfast was good. But we won't be rushing back with all the other Arcadia options."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My new alternative to LGO for a great breakfast at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We had brunch and sat out on the patio.  We each had omelettes and hash browns.  The omelet was delicious!  Next time I'll probably get more ingredients as I like my omelet a little more stuffed than this one was.  The hash browns were also very good.  The blueberry muffin was excellent - many juicy blueberries inside!  The coffee was smooth and not too bitter.    We really enjoyed the patio and the service (It's not full service, you order at the counter).  The atmosphere is causal.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the heads up about this place.  I decided to check it out after reading several people who posted.  It's a simple place with pretty good food.  It was too hot to eat outside but they do have a nice patio with umbrellas.  I'll remember that when the Phoenix winters come around.  I ordered the roast beef with carmelized onion sandwich and I thought it was very good.  It came with a side dish.  I also had a coupon for 20% off which I downloaded and printed after clicking on their website from the Yelp review.  So, take advantage of that savings.  Thanks fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"food is good,  price is excellent,  but the down size of this place is the neglect of Health Department rules and regulations.  Noticed an employee using the same cloth wiping down many  tables, as well  wiping their hands on the same cloth, then tossing this same cloth next to the clean coffee cups."}
{"text":"Didn't realize it was an order at the counter kind of place, but it was fine. Nice and clean, bright and an outdoor patio.  The food was all fresh and tasty.  My omelet had fresh spinach and mushrooms, and my husband had the Belgium waffle .... good texture and taste.  The hashbrowns were nothing to write home about, but the croissant more than made up for it!!  Hot, flaky and right out of the oven!! Tres bon!!   The counter thing didn't bother me because you are still served on proper plates with real silverware.  Definitely worth a trip back."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I usually, or use to love this place. When I lived in Arcadia I would come here once or twice a week and sit on the patio with my dog. The service was always fantastic, fast and friendly, even when they were busy! The food has never disappointed either.  Todays experience has changed my opinion big time. I work down the street in the Biltmore area. My office wanted a nicer breakfast than the usual burritos we normally get. I suggested Acacia caf√©. So we printed a menu and had about 7 orders from the office that I was going to call in and pick up.  I get on the phone and ask if I can do a pick up, \"sure\". Ok so I tell the lady I have a few different orders a couple will be on separate tickets. She does this HUFF and says \"we'll split it when you get here\". Ok then, no big deal.  I go on reading the orders of my fellow employees and I continue to hear her HUFFING under her breath. At this point im getting a little irritated, am I not moving fast enough for you, lady? So I tell her that I don't appreciate her being pushy and she says, \"I'm just trying to get your order\".  Ok well if you're not going to give respect to a loyal customer, have patience, and be huffing and puffing under your breath then you just lost a loyal customer and 7 other potential customers. Good luck with your bad attitude!"}
{"text":"This place is real small so I have never tried it, but I was going with a friend who likes it. I noticed a small patio and with the perfect weather I was enthused! You have to order at the counter then they bring the food to you.  Drinks are self serve. I had a coupon for buy one entree, get one 50% off, even with that I paid $16.61 for an omelet, french toast, an iced tea and a small orange juice! It was basic food, so I felt this was expensive, without coupon it would have been at least $20 and this is counter ordering. I can pay this much and have the same quality and table service. I guess that is why Snooze had a wait, so we went here.  I had an omelet with chees, added ham and green peppers.  The peppers were totally raw, they would be MUCH better cooked or at least hot, not added at the end and the omelet folded over. I asked for fruit with it, which was old! The melon was translucent and I didn't touch it! My friend ordered the French Toast and crisp bacon. The bacon was crisp, not greasy and good. The French Toast did have cinnamon but was a typical slice, nothing extrodinary.  They said it came with real maple syrup,  but it comes in a place ice cup, like the jams, so you have no label to see what you are eating.  The juice is touted as being fresh squeezed, but not what you would think, to me that means they squeeze it, then serve it! When I asked further I was told it is squeezed at a company in Tempe, that makes it local-good, but WHEN was it squeezed?? The salads looked good, I may go try one."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this little cafe. I was looking for something simply and affordable for lunch and Acacia hit the spot. I ordered the Spinach Salad ($6.50). It took a while to arrive at the table but it was worth the wait. The salad is huge, covering a large plate with fresh baby spinach, lots of crumbled bacon, and perfectly cooked hard boiled egg. The tomatoes around the edge were pink and flavorless, so I just pushed them aside. The warm bacon dressing served with this salad is super! when I ordered they warned me that it was spicy, and it was, but in a really good way. It was served on the side nice and warm and really made this salad pop.  I look forward to coming back, It is the prefect simple lunch spot.  Oh and the snicker-doodle cookie was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Love Kim for putting up with my husband's shenanigans. A real neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Acacia Cafe today after getting some terrible news and feeling quite ill.  I was starving and sad and really excited to try this new little cafe, hoping it would lift my spirits.    Unfortunately that was not the case.  I will not be returning to this cafe in the future.  I have never been treated so poorly.  To say the service is unprofessional is an understatement.  The lady taking my order was rude.  She snapped at me, then when she saw I was startled by it, she literally laughed.  When I walked away, again she laughed very loudly.  During the duration of my lunch, she was very passive aggressive.  It was a terrible experience and I'll never go back.    I am let down.  I was really hoping to find a new go to sandwich shop that was close to home.  There are better cafes in the area that appreciate my business and have excellent customer service.  Try Bertha's Cafe or LGO.  You're guaranteed a better experience."}
{"text":"Great sandwich bacon, lettuce and potato salad.  Will definitely go back. Didn't have one, but omelette a look great."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday. There was a short line to order, but lots of space to sit. They have a patio in the back too if the weather is tolerable. Their menu is small-ish, but everything sounded good. I decided on the chicken salad sandwich and my companion decided on the cinnamon swirl french toast.  YUM!! I have no complaints about this place. The service was fast and friendly, the prices were reasonable, if not on the cheaper side. The place is clean and pleasing to the eye. Parking is not a problem, either.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been back a few more times, and I still love this place! I tried an iced caramel soy latte, and it was delicioso!   Even when they are really busy service is always friendly.  Enough said. Now go get one of their chicken salad sandwiches tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place, coming back from Downtown Phoenix.  I stopped in just because I liked the name, but the food and atmosphere inside has an excellent attention to detail.  I had a bagel and lox.. .very nice!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Such a friendly staff and great food.  Pretty much anything you order, you are guaranteed to be full and happy!  Tip: pass on the waffles, and go for the cinnamon roll!"}
{"text":"These folks at Acacia work hard to produce a great breakfast with results that anyone would be happy with. Anytime I am in town for work I try to stop by.  Consistently great food, amazing service, good coffee, plenty of parking, hard to find fault with this place. If you are nearby you should make a point to stop in."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I USUALLY love it every time. However a certain older lady is usually almost always totally rude. Everyone else is pleasant and nice but this one red haired older lady is just incredibly rude and mean every time I visit. She actually called my mother and I impatient to my face because we sat at a table that hadn't been wiped down yet. She made me feel really bad about a small minuscule problem. The food is great, the employees are great, just please either keep her in the back or get rid of her."}
{"text":"Extremely inexpensive.  The breakfast menu doesn't exceed 7 bucks.  It's clean, friendly, and a nice neighborhood cafe that's in a stripmall that overlooks Indian School.  So if you sit outside, does it feel like you've been magically transported to Paris?  No.  But for these prices, its worth sipping your coffee, munching on your croissant and tolerating the fumes of the cars driving by."}
{"text":"Wow. So happy to find this joint, had a great lunch! As tourists in PHX, did Yelp and found what we wanted close by: simply good food. Not a sports bar, a serious restaurant or a chain. Menu...another wow. Gee, almost too many choices but all freshly prepared to order. Place order, self serve for beverage....and a short wait for food delivered to table. Sandwiches...good price for what ya get, made to order. His pastrami, my tuna salad very good, generous. Simple cafe atmosphere, very good & friendly staff."}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT So I am visiting from out of state and here in Phoenix area with my friends and we looked up the place on yelp.  Since it had over 100 reviews and there were over 4 stars we said let's go for breakfast.  Expecting busy on Sunday at 9:30 am we were right.   The idea is you stand in line,  order at the counter, pay, find a seat and they bring you food when it is ready.  The line is chaos and the poor foods runners were blocked from safely bringing the food to you.    HOW ABOUT ON SUNDAY YOU JUST HAVE PEOPLE  WAITING ON THE TABLES.  IT IS SAFER! !!!! Food was great because we all cleaned our plates."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood cafe. Recommend it for breakfast. Menu is fairly traditional and prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm so comfortable in this place.   Service is friendly.  Food is excellent.   Coffee always good.    I come here often,  have for a long time, and will for a long time.   Nice addition to the neighborhood.  I especially like the breakfast.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love local breakfast places and this place is just that. If you want something local and good. You'll love it. Food is yummy and delicious.  A few gems on menu that are more exciting than eggs and bacon and there are coffee treats that will satisfy that Starbucks craving."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed. Great food and service. I especially love the chicken noodle soup, part of the cafe combo. Small, lovely and great prices. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We had company in town and needed a local place to go for breakfast with our friend so we went to Yelp and found Acacia.  The coffee was delicious, even the decaf!  I put a bit of the pumpkin flavored coffee in with my decaf and it was outstanding!!!  I was going to give Acacia a 3 star, but am changing it to 4 because it's a cute neighborhood place with great coffee.  What we didn't expect is we wanted table service and you need to go up to order your dish and WAIT quite a while for it to be delivered.  The food was OK.  We had a nice variety, but nothing was a standout but the coffee, so on that basis, I am going back t a 3 star!  I had the burro or burrito with chiles and a little cheese.  I thought at one time they had chorizo, but this version was not very exciting....very little egg and tiny amount of pork. Just a burro cut in half on a plate.... No fruit, no potatoes, nothing... It was fine, but not a bell ringer for us.  And it's true, it is very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Acacia is a solid neighborhood go-to for casual, affordable, breakfast and lunch.  You order at the counter and the staff brings your dish to the table.  You can order food and coffees to go as well.  The interior is basic but pleasant and the background noise level passes the \"Dad test\" (my Dad's 83 and a tad bit hard o' hearing, so I'm extra sensitive to noise levels at restaurants).  One of my favorite features is Acacia's patio, a mini oasis that successfully overcomes the surrounding strip mall asphalt.  Located on the building's west side, and decorated with colorful plants and umbrellas, the patio is shady enough to tolerate early mornings on hot days.  My favorite breakfast selections include the Belgian waffle topped with fruit, the omelets, and the standard eggs, toast, and fruit combo.    For reliable service and food quality at great prices, Acacia's a great choice."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I've visited this little gem. It happens to be in the same plaza as my dry cleaners so I got to grab breakfast on the go.   This place is locally owned and never disappoints with the food. The service is super friendly and they are more than accommodating with orders. Today, I ordered the Light N White breakfast sandwich which comes on a ciabatta and has egg whites, Swiss cheese, spinach, and roasted tomatoes. Being the pain in the butt that I am, I added ham and asked for whole wheat toast. This isn't a normal order, but she graciously made sure the substitute and add-on was right.   Please visit here if you are in the Arcadia area, you will be happy that you did."}
{"text":"This is one of the best family morning spots in the area.  The prices are more than reasonable, the food is great (especially the omelettes and breakfast sandwich).  My sons love this spot too and when the weather is nice, their patio is perfect for a relaxing family weekend breakfast.  If the food and atmosphere aren't enough, the staff is friendly and the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!! What a clean, inviting place :) The omelette I had was amazing!! Definitely a \"must\".for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great locals place. They mAke you feel at home. You walk in they know your name and what you order. The food is great and pricing is perfect. Try there baked goods."}
{"text":"Wanted a new place for breakfast.  Drove by for years...Decided to try on a SAT morning...Very busy but was served right away. Tried the basic breakfast with extra crisp bacon and eggs over medium with sliced tomatoes. Sat outside on patio; very nice and very dog friendly. Breakfast came very quickly; asked for hot sauce was given several choices; so that was very nice. Loved that the eggs were cooked perfectly to my request; and the bacon was extra crisp without being burnt. Will be back to try other items and maybe for lunch next time."}
{"text":"What a great little breakfast and brunch spot! We were immediately greeted as we walked in by very friendly employees. And they gave us a cup for coffee while we decided over the menu.  Which brings me to my only complaint, the coffee wasn't very hot. Other then that everything else was wonderful. There were two delicious looking specials on the board but opted for a build your own omelette and was not disappointed. This is definitely on our rotation of quick breakfast places now!"}
{"text":"The coffee was great. Breakfast was inexpensive and OK... that's it. Service was not the best, it was not even that crowded and employees acted like they were too busy to be nice. I didn't like that. At all.  I may come back for more coffee and to try something else. Who knows."}
{"text":"I popped in here for a quick lunch around 11:30am and was so surprised at how busy it was already! They get quite the lunch crowd! I was a bit overwhelmed because their menu had so many delicious items, I didn't know what to choose!  I ended up going with the Cafe Chicken Salad sandwich on their HOMEMADE whole wheat bread! The sandwich had cubed chicken, grapes, almonds, honey mustard, mayo, lettuce, and tomato. I added some cheddar cheese because i'm a cheese freak! You were able to choose from a variety of sides like chips (my guilty pleasure), potato salad, pasta salad, cottage cheese, etc. Their flavored freshly brewed iced tea was also amazing!   One thing that really makes Acacia stand out is their SUPER friendly service! I could tell that a lot of regulars were there because they knew so many people by name and/or memorized their orders! Impressive! They make you feel right at home. If you're in the area and looking to try a new lunch spot, give Acacia a shot!"}
{"text":"Great service, really good food, fantastic value -- what more do you want and what more can I say? Acacia Caf√© is a lovely local joint with staff who invite you to stay and linger over all of their yummy menu items. My roasted veggie panini with pesto and aioli was consumed really quickly. My panini was fresh and loaded with veggies, making me feel virtuous about my healthy choice. I also felt like I was making an economical choice, as my full size panini was less than $7 and was ample enough to satiate my not-so-small appetite. I would definitely have that again. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I am going to update my review according to some more recent experiences. The staff has been a bit more brusque with me lately, especially over the phone when pre-ordering lunch. Also, since I became vegetarian I have been ordering my favorite sandwich but without meat- this has seemed to cause issues and my last sandwich was sloppy and thrown-together looking, even though it is essentially just a grilled cheese sandwich. Why is that so difficult? Acacia Cafe, you have disappointed me."}
{"text":"Was in the area and spotted this place for breakfast. Tried omelette w/hashbrowns and toast. Tasted fine but nothing special. Not sure what they specialize in but it was pretty crowed. The line system is perplexing. Best to enter at patio door. Not side door.  *positive thing: kids meals cheap"}
{"text":"How have I missed this little gem of a lunch spot?  There were lines of people ordering take-out sandwiches and salads and also tables where one can eat their meals. Overall, this is a self-service place.  I order the French Nicoise Salad, which was very good (although, in all honesty, I've had better in French restaurants).  However, the portion was large and it was tasty.  There is local art on their walls, which I always really appreciate.  Support your local artists!  I also ordered a scone, which was delicious.  I have a feeling their bakery only is a reason to visit.  I plan to return again and again."}
{"text":"Very welcoming vibe, and great service . I love this casual joint. Today was my very first visit there. But I'll certainly be back again. Especially for their out of this world roast beef sandwich and spinach salad."}
{"text":"Love the food, especially the Southwest salad. That dressing is to die for. The staff is friendly and remember their regulars. They have a patio for the 4 legged kiddos also."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's go-to place for Sunday breakfast. We haven't met anything on the menu we didn't like. The service is great, they make you feel like part of the Acacia Cafe family. On Sundays they have a special menu, which has the Albuquerque Benedict, one of my favorites! Definitely go back multiple times so you can try everything out. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch last month and scored a great table outside with our dog.  We ordered at the counter, but they were nice enough to bring the food out to us.  I enjoyed the chicken noodle soup and half of a turkey panini.  It was just the right portion size and was very tasty.  Very friendly staff and good, simple food!"}
{"text":"Used Acacia Cafe to cater lunch for a work meeting. The food and service was phenomenal! Definitely using them in the future for meetings, and stopping by on my own time!"}
{"text":"Great service, good prices, friendly staff, I am loving this place!  Came here to grab some lunch for my dad and I, menu is easy to read, the food took a little longer than expected but, the place was busy.   No gun sign is kind of a bummer though."}
{"text":"Happy we stopped in here yesterday for lunch. Really good southwestern chicken salad & everything was fresh. Service was nice too."}
{"text":"Incredible omelets!! Great place for a great breakfast! Friendly staff and excellent customer service"}
{"text":"In my hood. Always consistent good food. Service has gotten better. The Miami Ham ( Cubano) hello! All day long! My daughter loves their Chick Noodle Soup every time. The place is simple and clean.  Here at least once a week. The egg salad sandwich is just like my Mom use to make. They have an amazing marble rye. The Sunday morning specials are awesome!! It's always busy these days, but I'll wait. It's nice when people know your name. :)"}
{"text":"I live in the Arcadia area... the big benefit, is lots of little neighborhood cafes and local businesses. Its a great friendly area.... except at the Acacia Cafe... , and I'll get to that part of the story in a minute. Now most Saturday mornings, I plop myself down at a local caf√© and read my Wall Street Journal, but today was just a bit different. My good friend Kevin, who drives a tour bus on the weekends, called and said, \"I'll pick you up in the big bus, I've got just a 30 minute break for breakfast.\" Upon arrival, we walked into the Acacia Caf√©, where we have been countless times before, and this time the lady behind the counter actually shouted at us: \"NEVER AGAIN!!... YOU PEOPLE DO THIS ALL THE TIME...\"  I'm wondering what aren't we doing again, and which \"You People\" am I or are we?  Well she continues to scowl and loudly gripe about the fact that my friend called in his order in advance. Well, if you don't want the order, just say so..   After we were served, and sitting at our table, my friend Kevin commented, \"Well, I guess we've just been spanked for being customers.\" If our server's desire was to leave me/us with a very distasteful view of the Acacia Caf√©, 'cause I'm now one of \"THOSE PEOPLE\", I would say she was quite successful. There are many other small eateries in Arcadia, and I'll be eating there and reading my Wall Street Journal at their venues in the future, I believe the other cafes are happy to welcome me as one of \"Their People\".  Now the food at Acacia... Well actually pretty tasty, but the unhappy distasteful atmosphere in the Acacia means count me out."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Food is always fresh and comes out looking beautiful on the plate. All their baked goods are made in house and the staff is lovely."}
{"text":"Great place to bop in and grab some good food quick, and at a really reasonable price.  I had the Salad Nicoise and loved that it had big chunks of tuna, and that the green beans were just right, cooked, but still crisp and sweet. Dressing came on the side automatically, which is always my preference.  My mom thought the decor was a little stark, but good, healthy food always trumps atmosphere for me.  Oh, and the aroma when we walked in the door.... definitely the smell of good food.  We got there about 11:45 and for the next 45 minutes, there was a line waiting to order."}
{"text":"Good spot 1rst time here service was friendly and swift breakfast was affordable turkey link sausage 2 eggs poached hash browns not my fave but I would certainly return for some of the other options"}
{"text":"Unbelievably friendly and welcoming from the second we entered. Great prices and food quality. Best chicken noodle soup no contest! Fresh turkey sandwich. The cilantro ranch dressing was refreshing. Great spot! Highly recommend! Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Phoenix located on Indian School Rd. and 37 St. Try their delicious breakfast or lunch. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I usually pop in here when I'm dropping my dry cleaning off next door.  I always order the South by Southwest Burrito.  It's the best breakfast burrito.  I would describe it as a fajita with eggs wrapped in a flour tortilla.    What makes this burrito the best is the Zaaschila Habanero sauce.  Thing is, on my last visit, they didn't have it available.  Per the staff, the new owners decided not to carry it anymore.  Such a disappointment!  The employee mentioned that other customers have asked about it, but the owners refuse to bring it back.  The burrito isn't the same without it, and thus I won't be coming back until they bring back the sauce.  Owners, this message is to you... bring back Zaaschila! Bring back the sauce! I'll even give you 5 stars once you do.  It's my only gripe, as the place is friendly, clean, and pleasant to dine at."}
{"text":"First time here. Prices were reasonable and the line was long. The eggs and toast were good, about average but the French toast I did not care for it had too much cinnamon and just didn't taste as well as I had expected. My daughter would not eat it as it was too flavorful for a child's palate. Overall okay."}
{"text":"Great little place! Love the atmosphere, good inside and outside eating areas. Good food for inexpensive pricing. I've become a weekend regular!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!! The BEST BLT I have ever had!!!!  It is my second time to eat here!  Great breakfast too!!! I look forward to coming back!!  AA++"}
{"text":"They have a simple menu . Not like an over wellming menu that you can't decide,  because they have to much.Quality food. With lots of balanced flavor."}
{"text":"Slowest service in Arcadia.  Standing here waiting for a couple of breakfast sandwiches to go for nearly 30 minutes and the staff is clearly unorganized.  Restaurant is half empty.  How long does it take to make an egg sandwhich?!"}
{"text":"If you love salads you will love this place! Not to mention Fresh ingredients, huge salads and great location. Food of choice: Southwest Ranch grilled chicken salad (avocado ranch dressing, tortilla chip strips, onions, corn, black beans, tomatoes)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Came here because we had a Groupon and both dishes were horribly disappointing.   My french toast tasted like it had been soaked in pure eggs for days. Soggy, not flavorful at all (despite the advertised cinnamon bread they said they used). My boyfriend's eggs benedict was passable, but the hash browns tasted like they had been frozen. The service also was not very good. It took an awfully long time and as soon as a line of 4 people deep formed, existing customer's needs were ignored.  We are not returning to use the other Groupon's he bought for this place."}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here almost everyday. The food is great.  The staff is friendly and always go the extra mile.  I highly recommend Acacia Cafe!"}
{"text":"Lovely little cafe with a nice patio, good food and coffee bar, excellent staff, and the best French toast around (with pure maple syrup to boot!). I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"4 stars: )  Came here for breakfast and loved every plate. Im a big taste tester from all of my familys plates: )  I actually ordered the French Toast plate. It was cooked perfectly with a toasty outside and soft warm inside. The coffee bar was awesome with simple selections and the cafe actually offered sugar in the raw (some places only offer white refined)  I would definitely come back and definitely recommend this cute little spot if you are ever in the area and feel like a simple delicious no hassle breakfast or lunch Bon a petit: )"}
{"text":"We love this place but not today ! I came in to get a breakfast item at 2:30 and was turned away by the staff . I was offered lunch items instead . Why would you stop selling half of your menu HALF AN HOUR  before you close ?!  We have always been able to get breakfast later in the day and that's why we come here . Disappointing !"}
{"text":"Megan is awsome! Happy and cheerful answering all of the annoying questions of a first timer. Been to a lot of breakfast/lunch cafes. This place rates in my top five. Clean, simple ambiance. Had the Gourmet Grilled Cheese - really good and Traditional Tomato Soup - good flavor, best with something to accompany it as it has marinara like texture, but much milder taste. I asked for parmigiano, which was promptly provided. My lox loving friend was soooo quiet as he said his nova lox and bagel was awesome. My bro had the southwest salad and cup of  chili - very good. Fast service when you order at the counter."}
{"text":"This was my go to spot for a solid year. Breakfast is always consistent. Having moved out of state, their SXSW burrito has really set the bar high for what I'm looking to devour on a weekend morning.   I'll miss you, Acacia."}
{"text":"Acacia Caf√©   With its inexpensive prices, quick service it's no surprise that Acacia Caf√© draws a crowd. ¬†In addition to Acacia Caf√©'s inexpensive and generous servings, Acacia Caf√© stands out for its cooking methods. ¬†Everything is prepared fresh when your order. You might be in a rush, but the flavors and smells make you want to spend the day. It is not just the huge servings that are incredible, but the food is so delicious!   On my first visit I decided to go with breakfast (French toast). ¬†Acacia Cafe gives Huge servings of thick cut French toast drizzled in syrup, covered in butter, and sprinkled with powered sugar. ¬†The French toast is just crispy enough on the outside and tender and slightly moist inside, it just doesn't get any better.   If you love breakfast like I do, you have to Acacia Cafe!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars is my official rating.   I really, really, really want to like this place more, but I just can't get over how this place has some of the longest wait times when it's just so unnecessary.    The good: the food is always tasty and there are a great variety of options, including healthy options.  Brunch is a great meal option here.  Food is always flavorful.  The needs work: The counter service does not work here.  It just doesn't.   They need to staff up appropriately and change it to a sit down or have a coffee/pastry walk up and then a restaurant sit down. Or if it's going to be a walk-up counter, there needs to be a much better system in place. The staff get easily overwhelmed and the line is usually out the door.  There's no customer service here and the restaurant is just losing so many opportunities to retain local customers and keep people coming back.  I've had incorrect orders here and have been made to feel as though it was my fault the kitchen sent out the wrong food.  The general feeling here is chaos, overwhelmed staff, long lines, and that's the last thing I want when I'm going out for a casual meal with friends.  I'm not a restauranteur, but it seems like there are some fairly straightforward changes that could be made that would make this a fantastic option in the Arcadia area.  I live just blocks from here and would like this to be a go-to, but until customer service, wait times, and the general chaos is settled I'm going to keep driving by."}
{"text":"Acacia Cafe's is a model of operational efficiency and excellence for a small cafe owner.  How they sustain such low prices at a very high rent area is astounding, but they do it.  Simple food, smart personalized service, and just enough intelligent extras to make the experience feel high quality in every way... that is, except for the prices.  :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I lived in Arcadia for 9 years before walking into this restaurant. One day I was at the dry cleaners next door and wanted a coffee so I thought I'd give this place a try. That was the start of a beautiful relationship. This is my go-to now for home cooked breakfast and some \"me\" time. I love sitting here and readying a book with a mug of coffee and warm croissant. By the way, I've eaten croissants all over the world and Acacia has my favorite. It's fabulous! The food is so yummy in general. Try the two egg breakfast. It's a traditional, comfort food breakfast that can rival any of the hip new breakfast joints around town that you have to wait an hour to get into. No wait time here!  My last comment on this place, you've got to love walking into a homey, neighborhood joint and have them welcome you by name."}
{"text":"We ordered to go right before our flight back home. The sandwiches here are pretty awesome. My wife ordered the Mediterranean sandwich which was delicious and full of flavor...hummus was especially flavorful. I ordered the turkey sandwich which was decent. For the price, acacia cafe is a must try if you are around the area."}
{"text":"Met new to Phoenix Yelper Lynn W for coffee today.  I suggested Acacia as a good halfway point between us, and was hoping it did not have the crowds of LGO.  It did not, at least not at 10:30 am.  Not being a straight coffee drinker, I ordered a mocha.  Unfortunately, the espresso maker has been on the fritz for a week.  Hmmm now what.  Well it was a little windy, I'll call it blustery, this morning, so I did my best to convince myself winter is still with us and ordered a hot chocolate instead.  The staff had generously offered to steam the milk on the stovetop to accommodate me.  I also ordered a scone--a little more crumbly than I care for but still good.  I wish they had a few more pastry offerings, but they have the basics of danish, muffins, and scones.    Acacia has a great menu for breakfast and lunch.  Next time, I'll try a meal, and hopefully get that mocha I was looking forward to."}
{"text":"Since I'm stuck doing depositions in the Arcadia area this week, I've been using Yelp to help me experiment with Arcadian eateries for lunch. My reward today for this experiment was Acacia Cafe.  This is a brilliant, cute little lunch spot close to Indian School and 36th St, which serves very tasty looking breakfast items all day long, along with a large selection of light, refreshing sandwich selections among others. The service is friendly. You order at the counter and the items are brought to you. There is outdoor seating on a quaint little patio.   I opted for a soup and half sandwich combo. The potato soup and egg salad sandwich were both very yummy. My friend ordered a \"south by southwest\" wrap of some sort and said it was delicious.   I wish I worked closer to here so I could lunch here more often. I'll have to settle for the occasional weekend breakfast instead.  UPDATE: After several more visits, I am downgrading by 2 whole stars for two significant and persistent reasons: unfriendly service, and painfully slow service."}
{"text":"Coming here is a treat, I definitely look forward to having lunch here when ever I get a chance... The staff is great and the food is yummy my fav is the Teriyaki Chicken Wrap :) with some fruit on the side! Definitely a nice place to have lunch with your friends. Try to avoid the rush so go before or after, because its a small place not much seating and when its packed its packed and kinda noisy you can barely hear yourself think much less have a conversation with someone but I guess that just shows Its popular at lunch time ;-)"}
{"text":"Do you believe in unicorns? How about gremlins? Astrology? Do you believe a hip clean place churns out delicious CHEAP breakfast food ALL DAY LONG and its a short drive or bus ride away? Yeah, I would rather drink gnome blood on a pegasus while reading your tarot, but NO. IT IS TRUE. Put your I-Ching away! And get ready to unpeel your eyes like Clockwatch Orange!  I confess. I didn't believe everyone who raved about this place. After the dismal Mama Java experience (worst food ever) barely a couple feet away, I was ready to piss on their doorstop if they failed me. Cause one thing you have to know about me: I am dead serious about breakfast. If you fuck with my breakfast, I will shiv you with a KFC spork sharpened to deadly precision.  BUT-weirdly enough I am willing to wait and drive long distances for brunch IF I believe what awaits me is worth the time b/c my appetite rivals a truckers. Yeah, the truckers breakfast? Barely fazes me. Pure waffle carnage with me, folks.  (Why did I say \"folks\"? OMG, all the nice old people are getting into my urban slang)  So I pulled up here, deep breath, on a weekday afternoon at like 1:30. I was ready. BRING IT.  AND IT IS TRUE.  It is so CHEAP I couldn't believe it. Inside was so sunny and airy and clean and bright and cheerful. And artsy and tasteful. God, you would think I was trying to get into Acacia Cafe's panties. And I am. The staff chick  was adorable and sweet while I kept asking \"I can have ANYTHING on the menu? Really? And these are the REAL PRICES?\" Yeah. They are. I was soooo tempted to get the 3 buck waffles everyone raved about, but after waiting so long for yummies, I went for savoury, not sweet.  I did the roasted veggie omelet with these delightful hash brown things with rosemary and FRESH ground pepper on them! The veggies were delectible and roasted and sooooo good. Peppers and mushrooms and zucchini and so much more with basil and garlic. I was a little peeved that cheese wasn't mentioned in the omelet yet there it was folded into my chicken embryo. But to be fair, I didn't ask either. And it came with great fruit on the side. And the orange jucie was fresh. And the coffee delish. I savoured my meal for so long she took away my last few bites before I was done I had been sitting with my food for so long. And it hardly cost anything. Way cheaper than Harlow's Cafe and that place is way nasty. I spit on them (except for their biscuits.....omg...biscuits).  I am SO a fan."}
{"text":"I would go there anytime! So friendly , clean, small place.Their outdoors is very nice. The food is just delicious. I had the veggie sandwich and my fianc√©e had the breakfast wrap. Both such amazing taste. The staff is some of the friendliest I have seen. Keep the good food and friendly staff as it is. Will come back soon and I bet more then one time. :)"}
{"text":"Just didn't live up to the hype. Food was meh, service was meh as well."}
{"text":"Great local mom and pop breakfast and lunch cafe.  Service is great and the food is even better. The Eggs Benedict are a definite must in my book. The made from scratch hollandaise sauce is perfect, not too thin, not too thick... just right."}
{"text":"Delicious meals, we came and was greeted with smiles, you can seat anywhere, order your food at the register, and given a number and staff will come bring your big meal to your seat. Indoor seating set as a cafe, outdoor seating as well, welcoming atmosphere. I ordered the Belgium Waffle, Delish!!! Fresh delicious food!! A must try!!"}
{"text":"One of my *all time* fave B'Fast places!  Food is great!  People are personable.  Ambiance is pleasant.  Place is *clean*!  After my second time, I've always been greeted as a friend -- not just as a \"regular\".  AND, Mike will cook my waffle [thanks for the heads-up Milee S.] the way I like my waffle.  I don't have to eat it the same way [golden brown] that most everyone else wants theirs.  I get it the way I like it -- charcoal-y [that's how I like a waffle. you get yours the way you like a waffle].  Great place!  All thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The menu is uninspiringly simple, and the food, well, tastes the same. I must give credit, it definitely tastes fresh - but unfortunately it's not enough to account for the limited, simple menu."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood cafe.  The food is always great and so is the service.  I love that that they bake their own bread and all the soups and cookies are made there too.  You watch them cut the fresh bread with an electric knife to make sandwiches as they are ordered.  They really seem to put a lot of care into the quality of the food.  Yay! independent cafes operated by owners that care!  The chicken salad sandwich (with grapes in the chicken salad) and the egg salad sandwich on fresh sourdough are probably my favorites - actually I order one of those two sandwiches every time I go there and like them so much they are the only sandwiches I ever order - except for breakfast - they have an awesome make your own breakfast sandwich (english muffin, crispy bacon, egg, provolone cheese).  On Wednesdays they have an amazing potato soup - yum."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a simple, moderately priced, fresh place to eat where parking is not too much of an issue at lunchtime, this is a good bet...  The staff is friendly and open to you altering the menu items.  The salads and sandwiches are tasty and portion sizes are just right.  I am excited to go back for breakfast sometime soon.   Just one warning... the atmosphere is not much.  Acacia Cafe is located in a strip mall and it's clean, but not too much unique inside.  Go for the food if you are looking for something fresh and simple - do not go for the atmosphere or with extremely high expectations..."}
{"text":"Really fresh, sizable salade ni√ßoise with delicious housemade champagne vinaigrette. (Exception: they use those canned black olives which are a tasteless abomination). Expedient friendly service, and prices perfect for frugal lunchers! I came in because of a Belly card deal and will be bookmarking this spot for future. The panini and sandwich options looked tasty, and I noticed they keep Mighty Leaf tea on hand, which is good quality stuff. A strip-mall gem!"}
{"text":"My wife, 13 mo old daugther and I were looking for a new breakfast/lunch cafe on Sunday and we stopped in at Acacia Cafe as I drive by it almost every day on my way to work.  The place is great!  The cafe is quaint and clean, the outdoor patio is isolated and spacious.  The food is amazing, very fresh and worth the wait.  Not to mention it's extremely affordable.  The people were very friendly and helpful.  We decided to have breakfast, I had a 3 egg omelette with bacon, tomatoes, onions and avocado and my wife had their special, Monte Cristo.  They were both amazing!  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Acacia cafe is consistently good. This place is such a well-kept secret! The prices are completely reasonable, great portion sizes, and the staff is second to none.  I've been here a few times and have tried something different every time. This visit I went with a half AZ BLT: pepper bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato with a chipotle mayo on a slightly toasted mini ciabatta. Vey good! Perfectly cooked bacon, great tomato and lettuce ratio, not too much mayo. Great sandwich. This was paired with a half bistro salad. This salad is probably a new favorite! Pink grapefruit, chicken, strawberries, sliced almonds over spinach and paired with a poppyseed dressing. All of this came with a nicely toasted garlicky crostini. Yum!  My friend went for the full southwest chicken salad--no chicken, extra avocado. This is her go-to! Their full salad is HUGE! Easily could be shared if you weren't super hungry.  The staff is so accommodating! It's a seat yourself atmosphere but at peak times, they will make sure you have a place to sit with your entire party. Always kind and courteous. They are A+ in customer service!"}
{"text":"I first went here because of the positive reviews of their breakfast burrito - and indeed it is good.  That is the only reason I went back 2 weekends in a row.  But each time I visited this place there was something very unsettling about their service staff.  The lady working the register and the lady servicing the tables were very on edge and seemingly unable to cope with the nuances of casual customer service.  Somehow those two people managed to dictate the overall vibe of the place.  The last thing I need is a mega dose of anxiety with my Saturday brunch routine.  This alone will keep me from returning.  The food is great, but unfortunately the issues with these front of house employees are enough to send me elsewhere. I hope the ownership resolves this.  I rarely write reviews on here, but my experience today sent me over that threshold.  There was a review posted about 12 hours prior to mine that gives the play by play of the situation.  I was standing in line in front of that party."}
{"text":"Their Ham & Swiss is my favie.  The breakfast menu looks yummy, need to come back to try that."}
{"text":"a great little spot!  It was a drive becuase I normally go to N. Scottsdale places but yelp did not lead me astray.  It's a cross between a coffee shop and a deli.  I had the chicken salad and pasta salad and they were both really good!"}
{"text":"At Acacia Cafe you'll  find:  1) Great Food 2) Friendly people 3) Low Prices 4) Breakfast or Lunch made to order 5) Quick Service  The first time I went to Acacia Cafe I thought it was a sit-down get waited on type of place. Not really what I was looking for, but we were hungry and I'd heard they had great food. To my surprise I discovered you order at the counter, pick out a table and wait a few minutes until they bring you your delicious meal. Just what I was looking for, a casual lunch place. On top of the great food the prices very reasonable. You just can't go wrong at Acacia Cafe!  I highly recommend the Veggie Pannini."}
{"text":"Second visit.  Unique breakfast items, good friendly service.  Very good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Acacia cafe is a good compromise from waiting to eat at a local favorite breakfast spot with a 40 minute wait. You order at the counter, you sit, and someone delivers your food. We decided to sit out at the patio. It's small - and the guy at the other table was smoking so that sucked...  Anyway...We ordered the omelet with mushrooms, onions, cheese, bacon, and spinach along with hash browns. It was delightful!   The burrito my fiance ordered was really good! I had to take two or three bites of it! The side of fruit was not fresh, but that's ok. I was too stuffed to eat it anyway.  We left with a small doggy bag. Overall service was quick, food was good, and we spent close to $16 for two entrees. We were in and out of there in about half an hour."}
{"text":"I just came back from Phoenix and was delighted to find this cool cafe, not too far from where I was staying.  The prices are unbelievable ($4 for a Belgian Waffle? Unheard of at most places!) and the environment is pretty relaxing.  Like the previous reviewer mentioned, it definitely has a neighborhood feel and the servers are very friendly.  I wish I had a few more days in Phoenix; I certainly would have come back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is made fresh, very friendly staff, and great pricing! It's always busy here so prepare to wait in line. It's worth the wait. Enjoy and help support a local business!!!"}
{"text":"Good solid food.  We have been coming year occasionally for the past few years. This is a friendly local place. The food is always good. The southwest burrito is great.."}
{"text":"SUCH a cute, friendly place! Terrific menu, and they serve breakfast all day. The veggie breakfast panini was outstanding and too big to eat in one sitting. First time here and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I did a little Yelping on Saturday morning in search of a good, cheap breakfast and this place caught my eye. I had driven past it a number of times but never stopped in.   Big thanks to past reviewers for dropping by and taking the time to Yelp about this place! It is uber clean and the food is fresh and tastes delicious. And the prices are amazingly affordable -- the gf and I got out of there stuffed with goodness and spent right about ten bucks between us.   Great find!"}
{"text":"Not only does Acacia offer good food for fair prices, they also give back to the community. This makes their yummy home-baked goods taste even sweeter!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my first meal at Acacia.  Food was good and service was fine and more than reasonably prompt, especially considering they were rather full.  I went with an expired Living Social coupon that was supposed to still be good for the initial purchase price.  The lady at the counter not unreasonably balked a little at the long expired coupon but did so courteously,  and after consulting the (other?) owner/manager (of her own volition and without prompting) - they honored the coup.  Food was delivered reasonably promptly, again especially considering how busy they were.  I had a great salad, fresh verdantly green spinach, with strawberries, guacamole, and a peppercorn dressing.  My friend had an omelette with fresh home-made hash browns and found his satisfying and filling as well.  Dining on the outdoor patio was great, due to unseasonably comfortably cool weather, and a slightly  unexpected pleasure considering the proximity to Indian School Road.  A good experience - Not on my usual travel path but will make effort to go back."}
{"text":"A cute and cozy breakfast cafe in the Arts District of Scottsdale serving breakfast and lunch.  I really wanted to like this place -it's really cute and on a nice day it would be a great place to sit and chat and enjoy the many shaded outdoor spots.  Maybe it was the rainy morning but our experience was a bit underwhelming. We arrived at 8, just as they opened and were greeted and given our choice of tables as we were the days first customers.  TIP: essential to have a reservation here (which we did) as it got busier and busier and they turned lots of walk-ins away.  Saying service is leisurely is the most generous way I can describe our experience. Even though we were the first customers, our server didn't drop by for 5-10 minutes with greetings and water. Further, once we ordered, it was over 45 minute wait for the food-breakfast food-French toast and an egg sandwich.  So surprising since typically breakfast fare is the fastest and easiest to prepare.  Maybe they were short of staff or maybe it was just the rain. 4 star food with 2 star service and as I always say, good food is a given; service is what really sets a place apart.  Reluctantly, not recommended."}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood for breakfast food, this is where I want to go. I almost always get a waffle, and my boyfriend likes one of the Southwest egg dishes. I've also spent time just hanging out, doing some writing on notebook or laptop. The inside atmosphere is pleasant, and the deck outside is just lovely. Always got good service and the people are very nice - only time the lady taking orders seemed a little short with us was when they were busy and the computer was glitching out."}
{"text":"Biked here this morning looking for a casual tasty breakfast spot that wouldn't break the bank. This place is next to my dry cleaners so I was a little curious. I was intrigued by the little side patio area which is comfy and quaint. Glad we came here. After tasting our food we immediately decided this was going to be a repeat spot for us. Nicely done Acacia, nicely done."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly would definitely recommend!  Awesome iced tea too!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast before a round of golf and I was impressed with the layout of Acacia Cafe and the variety of choices on the menu. They also serve breakfast all day here!  Acacia Cafe seemed to make their food on the healthier side and they even bake their breads on site. I ordered theSouth by Southwest burrito made with carne Adobada, fluffy eggs, grilled bell peppers, cheese, onions, pico de gallo and wrapped in a flour tortilla. Tasted very good and not greasy at all but flavorful.  I tasted the marble rye bread also so yummy too!  The woman who took my order at the counter and served the food was so sweet, she could tell this was my first visit and was so friendly and kind! The prices are very resonalble for the quality of food you receive.  I would definitely come back here again next time I'm visiting Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I looked up this place after following one of the reviewers from a previous restaurant.  I have to say that this is a simple place, & you can expect to spend around $10 for breakfast.  It is close to the Biltmore & the food is good.  I had their omelette with Turkey Sausage & Broccoli with Wheat Toast & Sliced Fruit.  They have very good options if you need to dial it back from vacation food as well.  Date of Visit 8/8, Approximately 9 or 930am"}
{"text":"Not bad for a CAFE.  Reasonably priced menu- good for a quick lunch.  I noticed several people in line ordering to go.   I had the salad with pears, pecans, and gorgonzola cheese. It was tasty- and reasonably sized for a lunch salad.   Their chocolate chip cookie was great also."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast. The guys always remember what I want, it's inexpensive, and it's consistently good. It makes getting up at 5:00 am (almost) worth it!"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars here. It's a nice little modern cafe, serving old school menu options. It's owner operated. Everything is fresh, but the menu is limited. If you are looking for a catered lunch with standard sandwich options and sides, this place would be a people pleaser.  The reason for the three stars is that the place wreaks of fried, smoky bacon, which I know appeals to a lot of people, but yuck. They have a lovely little outdoor patio, and I could tolerate the horrible smell while I order at the counter if there were more options. While there are a few vegetarian options, there are no vegan options (without stripping the meals of everything that makes them filling).   The employees are nice, but service can be a little slow on the weekends so only go if you're not in a hurry or you'll end up as stressed out as they are."}
{"text":"I first went here yesterday for lunch to help support Dining Out for Life.  My two coworkers and I were all new to the lunch spot and we were all impressed when we left.  I had the chicken salad sandwich with some jalapeno chips, one friend had the southwest salad and the other had a bagel and lox.  Yes, the service was a little slow.  We weren't on a time crunch so we were okay with it, although really hungry!  All of the food seemed very fresh and I think the delicious wheat bread for my sandwich might have been made that day.  It even came with a pickle - an added touch I like with my sandwiches and burgers.  The menu had a lot of options and the portions were good, but not overly huge.  Another plus - the price is right.  They also serve b-fast all day long - one of my favorites!  I will definitely be back here and now I have another work-lunch option in the area.  Woohoo!  One weird side note - I think we were the only people under 65 in the joint save one family with small children sitting outside..."}
{"text":"My neighborhood go-to for breakfast/lunch 3 to 4 times a week!  Everything is homemade, fresh and delicious.  Try the South By Southwest, simply amazing.  But so are their sandwiches and salads.  All baked goods made on site.  Delish!  The patio is nice when too when the weather permits.  Cute atmosphere overall.  The staff is very friendly and knows me and my order."}
{"text":"Such a great little local spot. I've been here a few times now both for eat in and takeout and the food is always great. The prices are very reasonable and the patio is a great place to eat now that the weather has improved. The staff are very friendly and this is a true local cafe."}
{"text":"Brunch here today was worth driving over 18 miles one-way.  Restaurant 's space was bright (large windows facing the parking lot and street), uncluttered, and attractive (shelf/bookcase with picture frames and a few knick-knacks gave the space a cozy atmosphere- don't know about the restroom as I didn't get a chance to visit it).  I asked if we were to seat ourselves, and I was told that we were to order at the counter and that we could then seat anywhere we wanted to.  I try to get a few suggestions wherever I go not only to check for allergens, but also for good customer service; it never sits well with me if staff members aren't able to suggest anything off of the menu.  After hearing a few enthusiastic lunch suggestions from the cashier, I placed in our order: a Belgian waffle with fresh fruit toppings (peaches and berries) for Mom, and a combo of half a Reubenesque panini and a small mixed salad.  It took about fifteen minutes before the food arrived, which gave us time to chit-chat and this was when I noticed the restaurant's surroundings.  I thought it cool to be able to watch the two cooks prepare the orders behind the counter.  My Mom LOVED the waffle with the fresh fruit toppings!  Her plate arrived with two 4x4-inch waffles, one with peaches and the other with sliced strawberries, a slice of pineapple and an orange wedge, all sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Mom sensed something was missing, and after asking for whipped cream, she and the waffles were fast friends.  My small salad looked beautiful- mixed greens with glazed pecans, a few pear slices, and blue cheese crumbles, a slice of grilled foccacia bread and a side of citrus vinaigrette.  My half-sandwich of shaved corned beef, swiss cheese, fresh sauerkraut on Acacia Cafe marble-rye bread looked tiny (Mom and I noticed the wee-portion right away), but it was full of flavor.  The combo was a definite hit with me, even though I did end up with a few allergy symptoms.    Kudos to AC for winning over my Mom... we will visit again to try other menu selections soon!"}
{"text":"There's a fresh breeze making the Acacia Cafe one of the coolest casual dining spots in Phoenix. The new energy is in more than the vibe, you can taste it in the creative but reasonably priced food, and feel it in the quick, friendly service. It's all good, but my current fave is the mouth-watering veggie scramble panini with roasted eggplant, zucchini, red pepper, provolone, and sun-dried tomato cream cheese. Plenty of choices to wash down the deliciousness. The patio is a huge bonus now the weather is cooler. Central location and more relaxed feel than the usual places makes this an easy choice for breakfast to lunch or anything in between."}
{"text":"I feel it's time to update this review based on several poor experiences. We live around the corner and have eaten here numerous times and let me be clear, the food is completely edible/serviceable/whatever you wanna call it.   HOWEVER, the service here is.....unprofessional? The owners (I think they are the owners, the man and woman who run the joint anyway) make the entire experience completely uncomfortable. They sit and bicker at each other, and their employees, the ENTIRE time. It is unbelievable.  I called ahead on my way home to order two sandwiches. It took 4 attempts to get anyone to pickup the phone. Once \"Michael S\" did pick up the phone, I was put on hold and waited. I waited, and I waited, and I waited. I waited so long that I had arrived at the restaurant before he ever returned. Whatever.   So I go inside, very few people in line, wait, order and then the bickering begins. Very awkward for everyone in the restaurant. But here's the kicker: 40 FUCKING MINUTES LATER I GET MY SANDWICHES!!!! 40 MINUTES? SERIOUSLY? FOR 2 SANDWICHES!?!?!? Sure there were people in the restaurant, of course there are going to be people in your restaurant. So what's the goddam problem? This is what you're supposed to do right? You want to serve food right? And let me be clear, this was not a one off. This happens consistently.   On top of all of this, I feel that the quality of the food is deteriorating. My go to chicken salad sandwich is weaker and weaker every time. OH! And 75 cents for avocado demands more than a teaspoon of avo.   For comparison, we ate at the Duck and Decanter today. Similar price, BETTER sandwich, and surprise! I waited for 15 minutes tops. I mean, what a joke this place is. And my wife's sandwich actually had some avo on it. Wow. It's just not that hard.   I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because yes, if you are in a pinch and need sustenance, you can eat here and you will be satiated. Hell, it MIGHT even be good. But the service blows, the wait is completely redonculous, and the bitching that goes on between the owners is baffling. Drive the 10 minutes and go to the D&D, you will thank me, trust me!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast, and while the wait time was unbearable, I chalk it up to cranky hangover paranoia. The orange juice was awesome! Other notable features are how clean and comfortable the place is, the sheer deliciousness of the food, and the probability of me coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Tried Acacia today with a friend from out of town and my wife. The atmosphere is minimalistic and clean. You order at the counter from a relatively small menu and pay there as well. You choose where you want to sit, either indoors or outdoors and they bring the food to you. It wasn't busy when I was there so the food came out quickly. The waitress was a typical waitress, not terribly polite, but not rude. I asked for sour cream with my omlette and she simply stated \"we don't have sour cream.\" This was really the only interaction we had with the wait staff.  The food was pretty darn good. My omlette was cooked just right, and had a copious amount of filing. I enjoyed my hash browns which were a pile of crispy shredded potatoes, not the compressed cake kind. My friend and my wife both enjoyed their meals. My friend had a turkey sandwich on marbled rye and at one point he proclaimed \"This is a really good sandwich!\".  All in all I give this place 4 stars. The wait staff was not bad, but did not shine, the atmosphere was nothing special, but was clean and comfortable and the food was great. If the food hadn't been as good as it was, I'd probably only give it 3. The 3 of us ate for under $30, drinks included. While I won't be going out of my way to eat here (its outside my usual stomping grounds), if I'm in the neighborhood this place will be on the top of my list for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This was walking distance from my old house, and my boyfriend and I frequented our weekend mornings for breakfast quite often.  The employees at Acacia always make you feel like you're at \"home\" and treat you like family. We even ended up finding ourselves here on Mother's Day, and the lady that (might be the owner), and definitely a Mother was busy taking care of all her guests at the restaurant for breakfast and truly seemed to enjoy making people happy.  My go-to was always the breakfast sandwich on sourdough, bacon, eggs & cheese with a side of hashbrowns. They had this really yummy cinnamon vanilla coffee blend too that I'd always order.  You won't regret stopping by here for breakfast! When it's nice outside, the patio in the morning was always peaceful and a nice way to get your day going."}
{"text":"Ordered take out to have food on our flight back home. We ordered the Mediterranean sandwich (on ciabatta bread) and Turkey sandwich. Both sandwich were good and I really enjoyed my Mediterranean sandwich - it was full of veggies that blended well together. It took a while for the food to be ready but for the price and for what you get, it was worth it."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaraunt. I'm so glad to have a regular spot for breakfast that is close to home and simply delicious! The omelets are amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a bite there last week. Had the assorted bruschetta, and all were very flavorful. Sat at the bar and girl was nice, had six canned beers on special. They have a Living Social out now so I recommend you use it. Will offset the kind of pricey menu."}
{"text":"Love their Chai! The best in Phoenix for sure! Service was a little slow. The cashier might be recently hired. However, super cute place!"}
{"text":"Quaint little breakfast nook . I ordered an omelette, and my aunt ordered the same. Very large portions for the price, and the eggs were perfectly fluffy. Staff is friendly, and food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast and open early (5am). Went in around 5:30am, the food was cooked to order and beautifully served on a nice square plate. Very personable. Highly recommended for early breakfast."}
{"text":"I had no idea Acacia cafe would be so delicious. I have been here for breakfast quite a few times now, and each time I am pleasantly surprised. The food is high quality for low cost (almost diner) prices.    A few of my favorites:  Awesome waffles cooked to perfection and covered in fresh ripe fruit. The veggie omelet (try the roasted vegetable mix), the hash browns its served with are always crisp and not greasy. The vegetable sandwich with cheddar cheese  In addition to the food, the beverages are also great. They have three types of fresh brewed tea (the passion fruit is my favorite) and their cappuccinos and coffees are excellent also. The staff is friendly and quick to help you make up your mind, and it has always been very clean and well organized. This is a must try for a quick breakfast, I can't wait to go back for lunch and try the chicken salad everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritos - although I wish they came with salsa and the cafe would start having sour cream to order on the side. Busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I am giving this 4-stars even though my cinnamon roll was 3-star because my husband and friend both demolished amazing omelet/egg dishes that they raved about! They had 4-5 selections for iced tea which was appreciated by our Texan friend, and the portions and pricing were excellent."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for the last 3 or 4 years every day on my way to work. Finally today, I stopped procrastinating and made the decision to finally try it out.  First of all...breakfast served all day? I love you already. As tempting as the omlettes sounded, it was a bit warm outside, so I went the refreshing route with the Cashew Chicken salad. Yummmmm. This is one of my favorite salads to get at anywhere I go, but places like Paradise Bakery and CPK tend to fill it with too much cabbage...this was the perfect amount of greens, chicken and toppings, and the sauce - delicious!  Service - great. You could tell the woman owner had a sarcastic-no BS sense of humor, which I find refreshing in the service industry.  Price...$7.11 for the full size salad. Cheaper than dine-in restaurants. More expensive than bagged salads from the grocery store. What can you do?  Atmosphere - nothing to really write home about. Not a place I'm going to meet with a client for a business lunch, but to grab food to-go for myself, absolutely. Nothing wrong with it...very clean & tidy. Just a bit too cafeteria style for my taste.   All in all...will definitely be back. Especially for the breakfast!"}
{"text":"The Arizona BLT- crispy bacon, fresh lettuce, ruby red tomato, avocado, red onion, chipotle mayo, crusty ciabatta bread. Best DAMN BLT I've ever had, no question."}
{"text":"Four stars because I've only been here once, when I return a few more times I'm sure they get the final star.  This place reminds me of a European cafe. No frills, simple decor, and pleasant staff willing to help you make a decision.  I had a breakfast burrito, forgot what it was called, it looked a little small on the plate but by the time I finished I was full and satisfied. Yummy.  I wish this place had a bit more of a patio/landscaping, just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"I love their roast beef sandwich. The couscous side is perfect as well. With a soda, it was less than $9! Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I had a great time. I took a magazine and newspaper and just hung out for a while. The food and coffee was great! I had this great Asian Wrap. I even took a sandwich to go for my partner! (which he loved). I'm on my way back there right now to try out breakfast. This is a great little neighborhood cafe"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick breakfast, the operative word being quick. Ordered sat down and waited for our breakfast, which was just omelets, fruit cup, and toast. Ended up waiting for half an hour for food that was far from bad, but nothing too special. Guess I'll have to try the lunch menu if I go back."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly ( they know your name and what you like) Food is FRESH prepared well and delivered hot.  Only issue is lunch time rush.  The place is good and \"cooked to order\" takes time."}
{"text":"We had Acacia do a catering for one of our special customers. I ask for a sandwich and salad bar type lunch. Great clean food and the customer loved it. Thank you to Chef Steven for contacting me and going through the order with me. Everyone loved it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for breakfast & lunch for years. Food & service are always great! The staff get to know the regulars by name & are always friendly.  I have also used them for catering & they are very attentive to detail & I've always been very happy with the meals."}
{"text":"I ordered the south by Southwest with a side of hashbrowns.  I had a $1 coupon and my bill was $5 something.   A bargain.   The burrito wasn't my taste but I will be back to try a regular breakfast.  The service was 5 star.  The atmosphere is 5 star.  Flowers on each table.  Clean and cute.    In Arcadia you would pay 8 for just an egg and toast.  I walked in thinking this was going to be an overpriced Arcadia cafe.  I was wrong.   A great value."}
{"text":"I had a revelation, coffee and sandwiches go great together! I don't recommend having coffee with one of those Jalepeno'd hot-sauced, spicy meat, pepper jack cheese monsters that every place seems to be slinging, but coffee and chicken salad on marble rye, perfecto!   Acacia is off the beaten path and as my lunch date commented, \"this place reminds me of some place in D.C.\" It was set up like a shop you'd see in a bustling city, but didn't have the patrons, nor the speed of say a Boston sandwich shop. \"Let's go to Kelly's and gets some roast beef\" (Bostonians know what I'm saying)   It was dead to say the least, a few lunchers (new word) but not at all busy, and it was about 12:20pm. We ordered, and about 15 minutes later got our food. It was very slow for lunch, and for the amount of orders they had. I had a 1pm meeting so we couldn't eat in house, and had to take it home. Overall the menu was great, prices excellent, and service friendly.  My date left a You've Been Yelped card. I thought it would be cool to drop the card on the counter and say \"You been Yelped Mother F'er!\" Then proceed to walk out all gansta style, and throw your hands up in the air. It' be like a drive by Yelping...."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero I would. Just for the staff alone. Walked into the cafe today which we frequent to very often. As we were in line they asked the party size we answered 10. She huffed and puffed bid we know that it is a small cafe and we always do different table scattered threw the restaurant. We told her not to worry we were fine. She starts moving the tables as my kids are sitting there at the table we are still in line. We ask her what she is doing she starts saying there policy doesn't allow them to move tables. We said well we are not asking you to move the tables and our kids are sitting and we were fine. Again with the huffing and puffing. She goes to the cashier and starts complaining about us saying we were arguing with her. We bid you are still inline to place our order. We can hear everything. My friend walked up and informed the cashier that we were not arguing, we were telling her that we were fine that was it. We told them that we would just leave. As we are walking out she continued to say we are arguing with them. I have never been treated this way and I will not put up with that."}
{"text":"I now work just a few minutes away from Acacia and got lunch from there today. Based on the reviews, I decided to try the veggie panini ($6.50). It was solidly delicious but not stellar. In particular, the foccacia was a bit dry. I think that the not-so-Vigan sandwich at the nearby Vig (that may not be the exact name of the sandwich, but it's close) is a lot better (albeit $2 or $3 dollars more expensive). I still think this spot is a quality and affordable lunch spot, and the service is always outstanding, but I'm not adding on the extra star based on the veggie sandwich I tried."}
{"text":"Love this adorable breakfast/lunch place with a family feel. The food is always tasty and fresh. Coffee is great too! The staff is so friendly and I can tell there are a ton of regulars. Also, it's very reasonably priced. I will be coming here regularly and often"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, we had an entertainment book coupon which they accepted with no problem. I got the eggs benedict and my friend got a chicken panini sandwich. We also split a cup of the Posole. Food was good, reasonably priced. We had a nice experience."}
{"text":"Let me first start off with the things I like about this place. The food here is good, I wouldn't say it's the best breakfast in town, but it does the trick. I would best compare this to what you make at home, nothing fancy. What brings this place down some is the fact that it is just as good as what you could do at home. The ingredients fall short for me. The bacon and sausage are just okay, nothing special. The service also is just okay, not the friendliest front of house. With all of that mumbo jumbo said, I would say this place is a good place to get a simple fresh meal for a good price.   Side note: You may smell like breakfast after so bring a change of clothes!"}
{"text":"OK, I have to start out by pointing out that I love Acacia Cafe, but their sign/logo is written in Papyrus....Papyrus, people. I wonder if one of my graphic artist friends would be willing to work something new up for them on trade.  But I'm not here to talk about the logo, I'm here to talk about the food. I have lived right around the corner from Acacia Cafe for going on 2 years, and never went inside. What a mistake!  They have the most amazing freshly-baked multigrain bread I have had in Phoenix. We must have gotten there at just the right time because the place was filled with the aroma of fresh bread. It was so good that all I said to the lady taking my order was: I want whatever comes with that bread.   They hooked me up with a veggie scramble with a side of the toasted amazingness that is their bread. It was heaven  This is exactly the kind of place I love to discover, tucked away next to a dry cleaner in a shopping center. Amazing, fresh food."}
{"text":"It's OK for a quick breakfast. Prices are low. Breakfast burrito was pretty good. Coffee was average and wasn't kept full... self serve."}
{"text":"Excellent food, awesome prices. So happy to find it! The Southwest Burrito was delicious, and only 4.50! They had a nice mix of breakfast (served all day), and lunch items like salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"This cafe is what a cafe is about ! Small town, great food, professional, great staff, and genuine ! There style would succeed in a big  city vs small town due to it's great fresh food!!!! About time."}
{"text":"What a nice little place!  We had a perfect breakfast this morning.  We drag in there after the gym, slightly sweaty and still in our gym clothes and it's not a problem there!  Good coffee (but the cups are TOO small).  My daughter's french toast was cinnamon heaven!  I had the special, some southwest eggs benedict thing with green chiles - very good.  The fruit was fresh, it's clean and has quick service!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place to grab breakfast this is the spot. The food is excellent and the price is very reasonable. We definitely enjoyed having brunch or breakfast here and sitting out on the patio"}
{"text":"Do you like affordable, unpretentious breakfast and lunch dishes made with great ingredients? What about great service? Corned beef hash?  If you said yes to one of those, Acacia Cafe is the spot for you. If you didn't say yes to one of those, you're a liar.   This place has been open for basically my entire adult life and the founder recently passed away. Local restauranteurs (the same folks who own Base Pizzeria) purchased the restaurant and kept the same folks and the same feel, but have injected the cafe with some much needed new energy.   Highly recommended and family and kid friendly.   And look at that corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Adorable little place with amazing customer service. The menu is simple and well made. I enjoyed the house made mini jams on the table. Highly recommended for a casual meal."}
{"text":"I've been going to Acacia Caf√© for the better part of two years now.  I said Sack's was one of my two favorite lunch spots, and Acacia is the other.    I think I've pretty much eaten my way through their menu and can't say I've ever had a bad experience there.  Whether you're in the mood for breakfast or lunch, Acacia never disappoints.  I love their Miami Ham, their take on a Cuban.  I also really like their Chicken Caesar salad, chicken salad on a croissant, veggie panini, Egg Salad, Omelet, and I could go on, but I'll spare you.  Okay wait. If you like soup, their daily chicken noodle is better than Mom made, Yes, sorry Mom (She only made Campbell's anyway).  And on Thursdays, I really like their Turkey Chili  The place get's hoppin' around noon so either go around 11:30 or wait until 1:00 if you don't like crowds.  The patio is great anytime other than summer.  They used to serve China Mist iced tea, which I really liked, but now they serve a different brand that I don't care for as much.  I brought this to their attention, and was told I was the only one who had said anything about it.  That's okay though, it is still good tea.    My only complaint with the place is the tables are a little close together, but it's great if you want to hear all about why Facebook and Twitter are going to be the downfall of our society because of all the psychopaths using them, or who did what with who the night before even though you don't know them or them."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch today with my mom. This place is super cute, it has a really nice looking patio and the inside is small, but clean and comfortable. I got the veggie scramble sandwich with orange juice and she got a blt. It was so inexpensive! My mom had a coupon for bogo entrees with the purchase of two drinks which brought our total to 8$. Seriously?!?! Without the coup it would be like 12$....pretty amazing. The food was good. It was not the most amazing food ever, but it was fresh and cooked by a person in a pan (not in a microwave) and beats the pants off of an Einstein bagel sandwich or anywhere else with comparable prices. The veggie scramble had a variety of tasty vegetables like eggplant and mushrooms in addition to cheese and tomato. My mom enjoyed her sandwich (and the couscous that came with it). I saw some other people get salads...they were huge! I would definitely come here again for breakfast and would like to try lunch here."}
{"text":"Since the last post my diet has changed dramatically. I had to learn how to find the right places to eat and Acacia was one that I now frequent because they are super flexible and when I told them what I couldn't eat they offered up alternatives.  THAT WAS AWESOME!  Sometimes it doesn't seem like the lady at the front register isn't so friendly but once you get to know her you realize she does care. It's quickly becoming one of my fav's."}
{"text":"Before making a Saturday trip to Home Depot, my mom and I decided to grab a quick early breakfast here. This spot is located just minutes from our houses and I've been eyeing it ever since I bought my place last year.   They have ample seating both inside and out and of course plenty of parking since the Caf√© is located right next to Zipps in that strip mall on Indian School. I thought this was a sit-down restaurant, but its actually a counter-order place which worked out great. The prices are nice and the portions were generous. Mom went for the bacon and cheese omellete with hash browns and cottage cheese and I gave into my sweet tooth with the French toast which was amazing. I also got a Mocha to go with my meal and I really enjoyed their coffee there as well, decently priced there too. The food came out quickly, was freshly made and delicious. What more could you want from a neighborhood breakfast joint? We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I wanted a reasonably priced place for breakfast with my son, and found this on Yelp. Was wondering about some of the service comments, but found the service to be impeccable and friendly, especially from the aforementioned \"Soup Nazi.\" Maybe attitude begets attitude?  Was early and told her I would just have coffee until he came, and I was just handed a mug and a water glass (all coffee's self-serve) without any request for a credit card or payment. Nothing but smiles for the whole time we were there., which was about 9:30-11.  I had the veggie scramble (which wasn't obvious to me that it came as a sandwich), and it was tasty and perfectly cooked (a nit-pick: would have been nice to get a small cup of fruit like my son's egg/meat/veggies mix did).  We sat for about 90 minutes and never even a stare from the staff to relinquish the table, which we did when we saw the early lunch crowd start to come in.  I don't live too close, so may not get back often. But will always keep in mind for breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and have always received the bare minimum customer service required to be considered a hospitality establishment, but the food has always been good so I continued to go. If you have ever seen the Soup Nazi on the Seinfeld show then you'll know what I'm referring to...if you speak out of turn you will be corrected and even punished with even worse service.... if you order breakfast during lunch time you will be given the dirtiest look from the server and even the  cook (even though they serve breakfast all day). I have experienced the worst form of service in my entire life on my last visit ever...I ordered an omelet at 1:12 pm and I was given the usual dirty look, but this time the server went to the extreme by telling the next customer that she hopes they aren't ordering an omelet too!!! The server wanted me to hear her disgust with my order and the customer was very confused even asking the server \"What's wrong with the omelette's ?) Well I got your point and I won't inconvenience you and your cooks anymore in the future. Very disappointed in Michael's management skills in regards to training staff to treat customers with respect at all times. You might have survived in business for many years, but have you actually Thrived? I think the employees, especially the older lady at the cash register needs to go through Anger Management and be retrained in customer- service."}
{"text":"If you are tired of paying $18 a salad where you are paying for the ambiance more than your food, then this is the pace to try. It's simple, nothing fancy. They have a great selection of salads, soups, and sandwiches.  The prices are incredibly reasonable. I ordered a salad, cup of soup, and  iced tea ask for around $10. I had their Asian cashew salad which had an abundance of crunchy noodles, cashews, and almonds. So yummy. I was pleasantly surprised. I also ordered the Tuscan chicken soup and that was alright.   The staff is very helpful and friendly. They handed me their paper menu which has the description  of everything in their menu. Great customer service! The day that I came I noticed an older crowd. Mostly retirees."}
{"text":"On my first visit, I would have given this place a definite 4 stars. Oatmeal was the choice plus tea and my bill was a whole $3. Score! This could be the place to be when I don't want to wait in line at LGO or when I'm willing to trade off paying $15 for a superb meal when I can pay $5 for a good meal. Adorable interior, cute atmosphere, busy as bees, and uber neighborhoody vibes. Perfect place and to sit and conspire on an early Saturday morning.  Visit numero dos was less impressive. Looking back, I can't recall the service from my first experience, but I sure remember it from the latter. I bought a Daily Deal coupon thingy - the woman at the register was about to put her foot down over the fact that I didn't print it despite me having the electronic version on my phone when her boss came to the rescue and confirmed it was a-ok. Don't get huffy with me princess just because you were overruled. After that, she didn't go out of her way to be accommodating. At. All.  The veggie sammich was aight. My dining companion opted for the eggs, hash and toast - all of which seemed mediocre, though the toast a little sad (i.e. cold). Good portions for good prices. Still a nice place to be for brunch. Maybe the trick is to just have some 'tude yourself at the counter and then burrow into a back table to stay out of the way."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone. The owner who works here does not treat his customers like a customer should be treated. Also he is unprofessional to his employees. The food was ice cold, and Kim got my order incorrect. Gave it to.someone else. I enjoyed Karen's service she was a true professional  U need more employees like her. She was persistent to my needs  I own my own restaurant and would love to have her work for me. I will be taking my business elsewhere to a much better ran establishment."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! Love the REAL jam. It wasn't pre packaged like I've seen at other restaurant. Big selection of teas! Like the coffee."}
{"text":"THE LASTING IMPRESSION: (an update on 3/31/08)  Wow. The chicken salad sandwich on wheat bread is the bomb. I chowed down on this like nobody's business. And hooray for fresh fruit as my side, with smooth and satisfying coffee.   I got my sandwich to go. Again, service was slow.   While there, I had to pee. Hey, it happens. Bathroom was pretty clean, considering... and then it happened. Oh.My.God.   ***I SAW A ROACH ON THE WALL!***   It crawled down at me, its little antenna twitching. I about threw up in my mouth. I don't think I can look at Acacia Cafe the same way again.   3 stars is the best I can give now.   MY FIRST EXPERIENCE:  (was initially 4 stars)  I have always wanted to try Acacia Cafe. I've driven by it many times, yet didn't stop in until my lunch date and myself made a point to try a new place. Enter Acacia Cafe, per my request. I'm glad he listened to me!   The place is bright and open - with tables inside and a nice patio outside. There's a tiny fridge area if you want to grab a quick juice or yogurt. Otherwise, you can step up to the counter and eye the expansive menu. Making your choice is tough. I went with the Veggie Panni, with a side of couscous. Served warm, the Veggie Panni had roasted eggplant, zucchini, red pepper and onions stacked on a grilled ciabatta. The pesto mayo was a nice touch - not overpowering whatsoever. Very good!  The couscous was really great. I tried it first and couldn't put it down.   My date had the Chicken Salad Sandwich. Adding almonds and grapes were a nice touch. It was good! The chips - roasted pepper and sea salt - were incredible. I didn't want to stop munching on them. And I had my huge Veggie Panni to contend with. The sandwich was large, cut in two, and perfect for 1/2 now and 1/2 later. For $6.75, that's a pretty good deal.   Oh, did I mention we each got complimentary pickles?   For drinks, we both had Vanilla Hazelnut coffee. Very good!   I've already recommended to friends that if they want a new lunch spot or cool place to meet for coffee, then Acacia Cafe is a top choice. (WORD TO THE WISE: They don't offer Iced Coffee.)  Yet, the service... ah, how slow it was! We were the only two there who placed an order. Why did it take over 10 minutes from the time we paid until the time they called our name? I mean, it was even an ORDER TO GO! Did they have to go out back and cut the veggies themselves? Maybe they had to pluck the chicken first. Whatever it was, it left a bad taste in my mouth - which is why I definitely can't rate this place any higher.  HOURS OF OPERATION: (so sayeth the receipt)  Mon - Fri: 7 a.m. - 3 p.m. Sat & Sun: 8 a.m. - 2 p.m."}
{"text":"a nice find for some chill breakfast in phoenix! i got the eggs benedict and it was good. love their patio dining area..very cozy atmosphere. they also offer coffee and pastries. their jams were very tasty as well."}
{"text":"I have been a semi-regular at the Acacia Cafe for over a year now. I first found this local place from a New Times ad. I like to eat breakfast later in the morning/early afternoon, and the Acacia Cafe is one of the few non-chain places in the Arcadia/Biltmore area that serves breakfast after 11 AM.  The food is very good and fresh. Everything is made there including the bread, which is one of the highlights. The Eggs My Way is a great deal and very filling. I have recently grown to like the waffles as well.  The wait staff is very friendly, and they get to know your name.  The restaurant can fill up quickly, so sometimes it can be a challenge to find a seat. If you go late morning or after noon, it shouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"Great place! Order at the counter, refill your own coffee, enjoy the friendly staff, meet with your friends or associates, and then head off to work. They're one of the earliest open breakfast joints around town and the price is always right. Menu is a little thin and the flavors won't blow your mind, but it's a pretty dang satisfying experience that you can have every week (or more) without breaking the budget!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to update and add a third review.  Although this place has good food and I have gone four or five times now I am very upset over how rude we were treated today on 9/12/13. The woman who works the counter is always a bit off and snappy but today she was actually very ugly to my friend and I did not appreciate it.   Sadly it was my friends first time visiting. What a horrid first impression. My friend is so sweet she felt the need to apologize profusely only for asking questions about the menu and food allergies. I told my friend that she had no right to apologize since it was the woman's fault not hers.   The woman who works behind the counter does this type of thing all the time but today she was extra special nasty. I hate to tell her but you never know who your customers are so you should respect all. ( if she only knew-lol) The weird thing is that all the other workers in this restaurant are extra delightful and excellent. I guess they make up for Ms Grumpy and Overwhelmed. I understand having a bad day and am usually very forgiving of that having worked in many restaurants myself. However, you should never sigh, bang the counter, yell and scream, continue to shout, \"15 minutes to closing time\" and complain about how dirty your customers are within earshot of them. Also, rolling your eyes at a costumer for only asking about your Delish food is usually frowned upon in good costumer service manuals.   This worker is the odd ball for sure. ( Lordy is she the owner? That would be funny. Funny sad, not funny, haha) I don't believe I will come back unless this is corrected. This is not NYC's Seinfield's Soup Kitchen."}
{"text":"**NOW OPEN FOR SUNDAY BRUNCH**  8 am -  3 pm   This is a true neighborhood cafe with fresh food at neighbor-friendly prices.  Acacia Cafe just opened and I couldn't be happier.  It is easy to miss, sandwiched between an Italian restaurant and a retail plaza.  I stopped in the morning and was delighted to find a clean space with a great breakfast and lunch menu that is much more extensive then their website suggests.  For breakfast, they have several breakfast sandwiches, omelettes, and scrambles, a yogurt parfait, and an array of baked goods.  For lunch, they have about 5 different salads, 5 different sandwiches, and fresh made soup.    The counter person was super friendly as was proud to gush about the quality of the ingredients they use and that everything was made fresh including their baked goods (which includes cookies, rice crispy bars, scones, breads, croissants...).    I had a croissant and it was fantastic.  Seriously, the best I have had anywhere in Phoenix.   If all this doesn't sell you, the prices will.  Breakfast items (including the breakfast entrees, like the veggie scramble, which all include a breakfast bread of your choice) were under $4 and lunch items were under $6!   My killer croissant was $1.50.  I guess you can keep prices low when you make everything in house.  They open super early 5 AM - 3 PM during the week, and a little later on the weekends.  (open Sat., closed Sun.), so you can pop in after an early morning spin session at Studio 360.   And parking is plentiful.  Let's review.  Cheap, tasty, and convenient.  It's the trifecta. FINALLY, an alternative to the mob scene that was once my favorite neighborhood spot (aka LGO)."}
{"text":"There was a time where this was my daily breakfast place, but I have since changed office locations, which is a HUGE bummer.  The coffee (specifically french roast) is the best I've had in town, literally.  Their breakfast food is so great, usually the breakfast burrito or the two egg plate is my choice, but literally everything is awesome.  The owner, along with the staff is very friendly and gets to know you by name, which is refreshing in today's world."}
