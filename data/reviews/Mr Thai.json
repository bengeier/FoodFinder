{"text":"Went to this place a couple days ago and ordered a Vegetable Panang Thai curry for take-out. What I found when I came back home was a bowl full of pieces of what looks like the stem or root of some plant (lemongrass? hard to tell). The largest part was at least an inch in diameter and impossible to chew (probably wasn't supposed to be chewed). That part of the dish was inedible and it took me a while to collect all these the pieces and put them aside.  I tried to contact the restaurant to ask for explanations, they did not seem to care because they did not even reply to my queries.  Will never go back here, even though it is steps from my apartment. I'd rather go to Lime on Eglinton to get a respectable Thai meal."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery, and ordered a fresh mango roll, vegetable tom-yum soup, mango salad, and chicken pad thai. The fresh mango roll tasted like it had anise or something in it, but I couldn't find it to take it out, minus the black licorice flavour it would have been good.  The soup didn't wow me, the broth was good but didnt have much actually in it other then brocoli and bok choy, and didn't have any mushrooms as promised.  The pad thai was just average, maybe slightly less then average, and was more along the lines of the red kind you get from SpringRolls then a traditional pad thai.   I don't think I would order from there again.  The tom yum soup and pad thai I've had from the new Thai Express on St. Clair were much better. I haven't had the mango salad, I ordered it to have for left overs with the left over pad thai for the following night."}
{"text":"Mr. Thai, you've disappointed me for the last time. I won't be returning.  Initially, I learned to accept the quality here (I would have originally given it 2.5-3 stars); what kept me coming back was the convenience of proximity... But I can't justify supporting this establishment any longer. In my opinion, this experience has dropped Mr. Thai to below the quality of food found at Thai Express.  Tonight's take-out meal consisted of a fresh salad roll and a red curry chicken. The salad roll was fine, other than the slightly-less-than-fresh tasting chicken within.  But it was the red curry chicken that tipped the scale. It was grey (when it is usually a light pink here) and tasted decidedly watered down, as though they had begun to run low and simply added chicken stock and a thickening agent. I was not even able to remedy it by adding some of my own paste and fish sauce at home. Horrible."}
{"text":"Poor service. Hard to have a conversation over the very loud music, a/c and busser moving dishes. Will not be going back.   Oh, and the 'Thai' food was what you'd expect from an office tower food court."}
{"text":"I walked in around 11:15 - 11:20. The door was open but the restaurant was empty. I started looking at the menu as this woman walked in and told me that she won't open for another 15-20 minutes. I said that I don't mind just waiting until the kitchen opens (the tables were already set, everything was prepped). She bluntly said that she would rather have me come back.  She seemed annoyed and made no attempt to apologize, accommodate, or explain.      Wow. I've been in the service industry for over 12 years now, and as long as we have everything prepped we always welcome early birds. I don't know if she was just an employee, a manager, or the owner, but with this attitude this place won't last long. I'm not surprised other reviewers are not that enthusiastic either."}
{"text":"We ate here on the weekend quite enjoyed it. The food came swiftly and was very good. The meals are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm a busy guy.  That means I live to save time, meaning I like to get what I want, and quickly.   But I also try to be a healthy guy.   That means I really don't like grease. It tends to slow me down. See the busy part, above.  The food came pretty quick, but it was way too slick. I'm a steam cook my vegetables kind of guy, boil it if you really have to.   Price was good, but not sure I'll go back. They do have an interesting menu special that lets you pick from a wide range of options."}
{"text":"Good service but very bland food. They only had sriracha hot sauce and sushi kind soy sauce. Would not return."}
{"text":"Ate here today since there are not a lot of options on Sunday. Ordered one of their lunch specials which is green curry beef with rice at $10.45 tax included.  The curry was runny, bland and has small servings. I can eat at New Thai Family Restaurant a few blocks beside Sobeys at a lesser price and still have a satisfying experience.  The only saving grace is the quiet environment and not sure if that's helpful for a restaurant business and my polite server which I forgot the name."}
{"text":"I been here once over the lunch hour. It was packed! Had to wait to get a table. We ordered the Cashew Nut chicken. It wasn't bad, but not great either. There were hardly any cashews in it which was disappointing. I probably wouldn't go back, because I can get more bang for my buck somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not the best, but the food's pretty decent and for \"to-go\" the speed of meals ordered from the lunch menu are made quickly.  I ordered \"pick-up\" from the lunch specials and all-in-all, the food and price were decent, however the meal size wasn't as filling as I would've liked as it kept me hungry.  Last time I went, I ate there as a sit-down customer and the service was really bad, where I had to wait quite the extended periods of time just for a water, let alone having my order taken.  While waiting for my meal this time, I noticed that the chair I was sitting on was rather unstable, so be careful where you sit at this venue."}
{"text":"The one guy working both take out and service was a little stretched but courteous, although he did seem a bit stressed. The food was decent for a fast food type Thai place, came out quick, lots of it for a fair price. I liked that the pad Thai was not too sweet, and since my partner can't handle too much spice, I asked how hot the general Tao was and the guy promised to dial down the heat. It was delicious (comparable to Markham Chinese take out) and my partner loved it. Great for take out or delivery I guess, don't know about dining in but it's not a bad option if you're strolling by and could go for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"I agree with a 2 star rating for this restaurant.  For Thai food, this place delivers below average quality food.  This is western customization of Asian food at it's worst.  Mediocre spices and curries with too much rice for lunch specials.  It's straying too far from authentic, and not in a good way.  I've tried this place a few times now, usually 6 months apart, and keep hoping it will get better.  But after ordering I remember why I stopped coming here in the first place.  There's a couple of better Thai options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had take away and it was ready in about 10 minutes, that was the highlight of the dining experience.  Coconut chicken soup was inedible, it tasted more like watery chicken pot pie than anything else. The pad thai wasn't terrible, lots of tofu and egg, but it's rather ketchupy.   I'll stick with Thai Express around the corner for a quick thai fix."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a snowy winter night and was pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem! The positive experience began with me having to call them to modify an order placed from the web. They were extremely friendly and gave me the heads up that because of the weather the order might take a bit longer.  We had Veggies Pad Thai which was loaded with fresh crunchy vegetables and three wok dishes - ginger chicken, black bean shrimp and snow peas. All dishes were loaded with flavour and generous portions of meat and veggies. The shrimp was fantastic. Very meaty and cooked perfectly.  I was surprised to see some of the lower ratings - but I did notice that most of these reviews are quite old so maybe they have stepped up a bit.   I didn't try any curries so can't vouch for that and I did think that mango salad was a bit odd."}
{"text":"Pretty good food served slowly by a surly teenager who makes you listen to the worst, most auto-tuned, sugar-coated hip-pop I've ever endured.  Order your food to go."}
{"text":"I ordered the green mango salad with veggie tempura. It was a bit overpriced for the quality of food. The restaurant seemed pretty dead, and the service was ok. You order your food, get a glass of water and that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"I've always felt that this neighbourhood was missing a cheap pan-asian type place that serves food made to order.  I mean like in the guise of Salad King, or even Green Mango or Spring Rolls.  But then again, every neighbourhood needs a Salad King.  Enter Mr. Thai.  It's replaced the former Circle Thai a high end Thai food wannabe. Mr. Thai is occupying half the space Circle Thai did, and probably have the same owners.  The place seats about 30.  The previous Circle Thai was a disaster.  But this isn't a review about them.  So when I saw that Mr. Thai had opened last week, I was praying for Salad Kingesque place, and decided to give it a try.  The place on Friday lunch service was a massive zoo!  It confirmed to me that this was exactly what this neighbourhood is looking for.  The line up went out the door.    They were obviously having service issues just because of the sheer numbers.  I managed to grab a seat just as someone was leaving, and was watching people come in, take a look and just leave because it was so packed.  I had the Spicy Thai Chicken on rice, which also had a mango salad.  For $6.99 this is what I'm looking for in a cheap pan-asian place.  The portion is a little smaller that what you'd expect at Salad King, but the menu is very comparable.  The place is nicely renovated, but still using the old furniture from Circle Thai, but they're in fine condition, as it probably didn't get much usage before."}
{"text":"This place probably has the WORST FOOD in GTA! I dont understand how they are still in business. Hope they go down soon! They are a shame to Thai culture! They are not different than any SCAM or easy theft....!"}
{"text":"I think I'm already being polite by giving this place 2 stars   Yesterday for lunch I stopped in as I didn't want Pizza and Timmy's doesn't really offer a lunch menu despite the commercials and menus that would suggest otherwise   I enter the restaurant the cashier made eye contact and decided to look after the couple wrapping up their meal...ok sure ignore me why not  Then after taking 5 minutes to ensure he got a tip (yes he practically wrote it on the receipt) he asked what I would like to order. I order a what I thought what was a simple order - fried rice with chicken  He says 5 mins- I say ok and proceed to pay. As I'm waiting the cashier seats a young lady and is making small talk while my meal sits on the counter.   After waiting approx 10 minutes to get my food I leave the restaurant, get back to work and find that these fools put spicy flakes all over my order...leaving me quite unimpressed   As far as the food went, it was okay spicy flakes weren't spicy (so much for making a difference) and other than some undercooked rice that occasionally found it's way on my pallet I stomached the meal for what it was  Was it worth $9.25? No  Was the portion worth the cost? Nope! Was I reminded why I can't stand Mr.Thai?  Without a doubt  Don't even get me started on their coupons..."}
{"text":"I ordered a peanut satay chicken noodle dish, but I was served a plate of boiled rice noodles topped with paper mâché-looking paste and a sprinkle of crushed peanuts.  My lunch tasted as it looked.  My coworkers' dishes were not as terrible, but we agreed that we would not return."}
{"text":"Decent fast food. The are a little heavy on the sauce, but the veggies are always crispy, and they are always speedy with getting the food out. I come here often, and am rarely disappointed."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Thai food I have ever eaten.  We ordered the Dinner for 2 combo A.  It comes with spring rolls, mango salad, 1 wok dish  (we chose Kung Pao Chicken), pad thai, and mango sticky rice dessert.  The food was extremely bland.  The kung pao chicken was supposed to be spicy but had no spice at all.  I also ordered the thai coconut soup.  This was the worst of all.  It literally tasted like coconut milk mixed with water.  I am wondering if they forgot to add the broth to the soup?  Waste of $5 since we didn't eat more than a few spoonfuls.  I only gave 2 stars since the service was good.  Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Blah. I had the same exact meal as TonyF mentioned in his review, the spicy thai chicken lunch special, and was thoroughly bored by it. You call that spicy? I call it bland as hell. It was one of the most disappointing lunches I can remember! I request a do-over!  Service was fine, nice staff, and they got me the food very quickly. But supremely boring food with not a lot of flavour. I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hmm, I think the restaurant is underrated... the food is actually pretty good in comparison to other thai restaurants I've tried (well, i mean, you have to take the price into consideration). My friend and I walked in for lunch couple weeks ago and I was actually surprised at how well the food turned out. Because honestly, I really wasn't expecting much judging by its decor. But the food was actually really good lol I got the ginger chicken lunch special and I really liked it. The chicken slices were tender and the sauces were just right. I loved the mango salad on the side, it was just really refreshing. My friend got the green curry and it was pretty good as well. The spring roll could use more flavor though, it was just really bland. At any rate, the place is on my way home from work, so I'll probably pop in there once every week or every other week when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch, and we weren't disappointed. Spring rolls are obviously fried from frozen, and could have used a little bit more of a cook. The filling was a bit cold.   The Pad Thai and Mango Chicken were out within minutes of ordering, and both were generous portions. I added extra vegetables to the Pad Thai, and was pleased to see quite a bit of jade green broccoli and baby bokchoy. The taste of the food was about what I'd expect from a fast food Thai place.   What really impressed us was our server. He was polite, funny, and as we were a bit tight on time, he got our food out really fast. To me, good service deserves as much of a review as food.   No it's not the best Thai food I've ever had, but it was fast, hot, generous and tasty. After reading some of the other reviews here, I think people are being a bit too critical, but that's the beauty of Yelp!"}
{"text":"Food is crap- all rice, no meat or veggies, very bland taste. Brutal. There are much better Thai restaurants in the area with better food and prices. Guy at the front desk was also a nuisance. poor customer service. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"No good. Very bland thai food, not authentic, no flavour, lots of oil. Skip this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ended up there late one week night (he had a gig in the area). Basically the guy at the counter wasn't very friendly (maybe because it was late?)... All I wanted was a fresh roll. I LOVE those darn delicious things and I make pretty good ones myself. So my review here is purely based on my short experience and my one fresh roll.  1 MANGO fresh roll was $5.00 EACH (veg... shrimp/chicken was extra!!!)  I was shocked at the price and I mentioned it to my bf,  the counter guy interrupted me and said \"well we make them fresh\". I should hope so as they are FRESH rolls.  It was mostly romaine lettuce and a piece of mango with a few limp rice noodles in rice paper. Horrible and a horrifying price especially when you can get awesome rolls from Ginger (if you are downtown) for $2.00 a roll!  I guess because of the area they can get away with being way overpriced but I won't be going there any time soon."}
{"text":"It's just fast food quality. Not really worth the 9 bucks. Mango salad is so horrible tasting. I ended up throwing it away. I don't think I will come back again. Btw since I understand Cantonese, the restaurant has some really rude service - they are talking shit about their customers right in front of everyone."}
{"text":"The food at this place is garrrbage.  Ordered tom yum noodles and the beef kebob. Overpriced, chewy, and very poor quality. Avoid.   Go to a thai restaurant with real thai/ viet chefs. Avoid this Chinese-run craphole. What qualifies the owner of this place to even cook thai food? Garbage food."}
{"text":"I have been craving Thai lately so had lunch today at Mr. Thai.  I'd been there a couple years ago and hadn't had a good experience but I thought I'd give it another chance.  I ordered one of the specials ... Thai Spicy Chicken with Rice with just carrots and corn.  I ate it in rather than getting take-out and it was an extra $1.  It was really bland ... not even close to being spicy.  It was just okay and I didn't feel all that great afterwards.   Ken was the server and he was buzzing around the restaurant.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here today at about 12:30.  I ordered takeout but had 15 minutes to waste before I had to get to work.  I decided to sit at a table to eat my meal and was told I had to leave and that was not allowed.  The restaurant was empty - all tables available.  But I was not allowed to sit and eat for 10 minutes because I had ordered takeout and that's cheaper than sitting in.  The guy at the counter told me someone would have to serve me if I sat down -- I don't see how that would be necessary when I had already received my meal and had paid. I will not be returning.  This restaurant fails to see that sometimes we can make exceptions to rules - especially for paying customers.    Besides that - the food was also lackluster."}
{"text":"Given how much awesome thai food there is in the city, there isn't really a good reason to go here. Unless you are a unique blend of starving to death and also don't want to get on the train to travel 2 stops to a better place.  Curries and pad thai are mushy and bland, not worth the price (which is moderate, unlike the food).  Their lemongrass soups used to be quite good (and cheap!), but over time they put less meat in them, replaced the nice shitake mushrooms with shitty white button mushrooms, stopped putting in vegetables, etc. So now you're basically paying for yellow salty broth with a few hard lemongrass stems floating in it. Yeck."}
{"text":"I have no idea why am I even writing a review . I guess may be for those who have not tried food from this place and after reading my review they would not like to go here. So I ordered chicken pad thai and chicken fried rice. Chicken pad thai was okay and it was hard to find chicken pieces in it. And chicken fried rice was just worst. I guess the chef was a health freak and that is why prepared the fried rice dry with no oil in it. But I wonder why to make it super spicy? Fried rice tasted so blunt and bad that I had to throw it in the trash because it was too dry and difficult to swallow."}
{"text":"The corner of Yonge and St. Clair is a hard place to make a living. For every longstanding Seniors or Scallywags, there are innumerable Indian, Asian fusion and middle eastern spots that come and go. High-profile outfits like Terroni get chased away, and some new businesses are strangled in their cribs, shuttered before they see the light of day.   Mr. Thai entered this dog-eat-dog corner about a year ago, taking over from the upscale Circle Thai, which closed for \"Renovation\" two cold, cruel winters ago. Remnants of the old place remain. The signature chairs are still here, in a space half the size of the original. The seats were painted shiny gold-green to reflect the new decor. The paint has largely peeled away. The chairs are comfy, and the menu is cheaper and cheerier. Service is less cheery. Water glasses are filled occasionally, and you're generally left alone-which is great until you realize you've waited 20 minutes for the bill to appear.   Food is what you'd expect from a run-of-the-mill Thai joint. But for a wicked bout of food poisoning, I'd say it's slightly above average. 48 hours of suffering drags Mr. Thai below the culinary Mendoza line, and makes a return visit unlikely.   That said, if you're the sort who leaps without looking, the food tastes fine. Tom Yum is properly hot and sour, although it's a bit sweet for my liking. A spring roll arrives hot from the fryer; crispy outside and stuffed with generic shredded carrot 'n' junk inside. Mango salad sees fresh greens and soft ripe fruit tossed in pleasantly sweet dressing. Green curry chicken is mildly spicy and weirdly stingy/generous. Plenty of breast meat; a few cubes of deep-fried tofu, and two (count 'em) pieces of eggplant. My bowl runneth over, but I want more veg. If I were color-blind, I couldn't tell it from the yellow curry. A pyramid of slightly mushy steamed rice rides alongside. Noodles in Pad Thai have decent chew and a good amount of chicken, but vegetables are largely AWOL except for bean sprouts. The dish runs blood red with ketchup, so I'll pass in favor of the street-style versions at Khao San Road and Salad King.   I should be clear that I only suspect Mr. Thai to be the author of my gastric distress. It could have been something else I ate; but then, if this were a game of culinary Clue, I'd still guess Mr. Thai, in the kitchen, with a wok."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, not many thai options around the area so I thought it would be worth trying a very simple dish. I ordered take-out, it was ready in 3 mins...I don't know if that's quality or just that they had it already cooked from a while ago. Got home, opened the container and it was packed full..and no, that's not a good thing. The food has zero taste, the veggies were soggy and the chicken was really gross. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"I live near this place so when I don't want to trek far, I will stop by.  The food is pretty blah and not even close to being authentic.  I refuse to try the Pad Thai because I know already it will be disgusting.  The only thing I ever get from there are spring rolls and the chicken fried noodle dish, only because I have an obsession with fried noodles.  The sauce is not that flavourful and sometimes I wonder why the hell I keep buying it.  My bf actually likes the cashew nut chicken at this place but I think its pretty crap.  Its very sweet.  Overall the lunch prices are good, but the food is very very mediocre for Thai food."}
