{"text":"We walked down here while waiting for a concert at the Comerica Theatre. The service was kinda slow, but we ordered beers and cheese sticks and they were great! If you're in from out of town and want to try a local brew go for the 4 Piece Kilt Lifter (the Wapiti wasn't very good). The cheese sticks take fried cheese to a whole new level! I'd recommend dipping them in ranch -- AMAZING! Overall, I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"We had a good experience here. The best thing was their service. They were very apologetic about a mere 20 minute wait, but it wasn't even that long and then they bought our first round of drinks to thank us for waiting. Very classy and considerate, which is getting more and more rare. The Cobb salad and meat and cheese platter were generous and tasty. My only negative would be that their menu is short without any creative offerings or flavors. Overall, we were happy we went!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday morning. They had brunch menu going but my wife had her heart set on the quinoa salad we'd seen online.  They accommodated the request. Server was friendly and nice and the place was charming and clean.  Overall nice sports bar with good food and drink selection."}
{"text":"Goon alert!  Food was once again, not terrible, but not what I ordered. (What's with this? Nothing on the menu is complicated, why can't you deliver what was ordered?)  However, when I tried to get the attention of my waiter I was accosted by a goon.  The guy tells me he is the manager, but he acted like a goon. Came up to the table, did not identify himself as being part of the establishment and growled \"Waddya want?\"    He got angry and slammed away when I asked him who he was.  The waiter is a really nice guy and hampered by a kitchen that seems to never quite get it right. But where it is usually at least passable, the manager pushed them over to total failure."}
{"text":"Excellent remodel makes a classic location for food and drinks even better. There are plenty of TV's for watching sports and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Always wanted to eat here but not downtown too often during the week. They are not open on the weekend. I had a chance last night before the Bryan Adams concert at Comerica. I had the fish and chips. They were excellent. The place was extremely busy but it had no impact on service. Our server, Wesley, was pleasant, friendly and helpful. I really like Tom's Tavern and if you are downtown during the week, you should definitely stop in for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"The reason my wife and I came to Tom's Tavern was to celebrate her retirement after twenty years of working in the Maricopa court system. I was hoping this would be something we would remember with fond memories, but what we experienced was not that. We arrived shortly after opening on January 6, 2015. I ordered a brisket sandwich and my wife pulled pork sandwich. We received our food in about twenty five minutes. After taking the first bite of my brisket sandwich I realized it was extremely tough. Ugh! I took a closer look and noticed that the meat was DRY and did not look good. I then cut the meat with a knife (hard to do) and tried just the meat. It was tough and had little taste. Certainly not what brisket should taste like and definitely the worst I had ever had... period. I thought okay this could just be a bad menu choice, but then I looked at my wife and after a bite of her pulled pork sandwich she removed the bun and started \"picking\" around with a fork. I asked her what was going on and she said no worries, it's okay. She is a very kind lady and would never complain, so I inquired further and she said the sandwich was almost all fat and quietly said nothing else. My wife is NOT a picky eater so this was to take note of. After some time I realized she just pushed the plate to the edge of the table and a server picked it up. What are the chances both our lunches were a fluke. Hence my review and know that I do this just to forewarn others and to say shame on you (management) for allowing \"food\" like this to be served. Needless to say we were sorely disappointed after dropping $35. here."}
{"text":"We went because I had read they have been awarded best fish and chips several years in a row and we are always on the quest for good ones.  We have not navigated downtown Phoenix before, so figuring out parking was a little tricky for us.  However it was nice to discover metered street parking is free on the weekends.  We stopped for an early supper before heading back to Flag.  We weren't super hungry so we ordered the pretzel appetizer and split the fish and chips.  The server didn't seem annoyed by the split and said he would bring an extra plate.  So that was nice.  The pretzels were piping hot and fresh.   We got a cheese sauce and yellow mustard for dipping.  They were bread stick shaped and you get three.  The entree came with 3 nice sized pieces of fish, a big pile of fries, and cole slaw.  It was perfect for sharing or good for one hungry person.  Not a bad deal for $14.  The fish had the perfect light and crispy beer batter we prefer.  The fish was your basic flaky cod.  Seemed fresh.  The chips were your basic French fries.  Tasty but not remarkable.  The cole slaw was fine but not our favorite.  Had a weird sweetness and was not crisp.  Maybe made the day before!  Service was friendly.  Atmosphere was your basic bar and grill with a vague pub feel about it.  We were there at a weird time so not many people there.  PHX doesn't seem to have  a booming after hours in their downtown.   It is close to the sports arena and Orpheum theater so I can see it being a popular destination when something is going on there.  I also suspect they get a decent lunch and happy hour crowd during the week"}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon this place walking downtown and figured since it's surrounded by businesses that it would be a quick lunch.  Boy were we wrong.  The staff seated us quickly and took our order but then we waited...and waited...  Finally the food came out and it was mediocre at best.  The Cajun Chicken sandwich was a chicken breast with something that may have resembled paprika on it.  It tasted like cardboard and the roll it was on was hard.  It was served dry with tomato and lettuce if you wanted it.  The curly fries were surprisingly good considering the sandwich.  It took quite some time to pay our bill and the serve staff kept walking around talking about how they were short staffed and their last table didn't leave enough of a tip.  I understand that's frustrating but in front of other patrons seems a little...offf."}
{"text":"I decided to eat here for the first time since the line was out the door at the nearby Chipotle.   I tried their hamburger and chipotle Mac n cheese.   The burger is one of the best I've had in a long time.  The Mac n cheese was very cheesy, just the way I like it.    Added bonus if you sit on the patio, you get to watch the Arpaio protesters across the street."}
{"text":"Cute environment. Ordered a buffalo chicken wrap w no tomato. The girl that took my order (I think she was just helping out the bartender who seemed busy) didn't write it down, and then asked me to repeat it when she was standing at the computer. Came out with tomatoes on it, so I asked the bartender to remake it. I believe it was the owner who dropped off the correct wrap, and he was very apologetic. I've been in the industry a long time and I'm happy as to how quickly this was fixed. The wrap was delicious, booths were spacious and comfy, and it's in a great spot. Will be back next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"I had a gift certificate for a free meal for two here and finally got around to using it right before it expired, and I'm sure glad I did! I didn't have very high expectations to be honest. And when we walked in we were the only ones there except for an elderly business man on his laptop...not a good sign I thought (even for a downtown restaurant in a downtown that clears out after business hours during the week).   Anyway, everything we had to eat was delicious. We got the chicken tenders for an appetizer and it was very good quality meat, and not too greasy. The girlfriend got the chili, which was really good in no small part due to the fact that the meat used is brisket. Genius. I had the steak and rib combo. Steak was cooked to order and tasty. But the ribs are where it's at. Tender baby back ribs with thick, sweet bbq sauce. The meal also came with 2 rolls, mashed potatoes, and steamed veggies. You're not going home hungry that's for sure.  And the service was excellent. Granted, we were the only ones there. But still, our waiter went above and beyond and was so nice. I was worried he would mail it in when I showed our gift certificate but not at all."}
{"text":"i recently moved into cityscape, a high rise apt. bldg. just a block or two away from this establishment and i've started trying out the local eateries as i don't like to cook much. i ordered a tavern burger and cottage cheese. when asked how i wanted the burger i said well done, meaning no pink, but specifically stated i didn't want the burger to be burned and/or dry. the bartender assured me that would not happen. well, guess what? the burger was way overdone and left a bad aftertaste that lingered for quite a while. i should have requested the burger be tossed and another mad however i just wasn't in the mood for a hassle. plus the bartender never did ask how my food was. it's a shame as i left very unsatisfied and with a burnt taste in my mouth, unlikely to every return or to recommend this place to others. i'm sure it was not intentional but the result was still the same."}
{"text":"Bacon heaven! Best BLT in years. Lots of perfectly cooked,  flavorful bacon. Just enough other stuff to act as bacon deliver device! Mmmmmmmm. Great, fast service. Bacon was falling out of this lovely BLT because there was so much. Not that skinny, paper thin stuff that made you quit ordering BLTs,  the good stuff. For once,  the L was insignificant except for the balance it brought. The bun was fresh and not too thick. Sadly,  I  could not finish it all. Probably due to the equally yummy side of mashed red potatoes with cream cheese and green onions I ordered to go with my \"lighter\" meal. I had the beef dip the other day here. It was the hottest sandwich ever delivered to me. So delicious. Made me realize you just don't get hot food hot that often. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have only been here once, it was about two weeks ago, I went on for a date night. My boyfriend told me about the place he swore it was good, so I was open minded about trying it. I had fish and chips, they were super good! The waiter was awesome! And they served good \"Sex On The Beaches\" I had about three. The atmosphere was great, since it was downtown and it was the weekend (Friday). We sat outside, all in all I give this place a thumbs up and I am for sure going back there in the near future."}
{"text":"This is the third time I visited Tom's and each time keeps getting better. Today was helped by the beautiful weather as we sat in the outside patio for the first time. Great location for downtown people watching and although it's located on a busy intersection the noise level on the patio was very subdued. I had the Quinoa salad and it was huge! Fresh ingredients and very flavorful! The waitress was very attentive, she stopped by numerous times to check on us. I saw many people having business lunches and I can see why, this is a great afternoon lunch restaurant."}
{"text":"First time in since it's changed owners. I had the BBQ Salmon salad and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"We went before a suns game and were surprised that there weren't more people there for a Friday night. The meatloaf and salmon were excellent and the drinks were at happy hour prices. We had an issue with pricing on a glass of wine and the owner actually came out to discuss it with us and took care of it. Jim is a great guy and if you want a decent meal instead of bar food before the game make sure you stop by and try Toms Tavern out. Parking is around the corner and the stadium is a stones throw away."}
{"text":"$5 for a flaming D P. Great deal and delicious. Patio seatings the way to go when enjoying happy hour. Also a great place to watch games. Great investment Mikey Bidwell"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while sight seeing on a long lay over in Phoenix. The food was moderately priced and service was quick. The waiter was pleasant. For being downtown the place was very quiet. In fact, the whole of downtown was quiet."}
{"text":"We arrived as a party of 8 to an empty tavern, no other customers there. We were seated, and the waitress came back in fair time for our drink orders. It took a while for the drinks to come, but when they did, it was only a couple of the ones we ordered. I asked the waitress where my drink was, and she rolled her eyes and said something to the effect of \"my bartender is slow.\" I don't know what's up with that, as the waitress was very kind for the rest of the meal. We ordered then and then proceeded to wait for about 40-50 minutes before any food came. We were now one of three tables in the restaurant, and comprised 8 of the 14 customers in it. 40-50 minutes seems a bit slow when you're the only people ordering food (at the time you ordered it) When I got my Cuban sandwich, it looked pretty good. When I started eating it, I realized that the pork was actually quite dry and devoid of full flavor."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience at Tom's Tavern on Sunday. I live nearby and decided to visit for the first time with my girlfriend. We had the brunch buffet that had some good breakfast foods along with some munchies to enjoy during the games. Although we weren't drinking, the bar has happy hour prices which I'm sure many others enjoyed.   During the game, a pair of Arizona Cardinal cheerleaders came in and started fraternizing with fans which was an awesome addition to the experience. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Eh...ok here is the deal. They were maybe smart to stick with dishes that are impossible to toally screw up. The two dishes reccomended by our server (Eliseo, who was a dream by the way) were fish and chips, and the burger. Neither sucked...but neither made me go wow. The cole-slaw was not very tasty to me or my dining companion. It sortof tased like the mouthful of Aqua-net I would get as a child when walking into the cloud of it while my mom got ready in the morning. The 80s were strong with chemicals...  Here is what I do like...in a proper spot downtown, this is basically a little diner that serves booze. Yeah I had a beer with my burger and it was awesome! When pressed for time before a show at the Orpheum I was still able to have drinks and a meal without doing bar food. Yes the menue is limited but it is food.    The place has a lot more potential than kinetic going for it but Eliseo was such a dream (and I had beer) that I can comfortably give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good, not great food, friendly staff, overpriced. Had the burger with brisket, and Mac and cheese, and a beer. Everything was competent, just not worth the $22. tab."}
{"text":"I took the time to read all of the reviews of this place prior to mozy-ing over from Cityscape...and am grateful that in spite of the OLD reviews from 2009, that I chose to come here.  first of all, there are very few resto's in PHX that I would think actually do wonderful bevvies with Hendrick's Gin....I thought that these bevvies were a thing of only big cities....Tom's proved me wrong.  They had an tasty and refreshing Cucumber Cooler which was essentially a very refreshing cocktail infused with a touch of basil, and when I asked for an impromptu Cucumber Gimlet, Mixology Master Dave was very quick to oblige with an amazing beverage....Honeslty, if there was a place like this in San Francisco, I would be here in a heartbeat.  If you should ever find yourself in downtown Phoenix, make your way to Tom's....The food looked great, but the bevvies were amazing...OH....BY THE WAY...DISREGARD ANY OF THE REVIEWS FROM 2009....THERE ARE NEW OWNERS NOW WHO HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAKE THIS PLACE SO MUCH BETER....STOP IN AND CHECK IT OUT....really...."}
{"text":"Good place for groups. Very laid back. Unfortunately, they have very few vegetarian options. The spinach dip appetizer was good, but I wasn't able to get a full meal here. I would love to eat here more, so if more vegetarian options are added, I will!"}
{"text":"Came here after the American Lung Association Fight for Air Climb, much love for being there for a great organization.  Had a couple brews for that post climb rehydration.  That Toms is supporting such a worthwhile charity event makes them a winner in my book.  Thank you Toms!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"\"Big Shout Out to Tom's Tavern\", your Grilled Romaine Avocado Chicken salad was delicious ... omg the bursting flavors in your mouth ! The homemade chicken fingers ... amazing flavor and very impressed the batter was NOT dense or weighed down and greasy .  Our experience from beginning to end was fantastic! Ok my Az peeps  it your turn to experience Tom's Tavern ! If you go let me know what you think and as always enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bartender poured a drink that only filled half the martini glass. When we brought it to his attention he said, \"I'll catch ya next time.\" I think not!"}
{"text":"We found this place by chance when looking for a quick dinner in Phoenix, and I have to say I was not disappointed! The 1920s-style decor is lovely, and the food was delicious. One thing that may put off some visitors is that flatscreen TVs above the bar can and along some walls can distract from the theme. As sports fans coming back from spring training, however, we did not mind.  The dinner options were a bit limited, but we were all able to find something to suit our tastes. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, and the man in charge of refilling drinks was hilarious, on top of it, and really made our visit worth it. Someone should give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"Cold fries, mediocre burger with with lettuce, tomatoes and onion on the side. Wilted to the point where I didn't want to touch it. Service was horrible. Little to say...."}
{"text":"This place is good, and it has a nice vibe to it. Very laid back. I just wish it was open longer... but that's not really a big issue especially now.   The food was good, each time I ordered the Fish and Chips and my signature \"Sex on the beach\" my drink was super good! I had about four of them and could have kept on going. I was on a date with my BF he recommended we go because he went with this co workers.   Service was prompt and my waiter was super nice. We were sitting on the patio and the only ones out there, but she still made sure to come out often to check on us. :)"}
{"text":"Not a \"destination eating place.\" Susan had a burger and I had a BLT. We both thought the food was good except my bacon was a little salty. I really like the cole slaw with the lime but Susan hated it... to each his own. Anyway, kind of a nice downtown eatery but I wouldn't drive far to have lunch there. Nice wines for $5/glass from 11-2."}
{"text":"nice place to grab some lunch while downtown or at Jury Duty. Their lunch specials are well worth the price and I had to take half home with me. Service was fast and courteous, I was well attended while I was there and my glass was never empty.  I'll be stopping by again when I'm back in the area!"}
{"text":"We decided to veer from our usual favorite place, The Strand, and try something new. Tom's looked appealing so we stopped in. We were both very hungry and the menu had some awesome looking offerings.   First we ordered the Spinach artichoke dip, as this is one of our favorite appetizers and we like to try it wherever we go. What we didn't realize (which is admittedly our fault) is that it's got jalapeno cheese. The 2 horrible things about this dish were : #1 it's $9.50 and you get the tiniest little cup of dip...seriously...so teeny tiny!!!! Give me a break! And just a handful of stale chips. #2 Who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip? At least SAY SO in the title...when you read \"Spinach Artichoke Dip\" you just assume that's what it will be. Who reads the description, anyway (still, I will take ownership of that part). It was so gross...we sent it back.   Then the dinner salad. A small plate of iceberg lettuce and a few croutons. Really?   Then the worst...the cheeseburger. I asked if their medium was still a bit pink inside and was assured that it was. I realize some places interpret medium rare and medium differently which is way I always clarify. Well, this wasn't even close. It was cooked WELL. It was over cooked to the point of a leather consistency. Also, it was so bland. No seasoning or anything. Our waiter asked if I wanted them to cook me another one but even if they got the meat temperature right it still would have been nasty with no taste, so I passed and just sent it back.   I did eat the fries because I was hungry and it was the only edible thing I got (and not even that good).   Lastly...our waitress. She sucked. Never checked on us, seemed to not really care, and it wasn't busy so it's not like she was in the weeds or anything. Needless to say we won't be visiting ever again. We're gonna stick with The Strand down the street."}
{"text":"I want Tom's to be better... but it isn't.  The place has a cool \"Cheers\" vibe, the service is excellent, but...  I ordered a grilled cheese.  The simplest thing on the menu, right?  WRONG!    Those of you who are grilled cheese experts, like I am** will understand when I say: there was no butter on the bread and there was only one paltry slice of american cheese.  Seriously.  At least give me some cheese for my grilled cheese sandwich.  It's even in the title!  I am sure that Tom's has more options for non-carnivores on their huge menu, but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to peruse the menu at length or concoct a special order.  The worst part?  My sub-par grilled cheese, fries, and iced tea came to $12!!!  Come on!  They put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast!  At least the service was good.  **side note: I really wish more restaurants would get on the options for vegetarians bandwagon.  No, I do not want iceberg lettuce on a plate with italian dressing, thank you."}
{"text":"Just happened to be walking by and wanted a place to relax.  'Ended up ordering the chili  nacho plate and my husband had a beef dish.  Good food.  Nice atmosphere.  Bartender David & staff were very nice - good service."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Tom's Tavern since the recent remodel, you NEED to go back!  They reopened the doors in October 2011 and the place looks great!  Oh, and the food on the new menu is good too!!  The new owners did a fantastic job of updating the decor with a clean, modern look and yet keeping the feel of a Phoenix classic!  Open seven days a week with breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and dinner!  Average lunch is about $10-12 a plate, which isn't cheap, but with the good food, cool inside atmosphere, and adorable patio I will gladly pay a few bucks extra to support a great local business!  Located right on the corner of First Avenue and Washington, just across from CityScape, the patio makes a perfect place for people watching on a nice Arizona day (which we are lucky enough to have so many of this time of year)!  Great food choices, sandwiches ranging from a Reuben to a Cuban (\"no more rhymes now, I mean it\"), delicious varieties of smoked meats, fish and chips and fish tacos, soups (including a daily 'blackboard special'), and salads.  Wings, nachos, sliders, and a hummus appetizer that I would eat as my lunch entree.  Overall, it is a great mix of food without being too overwhelming of a menu.  I love the soup and salad combo (your choice of salad) and can't wait for an excuse to go back for happy hour.  I almost cried when I noticed there is a $5 GLASS OF WINE LUNCH SPECIAL FROM 11-2 . . . I had to go back to work . . . what a tease!  Happy hour is 2:30 - 6:30 on weekdays with food and drink specials.  And a weekend brunch on Saturday and Sunday from 8:00am-2:00pm.  Pretty much, any time of day you could stop into Tom's and find something to tempt your taste buds!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Toms Tavern is excellent. Fantastic staff and the food is next level. The new menu is a step up from the old and i love it.  http://tomstavern.wpengine.com/menu/  Note that the menu on yelp is out of date"}
{"text":"Nice place, good food and the server was attentive. The place was busy but not overly crowded. We enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"My work has hosted a few forum-type shindigs here, and most recently at one such shindig, I had breakfast while listening to people discuss water issues.  I have to admit, the scrambled eggs, potatoes and sausage were much more appealing (and tastier) than listening to a bunch of government and corporate bigwigs talk about how to conserve water.    It's typical diner fare. But, I will say the scrambled eggs were excellent. I don't like fru-fru eggs that are a undercooked and watery.  I like me some hearty, scrambled in about a pound of butter eggs. And, that is what I got.  Tom's also has a great vibe -- again the whole diner experience.  Saddle-up to the bar, take in some of the history hanging on the walls, and perhaps see a few Arizona notables walk in (Phil Gordon must be a regular because I spotted him on my first visit.)  All in all, if you want a nice, no-frills, but definitely one-of-a-kind Phoenix tradition, head to Tom's for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Oh, yeah, and they validate your Patriots Parking Garage ticket, so FREE parking... YEAH!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty chill spot for drinks & bar food.  We went on a Sunday night after a big meeting that was held at the Phoenix Convention Center.  They were able to accommodate a group of about 20 of us without any issues (not a whole lot of people there).    Their quesadillas and curly fries are quite good and I could not help reaching for the nachos again and again, but definitely avoid their Caesar salad (I know, who orders salad at a bar anyway?!)"}
{"text":"Toms Tavern was place to stop in before making our way to an evening at the science center. I loved the decor that highlights the history of the establishment.  The staff was welcoming and attentive even though we had no reservations and were in a hurry. The combination of old favorites and fresh new ideas made for a well rounded menu. The meal left us satisfied and eager to visit again. I'm looking forward to tracking the upcoming concept dinners to see what they come up with next."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Tom's Tavern.  They sat our large group in a busy walk way and that is the reason for 3 not 4 stars...If there are larger groups don't put them in the path of all the employees.  I had the BLT and it was good ...  Not the best but for the price and the location good. I'd add more meat but that is just me :)  It is a busy atmosphere and a popular place during the day ... It is not your typical tavern so don't let the name fool you ... it is not dark, smelly and full of the \"regulars\".  It is good dinning at a fair price. I will return.  2-14-2013 Received email from their customer service team and I added a star for their oustanding customer care and follow-up!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a drink after work in downtown Phoenix.  They did a nice job with the renovation.  Nice space, nice bartender and decent happy hour specials."}
{"text":"This place is extremely delicious. The food was so amazing we recommend the chili super filling, burger oh so juicy and the fries are the perfect crispness .The salmon with ho cake was to die for don't forget that arugula salad."}
{"text":"We come here for all the Arizona Cardinals game every away game and are so happy with the food and service. Their new general manager has really turned the place around and the servers are all professional and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best beef brisket I have found in Phoenix!  The atmosphere was great, nice surroundings, a little history inside as well.  The staff was super friendly and attentive as well.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Get the fish and chips.  Repeat, get the fish and chips.  The fish tacos are good, but not as good as the fish and chips.  A barbeque sandwich is also good, the sauce is more mustard based than most and is a nice change.  The new owners ran food service at the sports arena so the food tends to be what you can get at the suites (or feels like it).  You don't come here for good health though.  There really isn't anything healthy (like the old Tom's) and lots of the downtown set i.e. lawyers and politicos tend to gather here to see and be seen."}
{"text":"After I moved to Phoenix I swore that I would NEVER set foot in Tom's Tavern even though it's right around the corner from work and would be ideal for post-work drinks. Then a few weeks ago as I was walking to the bank I happened to peek my head in and saw that the place has been completely redone.  So after some soul searching and in desperate need of a beer one night, I popped in. I like what they did with the place. The bar is nice with a marble top and some tables and chairs with more seating toward the back. They have some good stuff on tap. I had two glasses of the Sam Adams season and some Onion Rings which came with some tasty sauces. My bartender was a very nice girl from Alaska who I think is called Vicki (sorry if I got it wrong). All of the staff there were very friendly. The Cuban sandwich is also apparently phenomenal because one lady at the bar would not shut up about how great it was. The ONLY thing I would change is that the places is lit too damn brightly. They need to turn it down a notch because I think this place could become a cool post-work hangout and fun weekend place which we all know downtown desperately needs (if you build it, or in this case turn it down, they will come). They just need more intimate lighting because we all know the magic of lots of alcohol and low lighting (until the spell wears off the following morning but we cross that bridge when we get to it, don't we?) But seriously, I like the place, they have my support, I will be back and I encourage all Yelpers to pop in and check it out."}
{"text":"THE place for lunch downtown!  Just gimme a bowl o' 'red', some crackers and a glass of icy-cold milk, and nobody gets hurt!  Tom's has been that way since before you were born, and it still is!  Oh yeah, they do have other things on the menu.  But, for the regulars...."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets one star is because I can't give it zero. The service was horrible. Our food was given to the wrong table TWICE, half of our drinks never showed up, no one apologized even though we complained, and we were still given a full bill at the end of the night.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"It was okay here, food was nothing to write home about, but the beer was cold and the atmosphere nice. Service was good even with the Super Bowl in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Wifey and I were in town for the Final Four this weekend, and before the championship on Monday, we dropped in to have a couple of drinks, a burger, and some chicken strips. The bartender (sadly I didn't catch his name, but he had the start of what could one day be a pretty wicked beard) whipped us up one of his specialty cocktails, and unlike bars with a similar feel, he didn't do it with any measure of pretension. And all of that with some genuine banter about sports and life in Phoenix. We'll be stopping by next time we're around, for sure!"}
{"text":"Boo tom's. You signed up for wine walk, took al the promo that went with it, then decided to close because you ran out of wine and food? Really sets a bad example for Phx events. Disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"They were just closing as we arrived but said come on in for a quick drink. Nice place. The bartender was so friendly. Great little spot for a quick drink."}
{"text":"Weird review. We never actually got to eat. We were told a bunch of times the wait would be 5 minutes. We left after 45 and got something else. It was Super Bowl weekend and they were understaffed so I get it. But the whole situation was handled poorly."}
{"text":"A little too overpriced for the type and quality of foods being offered, but I can't dock them too much for that. Service is great and the outside seating is wonderful in newly revitalized downtown. Close to all the local jobs, courts, and firms, so the location is ideal.  Wait time is decent and the waiters/waitresses have always been pleasant."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork tacos at $4 (for 2) on the happy hour menu were good sized, delicious, and quite the deal. Paired with a Four Peaks ale made for a tasty and inexpensive night out."}
{"text":"This used to be a hidden gem that my coworkers, (which is a group of about ten people) and I enjoyed for our after work happy hours.   We went in last night and were very disappointed. We had heard that Tom's was under new ownership and it shows.   The biggest issue were the menu changes. They pretty much cut the menu in half and removed all of the \"bar food\".  No bar food = no happy hour for us. I made the best of it with chips and salsa and a charcuterie board but it was disappointing. What happened to the nachos and other great bar food? Now it's just high priced entrees. We don't want to come in there for a high priced dinner!  Apparently no one else does either. Besides our work group, there were three other people in the entire restaurant. If it wasn't for the \"boss\" who decided to pick up the tab because of the situation, we would have left!   To the new owners of Tom's...You are not going to be successful unless you make serious changes to the menu and start promoting some specials. You have to be losing money if you stay open in the evening. My group will not return until you get food fit for an enjoyable happy hour.   Good luck!"}
{"text":"This place is great start for a fun night downtown. By far the coldest draft line and a cool lay back bartender Travis."}
{"text":"never again. i've given't tom's two tries - because in fairness, every place has an \"off\" night. tonight was the last time. we were there at least 25 minutes. we ordered drinks. drinks never came. we left."}
{"text":"Peg and I have been wanting to go to this place for a while, and last night was the perfect time to give it a go. Chef Gallen, like seasoned chefs,  has been through the cycles in the food industry and what he does now is prepare wonderfully honest, straightforward no-frills food that is incredibly good. There is nothing trendy or complicated here. Shrimp cocktail (with a cocktail sauce as well as a lemon-tarragon vinaigrette), buttermilk fried oysters (with a bacon jam that I swear I would eat on cardboard), veal meatloaf with simply prepared incredibly tasty mashed potatoes,  honey roasted carrots and sweet & spicy ketchup, and slow-cooked pork belly with with white cheddar polenta, bacon roasted asparagus and cherry gastrique. Love on a plate.The atmosphere is relaxing and the service is stellar. It is so nice to see a veteran of an incredibly difficult industry in a place that he loves and does what he does best.  This is go-back!!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"I wish this place were better! The only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour. I went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average. Don't get me wrong, the hostesses were nice... when they were actually around.  I had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce. Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible. My veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful. My friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless.   For the price I would expect better food... much better food.   Honestly, they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps. Quit the food, up the drinks."}
{"text":"Hubby and I took a trek from the East Valley on the rail to downtown over the holidays. Randomly picked out Tom's Tavern for an early dinner.  I am a BLT lover so quickley ordered a BLT from their menu that stated it \"came on sourdough bread\"--another favorite.  When it came, I noticed it was on wheat bread. I checked the menu to be sure I had read correctly.  I alerted the waitress about the bread goof up and she said, \"Oh, we're all out of sourdough, but I  know you will like this\"  Really?   I would have ordered something else, as I don't care for wheat bread with a BLT.  And, the bread wasn't really browned or toasted much at all-kind of limp and fell apart.  The wine was good and reasonably priced, but the iced tea had that funny \"bag in the box taste\", not sure if it was brewed or not.  The bartender was very attentive and helpful. He noticed that hubby's Buffalo Chicken Salad was about to be delivered without Wing Sauce on the chicken, so he alerted the kitchen to run the chicken through the wing sauce.   Salad was good according to hubby.  Not sure what is going on in the kitchen, but they caould stand to move it up a notch or two. Seemed like most people there were regulars who came in after work for a drink and dinner."}
{"text":"We were going to a concert downtown and every restaurant near was an absurd wait time. We walked one block to Toms Tavern and was glad they are now opened on Saturday evening. No wait and very accommodating on our order. Food was excellent. Great bar too. Walk a block next time you will be pleased."}
{"text":"I went here last night to get a tasty meal and found out that they have a \"special events menu.\"  Last night the special event - Snoop Dogg and 311 - brought out a bunch of white 30-somethings with crappy tribal tattoos.  Their menu is incredibly brief and not what we anticipated even slightly when we decided to go.  So we left with no food."}
{"text":"Wow!! What a great spot. Went there for lunch while on jury duty. Had the best cheeseburger and curly fries. Very juicy burger and flavorful fries. The service was fast and friendly. The place looks spotless. Very clean and the seating is very spacious.  So glad to have found this place, Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"What happened here? This used to be a place that you could go into and get a fine meal and out within an hour. A month ago I was there for a business lunch and it took a total of 2 hours for 4 people. They kept loosing our order they told us. The manager comped most of the meal for us.  Today I stopped in and this time had to nearly hog tie the waiter to take our beverage order. Once he got there we ordered our food items for fear he would never return. About an hour later our food finally arrived. The food is great but the side salad was a disappointment.  BIDWELL FAMILY: Now that you own this historic restaurant, stop by and check out the poor service that you are offering."}
{"text":"We came here for a networking event last week. The crowd (or crowding, as it were) was akin to that of a happy hour or pregame crowd. We felt squished.   The tap selection is basic, although having the Sam Adams seasonal always makes me like a place. We got to smaple some small bites of some new apps theyre working on which were good. Braised beef pappadeaux. Thats all Im saying.  I may come here again, but only if its not super crowded."}
{"text":"So...while I get that it's Super Bowl weekend, and the city is insane...I would give 0 stars to this place if I could.  4 of us walked in during prime time Super Bowl weekend.  As we ask for a table, we are told they are no longer seating anyone, and we had to wait 25 minutes before it would start up again.  After waiting 45 minutes, I walked through the dining room to find 5 completely empty tables.  When discussing the seating situation with the hostess, I am told \"there are plenty of other places you can go to on Washington St.\"  Who tells a customer this?  Others complained and asked for the manager, but they were told \"he's too busy to come out and talk to you\".  Horrible way of handling the crowds.  We ended up leaving after around an hour of waiting, and ate somewhere else.  I would never go back."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I had a goodbye work luncheon for a colleague.  The food was delicious and the servers were attentive and nice.  The management was able to coordinate with us to provide a special print-out menu and a microphone for speeches.  I would highly reccommend this restaurant for workplace gatherings.     We will be back."}
{"text":"Gah...I'm not really sure what to think of this place. We got a couple of free tickets to the Octoberfest, so my friend and I stopped by Tom's Tavern. Octoberfest hasn't started yet and they weren't letting anyone in at the festival, so we decided to have a couple of drinks here first. I wanted to check something on my i-touch, so I asked one of the employees for the wireless password. He said nobody knows even the owner doesn't know.  Is he serious? Then why in the world is this business paying for it?    We finished our beers and left."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a concert - had the French Dip and a side of mac & cheese.  I'm one of those people who never clean my plate, and I have to confess that I cleaned my plate here.  The Chipotle Mac & Cheese is fantastic.  French Dip was tender and on a great bun.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I seem to be going to Tom's Restaurant & Tavern about every two weeks. where  I meet my friend for lunch.  I love this place and our main waiter, Frank, Jr.  not only is he so professional, courteous and funny, but  becomes your friend right away.  You would think you have known him forever.  Their food is delicious and they have a huge menu.  It's very nice because you can either choose to sit outside on the patio like a cafe' setting, or sit inside the restaurant.  They are reasonably priced and most of the people that eat there are on their lunch hour, so they do hurry to get your food out.  I highly suggest you try Tom's Restaurant and Tavern the next time you are down on Central Ave."}
{"text":"Not the worst, not the greatest.  I'm 50/50 based on our one visit.  We live across the street so wanted to check it out and compare to other places around.  We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  I had a side of their hand-breaded onion rings and my cohort had a side caesar salad.  None of the food blew our socks off by any means but I wouldn't say it was \"bad\" either.  The waitress was a tid bit forgetful and also explained the cole slaw wrong which was too bad as my lunch date hates tomatoes and there were some in the coleslaw which was on the pulled pork sandwich.  I'm sorry to say but the hand-breaded onion rings were a complete let down.  We've made them better in our skillet at home than here.  They were soft, the breading all fell off and they just totally missed the boat.  Maybe it was just a bad batch but I wouldn't order them again if they were the only thing on the menu.  Although not completely attentive, our server was very friendly.  The meal wasn't priced bad at all either.  I might stop in for drinks again sometime but probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"They are open for dinner!  This is a great spot right next to tons to do - it's tucked away so you get an intimate setting.  All of their food is great - the meatloaf (not he kind mom used to make) will blow you away.  Such an amazing flavor!  Chicken strips are spot on.  The bartenders make a great cocktail.    All in all, I like coming here for a dinner or lunch to see what phoenix used to be while eating some delicious modern food."}
{"text":"Just like the rest of downtown Phoenix, this place was dead. Our server was slow, taking 10 to 15 minutes to bring out our drinks. The food was okay, but nothing to write to my Yelp friends about. If you can find somewhere else in downtown PHX, I recommend you give it a try before ending up at this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  My friends and I are totally hooked!!  Where do I start?  The Staff - Derrick, Travis, and Scott were all so awesome.  I don't get downtown often, but I will stop in to Tom's  every single time from now on.  Everyone was friendly, and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Decent burger, good salads but really high prices for the quality...probably because of the location.  Nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"I gave it a shot because it looked interesting from the street and had a nice patio.  I went, that's it, I'm done.  I ordered the Blue Plate Special, which today was a chicken green chili plate.  The chicken was quite dry, it came with wild rice (wtf?) and had tomato slices on a bed of leafy greens. W? T? F?  That screams out \"filler\".  There was pico de gallo which wasn't too bad. No idea if it was handmade or store bought, but it was the bright spot in my experience.  To drink I had a belgian wheat beer that was pretty good, but I ordered that one because the waiter said they didn't have Widmer Bros. Hefeweizen.  Despite there being a Widmer Bros. Hefeweizen neon sign hanging behind the bar.  The waitress, who, by the way, appeared to be old enough to have worked at Toms when it opened (80 years) was not good at all. Ten minutes from when I ordered my beer she came out empty handed to see if I was ready to order. When I asked about aforementioned beer she rolled her eyes and departed, returning with said beer, adorned with an orange slice, that I specifically requested it not have.  When my food was delivered, in a MOSTLY timely manner, she never returned.  Ever.  Despite my beer being empty.  I don't think I'll be going back to Toms, nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"Surprised by an awful experience...was told by co-workers that this place had awesome food...unfortunately this is far from the truth. I ordered the half salad/soup combo , thinking how can you screw that up...well Toms managed to do just that after waiting over 45 minutes during lunch for our food to come it was the most pathetic meal I've ever seen . I can't believe I paid over $12 for an iceberg lettuce mix not what is expected at that price add four measly strips of chicken and super oily dressing and you have what may be the worst salad ever. Oh let's not forget the tiny cup of soup which was mainly broth and I feel like I was totally ripped off."}
{"text":"I pulled up to the bar and liked how the place is modern yet still remembers it's heritage. Tom's Tavern was a pool hall with illegal card games in the back when I first entered this business as a kid.  Now a modern bar and grill, I order a craft draft and decided to walk around to look at the artifacts on the wall. There are many pictures hanging. I have learned that at times, I can make sense of a reoccurring dream by jogging a memory simply by looking at an old picture of a place I knew.  The beer is tasty and I meet Rebbecca. A super sweet Cajun Gal. She walks with me a bit and we converse over what we know. I photograph images, pool sticks, and whats left of possibly 50 year old pool balls.  It was an excellent visit."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here with a group of friends. The atmosphere was lively and fun. The server was friendly and patient. The food was very flavorful. The menu was full of great choices, but not overwhelming. The prices were slightly high for lunch, though. The whole experience, however, was very nice."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was extremely disappointed when stopping in for lunch today.  My husband raved about Tom's lunch he had several months ago.  He said they had \"killer\" potato salad and a chili-mac-and-cheese you'd never find anywhere.  The 2 of us ordered; Prime Rib French Dip, Cuban Pork Sandwich and a BLT.  The French Dip was the worst of the 3.  Dry, very over cooked - crispy meat - nothing that we expected, a huge disappointment.  The Cuban Pork was mediocre at best.  The BLT - only okay at best.  I have to say the sides were a different story - the Cole Slaw is the best you may ever eat.  Fries - same, excellent.  The staff was very attentive, hostess was cheerful and welcomed us warmly.  I don't know what Tom's looked like prior to the remodel - I sure wish I would have made it to lunch before the remodel - we certainly will not go back.  $45.00 for 3 lunches and one soda - not worth it."}
{"text":"I went there with a coworker and two clients for lunch this week, as this was the client's pick.  I ordered the barbequed chicken thighs and fries for lunch.  The food was so salty that I could barely eat it.   I'm not one to send food back, and truly wanted to except I didn't want to be \"that person\" in front of a client.  I managed to eat about a third and took the rest in a to-go box.  I tried it again the next day -- couldn't eat it.   A good cook doesn't need to over-salt the food to the point that it's a health hazard.  Maybe that's the way you sell more drinks?  I'm not overweight and typically eat fairly well, but this sent my blood pressure sky rocketing.  Other than that, the service was good and the clients enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Read about Tom's, was intriqued by both the history and new ownership.  The staff is friendly, the decor is nice (if a bit too bright for a tavern).  However, the food and service are lacking.  Ordered a cheese burger medium rare with no bun and a fried egg; delivered a raw burger with a bun and no egg.  When the food was returned to be cooked - received a terse comment about ordering a medium rare burger - do we want it medium.  Actually, I would have rather enjoyed a medium rare burger without the added commentary.   The caesar salad warm warm and wilted. We will not be back; my wife and I enjoy the resurgence of the downtown area - but next time I want a burger it will be 5Guys right across the street."}
{"text":"I had the chance to check out some of their dinner offerings and was not disappointed.  What I got was a strong attention to quality and detail with my food.  We had a chance to meet the new owner and really enjoyed our time.  I also really appreciated their efforts to source as much of their food as possible from local sources.   Besides the food being excellent, the atmosphere is really neat.  The place is full of photos of those more famous then I ever will be, both from AZ and in general.  As a real history vibe to it.   If you have not tired Tom's or not for dinner recently I would recommend you try it.  I know they have been best know for lunch time, but worth also coming back for an evening meal."}
{"text":"This place was the first stop of the night for the bar crawl event and I wasn't extremely impressed. The bartenders were not personable and even though we showed our VIP badges they weren't offering the special pricing for drinks.  The fun feature for this night at least was the decorate you own cupcake. Probably the most fun I had there."}
{"text":"Got there at 7pm and  they wouldn't serve us. Told us they sent the cook home because they were too slow...terrible service"}
{"text":"3.5 if half stars were available. The food was okay and the service above average. I went to Tom's as a tourist and I think this might have more appeal to locals. It seems to be a Cheers place where everybody knows your name and pictures of local politicians are on the walls. A nice joint for beers and burgers."}
{"text":"We stopped in for what we had hoped would be a quick lunch on a Wednesday.  My coworker mentioned that it had recently changed ownership after the former owner passed.    The place is clean and we were greeted quickly, opting to eat out on the patio on a wonderful spring day.  We were handed menus and were greeeted a few min later by our waitress, who took our drink orders.   We finally put in our food orders all 3 of us ordered a sandwich of some sort on the menu,  I had the grilled cheese with bacon on rye (hold the tomato) and a side salad.  Now up to this point the wait seemed average for a downtown sitdown lunch.  Two glasses of water later, we began to wonder where our food was as did other tables around us.   [I could have been and out of Jimmy John's across the street for less time and $] We FINALLY got our food.  But they forgot my side salad. It eventually came out (a little unimpressive mostly iceburg salad, to their credit it did have homemade croutons on it).  The rye on my bread seemed as if it was on the dry stale side before grilling, over all it was ok, noting special.  One coworker picked at his turkey melt a bit unimpressed.    Hitting the 1 hr mark we finally got our check and waited.  She finally cameback out with the credit card and said she was confused and wanted to confirm if the card she had in hand was from our table.  HUH?!  Ok.....  Thank goodness one of my lunch companions was my supervisor otherwise I would have been awkward to walk in from an extended lunch hour and a half."}
{"text":"Service was great, unfortunately we called in for 20 people (xmas party) more than a week in advance,when we arrived (5:30pm) it was announced they were out of: Ribs, Meatloaf, Brisket, Half Chicken (how do you run out of chicken by 5:30?)   Keep in mind this is a BBQ joint - with no BBQ.  Enjoy for lunch if your by the capital but eat dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was seeing a show at the Dodge Theater, was short on time, and hungry! I wasn't sure what restaurants were around the Dodge, so my friend and I walked down Washington, confident that we'd stumble upon something at some point. And we did, it was Tom's Restaurant and Tavern. They seemed to have a pretty decent beer selection, and open tables, which we were happy to find so close to the show.   We sat down and took a look at the menu. It was a special event menu, which I really hate. I don't see the point of restricting the menu so much just because of a show down the street. There were about 4 vegetarian options, few of which seemed appetizing. My friend opted for the potato skins sans chili and I opted for the jalapeno hummus. The waiter returned some time later to let me know that they were out of the hummus, and gave me a different menu that had the aldo pasta listed. penne pasta, marinara sauce, parmesan cheese and garlic bread- i was sold. The food arrived, and wasn't bad. The pasta was pretty small, but was enough to fill me up, and my friend seemed ok with her potato skins.   Overall, the food was ok, but it was really the service that caused me to rate them with only two stars. I'm not sure if our server is a server by trade- it seemed like it might have been his first night. He was super slow and had a really hard time remembering what we had ordered. He also seemed to have to have a hard time with keeping our orders straight and not confusing them with the orders of the tables next to us. I was also really disappointed by the menu. I know that this is more of an old-fashioned diner, but the options were so limited that it was actual work finding something to eat (I'm sorry, but when I was hoping for some cheese or some spicy flavor, a plate of steamed veggies just doesn't sound appetizing).   I'd be willing to give this place another shot, but definitely not on an \"event\" night, because it was really pretty lame."}
{"text":"First time at Toms..... Loved it! Ask to sit in Briannas section.  She is the very best! Tell her the crazy lady from denver that loves her red glassed sent you!"}
{"text":"One of the best lunch spots in downtown Phoenix!! The atmosphere is very upscale and great for bringing clients or potential clients. The food is fantastic every time. Jim Gallen, the new owner, has done a great job making this place much better than it used to be. My favorite thing on the menu is the Fish and Chips or the Tom's Cobb Salad. Highly recommended lunch and happy hour."}
{"text":"Tom's Tavern is in downtown Phoenix on the NEC of Washington St and First Avenue. It's a great sit-down place to pop in for lunch, and you can usually get in and out in a hour. The fries are really good, as are the fish 'n' chips, and the brisket sandwich. A couple of the salads are also good. Only the mac 'n' cheese is something I wouldn't order again.   The inside has booths, tables, and a full bar. There are TVs for catching the news or the game. Outside seating is also available."}
{"text":"Great service and great atmosphere. Friendly owner and great to out of towners had a great time"}
