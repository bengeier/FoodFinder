{"text":"We came here with a groupon deal. We tried the Hottie and the Arjun's toasty. Both were fine but small and overpriced.

Apparently this place is also a vapour lounge since we saw people asking for water for their pipes, which was awkward for us. It seems confusing as to who their target audience is. We only found out it was a vapour lounge when we got there which doesn't seem family friendly."}
{"text":"Really overpriced, burnt food. I ordered the classic grilled cheese, bacon bowl side and apple fritter for a total of $15 before tax. Both the bacon and the apple fritter dessert came out very burnt. I know grilled cheese is supposed to be quite greasy, but this was ridiculous-could barely taste the other flavours with all the oil soaked in the bread...almost made me gag a few times trying to eat it. Would not come back again."}
{"text":"When I was in high school, part of the curriculum was a class where the final project was starting a small business. Most students did something simple like opening a cafe or restaurant at school. They'd serve the most basic, simple things, like instant coffee or sugar cookies. They knew they didn't really have to impress anyone, since they'd get a good grade pretty much just for doing the work.

This restaurant reminds me of the ones that popped up in high school. For $5, I got the exact grilled cheese sandwich I've been making at home since I was 8. I was expecting there to be something special about it, but it seems to be made with the bread and cheese I buy at Loblaws and are in my fridge right now. I really expect a restaurant that specializes in a certain thing to serve me a version of that thing that a child can't make in five minutes."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon today, $12 for $20, and came here for lunch with my co-worker. I called ahead for pick up and they had no problem accommodating my request. I also informed them that I had the Groupon and they said it would be ready in about 5-10 minutes. I ordered the Meaty Goat and added Avocado and Bacon and my worker got the Antipasti. They were ready when we got there and also came with chips and ketchup. I have to say I enjoyed the sandwich that I got but I wouldn't pay $10 for it. With the Groupon, the cost came to $6 since I split it with my friend. I also wouldn't have heard about the place if it wasn't for the Groupon so I am glad that I got to try this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in the other day to grab a bite and instead, I left as quickly as I went in. I just didn't feel the vibe of this place. The staff were friendly and attentive but I left anyway. I want to go back and give it a shot when I have more time.  Definitely very unique place."}
{"text":"Gourmet grilled cheese? Don't mind if I do!

This is a small restaurant near Church and Wellesley that does both take-out and dine-in. Its a small space with just a few tables, but it's cozy and I like the somewhat wacky decor -- I haven't seen a paint splatter pattern on a floor in a while.

I ordered the club melt, which is basically a grilled cheese version of a turkey club sandwich. It's served with some kettle chips, and at first I though the portion was a bit small, but it was very filling. They used some great cheddar, quality turkey and it was grilled just right. 

This is a good choice if you're really in the mood for some variant of a grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese is simply one of life's comfort foods and on a chilly day, what is better than a short trek to cheesy goodness? Arriving just at noon, we were pleasantly surprised by the quaint interiors with ample seating. Being rather new, we were the first lunch patrons. We quickly ordered the traditional grilled cheese on marble rye with pepperoni ($4.50) and added a cup of roasted red pepper and tomato soup ($3). My friend ordered the traditional as well but with turkey, avocado, arugula, tomatoes and mushrooms ($6) along with the same soup ($3).  

The Good: The grilled cheeses were prefect. Not greasy and perfectly melted. The size is right on for the price and orders are filled quickly. The staff was attentive and facilities were clean. We ordered, received our meals and were back to the office in 45 minutes.

The Meh: The soup was just okay. It was a bit too much on the acidic side but on the positive side, it was piping hot. 

Overall: It's a great spot to grab comfort food at any time without hurting the wallet. We will definitely be back."}

# of Visits before review: 1
Date of last visit before review: Jan 3, 2014

I ordered a Meaty Goat Cheese sandwich which was comprised of goat cheese, mozzarella, spinach and ham on marble or rye bread (couldn't tell which one) with a cup of soup.  

The total was $8.50 including tax.  

What I liked - goat cheese and mozzarella cheese was real cheese and not processed.  Everything seemed fresh.  The roasted vegetable soup either had pumpkin or squash in it with some carrots and possibly red peppers and I love pumpkin and squash.  

What I didn't like: 
-The meal took about 10 minutes to come out even though I was the only one there, It's a grilled cheese sandwich and should only take 3-5 minutes.  
-It's not very filling for a total of $8.50 (even if it includes tax) and I know I ordered specialty cheese with goat cheese
-I asked about coffee and they said they were sold out...umm..how do you sell out of coffee at noon time?

Verdict - Did my taste buds melt? Not really.  It just tasted like a sandwich to me.  Would I visit again? Maybe, but not an everyday place for me as I don't like spending close to $10 on lunch without getting completely full.   This is a place for cheese lovers, but not for those who think cheese is just \"meh\"."}
{"text":"When I heard there was a new grilled cheese place in my work 'hood I had to check it out. I got the SO to drop me off at Church and Gloucester and I started looking around. The exterior doesn't stand out. Look for the sidewalk sign or you are going to miss it. The cashier was really friendly. I asked if they had debit and they didn't. Luckily there is an ATM across the street. She said they will have debit in January. I ordered the classic as a combo and a coffee. I added pepperoni just for fun. I think there was a communication barrier because I didn't get the combo. I didn't cause a scene, though, as the cashier seemed a little uncertain. The coffee was self-serve. It wasn't gourmet but it was good enough and only $1. I'm tempted to give up my McDonalds addiction and just come here for coffee. The food took about five minutes to arrive. The sandwich was made with white bread, real cheese (not processed), and had a fair amount of pepperoni. It was delicious, but a bit small. There are mustard, ketchup, and mayo provided for your dipping needs. It came with two pickle slices (eeeewwww for me, but I guess others love them), a small cup of garlicky cherry tomatoes and a small fruit cup. The plain sandwich was $3 (grand opening special) and $1.50 to add the meat. The interior is clean and features various paintings which seem to be for sale. My only suggestion is that I hope they expand the side dish options. Soup isn't terribly substantial. I think a salad or fries would go a long way."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends on a lazy sunday afternoon a few weeks ago. The weather was awesome, and we were just around the corner so Jeremy M suggested we come here.

The place is cute and quaint and looks like its suuuuuuper 420 friendly (they were selling papers and rolling accessories at the counter, and they have a vapor lounge upstairs). Because of all that, I definitely though the food would be awesome, because stoners + food, thats simple math.


It was too! I got the anitpasti sandwhich, which came on this cute marbled rye with a whole bunch of grilled veggies in it. It was ridiculously delicious! *just dont tell the val i said that veggies can be delicious*

next time im in TO, this will definitely be on my list to go back to!"}
{"text":"These are not anything close to resembling a gourmet grilled cheese. These could only be of lower quality if they made them in a microwave. For the price they charge I would expect some effort be put into it."}
{"text":"Came here for some lunch after the Pride Parade on account of we all love cheese!!
Sad to say I was LESS than impressed with this restaurant.

They had a condensed menu because of Pride which only featured 5 different sandwiches, with only a side of bacon as a side.
I got the club melt which in itself was decent. Overpriced, and definitely something I could have made at home.
It was served with a small wedge of pickle and small handful of kettle chips.

There is not much seating as this establishment is a converted house.
To be honest, it was a little run down. The tables wobbled and didn't sit straight, the seating by the window was really dirty which made for an uncomfortable meal.

This meal was not worth what I paid, it was decently tasting, but was not filling and I was still hungry leaving.

2/5"}
{"text":"Charging six bucks for a basic grilled cheese, a sandwich a 12 year old could grill, bad business decision. $3, tops! 
Last time the amount of cheese and finished product was cheap and not worth six...."}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place. I stopped in for lunch and flipped through the menu. I saw a lot that got me going so I ordered two sandwiches.

I got the Hottie and the classic Grilled Cheese. My rating pretty much says it for me. I've had better and the Hottie had WAY too much Jalapeno on it for me to taste the rest of the sandwich.

The other issue I had was the wait. The price point was there for the sandwich but the waiting for it took too long for me to find it worth it in the long run.

The staff was courteous and friendly but at the end of the day I just didn't see the full appeal about this place. Also, the lack of mushrooms on the menu was displeasing but that is just me.

Try it if you'd like but this place just wasn't for me for a multitude of reasons"}
{"text":"I returned to Get Melted today for takeout. A friend told me that they had a Groupon, and I became curious about whether things had changed since I was last there. The Groupon is $12 for $20 worth of food. I decided to order two sandwiches for my friend and I to share, and asked for it to go. What I ordered was: 

For me: La Poire - $8.75 made with Brie, Mozzarella, Pear, Almond, Arugula, Dijon, Marble Rye

For my friend: Classic Melt - $5.75 made with Cheddar, Mozzarella, Mayo, White. My friend wanted to add avocado and bacon, but avocado was not available today. My friend also originally wanted the Toad in the Hole - $5.00 made with a Fried Egg, Cheddar, White. But that was also not available. So to customize it we paid $1.50 for bacon, and 0.75 for an egg...I think! The menu and prices are different online - so we likely paid more for the additions than the prices online. 

My friend and I had seen photos of the food online, and I was eagerly waiting to bite into a crunchy pickle and munch on chips as well. About 15 minutes after ordering I got the food in a small bag and I went home. When I got home I opened the bag and we were incredibly disappointed. There were no pickles, and you got a small handful of chips that were seasoned - maybe with onion powder and mustard? It was hard to decipher the flavor. What happened to sea salt chips that would please more palettes? Why complicate it with odd seasoning? 

In terms of the sandwiches. Well, they were just that - sandwiches. Not grilled cheeses. The bread was toasted not grilled, and you could not taste any butter. In fact, the bread was dry! My sandwich was actually decent in flavor, but it was not a grilled cheese. And for $10 it was not good enough to buy again. My friend's sandwich was mediocre at best. It was small, with dry bread and a soggy center. In fact, this is the kind of sandwich I make for myself when I am rushing to work in the morning. Takes no time to make and the ingredients are basic.

Oh, and I also got a pop for $2. The grand total for our meal was $21.10. 

Needless to say, I know why they have a Groupon out. 

Hmmmm curious, do the people that get take out get less food because....well, why?! If you are gotta offer less for takeout, then there should be a takeout menu with lower prices! 

Skip it!

P.S: 

*Few computer plugs so hard to relax and work while you eat
**They are open from 11AM to 5PM and closed Sundays. So if you wanna grab a sandwich after work, you are out of luck!
**Prices too expensive--no value for money"}
{"text":"Came in not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the quality. They have perfected the grilled cheese and they know it. Lots of seating and very friendly staff makes this place great. 

Just be careful as you might walk right by it or think they are closed as they are raised up above the streets and you might think they are closed or something as we did before we walked inside. 

If you like cheesy anything, try this place out. Curious how they would do macaroni..."}
{"text":"CLOSED

=========================================

The sandwiches are okay but definitely overpriced.

The lounge upstairs is pretty small. With just 10-15 people I think it might start feeling crowded. Bongs and vapes are available for rent. No charge to get in but you have to buy something. The lounge was empty the few times I went. No atmosphere.

The shop downstairs is okay if that's your thing. But the lounge could use a bigger space and some music or TVs or other entertainment."}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese?!! Yes Please!!

After an initial search, (I walked too far), I stumbled my way back *almost* home and tah dah, my ultimate goal was met!  It's a nice little place with that crazy retro sign, it suits it.  It was a little disorganized when I was there yesterday, but my sandwich was So Good.  I got an Arjun's ... Specialty?  Anyway, it was wonderful and ended up having almost a carbonara sauce around the edges from the melted cheese and the tasty bacon.  Tomato as well, and I was pretty much in heaven.  I could eat one of these every day and possibly not care when the end came. ;)  It took awhile, but people saying \"oh, grilled cheese shouldn't take x long\" are not taking into account the toppings, the thickness of the cheeses, the desire they have to make you a good one.  I understand it's frustrating if it's takeout, which they do, but I am completely hoping to peg this place as a neighbourhood hangout as well, rather than just a bag lunch and \"See ya!\" kind of place.

I engaged in the vape lounge section while there, as well.  I have MS, and I need to rest a lot, and I need to medicate, and I did.  It is *so* nice to just be able to be out in a regular place where I expect they'll get to know me pretty soon. =)  There is a non-vaping section with nice floofy chairs as well, so the whole family can go chew these wonderful beasts.  Homph.  Thank you especially for that. xo"}
{"text":"I love this place in principle but it's not for me.  Reeks too much like the wacky to be family friendly too...not that I care...just saying haha

Staff is awesome but I find this place confusing.  Do I seat myself? Or do you seat me? Do I pick up my food? Or do you bring it to me? Am I supposed to tip or is this a fast food place?

Portions were too small for my hangover-hungries and wasn't actually good bang for my buck....

But that doesn't mean it's not good bang for YOUR buck!  I probably won't be in a rush to go back because I'm a pig, but people should try it out."}
{"text":"I love grilled cheese sandwiches and was expecting a great selection of breads and cheeses to pick from.  I had a Turkey Club Melt, it was good but I'm not rushing back.  I also had the cream if mushroom soup - next time pass.  Looked like blender mushrooms and some vegetable stock, not creamy at all.

My preference for grilled cheese sandwiches is in Kensington Market \"Grilled Cheese\". You can select from many different cheeses and varieties of bread.  At least this place adds some variety to. Church Street.  They do get high marks for having a \"cute\" shop."}
{"text":"i really detest giving a one star to restaurants, however the most i think about the situation, the more it barely warrants one star...

if you can make a grilled cheese sandwich, stay home
if you can buy no name potato chips and put them on a plate...stay home
if you can put microwaveable bacon in a microwave and cook it...stay home. 

as a huge cheese lover, i was very intrigued to come in here and check it out. smack dab in one of the best neighborhoods in Toronto for restaurants. pretty new on the inside, nice lay out, not for big crowds and upstairs is a vapor lounge, complete with tv/satellite(not confirmed i heard this through someone else) when i looked at the menu i was very happy to see the variety of the items on the menu, plus side menus. the cashier was amazing, she was friendly, bubbly and eager to help out, during what i could imagine was a very busy and beneficial pride week.

i wasn't very happy after ordering, and neither was the group i was with. 
i get it, everyone's out to make a living, and make something of themselves, however, for how \"big\" the kitchen is, to only have some sandwich presses and a microwave is pretty sad, i was disappointed that for me and significant other was $35 W tip included. they don't explain on the menu what comes with the sandwich, naturally i thought at the very least fries would come with it, instead we were treated to no name bbq chips. at least they give you a pickle...not to mention our table shook more then some beds in that neighborhood. another peeve of mine, as laid back as this place was, if i have to ask people to move out of the way AND DISTURB their meal, so i can get to the bathroom? you've FAILED as a restaurant.

honestly nothing special, for the price i wish more was offered. if you can cook at home, then stay home and save your money, if i could give a lower rating i would. 
at least the place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"4 stars if the chips were nicer and the price a bit lower. I think they were Lays chips? Maybe that is temporary because the sandwich was great. Had the La Poire. Small meal, tasty."}
