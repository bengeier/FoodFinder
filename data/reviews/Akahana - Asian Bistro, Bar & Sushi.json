{"text":"Food was very good, service a bit slow but not the fault of the server. She was under staffed. Please please do something about the rest rooms."}
{"text":"Always look forward to coming or ordering out at Akahana.  Amazing sushi.  The sushi is better than the hot entrees albeit the hot entrees are above average.

I always get either the crunchy roll or the Charlotte Roll.  The Charlotte roll is is packed with flavor.  A must try if you are feeling adventurous.  

The quality is great every time whether we dine in or take out.  The presentation, taste, etc. is exceptional. Can't beat the BOGO sushi roll special!

Akahana is one of the few sushi spots in the Fort Mill area.  It's located conveniently in Baxter to enjoy before or after a night in the area. The ambiance is pleasant with both indoor and outdoor seating.  Akahana is within walking distance of all other shops and nightlife spots in Baxter.

The owner is very nice and introduced himself and talked to us last time we were in.  A week later we saw him while in the area and he recognized us. He offered to buy us sushi next time we were in. It meant a lot that he remembered us.

Only qualm I have is that the draft beer was either stale or the tap system needed cleaned.  I had a NoDa Jam Session and it tasted skunked.

All in all I love dining at Akahana when I'm in the mood for some good sushi. Definitely recommend if you are ever in the area and looking to get something out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Super yummy fresh sushi. BOGO sushi with a good selection of classic and specialty rolls. They also have regular Asian food for people who don't love sushi. Good service and nice ambiance with full bar."}
{"text":"I got the sesame chicken, i took my mom, sister, brother and dad. My dad asked what they have other than soda and alcohol, the lady said \"Juice and stuff.\" Is that a correct answer? Other than the horrible service, the food was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here before many times. However, it seems as though every time we visit the sushi rolls become smaller and smaller. We had lunch today and took advantage of the buy-one-get-one special for lunch. The buy-one-get-one doesn't make sense when the rolls are extremely small. Don't be fooled by the discount! Besides the sushi, we've never had an issue with a meal or meal size. Just keep in mind the sushi roll size/pieces."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ended up leaving without receiving our meals after waiting over an hour for food. A table of 10 that was seated after us had already received food and we're paying their check. Service was horrible and management was completely unhelpful. Would never return."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch a couple of times and the service was just ok, meaning it took a while to get our food.  When you typically have an hour to eat during lunch you really should get your food delivered within 10 min. Max of ordering.  This took at least 20 and they weren't busy at all.  Although BOGO is a great marketing idea be aware that the size of your sushi when it is \"take out\" is much smaller size (just bite size) then when you eat in.  

I went on a Friday night around 7:30pm for take out understanding it would be busier than usual, I decided to order a drink from the bar, then order my food.  The bar was packed and soon realized it was because people were waiting for a table, which is a good sign that the food is worth the wait.  However, I stood right at the bar for a good 10 min and neither of the 2 bartenders acknowledged me or my friend and they came by us many times.  I get when a bar is busy but you need to acknowledge your customers at least with 'I'll be right with you'.  FINALLY got our dirty martini order with the male bartender and get our drinks which were in the short, no stem martini glasses and only 3/4 full with 1 olive, so disappointed with that but then got the bill!!!!   $8 each with a $1 prep fee on top of that!!!!!  What is that??  I mean we are in Fort Mill, not NY or even Charlotte!  Anyway, decided to order the take out and they said it was a 45 min wait on food.  So very disappointed in the entire exp."}
{"text":"Spicy edamame is wonderful! Good sushi. Ambience is very nice but tables for 2 are so close together that you have no privacy. We actually asked to be seated elsewhere as the place was empty since it was early. We felt like it was an inconvenience. Our waitress said they like to keep the tables close for the waiters. I understand that but you actually feel like you are joining strangers for dinner. I noticed 2 couples come in after us also ask to sit elsewhere. Small issue but I don't want to have to ask every time so will likely just eat elsewhere for the $."}
{"text":"My family will never eat at Akahana again. My sister has a severe gluten allergy and the last time we ate there they paid no attention to our specific instructions to put her order in a separate container. When we asked them to remake it the manager was incredibly rude and said I should have told them about the allergy even though my specific instructions about the gluten allergy were on the receipt. Very disappointed in the way she conducted herself, definitely didn't represent the business well."}
{"text":"Cuisine is Asian fusion. Interior theme fits the cuisine: small tea candles at each table and a full set of \"essentials\" with sriracha & hoisin sauces, salt & pepper, regular and less sodium soy sauce, and 2 small plates (the plates are not so essential and I usually ask for them to be removed). Noticed not all the chairs matched in the dining room.

Food tastes average-good. Pricing is fair, their $4.95 appetizer soups shocked me at first but then I found they are actually full bowls (and quite delicious), not the tiny cups you are served elsewhere. 

Sushi is always BOGO (good deal for sushi) and the entree dishes are ~$12.00. Sundays have $3 mimosas and $4 bloody Marys. 

Unfortunately service is why it's only worth 2 stars maximum because it all depends on your server. I eat here somewhat frequently and noticed a bit of turnover. There's 3 [memorable] servers I've seen since the opening that are still around and doing a great job. (Don't get me wrong, I'm not a sourpuss & always in a good mood to go eat!) 

Other servers either seem new to the industry or just not suited for the role with an apparent negative attitude, being passive-aggressive....ie not presenting bill in the booklet, slamming pens at payment, being MIA through dining experience."}
{"text":"Sushi is awesome,  but the service level needs to be improved.   Staff also fails to ask if there is anything else.   Staff assumes when you are finished and they bring you the check failing to ask if you would like something else."}
{"text":"My wife and visited Akahana on a Friday night. When greeted at the door we were advised that the wait would be about 10 minutes. Not too bad for a Friday night during the dinner rush. We went to the bar to get a glass of wine. The service in the bar was a little slow and the staff seemed a little overwhelmed. It wasn't that busy in the bar so this might be an area they should look into improving.

When we were seated we exchanged pleasantries with our server, Gina, we advised her that I have gluten sensitivities. Gina was AWESOME! She made suggestions and steered us clear of things that may be a problem for me. The surprise to me was when she brought a bottle of gluten free soy sauce to our table without even being asked to do so. Her suggestion of a wine selection was spot on too.

The Pho that we had was incredible and again Gina helped us in our selection because we have never tried it. The sushi was tasty and fresh, we chose something we have had tons of times before and it was very good.

The wine was a big pour and for the price it was an above average deal. 

Our overall experiance was awesome and we would recommend you visit.  Ask to sit in Gina's section if she is working and tell her you heard about it here.

The bar service was a little slow and the front door was slow to close causing cold air to rush in and flow over our table. But those are things that can be worked on. The food was great and the table service was outstanding and it was reasonably priced. A huge thank you to Gina and Akahana for a job extremely well done"}
{"text":"I like this place the sushi is always good and always BOGO with an above average selection but the service is always hit or miss can't understand why"}
{"text":"Love their sushi! Buy one get one keeps you ordering in multiples of 2 and is a cheeky way to upsell you more sushi but it works. Plus it's so good you will be glad you had more. Pad tai is pretty good, better than I have found around the fort mill area."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the review that mentioned the rolls are of great 'quality'.  Brought my daughter here for Christmas break celebration and was very disappointed in the size and amount of roll for the price (which is totally built into the bogo 'deal'). The avocado in her California roll was browning and speckled and the avocado in my cherry blossom roll was mushy brown-completely rotted in 4 of the pieces. I brought this to my waitresses attention who sent whom I thought was the hostess over (come to find she is the manager) and asked if we wanted another one or for it to be taken off the bill. My daughter was still hungry so I asked for hers to be remade, but I had lost my appetite and didn't want a replacement for mine. Check came charging for all rolls. When I questioned the manager and stated she had said that she would take it off the bill, she completely backpeddled and said she could only give 10% off if I don't want to remade. Any business that is ok with serving food of poor quality and charging their customers full-price is not one that one where I will choose to spend my money! Disgraceful!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! The sushi is phenomenal and fresh. The service was exceptional! I recommend trying the Fuji moon drink and the Florida roll is amazing. The miso soup was good too. Plus BOGO is a great savings for sushi. The toro or fatty tuna is the best I've had at a sushi place so far. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  Custom orders always come out correct, and their menu selections are out of this world to begin with.  Service is always on point and proactive.  Their sushi is out of this world amazing.  Miso soup is standard (great) and affordable pricing.  From their fusion cuisine to Japanese standards, always impressed (I have eaten there 5-6 times since moving to Fort Mill)
You won't be disappointed.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"This was horrible.  They advertised they had white tuna. I inquired about this as an avid fisherman and asked if this was albacore. They said not it was red big eye tuna. I asked them to check with the sushi chef which said this was escolar white tuna.  Lies !!!   Escolar is a misnomer for snake mackerel which can make you extremely sick.  I will never be back here.  I brought up my concerns to the waitress/bartender.  Horrible place.  Don't go"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here every day, no lie. They always have my order correct and it tastes delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Their food was descent but their service is terrible. We had to wait 7 minutes to be seated with lads if empty tables and in the end they forgot about us. Second time it happened and we left."}
{"text":"First sushi place I have ever gone to that has craft beer.  Very much appreciated over the standard Japanese beer at most sushi restaurants.   Sushi was excellent.   Loved the roll wrapped in cucumber vs rice.  Very tasty.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Baxter village. The Asian place to go to when in the area.

Great selection of good food and the service is great too. The plates are very big and I always have to take half of it home. I love their lettuce wraps which I think are an appetizer but are big enough to eat as a whole meal or to split with someone else."}
{"text":"I've been to Akihana 3 times. Each time, service has sucked, the bogo sushi offer is some bizarre smoke and mirrors, and the meal takes about an hour to come out. Just really disappointing."}
{"text":"Wish I could review the food but with waiting for an hour for the food to come with only 2 other tables in the resturant it not going to be worth it.

--Additional info--
I posted the above while waiting on my food and would like to add the following: i asked the serve to please have someone come out and tell me why it took so long for the food to come out (which included 4 sushi rolls and order 2 orders of Lo Mein).  The manager comes out, doesn't apologize at any point for anything and then blames the server for not entering the order quick enough.  I told him that I doubt that was the fact as there were on 2 other tables in the resturant.  He says that he will go check at the sushi bar and get back with me.  He in fact does come back out to talk, be it that it was 10 minutes later, and blames it again on the server, his sushi bar received the order at 8:00 and we got the food at 8:40 and they were busy with other tables and take out orders.  I, with a smile, said which one of the other 2 tables and the 2 people that I saw walk out the door backed them up?  He said he didn't see a problem with the wait and that he didn't see where the issue was. At that point I was furious and Told him that it was obvious that he wasn't concerned about customer satisfaction whatsoever and that it was a shame because the sushi was very good but they wouldn't be around very long with such poor focus on the customer.

I felt so bad for the server knowing that it wasn't her fault and in speaking with her afterwards that the managers often blame the servers for slow service coming out of the kitchen.  So knowing these types of managers I wanted to make sure that the server was taken care of and not punished in any way by the manager withholding tips because of complaints I gave her a very nice tip in cash and paid the bill with a credit card.

So if you have a couple hours to spare and aren't concerned about having to wait an obscene amount of time for your food, then this place isn't bad.  Otherwise don't waste your time and go somewhere else to support the local business."}
{"text":"The food is delicious every time, but the awful service which seems to get progressively worse through the years leaves much to be desired.  I am starting to get the impression that the management knows customers will continue to frequent Akahana, regardless of the atrocious service solely by the fact that the food is excellent.  It really is a shame that this restaurant has seemingly made no attempt to address the issues with poor wait staff, even though it is a well known fact that it is terrible. Get takeout if you are planning to eat here"}
{"text":"I love sushi and SO WANT to love this place. I've eaten here at least a dozen times in 2015, and every time I leave I'm literally shaking my head saying \"never again.\" The irony is I quite like the food. It's the service that I find terrible and I believe it starts at the management level. No one is ensuring that everything is going as it should. In fact it's hard to determine who the manager is because no one seems to be in charge.

Employee turnover seemed very high last year as there never seemed to be a familiar face when I'd sit down. 

I saw the gamut last year from dirty dining areas (the patio chairs were in dire need of replacement for most of the year), deeply stained concrete in need of a washing, cockroaches running around the patio (I'm not exaggerating). A word on the cockroaches... The servers have acknowledged them explaining nothing can be done as the patio is outdoors.... I've eaten outdoors countless times at many other places and I have never seen anything like this. 

There's a bus station for dirty dishes outside on the patio that seldom gets picked up, so dirty dishes pile up. Many of the wait staff are poorly trained if at all, orders forgotten and even our table forgotten entirely. More than once did they seem short staffed as servers run breathlessly trying to keep up. 

I do not enjoy writing a negative review. I was raised in the restaurant industry and I think it's one of the hardest businesses to operate. However, from everything I've seen, the issues at this restaurant start at the top. This place has massive potential... and it's being missed. If they could understand and deliver what good (not even great) service was, they'd be doing better than they are. 

I've not visited in 2016, and I won't be back, but I've been motivated to share my experiences after hearing a friend express their recent disappointment there. 

I WANT to eat here. I like the food here.... I just can't bring myself to support a restaurant that doesn't seem to care about the customer experience."}
{"text":"It's ok. Asian American cuisine. Had fried rice, two different types of sushi, and pork bun. The fish sauce needed more flavor, quite bland.  One of our sushi rolls was wrong. The best flavor of all the dishes was the fried rice! Smh! Portions decent size."}
{"text":"The food was quite good. Unfortunately the service was terrible. Actually the service was just ok until we asked for the check. It took 40-45 minutes to get a to-go box, get our check and then the receipt. They had added a 20% gratuity to the bill for a party of 4 adults and 2 kids that didn't order anything. So no real surprise that service was so bad with the tip mandatory. This was the first time in memory that I actually sought out a manager to complain. Turns out the manager was the guy our waitress was chatting with for about 10 minutes while we waited for our check. All this with the restaurant empty except for one other party. I'm also not one to leave negative reviews. Most places do a passable job. This was the worst service I can recall ever receiving."}
{"text":"This place was not my favorite, but I don't remember ever being happy from a pan-Asian restaurant.  For an appetizer we ordered shrimp & veggie tempura.  The tempura was so thick on the food and the veggies were still hard and raw - I have never had tempura that bad before.

I asked the waitress if I could not get yellow tail as part of a nigiri dinner option and they could just give me two other kinds on the plate already instead.  She just told me no and didn't even check with anyone and I really don't see how that would be an unreasonable request...  Since I hate yellow tail so much, I decided to order a tuna and rice bowl.  The prices of the rolls are crazy expensive even for non-specialty ones.  For example, spicy tuna is more than $10 - I want to say its closer to $15.

The veggie rolls were BOGO so my husband got two of those and they were just ok.  I would never go back to this place.  it's really overpriced and the food isn't even good!"}
{"text":"If I could give it -3 stars I would. Hands down one of the worst place I've been too. Good /okay service, horrible food.

We ordered the \"Shaken beef\" which was supposed to be one of the popular dishes, but I honestly don't understand why...... the rice was dry and burnt, no sauce or anything for it & vegetables looked like they were left out all day. I took a bite of the beef, and it was cold.... it was like they literally took it out all the ingredients from the fridge and put it on a plate to serve.
Sushi was ok... even with their buy one get one free promotion. I couldn't even finish a roll of 5.

I regret not looking at reviews before going here, but at least I can give Yelp and future customers some feedback. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Literally just walked out the front door because we felt so uncomfortable and so unwelcome in this restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to go for lunch and get their buy one get one free sushi. Upon walking in, the host was not welcoming and seemed annoyed that he had to seat us. A waiter was sitting at one of the tables on his phone. Our waitress came over immediately and got our drink order but left us to sit for 15 minutes without getting our food order. Mind, there were just two tables of two inside and a party of 6 outside and there was extra help but they didn't seem to care. The host just stood there and looked on. The waitress seemed preoccupied with the party outside and didn't seem to care much about anyone inside. Then the two girls sitting next to us asked to be moved to a different table. This was the last straw for me.The whole atmosphere felt very snooty and rude. I looked at my boyfriend and said I'm ready to go now and we left. We've consistently gotten this kind of service from this location over the past few times we've eaten here. I'm not about to spend 15 plus dollars a plate on awful service like this. We will not be coming back. Most of the time I don't bother with reviews unless the service is fantastic but I could not keep my mouth shut about crappy experience."}
{"text":"This our go to place for sushi in Rock Hill~Baxter Village.  We love everything we've ever gotten and have never been disappointed.  The buy one get one free roll is a definite plus so really can get a lot of food for a great price.  Never have tried any of the typical Chinese dishes as we prefer sushi,  but the food always looks and smells good.  Have always had excellent service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Tonight, I paid for my take out order in full.  They gave me half my order when I picked it up. I only realized this when I arrived home and unwrapped their bag. I called them back to tell them this. The manager checked with the kitchen, blithely admitted that they did not prepare that part of the order and then told me the kitchen was closed. Offered nothing but apologies until I casually reminded her that I paid full price for a fraction of a meal. Now I get to go in tomorrow morning for a full refund. Between inattentive waitstaff and this being the second time they've had a major issue keeping an order straight, we observe a self-evident, disturbing, and quite frankly damning trend: quality of service has taken a similar nosedive here over the last 5 months, on multiple levels. This is the nadir. I'd been excited about this place at first after having recently moved here but now its staff cannot even assemble and hand off the meal that I paid for. I guess my $5 tip on that take-out order was ethically gratuitous at the end of the day. More like fake-out order. I try to go out of my way to support establishments that treat me well in turn. This social contract is ended. Time to progress to more competent East Asian cuisine in the Fort Mill/Rock Hill area."}
{"text":"SUSHI SPECIALS. Come for the sushi specials, that is all. Outside of the sushi specials there isn't anything that great about this place. BOGO sushi rolls is the best thing this place has going for it. Otherwise it is regular, overpriced sushi."}
{"text":"My husband and I love their sushi rolls and their atmosphere is great to sit outside! My dad loves their shrimp fried rice :-)"}
{"text":"Buy 1, Get 1 sushi rolls are not only an awesome deal, but the sushi is great! Spicy edamame and shumai are our go to apps! It's a weekly tradition for my coworkers and I to meet up for great food and drinks.  I've always had a good experience with waitstaff. I do not recommend sitting at the bar, as the girl normally behind it has an attitude. I learned my first time sitting over there! Stick to the table side and the waiters/waitresses do a great job!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I am very critical of service. Hence my review. The sushi was very good, but the service by that girl, whatever her name was, absolutely AWFUL! She didn't know the menu, the drinks, not an unpleasant person, but she does not understand she is working for tips apparently. Her head was in the clouds! Speaks volumes about the manager. This place is a disaster. Ownership should really look mlre closely at their staff. Get it together Akahana! We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I love the sushi... I would love to give 5 stars, for the last several months, we've ordered to-go at least every 2-3 weeks.. but it's been very frustrating when I call and am told 15-20min and it's over an hour before it's ready.  Very frustrating when trying to coordinate evening family plans.. I really do love the food but there's also a limit on how much a busy mother and wife can take"}
{"text":"We went here when we had family in from NY, we decided it was a nice spot to eat outside. Everyone liked the food, it was a little greasy but all together good.  The waitress was really nice but not really attentive. We constantly felt like we couldn't find her. The two tables next to us came in after us and had apps just like we had yet got dinner almost 8 minutes before us. It's not like we had a huge party of people. We were four adults. I guess we might go back there but I'm not sure I would take my guests that come from out of state."}
{"text":"Friend recommended so I finally got to try and was disappointed.  Must have been an off  day because my fish in sushi wasn't fresh.  Also the rolls were sloppily done and lacked flavor.  Server was very nice, but not enough for a repeat."}
{"text":"Great sushi, even better prices.  How is this place not more popular? lol"}
{"text":"Food was great, as always. Sadly I experienced the worst service I've ever experienced. Hailey was my group server and she was not attentive at all. I specifically asked for a refreshed drink and still did not receive it until almost 10 minutes later. She took 15-20 minutes to even take our order. We were not a big group, only 5 people. She did not seem to care about us or our customer service. Certainly hope I do not get her again."}
{"text":"Filthy bathroom! My feet were sticking to the floor due to the piss around the comde. At 1st I thought I was at Chucky Cheese do to all of the screaming kids. Horrible martini, got the food to go and just through it in the trash it was so screwed up! There are plenty of good places to in Fort Mill. This is not one of them. 
P.s service was horrible"}
{"text":"Great food with a great waiter named Kurt! Took my mom here for her birthday, both of our first times and we highly enjoyed it. Can't beat the buy one get one roll deal. Plus we had the lettuce wraps. All was delicious. One of the rolls is the Ecstasy something and the other I can't remember. Sorry. But don't think you can go wrong with the rolls."}
{"text":"Tons of veggie sushi options and the buy one get one free any day of the week is an awesome deal!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype surrounding Akahana and can now say I get it. This place is absolutely fantastic for everything Asian, as well as Indian cuisine. 

I came for lunch the other day, and against my better judgement tried an Indian dish. Believe me when I say, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the dish and it was VERY good. I was simply jealous of all the other more Asian dishes in my party of 10. 

Per the dish I had, a chicken dish with yellow curry with white rice, made great use of curry sauce ingredients as well as a fresh vegetable medley- sprinkled with fresh jalopenos. It was fairly hot outside that day on their patio so I can't really pin-point my sweating due to the dish or the heat. My guess is a combination of the two (most likely), and I will say it had the perfect kick. The dish had a perfect flavor balance and was not skimpy on its proportion. 

In general, it seemed like just about every dish on the table for in upwards of $9, for a lunch menu item, seemed well worth it proportion-wise. All 10 plates looked delectable and it seems to me it wouldn't be hard to find a new, great dish off their menu.

Aside from enjoying a lunch here, the interior is such that would warrant a great date night. Very modern and upscale decor. I haven't looked to hard into their dinner menu, but I can assume quality, quantity, and price are all adequately proportioned, as in lunchtime."}
{"text":"Love the Food.... but the service is sooooooo slow it hurts.....
They are under staffed... please hire more people!!!!"}
{"text":"I've popped in here for both a sit-down dinner and late-night sushi take-out. The interior is classy and contemporary, and the waitstaff is friendly. Great atmosphere for a date. Pretty nice presentation, too. Service is a little slow.

On to the food! My boyfriend has a gluten allergy, and the chef was happy to make some informed suggestions about safe options, which was pretty cool. The miso is too salty... I really don't like it at all. I have to say that I'm also not really a fan of their fried sushi rolls - the batter is a little too thick for my taste, kind of like fancy fish sticks. However, I will say that the other rolls I've had were quite delicious.

The Cherry Blossom Roll is simple, and though I'm not usually for the simpler rolls, it was actually very flavorful and fresh. I'd order it again.
I also have had a Spicy Tuna Roll, and though the taste wasn't completely my thing (a bit saltier than expected, maybe?), it was true to its word about the heat.
The Florida Roll tastes great with spicy salmon swapped out for the tuna (EDIT: I've been told they do not do substitutions anymore). This thing was definitely packed to the brim with fish. No skimping there.

Hands down, though, my #1 recommendation is the Tropical Exotic Roll. It's unique and SO tasty! Don't be scared off by the odd-looking soy paper and the unusual, cute little triangles it's cut in - that's part of what makes it delicious! I'm planning on getting it again my next visit for sure.

Their prices are kind of high, but I was told they always have BOGO sushi, so that's how they balance the deal. I'm not sure about the other types of food they serve, but if you're into sushi, give them a try!

EDIT: I have now also tried their pho. It's okay, but definitely isn't memorable. Pretty bland. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"The kids love this place and go there all the time, great sushi selection, great value, service has always been very good"}
{"text":"Just not good. Wanted to like this place because there are so few options in Baxter area but everything was working against it. 

Completely lack of ambiance. Just a plain bad experience. 

Bad service, wait staff hung around chatting while we waited for 10 minutes just to get water or acknowledgement. Our eventual waitress was good but the wait staff really killed the mood. 

Food is 'eh at best. My wife's tuna had something weird going on with it. Hard to explain.   Red Bowl is a better bet."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times because my kids love eating outside and the kid meals are ok but the past 2x the smell when you walk in is so gross!!!! I should've walked out this past time but we sat outside.  The sushi had a horrible smell and wasn't fresh! I felt nauseous all day! We'll never be back:("}
{"text":"Amazing food here and pretty good service. Food is fresh. Atmosphere is great!!!! They do fry all of their food in the same grease which is why I'm rating a 3 stars. My Neice suffers from food allergies and didn't have much to choose from. Overall pretty good food.."}
{"text":"I have been to Akahana on many occasions and they never disappoint with their customer service and food, you really can't go wrong with this place. This has been a great addition to the Baxter Village neighborhood. The price you pay for the food and service is very good and on par with Baxter Village. I enjoy supporting small local businesses and Akahana deserves the support. You will be pleased with your visit."}
{"text":"Received very poor quality of service here today. Ordered the pad thai with chicken, got the pad thai, noticed the scallions were missing? Called the waiter over and asked him why the scallions were missing. He informs me it's a different dish. I educate him that the menu says scallions are included in the pad thai. He says he'll get me a side of scallions. 15 minutes later, waiter comes back and says the chefs are out of scallions. Wouldn't you inform your customer that a crucial ingredient is missing before they order? Or, you know, have the decency to tell them when you serve them?

So I ask the waiter if they'll comp the chicken ($1) in place of the scallion. He said no, because it's still extra... $1... 

Didn't get a refill for 20 minutes until I asked for it. Didn't get a spoon for 15 minutes after I asked for it. So disappointing. I have eaten here before and the service wasn't great, but it wasn't this poor of quality. Won't be returning here or bringing guests here. Many better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. HORRIBLE service. We will not be back. Nor will we be recommending this. When we are told we can sit at our table, but won't be waited on for 15 min... Then our waitress comes over 20 minutes later and with a sigh exclaims \"They are giving me all the big tables tonight. And it's my first night!\" Please... What a poor excuse, and unbelievable that the manager would put a new employee on the \"big tables\". We are not a difficult party. 5 of us. We just want some silver ware...  
I read the other reviews, MANY of which have had my same experience. Large staff turn over, poor service, rude manager... 
I want to love this place. So kitchen staff, you get 10 stars. But I cannot deal with this poor excuse for customer service."}
{"text":"I give them two stars only because the food is good and they always have the BOGO sushi. The service is horrible. Today was the last straw. I arrived at 12:30, about 5 minutes later another couple was seated. They were immediately asked their drink orders. When the waitress walked back by I asked if someone would be by to help me. She replied with oh we are sending someone out. At that point I just got my purse and left. I had been waiting for almost 10 minutes and just felt it was ridiculous that no one had stopped by my table. The last time I went there the waiter dropped our napkins on the ground then proceed to place them on our table and he never refilled our drinks. As I said the food is good, but the service is just plain horrible."}
{"text":"Singapore Vermicelli is the hidden gem in the menu.  If you ask me, this dish should have a special place in the menu, big font, bold, highlighted, underlined etc.,  I believe its curry powder used in the sauce and it is so damn delicious.  Vermicelli (super thin rice noodles) just melts in your mouth, added chicken just compliments the dish.  The first time we just ordered it by chance and it was instant love, probably because its taste kind of reminded of some Indian food that we love.
Have only place to-go orders in Akahana and the food was always prepared and ready on -time, never had to wait more than the mentioned time.  The place looked decent inside to dine, the bar was looking decent, plenty of outdoor seating to catch all the fun happening in then baxter town center."}
{"text":"Came here for the BOGO sushi.  Rolls only - no nigiri or sashimi. Only one waiter working the entire restaurant which was surprisingly busy for a Monday which made service horrible. Everything took forever!  Sushi rolls were good. Ordered gyoza fried and they brought steamed.  Pepper steak had a nasty flavor. Refills were few and far between. Waiter was doing his best but management obviously lacking at this place.  Tables a bit unkept also.  Probably wont be back - BOGO sushi not really that great of a deal here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoy Akahana. We typically order out, but the food is quite delicious. Our favorites are the curry udon, pineapple rice, hot & sour soup, miso soup, and pretty much all the sushi rolls. For the times we have ate there, the restaurant is clean and staff is friendly. I'm really surprised it doesn't have a better star rating."}
{"text":"Service was very rough! It took 40 minutes for our apps and 45 minutes for the entrees. They overcharged us for the beer and tried to tell us it was because we ordered drafts vs bottle. It did not state that in the menu. When we complained the manager came out with no apology. We had to find someone to get our check. This place is on the list."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot. I got the seafood hot pot and it was amazing! You really don't need the rice that comes with it as it is more of a soup."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in Fort Mill and they suggested to go at this place. A very nice sushi place in Baxter Village area. Sunday night, group of 6, we were accommodated right the way. Service was prompt and attentive.
Vast selection of food and rolls. There is something for everybody, they offer a Kids menu also. Buy one get one free sushi roll!"}
{"text":"Three times in a row our order has been wrong. Customer service has been below average, and that is unfortunate for this once good restaurant."}
{"text":"I always love the sushi at Akahana and generally we get great service but tonight was quite ridiculous. Avyn was our server and if you get her (which you won't know because she will not introduce herself)... Ask to move, or go back another time. There were three tables in the restaurant yet she was frazzled and had an excuse for why everything was taking an eternity. I never tip below 20%, but tonight was an exception.  Avyn needs to find another career path as she destroyed our dining experience. The table behind us shared our sentiment-- we had plenty of time to get to know each other since we were left stranded with no idea when we were going to receive our ordered drinks or our credit cards back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great food. Who could complain about buy one get one free sushi? I love that they have so many different things including pho!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The sushi is amazing and I have tried other dishes here as well such as the lo mein,  the pineapple chicken fried rice, and the sesame tofu all of which are great! I have been to both the one in Fort Mill and the location in Charlotte and the one in Charlotte does not even compare to the one in Fort Mill. The only reason I give this establishment 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is not always the best."}
{"text":"**Update Nov 2016. Some of the best Asian in Charlotte. Fairly priced and tastes good. Just be selective and ask about Alcohol prices. **
Alcohol/beer is a RIPOFF!!!!!!!  Do not buy!!!!Poseidon roll used to be huge but is now normal sized but price isn't-$24. Yikes. And I just paid $7 for a Southern Tier draft beer. Yes, $7 for one draft beer. One. Draft. Beer. Fail on all counts. No wonder this place is dead tonight."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant while driving through the area looking for a sushi spot. What a find!!!

We enjoyed the selection of various Asian foods from sushi to some traditional Chinese selections and then some other Asian dishes. Our waiter was excellent and the food was better than average. With BOGO drinks at the bar, the night was truly enjoyable and the food was surprisingly good.

Highly recommend when one is in Fort Mill or Tega Cay and in the mood for sushi!"}
{"text":"I take my wife and kids here once a week, the sushi is excellent, I recommend trying the bagel roll. The service is fast and never a long wait"}
{"text":"Service was terrible first time here because dirty martini was closed. Sat outside on a slow Sunday, silverware was dirty took at least 10 mins with food at the table for someone to come by and acknowledge our existence. Decent drink specials food was terrible bland, pad Thai smelt like wet dog, beef shaking something \"special\" was again bad but more flavor than the pad Thai. Poor service as I said silverware and chop sticks both dirty. Don't know if this place has been around a while but I couldn't see it being around long. Avoid."}
{"text":"The fella and I had been watching the progress at Akahana for awhile, and we were glad to see it finally opened!  It's in the space previously inhabited by Liu Liu's in Baxter Village, and this is a significant upgrade from that Asian restaurant.

The servers at Akahana aim to please; they're attentive and friendly, but not overbearing.  Our particular waiter seemed a little new and unsure, but it was sweet - E for effort.  The menu itself is extensive to the point of being almost overwhelming.  It offers all kinds of sushi, pad thai, lo mein, even curry dishes!  It took us a decent amount of time to find the wine because it's listed UNDER the sushi it pairs well with.  Neither of us was getting sushi, so we skipped over that part of the menu thinking it was just sushi.  The fella got a glass of white wine, and I got the Passion Saketini ($8), which tasted like pineapple with vodka. 

We got the spring roll appetizer ($4.95), which is always my gauge of how good any Asian restaurant is.  It was deeeelicious!  There were two rolls, and they were much bigger than at most restaurants.  The outside texture was light and crispy, and it was stuffed full of fresh, thick pork.

For entrees, I got the Chicken Lo Mein ($9.95), and the fella got the Soft Egg Noodle with chicken ($10.95).  Although the portions were huge, I ate almost my entire plate.  The fellas noodles were a little thinner than mine, and he said his was really good, but I was too busy stuffing my face to try his.  Although we didn't get any sushi, it looked beautiful when I saw it carried by our table.

The place was hopping at 6:30 on a Friday night, and I hope it does well.  It seems like a great addition to Baxter with indoor seating, a covered outdoor seating area, and a bar area.  The prices are very reasonable, and the food is pretty outstanding, too.  So glad it's finally open!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch after a client meeting today and all and all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I wasn't feeling too adventurous with my menu selections and opted to keep it simple with a house salad, solely for the purpose of the ginger dressing, and a Philly sushi roll. The standard menu items that I ordered were delicious and I gobbled them up right away. The service was super friendly and fast. Any need that we had was meet before we could ask for it. I even believe that the server picked up on the fact that I was gabbing away to my coworker and respected that fact being attentive without interrupting.

The atmosphere was great. I think my favorite part about this experience was the decor. Typically, I find that places like this tend to go overboard, but everything here was balanced. There was just the right amount of culture, while maintaining a contemporary feel to the restaurant. For example, hanging down from the ceiling, they had brightly colored open umbrellas (hanging from the handles) and behind the sushi bar, the backdrop was a water fall wall. I'm not too familiar with the Baxter Village scene, but would venture to guess this would be a great place to post up and do some people watching on their massive patio.

Overall, my impression of this place was solid. The food didn't \"wow\" me, but it was a great place to stop in for lunch."}
{"text":"We tried Akahana last night with another couple.  The food is outstanding, BUT one person was served, second dinner arrived about 10 minutes later, and the third, which my hubby and I shared, was at least 20 minutes after the first dinner was served. We ordered the Back Bean stir fry, which was delicious, but SO late in coming.  Our friend ordered the Mongolian Beef, which was so spicy he had a difficult time eating it.  (And he normally likes spicy food).  No mention on the menu about it being spicy at all.  The other person (first one served) had the Salmon, which was very good, but comes drenched in a Curry sauce.  No mention of that on the menu either. She would not have ordered it if she knew it was Curry.  So a word to the wise:  Check the ingredients with your server, ask a lot of questions, and be aware they are new and inexperienced.  We were there for 1 1/2 hours.
Love their dumplings, and the wonton soup is delicious. Both were wrapped in a very light dough, perfect.  They need to get some Chinese Mustard, which we like to add to our soup.
Don't quite know how many stars to give this brand new restaurant.  Delicious food, less than satisfactory dinner service. (NOT the waiter's fault, I blame it on the kitchen organization.
Very, very noisy.  Nothing on the walls, floor or ceilings to absorb any sound, so little kids screaming is very noticeable. Also, the music is too loud.
We will give them another chance.  They are certainly not pros at this restaurant thing."}
{"text":"I am a pretty frequent customer at akahana and have been for the past 3 years and have had no complaints. Today i had a big order for my family and I and had ordered 8 sushi rolls. Went to get the food and got home and realized we were missing 2 rolls, but didn't know which two. I live about 25 mins from this restaurant so we weren't going to immediately head back to the restaurant to get the other two rolls, so we called and claimed we were missing two rolls and that we wanted to come get it once we finished eating. Long story short, the manager claimed he watched the security camera and that the two rolls we claimed we didn't get, were there and basically considered us liars and argued with us for five minutes about how he's confused on our story. He also asked if we had our food items for proof. Worst customer service I have experienced! Extremely upset with how we were treated."}
{"text":"I had gotten the special combo pho, figuring it would be good just like the one at plaza-mid. But I was wrong. I bit into one of the meatballs in the soup and it turns out the meat was spoiled. All of the meatballs was just sour. Had told the waitress that it was bad and the cooks needed to check their meat. Super disappointed that none of the managers came to apologized or even given discount for the bad service."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to give this place a try after reading reviews but after getting a $10 off coupon my husband and I decided to try it out. I ordered Mongolian Beef and overall it was good. It was $12.95 and it was a good amount of food. We went at lunch and I really wish they would've had lunch portions with lunch prices. If you have ever tried out PF Changs I would recommend going to PF Changs. The service wasn't terrible. Our waitress was attentive once we got our food but prior to placing our order we were waiting a good while considering there were only 4 other families in the restaurant. Probably wouldn't return again unless we had another coupon."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Alycia and Reece are the best in the bar... such great service and so nice.  The sushi is amazing and the tom yum soup was awesome.  Great spot to pop into for a drink or dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here on lunch and took advantage of their BOGO sushi promo! I got the California roll ( i know rookie move) and the wasabi roll. The wasabi roll was amazing but it will clear out your nostrils if you're congested . The place was empty, but the place was clean. Our server was great and refilled our drinks without us asking. I'll definitely return soon."}
{"text":"If this review was about the food it would be four stars. For the sushi alone it would be five. We love this place and come often (take out more than sit in) 
This review is about the service. We came here for dinner tonight - table of five. we were all hungry for sushi. 
I could tell from the onset it was not going to be a good experience. our waiter was simply not attentive, not available, and not the right personality for that role. Let's review our 80 minutes there - 
four adults each ordering two sushi rolls each. 
three ordered water, one ordered sweet tea. and we ordered three  appetizers beforehand.
okay, we asked for a few differences - but nothing major. simple things like no ginger, add spicy mayo, one added cucumber. We waited an exceptionally long time for dinner. no visit from the waiter. no service ware, no napkins. no water fill ups. 
when the food came my order of a Charlotte roll came out as a California roll. he seemed shocked that I said it was wrong - pointed to my daughters plate who also ordered a Charlotte roll as to say \"there it is!\". i said leave it here they will eat it, obviously meaning we would pay for it. he took my plate and said no then you will have to pay for it and whisked it away. when he came back he all be showed me he wrote down a California roll. I Do Not Care what you wrote, you didn't write what I ordered. I even said no cream cheese, which is not in a California roll. 
we didn't get any wasabi without asking three times, didn't get an appetizer of spring rolls without asking three times (skip them, no good), didn't get soy sauce bowls without going up and getting them ourselves (same for chopsticks), we seemed to be BOTHERING the waiter anytime we asked anything (mainly water refills), and the restaurant was not busy. If he's new he needs to be better trained. If not new, he needs. serious refresher course in waiting tables. 
I felt bad only tipping 10% but honestly I don't even think he deserved that."}
{"text":"Tried to make a reservation. And I wanted to come early to set up. They would not allow it and needed an additional $100 deposit. Sushi isn't fresh either...."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on with the patio chairs that are  to low for the tables? Some of them are splitting at the seams as well."}
{"text":"Went to this place one time and was hooked! the environment of this place is chill and relaxing and has been practically empty the two times we have went. Great sushi spot that is a little on the pricy side but offers BOGO sushi all day everyday. You cant beat the deal for the quality of sushi you get. The veggie head was excited about the vegetarian section of the menu. We love this place as it has come to be our go to sushi spot!"}
{"text":"The service was ok but the food was mediocre at best. We did not have sushi so I am reviewing on the other plates. I think the menu is too diverse and it would be a challenge to deliver authentically on all those options. The menu also does not accurately describe the dishes, and the wait staff was not knowledgable enough to assist and or even provide the correct answers. This led to total dissaction as the waitor obviously knew as he apoligized while he served the food. Of the 5 dishes we ordered, only 1 was ok with the other 4 less than average. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Bogo sushi"}
{"text":"I like to start with the miso soup and house salad with ginger dressing. Try the Vietnamese Shaking Beef. It comes complete with beef tenderloin sautéed in 5 Vietnamese spicereviewThe dish is served with fried rice, lettuce and tomato slices. 

Great quality food at a reasonable price. Their menu has many types of Asian cuisine to choose from. This location of Akahana did not have desert at the time of this review. The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Went a week ago.  Not very busy got stuck at the table by the restroom (later moved due to people bumping into the baby on the end).  We had 4 adults, 2 kids and a baby - service was slow, forgot to bring out a soup & didn't put in a kids meal order almost ignored us for refills.  To top it off the bad waitress used the tiny print \"parties of 6 or more the tip is added\" on us - yes I know we had 6 people but that's usually 6 adults - not kids!!  Food was good but not worth the 2 hours we spent in there."}
{"text":"Not sure if this place changed owners from what I heard but the menu has changed. We enjoyed everything we had. First time for me ordering a Pho dish, had shrimp Pho and was told by the waitress it was a large dish that most people don't finish.  I ordered the spider roll with it and lettuce wraps.  Everything was very good and for all the food we ate was reasonably priced.  $59 for three of us.  Also had to take food home.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"I'm on the patio at this moment, it's just me and my fiancé out here no other tables. We have been here for an hour and not once have we been checked on since we ordered our food 45 minutes ago.  This is our 2nd visit and last time was a bad experience, we decided to give it another shot, which will never happen again .  The food is over priced and the experience, well... there is no experience. I asked for a manager and he came and I explained how we haven't had anyone to check on us. He apologized. Finally our food came, and the chicken curry was tasteless and looked very sloppy. The sushi was decent, nothing spectacular .  Once again , sat here for 20 mins after our food was finished just to see if anyone was going to give us our check.  No one came for 30 minutes, and when he came he laid the check on the table and walked off...... insane.  Do not come here , I repeat you do not want to come here !!!"}
{"text":"The service was awful. The waitress was quite rude when I confronted her about being charged for something I didn't order that was more expensive than what I did order. The smell is horrible inside the restaurant and the wait time was awful considering there were not many people there."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight and wasn't given all of our food.  When I called to ask for a partial refund I was continuously told I was wrong, that the food was in the bags.  She was very snotty and rude.  This isn't our first bad experience there but it's our last, we will not be returning.  There are other places we can go where they value their customers.  It's just unfortunate that yet another dining place in our neighborhood is horrible."}
{"text":"I choose a strip mall Asian restaurant over this place. The staff are great but, what a shame. 30+ minutes for food, TVs were working, the carbonated drinks were BEYOND flat even after a comp. My chicken stir fry smelled like that chicken truck you speed to go around on the interstate. Saw a pick up customer waiting over a half hour for his food and heard guest behind us complaining about the food as well. Oh and, if you want to know the deal breaker, go into the bathroom. Water smells like sewage, soap pumps don't work AND there's gang garbage scratched in the walls at the urinal. Hahah! What a joke! It's BAXTER. Someone please do something GREAT with this space. This is prime real estate that can bring in some M O N E Y if someone freaking cared enough. People spend billions on their dogs so open a restaurant for dogs for all I care. I mean, we won't be back to this dump that's for sure."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Sunday night a few weeks ago and a very strong unpleasant fishy smell hit you in the face.  I like sushi, and have been in dozens of sushi places in my life and never remember smelling a bad fish smell.  Then the wait staff offered us the bar area even though several tables were not occupied.  They didn't seem to care whether we were there or not, and made us wait for several minutes at the hostess station.  Finally we just turned around and walked out.

Hoping they can improve things or someone else can come in and offer the upscale sushi experience Baxter Village sorely needs."}
{"text":"Not only did we have the pleasure to re-upholster akahanas chairs and barstools but we had the privilege to taste their amazing sushi and the food is great definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for sushi and a few glasses of vino.  Nicely renovated from the previous establishment in a good neighborhood.  

The sushi bar in the back had a neat waterfall wall behind it.  One thing I'm starting to notice is that most newer \"asian places\" are mixing Thai, Chinese, Hibachi and everything all under one roof.  I remember back in the old days you had to go to a specific restaurant for the type of asian cuisine.  Akahana fits the bill nicely as hey have all sorts of options to meet any craving (Pho, Thai dishes, and traditional Chinese).

The sushi selection was very nice and to my delight it was BOGO on the rolls so we filled up nicely.  They had one roll, and I can't remember the name that had seared steak on top it was one of the best rolls I've had in awhile.

Service was on par and helpful.  One thing I will say is that they have to work on the background music right.  Fort Mill is still not that \"hip\" and the older crowd, and even me didn't really want to hear AC/DC blasting You Shook Me All Night Long which is a great song, but not really appropriate while eating dinner in a nicer sit down place.  Plus it was very loud.

Nice place, I'll be back"}
{"text":"We went in at 11:30 and were promptly seated. The service was very friendly and quick with orders and requests. The food was great. I had soba and tempura shrimp, while my friend got BOGO sushi. My only issue was that a family with a child were seated RIGHT BEHIND us (chairs were literally inches apart) and she was a screamer. I try to understand kids will be kids, but the place was empty otherwise ... so maybe sit them a few tables away? I would definitely return, and just hope for a quieter experience next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese dishes.  The sashimi was very fresh and you can't beat the buy one get one free rolls.  My favorite dish is the Deluxe Fried Rice - chewy and flavorful Chinese sausage, succulent shrimp, tasty chicken and a bit of eggs in a bed of beautifully fried rice.  Go to Akahana and definitely order the fried rice!

The decor is modern and warm with outdoor seating on warm days.  It's a great place to eat with friends or family.  Also good for business lunches and dinners.  Prices are also reasonable.  Most dishes are in the low teens."}
{"text":"We go here a lot! I love Akahana in Baxter Village. We always start out with their house salad with their ginger dressing. It's great for big groups and we like to have birthdays here. They have a great atmosphere and lots of seating. You can sit in the formal dining area, the bar, or on the patio. 

We love their lettuce wraps and they always have buy one get one on the sushi rolls. I don't really like their spicy tuna rolls there and that makes me sad becuase thats my favorite kind. I recommend the charlotte roll and the bagel roll! 

Their noodle stir fry is really good too! 

They are not pricy at all either!"}
{"text":"Overall this is a great lunch spot. We started with theLettuce wraps - outstanding! Then took advantage of the buy one, get one rolls. The sushi was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Sarah Abouissa was our server. The sushi was great, the spicy edamame was also fantastic. But Sarah made the experience that much better with her knowledge of the menu, and making perfect recommendations. Definitely will be back but requesting Sarah from now on."}
{"text":"The service was good. The food was good. The ambience was good. The bathroom floor was dirty. The table was sticky."}
{"text":"We've ordered take-out from this place previously and have typically received good service and have been satisfied with our orders. We rarely dine in so I can't comment on the waitstaff. Last night, we picked up an order and once home, realized that half of our order was not included with our pick up. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know the situation, that we had paid for the full order and that we were on our way back. They agreed to complete the order and have it ready for us to pick up. Neither on the phone nor when we arrived, did we receive anything in the way of an apology for their error or our inconvenience (we live about 20 minutes away from the restaurant). No apology, no comp, no effort on their part at all to right their wrong. And to make matters worse, they filled the remaining order incorrectly. I understand human error and am typically forgiving of that as long as you OWN your screw up. There are too many other Asian restaurants around here to choose from to have to be treated so poorly."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi place I've been to in the fort mill area. They also have buy one get one free sushi deals everyday. The deal includes most rolls, not the normal cheap ones."}
{"text":"We went at 8:30pm on a Sunday night while visiting town (we are moving to the Charlotte for my husband's work) and we received exceptional service. Tiffany was our server and she was really helpful in pointing out all the things on the menu that were what I needed to eat. Being on a gluten-free diet (for Celiacs) and being pregnant meant I couldn't eat any raw fish or gluten (including tempura, regular soy sauce, and crab sticks). She pointed to some delicious sushi rolls on the menu that I could eat, recommended some substitutions, and gave us some gluten free soy sauce for the table! She even answered all our questions about Fort Mill and the Charlotte area and neighborhoods. A wonderful experience all around, we will definitely go back once we move to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We waited over 30 minutes for a table of 4, and even though half the tables were empty, they wouldn't seat us saying they were all reserved. As we waited I saw lots of employees standing around doing nothing, and most of the empty tables stayed empty for nearly an hour.

Management must have changed because this place used to always be packed... Now you can't get a table in a half empty restaurant. Makes no sense.

The food is not bad, but it is a little pricey. 1 appetizer, 2 adult entrees, 2 drinks and 2 kids meals cost us over $70. We don't pay that much anywhere else in Fort Mill.

Unfortunately it's the only Asian-fusion restaurant in the area, so there's not any other options. Once they get some competition I can't imagine them staying open unless they find a way to better manage the place."}
{"text":"Visiting my sister in-law in Fort Mills she wanted sushi so I referred to Yelp.  We went late, about 8 pm but the restaurant was fairly busy.    The service was prompt an courteous.  The menu pricing that other have  referred to are high until you see the BOGO pricing.   We started with Sashimi; he pieces were large and the tuna was cyrovac I suspect but it was good.   We ordered 6 rolls 4 to begin with and then 2 later.  They came in a respectable amount of time and all were very good.   All in all a good dinner and we will return the next time we are in Fort Mills."}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say I enjoyed it. The restaurant was clean and we were greeted and sat right away. They are offering buy one get one free sushi roll everyday and night right now. I don't know how long that's going to last. 

We got the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. I was surprised at how big it was. It had diced chicken with peppers and onions with some water chestnuts. Lettuce was crispy and refreshing. Chicken was flavorful and savory. 

I got the crunch roll and surf & turf roll. Crunch roll was good. Had crab and shrimp. Decent size. Surf & turf roll was also good. I love my steak medium rare and that's how it was. Shrimp inside with cucumber was good too.

I would definitely come back here again. Service was good too!"}
{"text":"This place used to be excellent in fort mill for sushi and good stir fry. Last four experienced have been awful, service and food quality. Sushi was very fishy (supposed to be sashimi grade tuna), service was poor all new wait staff. I would no longer recommend this place."}
{"text":"Well, let me first say that Baxter Village is such a cute spot for a date night or Saturday afternoon. This was my first time and it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the beef pad thai and it was one of the better ones we have had. The portions are quite large here so come hungry! I had the vegetable pho and I will be back to have more! It was more authentic than I was expecting for a non specific Vietnames place! It came with all the traditional pho fixings. I would highly recommend trying the pho.

Next time we go back, and I assure you, there will be a next time...I will be having sushi rolls as well (even though I know I will have leftovers). The sushi rolls are buy one get one free. How awesome! There were many other Asian dishes I have yet to try! 

The only reason I did not rate five stars was because the service was not top notch. They acted like they could care less that we were there or not."}
{"text":"Must try items: fried chicken, lettuce wrap, salmon bowl and spicy edamame! Very nice sushi place in fort mill!"}
{"text":"We came in around 9 didnt get our food until almost 1030. I can be understanding if its busy (i used to be a server) and we did have 8 people in our party but they were not even busy in our section was only 2 other tables and there were three sushi chefs on duty. I don't get why it took like an hr and half to receive any food. The food also was alright it wasn't amazing for how long we had to wait either. I'm guessing thats why it wasn't packed and it was a saturday night. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the server was really nice and the other time I went it was a more pleasant experience but to be honest because of this past weekend it will be awhile before I come back."}
{"text":"1st time at your establishment last night, and I left with much to be desired. The only highlight was our server. Mongolian beef dish was luke warm at best and sushi (surf &turf and Dragon Roll) very bland.  Worst of all was management,
I'd can only assume that he was inexperienced.
 We didn't want to sit outside because it was very windy and then after a 45 minute wait we were sat a table in front of an open door blowing in the wind we were trying to avoid. Asked server if they could close the door,  \"sorry my manager said no,\" she replied. So instead of waiting another 45 mins for a table we suffered through for a less than enjoyable dinner. I would say better luck next time, but that would mean I would be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm conflicted while writing this review. We eat here often and love the food. We ordered a spider roll but our sweet server thought we said spiral roll. When we asked to get it replaced he/she looked worried and ran to speak with a manager. He/she came back a few moments later and said it would be made right. We asked what that meant and he/she told us he/she would have to pay for that mistake bc the kitchen refuses to take back any food, especially if the server makes a mistake. Seriously?!?! We all make mistakes, and the kitchen should be understanding in these situations. Needless to say, the issue was fixed and we were sure to take good care of our dear server tip-wise for the kind deed done. A word of advice to the business, take care of and be nice to your servers or you won't have any and then you will shut down like all the other places that have been in the location!"}
{"text":"I've been to Akahana in Baxter village two times, and took my wife for the first time yesterday. This location is in Baxter village so parking can be a pain depending on what time of the day you go. Thankfully late Sunday afternoons aren't really crowded. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere inside but I can imagine it gets chaotic when it is busy. The service this time was much better and more attentive than the last time, which was almost non-existent on my previous trip. I ordered the chicken fried rice and my wife got the Mongolian beef. Both dishes were pretty good but it felt like there was more to be desired, maybe a bit more sauce on the beef, however with a little side of shrimp sauce the chicken fried rice was great. I'm not a big sushi eater but from what I understand this is one of the better places to get sushi in the Rock HIll / Fort Mill area and frequently has good deals. Overall it is a good restaurant and I recommend trying this place at least once before forming an opinion."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times since I work in the area, and it's honestly a hit or miss.  The sushi is always fresh and delicious, but the Pho...not so much.  The bagel roll and the chicken wings are the best things popping here, but the Pad-Thai looks and smells disgusting ( I did not try it since I was already turned off by the visual). The spring rolls, tempura shrimp, and spicy edamame are all good, but you can't really mess those up.  All in all, I eat here due to convenience, not because it's the best.  It can also get quite pricey.  BOGO sushi seems like a great deal until you realize that the price of a roll is upwards of $10-12.  Also, if you eat in, the service will be quite slow, regardless of how empty it may look."}
{"text":"This place is top of my list for quality sushi without driving all over God's creation trying to locate it. Yes their sushi is BOGO, and yes the price may be a little higher than most places for a maki sushi HOWEVER when you weight the quality of the roll and the rest of your experience in the price, it's gold. 

The Pho is amazing, the bun bowls are delicious. I just can't say it enough. Date night is a guaranteed Akahana night. 

(the bartender does a decent pour, too!)"}
{"text":"Watch your check! They will add charges on drinks that are not on the menu. Service is slow and no apologies made for the delay or any of the mistakes."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. Decent service even when busy. Bogo sushi rolls that aren't just decent but amazing!! My fav are the spiral ecstasy and Charlotte roll (or is it the hurricane).. I love trying something new and never get disappointed."}
{"text":"Spicy Edamame, Agedashi Tofu, Zen Rolls, and Massamum curry - all yumilicious. 

All rolls were Buy One Get One (BOGO) free, but they are over priced to begin with. For Zen Rolls were $12, which is pricy.

Service was pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"Always a go to for me and anyone I'm with. You can't beat the buy one get one sushi deal along with the rest of the great food here! I highly recommend to anyone !"}
{"text":"They always have bogo sushi, but their prices reflect the \"bogo\". $10 for a spicy tuna roll...especially when at every other place they run usually &4.50-$5. 

Even though their prices really make it so that it's not \"bogo\", their sushi is tasty. Every time I've gone, the fish has been fresh and their presentation in appealing. Also this akahana has a large outside seating area so you can enjoy the weather and people watch with some sushi."}
{"text":"Well I came in to pick up a call in order it was 11.99 so I give a 20 and I get 8 back in change. So I was shorted a penny no big deal right but when I asked about it the waitress said sorry we don't do change LOL WELL next time I will round my bill down to the even dollar cause next time I want do change LOL"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place in Baxter Village is on the \"Keeper\" list. Place is cool and cozy, feels modern and fresh. We ordered Mongolian Beef and I forgot what I had but everything was fresh and delicious. The portions are huge!! We should've split it! I brought the leftovers for lunch. People around us ordered Sushi and the rolls crazy  big portions! You buy one get one free. Service was good and very accommodating . Loved it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, and excellent prices! I had almost given up on finding a really good sushi restaurant since I moved here a couple of months ago, but not anymore! I will definitely be back! Marhysa was a great server and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the very first time and I loved it. Fresh and delicious Sushi rolls. I feel I could come back every day and enjoy the Sushi. The imported beers are great too. Buy one get one free deal for Sushi is worth it. I loved the Garden Roll and the Crab Tempura Cake Rolls the best. Please check this fun and exciting place out if you in Baxter. Ignore the negative reviews and come see for yourself that this place is great."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I was impressed with the ambiance of the place.  It was nicely decorated and there were plenty of open tables inside and out.  It was around 7pm on a Wednesday night.  I was with my boyfriend on a date night so I was hoping for a table alone but we were seated almost directly next to a father and son.  We ordered our appetizer and my boyfriend ordered sake.  The crab Rangoon appetizer was delicious and we became hungrier as the time went on.  We ordered our food; I wanted sushi and they always have a buy one, get one free special and my boyfriend, not a sushi eater, got the sesame chicken. 
After nearly an hour of waiting and watching people enter the restaurant and not leave it, we were becoming concerned about the wait time for our food.  My boyfriend's came out first (after about a 45 minute wait) and it WAS delicious.  He wanted to wait for me to get my sushi but I told him to go on because I didn't know how much longer it would be.  Almost a full twenty minutes more went by before we actually got our food.  We couldn't believe the wait!  I asked the waitress who was quite friendly if this was how it normally was and she said during the dinner rush, the sushi always gets behind.  This leads me to believe they need to hire another one or two sushi chefs because there's never a wait like that at other equally priced restaurants.
When my sushi DID finally arrive, it was good.  It was rolled tightly and tasted delicious (I had the volcano roll  and the spicy tuna).  However, both my boyfriend and I were turned off by the wait.  The waitress said coming after the lunch rush but before the dinner rush would be the best time so I encourage you to try to go then if you're going to go.  I love the buy one get one free roll experience but I hated the wait.  We will probably go again but at the exact right time."}
{"text":"Good sushi, laid back service and good buy one get one deal!  The crunch roll was a little stale in that the tempura flakes weren't very crunchy. Other than that good food, ok service and very nice location."}
{"text":"The food here is great...the service however is abhorrent!  The waiters and management alike is rude at best and they appear incapable of handling any large capacity of patrons.  As an example, I called attempting to place a to go order on Tuesday evening....attempting being the operative word here.  I was put on hold for 17 minutes and no one ever came back on the line so I kept calling back only to be put on hold again! When I finally was able to speak with someone, who in fact was the manager, I was told that the wait staff was so busy that they couldn't take to go orders!!!!  
I find this establishment to be ran in a woefully inefficient manner and as such, will not be returning until they get their act together."}
{"text":"I've been here twice... The first time, I sat at the bar and the second, I got my food to go... Both times I got the same thing because it was so good! lol

I'm a sucker for some edamame and the spicy edamame here is delicious! It's not super spicy, but it's got a nice little kick to it... The sauce is just the right balance of sweet so it doesn't go overboard and the salt is a perfect compliment. I've heard their sushi isn't bad, but I haven't tried it yet.

The service has been great on both occasions. The bartenders were attentive, courteous and fun. They were quick with refills when I stayed and when I took it to go, I received silverware, napkins and an extra container to put the shells in. Nothing worse than nowhere to put your discards! They even offered me a cup of water to go as I waited. I appreciate that. Next time I'm in the area, it's on at Akahana!"}
{"text":"I've eaten sushi here a few times, and told myself not to come back the last few times.

There are always bits of other sushi on my sushi, those little orange fish eggs are on everything, but not because they were meant to be. It's as if they don't care to clean enough to make sure each roll is perfect, the way sushi is meant to be."}
{"text":"Akahana has the best sushi ever! The volcano roll here is my favorite volcano roll period! So delicious! Staff is very friendly, atmosphere is very nice, clean and I always have a great experience while here!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the food is okay. Tonight we were seated looking directly into the kitchen. We placed our order and I told the waitress I wanted the beef extra well done. In the meantime, I watched the woman in the kitchen put gloss on her lips with her finger and then went on cooking and touching the food without washing her hands. The man in the kitchen was touching his face. It was disgusting. Then, the food came out and my beef was red in the middle and raw. Absolutely disgusting. And the icing was the woman must have been told that I complained about her because she stared me down the rest of the evening. Do not eat here!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Took a party of 16, and everyone had a great meal. Wide variety of sushi selection.  Service was spot on and excellent."}
{"text":"The sushi was ok, the drinks pretty good, prices were okay and in general I would think 3 stars for a restaurant like this. That's factoring in sub-par service. For exceptional service a 4 for sure. But the service was just so bad. We did have a party of 7, but it was not busy. I never got a soup I ordered, the waitress argued with a member of my party about an incorrect entree coming out, she was obviously highly irritated with us the whole meal. She was asked by another lady if they had virgin drinks from the bar and she cattily replied they had juice. The manager seemed to be apologetic about the service but in the same breath excusing her a bit because she had personal issues going on. He really didn't go out of his way to improve our current dinning experience just promised a better one next time around. She sure as heck tacked on her 18% tip too (policy for a group over 6), so I guess it didn't matter to her what we thought about the service. If I'm in the area again I might give it another shot but I never want to bring a big group here ever again."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and this sushi was really good. Even better, when we went for lunch it was BOGO on sushi rolls...we definitely took advantage of that! The downside is that even with that special the rolls are still on the expensive side. Our waiter was very nice, but he was almost too helpful. He came over to the table to check on us a lot. I appreciated his desire to make sure we were happy, but in my opinion he was too involved (if both of our glasses of water are full, chances are we don't need more water).  If asked to go back again, I would. But I wouldn't make a special trip there."}
{"text":"Wait staff was good and attentive. They get a star  

The wasabi was way too mild, you can smear it on like avocado  and not shed a tear . I want to be able to put a pea size amount in a piece and have my alarm  bell  rung. There was no opening of the sinuses. 

Wanted to try Buda beer but they were out. No biggie. Sushi  was edible but not exceptional. The bogo free deal on sushi rolls was excellent, but I felt that the quality suffers. 

Calamari  is excellent and the edamame was perfect. My friends enjoyed the seafood pot  and they shared."}
{"text":"I follow this place on social media for specials so today they posted a new shipment of Uni and Fatty Tuna just in, so we went.  It was amazing!  Super fresh...super creamy and well prepared!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. But the waitress was a disaster. We ordered appetizers and the dinner special which included soup and salad. The appetizer arrived and a minute so did our entree. We asked about our soup and salad and the waitress said she would bring it right out. When we reminded her that the soup and salad should come after the entree she was at a complete loss about what to do. So we told her to forget about the soup and salad and take it off our bill. They reduced the bill for $3.48! The poor kid had no training and failed to follow up or apologize for the screw up. Other than that the good here is decent. Just make sure you get a seasoned wait person!"}
{"text":"Food is fine. Service is bad. Prices are not good. Manager rude and inconsiderate. 
Place is packed, food is slow to come and not near enough servers. Caution, watch the beer prices. You order a beer based on the price in the menu and they serve you the \"pint\" size which costs a dollar more. Not on the menu that way, but that's what you get. Can you say \"rip off\"?? Well, at least an attempted ripoff! 
Overall a bad experience. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and this time really SUCKED.
Arrived with several tables open and was told we (party of 3) we could not set there.
After standing about 20 minutes they then placed us at that same table.
I voiced my concerns to the so called MANAGER the only response I received was \"so, and \".
Service was slow but responsive.
Will NOT BE BACK ANYTIME SOON !!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place around for sushi. Awesome food, good prices and the staff is awesome. Plus you can't beat the buy one get one free on sushi rolls everyday. Plus for happy hour Alycia and Reese are a lot of fun."}
{"text":"First time here in Akahana, and I must say that the quality of the food is second to none in the area. I love sushi and have tried most authentic sushi restaurants in Charlotte area. The quality of fish here is one of the best. We will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"I was staying in town for one night. The guy working at the front desk at my hotel said this was a fantastic sushi place. I ordered the calamari (it sounded delish) it was WAY over cooked and needed salt and pepper. (The sauce that came with it was very good)

I ordered two sushi rolls. (I tend to order semi/cooked rolls at places I am not familiar with) one roll was tuna and the entire roll was flash fried. The roll was just bland. It tasted like I was eating flour. Don't get me wrong it was flash fried to perfection, it just had zero taste. And the tuna and veggies inside were mediocre. 

Same goes for my second roll. It was a tempura shrimp, wrapped in rice and topped with raw tuna and crab salad. The didn't look like tuna  and again the roll had zero flavor which it had a ton of ingredients. 

I really wanted to love this place because the things I ordered sounded amazing on the menu. But it was disappointing."}
{"text":"So, we waited 2 hours for our sushi and instead of a discount for us patiently waiting they decided to add 18% gratuity!  Um wth!! They didn't even split our bill correctly and it was 2 checks. Very unprofessional & will never return! Management did not do anything to resolve the situation."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here the sushi was decent, but the server wasn't very friendly. My two other girlfriends and I ordered different martinis and when the server brought them to the table we assumed he put ours down to who ordered what. After a couple sips we realized he mixed up two of our drinks. I had already drank half of the martini he put infront of me so we just requested he make us a new one since he messed up. Then I was charged for both martinis when he messed up by putting the wrong one infront of me!! Then he added an automatic gratuity since there was 6 of us, which I would have been fine paying if I wasn't charged for a martini I didn't order. Overall the service was slow too. 

Second time trying this place I went with just my husband. It took 15 minutes for our server to come over, after the hostess brought us drinks because our server was \"busy\" although the restaurant was half empty atleast. The server was not friendly and literally walked up and said \"y'all ready to order\" no apology for being slow or no introduction or anything. Slow service and server acted like she could care less about us, and unfortunately two of our 4 sushi rolls were not even good at all. Usually my husband and I never leave sushi behind but it was so disappointing we left probably 10 pieces. Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"I keep coming here because its in my neighborhood. The service is hit or miss but the sushi is fine, I think that's all we ever get. For the limited restaurants in Ft Mill you could do worse I guess."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing lunch. The sushi is usually good but this time the rice was mushy, the fish was not fresh and the presentation was awful. The avocado did not look appetizing. 

Management, please get rid of that awful stench."}
{"text":"Some of the best Pho we've had!
Excited to have something in the local area like this."}
{"text":"Wait was very long considering there were only four to five tables taken in the whole restaurant. Our waitress took our order incorrectly and ended up charging us for a similarly-named, more expensive roll and when we pointed it out to her the first time she claimed the \"Alaskan Dynamite\" roll was the only \"Alaska\" roll on the menu...which isn't true. When I confronted her about it again, she claimed she made the mistake but refused to fix the charge because \"the Alaskan Dynamite roll is the one we ate.\" I really hope they aren't overcharging customers every time they make mistakes! Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Charlotte, and great prices also! We love the buy one, get one free sushi rolls. This is our go to date night spot. We never have to wait for a table, and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"This place has a great deal on sushi; buy one get one free on their great selection of rolls during lunch.

Great quality, great selection and price.

Me & Ben went here for lunch on a Monday and the place as not crowded at all.
Good service and nice dining room."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy where do i start? Well me and my significant other were out searching for some places to eat around our location and we so happen to stop in here.Worst mistake ever! FIrst i do want to start by saying our waitress by all means was the best and very helpful but the food was terrible. I had the pineapple shrimp rice it actually was pretty good aside the fact that it was barely hot, my boyfriend had the mongolian beef dinner the meat tasted  horrible i thought at first he was over exaggerating but nope not only was it not hot or warm was not good to taste at all and funny flavor.He expressed to our waitress he didnt want it or anything else not one time did the manager on duty come out and ask what was the problem? Is it anything else he could do to make him happy? Nothing at all. Today is 9/27/17 on a wendsday and we were there at 8ish untll close to closeing . Far as my drink that was okay you could taste the basil in the drink and a tad bit watered down. I would never patron this business again even if someone paid me. Visit at your own risk."}
