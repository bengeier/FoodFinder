{"text":"Personally, I think the food was pretty bad: bland and bad texture, etc., and not cheap. I would never go back there. My friend had the same opinion in spite of insisting that \"they [Mexican restaurants] are all the same.\" Definitely go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The new owner is eager to please.  If you are not satisfied with something he will do it again to make it right.  Just ask.  The  fajita quesadilla here is excellent."}
{"text":"The food was good and the servers were nice but it was extremely slow and they actually forgot to send the order in once we placed it.  They made up for it by giving us complimentary margaritas but we were very hungry.  Either way, I would still go back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun, inviting, unique and originally gave off a positive impression for the place. However, both the food and drink are overpriced. The service is self serve/order from counter first, but there are no signs indicating that. The food from the food truck was priced slightly higher compared to El Cabalito, the adjacent restaurant you walk through to get to the patio. Example/ Guacamole and Chips at El Patio is $9.73 compared to inside at $9.50. 

Margarita and guacome + chips were good.

The Verdita Slushie is is described as Trombone Blanco, mango, pineapple, jalapeño. The drink came in an old fashioned size glass and cost. $11.50 (really not worth it.) You could barely taste the pineapple or mango. I went back to bar to ask if I was given the wrong drink because it is green and I can't taste the mango or pineapple. I was told it really wasn't a fruit based drink, then why list them as the 2nd and 3rd ingredient? Really, it tasted like a tart, mild jalapeños Slushie. I understand it's green in colour because it's called Verdita but don't list fruit in the description if it's not going to be part of the taste, or not even a hint."}
{"text":"Came in one evening with my family. Was greeted nicely, immediately was able to get a table. Server was friendly. The food was very good. I got basic steak tacos and they were good. Decently priced. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The good: The horchata and margaritas were very tasty, the service was attentive and friendly

The bad: The food, it was just not very good and a little strange.  I was immediately suspicious when my vegetarian combo arrived on the table about 30 seconds after I ordered it. The sauce on my bean burrito tasted a lot like marinara.  It was comparable to eating a pizza wrap with refried beans.  Everything else on the plate was mediocre.

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you like Tex Mex the food here will do the trick. Nothing fancy or adventurous, but the standard fare the way you'd expect it. Good  salsa. Everyone was friendly and prompt. I'm happy and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We've been VERY desperate for good Mexican food ever since Mas Amigos/Don Juan's closed.  Just learned about El Patio a couple of weeks ago, and we were eager to try it in the hopes that finally there might be a place where we would be excited about the Mexican food. Because I am a native Texan, this is a lot more important to me than to most in this area.

Alas. Suffice it to say that, not only did I not finish my cheese enchiladas (I did finish the taco), I didn't even bother to take the considerable leftovers home with me. Not very tasty. The same was true of the guacamole as well as the \"spicy\" salsa that they bring out only to those who request it (it was NOT very spicy). Just not a lot of taste anywhere on the table. WHY, O WHY  did the new proprietor of Mas Amigos/Don Juan's run it into the ground?

One positive thing I can say is that, unlike nearly every Mexican restaurant we've visited, this one did NOT have a television, and to us that's a very good thing.

I also should say that the wait staff were very pleasant and helpful. Kudos to them."}
{"text":"Our first time there was our last time. My husband and I actually ended up ordering the same thing, the taco/burrito combination plate. We should've known something was up when our food came out extremely fast. The meat had no flavor whatsoever, the salsa was sub par in comparison to other Mexican restaurants in town and it was overpriced. We figured it was a new place and to give it a shot, but never again."}
{"text":"Service was good. That's about it.

If you have epilepsy, avoid this place at all costs. The lights flicker. I had to move near a window to avoid it.

As someone from Arizona, I've had good Mexican food, and el patio is definitely NOT good. 

My rice and beans came before my fish tacos. Beans tasted fishy. Fish tacos are soggy like a mop (these are not Baja style fish tacos!). 

If u have to eat here, make sure you down some tequila shots before you eat. The food will not taste good sober."}
{"text":"Over priced food truck. If you sit outside you serve yourself essential but the set up is cute. The menu is very small and extremely over priced. Will never return. $54 for 3 tacos and 2 margaritas"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced in the city.  

Came to sit on the patio for some truck tacos and coronas but it got really windy so decided to move indoor to their connecting restaurant El Caballito Tequila Bar.  After a long wait for the food to arrive, my boyfriend went back to El Patio to inquire, where the server was confused and said she must've forgotten about it - thanks Captain Obvious!  To make matters worse the bartender blamed him for trying to 'dine and dash' which made no sense since you need to eat to 'dine' and and the restaurant can't be holding your ID and a creditcard if you're going to 'dash'.   *Head shake*  Zero stars for service.

The tacos weren't bad once they arrived.  Some comments I would make are that it's a tad small for the price - it is about $5 per taco depending on which you choose, and the shell should be doubled up since it gets soggy real fast. 

The assistant manager came to see us after we ate to offer complimentary tacos for the incident but we were really disappointed with the entire experience at that point and wanted to leave that we actually turned down free food.    

Needless to say I would never return and never recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"Good example of a cute idea gone wrong. The concept sounds good with the food truck. But it is horribly expensive and very limited menu. We ordered the 6 taco special, the taco's arrived late and soggy. We almost sent them back but we didn't have time. We had a show to catch. We wanted to try an assortment of tacos but they have a rule, they all have to be the same. That's boring and what a missed opportunity for a guest to try an assortment. This place has a lot of issues to work out. No fun, not fulfilling and overpriced is the best I can say. The noise level it too high, can't really talk. Looking for a fun good time? Not here... I would not return"}
{"text":"They need a structured line on busy days. It's a free for all to get in. People interrupting other tables asking if they are leaving soon. Tacos are ok, chips and quac are really good."}
{"text":"I've been here with friends four times now, and I feel I can write a review. My review is decidedly mixed. In some ways El Patio has excellent Mexican and Mexican inspired food, but in other ways its food disappoints.  Also of note, new ownership begins this week (first week of November, 2015, so both the good and the bad may be subject to change).

On each visit we were seated or told to seat ourselves quickly. Little to no waiting. The place is nice, well lit, and clean. Service was excellent each visit as well, with menus, water, chips with salsa, and drink orders all quickly tended to. The menu is relatively extensive with lots of alternatives, many that are not available or at least are hard to find in Champaign-Urbana.  

I've had four different meals and my experience was the same each time.  

THE GOOD: the main dishes were excellent.  Flavorful and hot, always very tasty.  I've had the ceveche, the burrito, the chile verde, and tacos.  The only one I'd critique was the ceveche. Though delicious, I am not used ceveche as seafood first cooked then marinated in lime juice. Typically the \"cooking\" is done by the marinade, but some of the fish ingredients were clearly cooked first.  That said, even the ceveche was good and flavorful, and I'd consider having it again after I finish working my way through other interesting items on the menu.

The drinks I ordered also fall into the GOOD category.  I am not a fan of the newer style of sweet, frozen concoctions with classic names.  I like my margarita made of lime juice, a good tequila, and triple sec. A lime slice and salt on the rim is fine, but I don't want it frozen.  I want my martini made of quality gin and vermouth.  I don't want either frozen or tasting more like a jolly rancher candy than a cocktail.  And the drinks I had at El Patio did not disappoint.  They used high quality liquors (at least for these drinks) mixed in appropriate proportions (leading me to believe the bartender knew what he was doing), they were served at the appropriate temperatures, and they were reasonably priced.  El Patio does have plenty of fruffy drinks as well, so it's your choice. My compatriots liked their frozen margaritas and appletinis, so we all were happy.

THE BAD:  My complaints about El Patio are mostly about the items that accompany the main dish. The chips and salsa were OK. The chips are not exceptional and don't taste like they were freshly made. They were a little salty to my taste, and they were room temperature. I could not tell if they had been made a lot earlier in the day or if they were from a bag. However, my first real complaint foreshadows the next ones: the salsa is ice cold. Left until the end of the meal it had warmed some and by then had become tasty enough, but served ice cold it had little flavor.  Basically, anything with (hopefully fresh) tomatoes should be served at room temperature as tomatoes lose flavor when cold. You'd think a Mexican restaurant would know this!  Also, I'm guessing they do not make their own salsa; why would it be so cold if they did?

My second complaint was basically the same about the salad and guacamole. Both the guacamole (dip) and the guacamole on the salad were ice cold. This seemed weird to us, especially in the salad. A nice warm entree, warm beans and rice, and relatively warm lettuce and tomato in the salad did not seem to pair well with icy guacamole on top of the lettuce.  Again, it was tasty enough, but it improves if you let it warm up for about twenty or thirty minutes before eating it.

The beans and rice are a middle ground. They were fine. Nothing exceptional about them but nothing wrong with them.

And finally, this store keeps unusual hours. It opens for lunch and then closes until 5pm when it reopens for dinner, making it impossible for those wanting an early lunch, a bite with friends on the way home from work, etc.  I was told the hours will be changing under the new owners, probably staying open all day, but the waitress wasn't yet certain what the hours would be.

Please forgive the length of this review. I thought I should explain my three-star review as being four stars for the main dish and drinks, two stars for the accompaniments, especially the salsa and guacamole. I look forward to trying other menu items (assuming the menu is not changed by the new owner) and hope for improvements in the side dishes as in general I rather like this place."}
{"text":"After a Jays game we were looking for a late night taco shop that was walking distant within the financial district. We were recommended to go to  El Caballito as the closest one at King and Wellington right across the Roy Thompson Hall. Apparently it has a \"sick patio\"

So we walk into this gigantic well lit restaurant playing some groovy tunes and low lighting and asked for the patio. After a winding path that takes you upstairs we end up in \"El Patio\"

The concept is pretty cool. A bar, a food-truck and a few wooden booths in one end and a bunch of tables in between. You have to order your food at the bar and are given a number. The food is prepared in the food truck and brought to you by a server- so I guess I understand why they have their own name, social media page and all. As it is sort of its own entity that is attached to the larger restaurant. When I went on a Tuesday. Taco's were $3.50 each. I got the extra hot sauce. It had a serious kick to it. Some of the taco's like brisket had a little southern styled bbq taste to it. Which was somewhat interesting for a taco joint. I liked that they heated the taco shells so over time there would be some crunch to them.

I did enjoy myself and might return. However the food did not have the same WOW factor as grand electric. Not disappointed- but maybe i just have high standards. 

P.S- Checked in with Yelp and there was an offer for a free Margarita if I order over $25 worth of food. EASY!"}
{"text":"Hidden food truck in the heart of Toronto that serves up your basic Tex mex foods as well as an accompanying bar. The environment is very hipster but very small (don't come with a large group since seating is limited). The food and drinks are pricey for the quality of food served. The tacos were nothing to write home about as well as the margarita was just basic, coming out of the tap. Don't recommend coming here for dinner but definitely could be a place to stop off at to get some quick drinks!"}
{"text":"Very uninspired meal here.  With so many superior choices in town for Mexican, I can't ever see myself going back."}
{"text":"One of the best  Taco spots  I've been able to find since moving to the Midwest from LA"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places, great mexican food with a large menu and quick service. Great chips, burritos, and enchiladas."}
{"text":"Although the patio is really unique and a great place to hang I wouldn't recommend this place 
1. Tacos are expensive for what you get ($18 for 3)
2.  They need to train their staff better on customer service. Rather than standing around and chatting, they need to focus on basic customer needs. Like providing plates and napkins when served. 

Felt no guilt on leaving 0 tip on the bill."}
{"text":"I found this place by random one night when I was scrolling Yelp to find a new place to try. It's a fairly small spot but nicely laid out. Chips and salsa were very tasty! Got a side of queso for the chips and it had a little spiciness to it which was just right! I ordered the chicken flautas and if I remember correctly they came with some guacamole in the middle of the plate as well as cheese drizzled over them. They were very crunchy which was a huge plus for me. My girlfriend got a steak chimichanga which she thought was pretty good, I tried and can agree it was pretty good. The bill for both of us was maybe $22? so pretty cheap as well, worth checking out. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really cute patio set up. Good for friends gathering together. Really loud with music so maybe not the best place to take a date.

Drinks and food are self serve. One food truck to place taco orders. One bar area to place drinks. Tables are seat yourself and communal. No servers/service, only people to take away your finished drinks and plates. 

You can order tacos individually or $25/30 for six. All have to be the same kind. Had the baked fish tacos and they were nothing special. Really messy to eat if you're sharing with friends because they don't offer plates and you have to get your own napkins from the bar (not available at table). 

They offered buckets of corona five for $25 I believe. Also had premixed margaritas that the bartender will gladly tell you what's in them. Bar was a bit slow. Drinks were a bit watered down. At one point the bartender lost her bottle opener in the bathroom so only one other bartender was available. 

Patio has a great ambiance. Loved the lights hanging, made it feel very cosy. The music on Friday was amazing! A mix of old school jams and current hip hop.

Overall, would come back here just for their patio and beer with friends :)"}
{"text":"I am actually stunned by how much better this place was than I had anticipated. Maize is still my favorite place in town but much preferred for pick up and go since it's so tiny. El Patio on the other hand was incredibly quick, staff was welcoming, and there was zero wait on a (very cold) Saturday night in January. The food tasted great, arrived quickly, and there was a LOT of it. I had the Santa Ana and it was delightful. My fiancé had something very meaty (I don't think it was carne asada but I think it was similar) that he requested the homemade corn tortillas with and it was also delicious. Salsa was great and chips were fresh and warm. The margarita my fiancé ordered for us to split was fine also - I don't like tequila or margaritas especially much BUT it was much more drinkable than many others I've had (not overwhelmingly sweet nor tequila burning a hole in your esophagus). We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"If you want fish tacos, go to Huaraches Moroleon in Urbana! They have more fish in their visually appealing/ better tasting tacos. Plus they don't serve rice and beans beforehand and say here are your tacos.  Speaking of beans, I thought they had a strange taste. ( I was comparing to Huaraches) I had my husband try them and he immediately said they were from the can! Such an awful taste! He is from MX and definitely would know! On a good note he was pleased w his ceviche! ( that was actually appealing and was a big helping)! In spite of my so so 1st impression, I did enjoy my horchata very much in the tall mug and it had a great taste. I also took my tacos to go anyway since they still tasted ok and I don't like wasting . Not impressed w the girl at the checkout who immediately asked my husband where he worked! Do all your employees ask the customers this? Apparently her boyfriend recognized him from his last job that he got fired from and my husband just happened to be the one that gave him the 'good news'!  My husband knew all along what was going on even before we got out of our seats. I won't go into all the extra details of observations and conversation, but this employee was definitely unprofessional."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 STARS b/c there is a kinda cool laid back vibe to this place.  We sat by the outside patio (entrance by Pearl St).  The food truck is parked there, the bar is there as well.  You order at the bar (food/drinks) and either pay on the spot or open a tab.

We got the 3 tacos for $15 (one pork, one chicken and one spicy shrimp).  I only tried the chicken and the shrimp.  They were good, but a little too expensive..but then again the area is expensive anyways.   

Check in on Yelp and get a free margarita with a order of $25 or more :)"}
{"text":"Super cool vibe. Went over the summer but just getting around to posting my review now (I believe it's closed over the winter).

Tacos, beers, and margaritas served out of a shipping container, with communal outdoor seating and string lights. 

Come for the vibe, stay for the food and drinks. It's great for groups, and a cool place to chill while waiting for a table at Pai or before heading to a bar."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, tacos were small and soggy. Seat yourself. Probably wouldn't go again, but the ambiance was nice for a downtown patio."}
{"text":"Just had an early dinner. My Pollo Asado was excellent.  Tender chicken and not overly flavored.  Very nice rice and beans with a tasty salad.  

My wife also loved her to Ramiro Special (Shrimp). 

We'll definitely eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find! The chori pollo was incredible, and homemade corn tortillas were awesome!  Staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Okay first off,  I would just like to say that El Patio is 100 times better than El Toro in my opinion. The servers are very friendly... You get free chips with salsa with your order and the salsa is so fresh and delicious. I usually order chicken tacos or the fajita quesadilla and it always tastes so fresh and flavorful. Definitely recommend this place for people looking for a yummy Mexican restaurant on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place recently opened and my friends and I were hungry after spending some much needed time at the pool. Everyone was super friendly and the menu is extensive. 

I got enchiladas with rice and the sauce and the queso fresco was literally freshly shaved onto my dish. The margaritas were strong. I highly recommend this place. The chips and salsa was good too. 

Excellent service, pricing, and ambiance. Great for kids and families. There's outdoor seating and it was very busy when we went."}
{"text":"Service was terrific and fast. The food was tasty and salsas were delicious. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Checked this new place out on Sunday and I can say it is a solid entry in Champaign Urbana Mexican food. I think it is similar in flavor to El Toro. My only complaint is that it seems to be just a bit pricier than similar restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very Good and friendly service.  This is the same owner as La Fiesta that was located in Urbana.  You can't go wrong there because La Fiesta was awesome, just poorly located.  The menu is huge and there is lots to choose from.  Although it is a bit pricier than El Toro, it's freshly prepared and has a more intimate setting in the dining area.  I will be going back often because it's close to home and WAY better than El Toro.   It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and spacious, I felt comfortable in the restaurant. Service was excellent. The portions are generous, however the the food is not flavorful. I had carne asada, rice and bears. I didn't feel like anything was seasoned, and I did not find myself wanting to take another bite which is very usual for me and Mexican food. 

The place is ok if you're very hungry and you like bland food. Personally, I'd rather wait in line at Maize."}
{"text":"Hands down the best mexican food in town!! Fresh vegetables and seafood. Great service. Seems to be family owned. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on cinco de mayo. Didn't have their liquor license due to new owners I guess. Disappointing. Salsa and chips were good. Enchiladas tacos tamales and burrito were just so so. Little bland for me. Wished it had been better as in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last two weeks. It was a great find, thanks to Yelp! They have specials every day of the week including weekends! Yesterday, I came with a few friends and ordered a pitcher which easily poured 6 12oz margaritas. Both times, I went with the 3 tacos ala carte - one chicken, one steak, & one chorizo. The meat is really well prepared. The steak is probably my favorite when it came to flavor. Beware, the chorizo is pretty greasy! My only complaint about the tacos is they're very custom (which for some, is a good thing). They ask what you want on your tacos when you order so, if you're like me and ridiculously non-picky and just want to try everything, this question is kind of annoying. I mean, I just want it all! Also, their tacos are served in flour tortillas by default. They do have corn tortillas but I keep forgetting to ask about them."}
{"text":"The food I had was good the portions were decent service was extremely slow since there was only six other people in the restaurant at the time and a little bit high priced for what we got El Toro still has better food and so does maize restaurants"}
{"text":"I found this little gem in village at the crossing and have returned twice now. The staff is more than friendly and they make both mole sauce and al pastor. 

There are a couple of tables out front and plenty of seating indoors. My lunch partner was quieter than I have ever seen and nary a speck food remained on his plate. We both enjoyed it greatly and will return!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good authentic Mexican food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Very cozy an welcoming as you walk in, and all of the food is awesome.  I prefer it to El Toro and Dos, the home made corn tortillas make a world of difference.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated 3 stars. It's a great patio to go to after work. It's super lively, and decorated with pretty strings of light! The chips and guacamole have a nice twist: it's half regular chips and half taro chips!  I also tried the mojito, which was nice. Kind of pricey, but normal for this area."}
{"text":"Went to El Patio with a couple of Mexican friends, we tried their grilled corn which is smothered in a creamy sauce, cheese and chili powder, it was delicious! My friends said it took them back to Mexico.

It is a different, fun, spicy ambiance, sort of like sit yourself, get your own food and drinks, and share a table with strangers type of thing, so it might not be for everybody, but for me I had a fun time.

It's great for getting a bucket of Coronas and snacking on Mexican treats."}
{"text":"If you go to a party and are given a card that gives you free guac for three months, you are going to return... a lot. El Patio, you are marketing geniuses. You got me!

I love this space. It's like a little secret hidden amongst the skyscrapers, and it happens to be fueled by tequila and a delicious taco truck. What's not to love? 

Full disclosure: I planned an event with these folks, but I've also been twice as a paying customer, and I really wanted to share my authentic, fab experiences."}
{"text":"I love the typical Mexican lunch or dinner at El Toro in CU, but sometimes it gets boring.  Glad I tried this new place.  Every bit as good, super friendly, and amazingly good queso."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at El Patio, usually one or two meals a week. This is a family-run restaurant, and the family takes very good care of us. They have ice cold bottles of Victoria, the absolute best beer Mexico has to offer. My wife can testify to the deliciousness of the margaritas. My recommendation is that you order from the supplemental menu that offers Gorditas, Tortas, and Tacos, which are made with their made-from-scratch tortillas. I typically eat a couple Gorditas, one with pastor and one with lengua or chorizo."}
