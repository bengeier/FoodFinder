{"text":"I am sad to report that this place has really gone downhill over the last few years.  I used to enjoy going there, and the food was completely acceptable.  I'm not sure if it is new ownership, or if they are short on money, but the food lately has been awful.  The egg and shrimp rolls are the only thing which is edible.  I had the curry chicken today.  It consisted of 99% onions and then some chunks of a white, watery, tasteless substance which was supposed to be the chicken.  Absolutely terrible.  I ate a few bites and gave up.  My wife had chicken with Chinese vegetables.  It was basically the same, 99% celery and then this mystery chicken.  My son had sweet and sour chicken, and he didn't finish his meal, which is very telling.  He said the chicken tasted funny and the breading as weird.  All in all, it was a waste of 19 dollars.  We just had some sandwiches to fill us up and the food went in the disposal.  Oh, did I mention that the fortune cookies were stale?"}
{"text":"I love this place and order from them very often. It's typical Americanized Chinese food but the food is very tasty and made promptly. I love the chicken and broccoli, shrimp egg rolls, steamed dumplings, and crab rangoon, in particular. I never eat in (there's a few tables), so I always pick up or get delivery. For pick up, my order is made quickly after I call; for delivery, it takes 45-60 mins. They have never once messed up on my order. Definitely check out this place if you're looking for some delicious Chinese take out."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good, great staff.  Quick and generous portions.  The pot stickers are always part of our order,  mmmmm."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in white oak. General tsao, vegetables, and white rice is my favorite combo from there. They also have an excellent buffet."}
{"text":"This place has decent food for moderate prices. Small casual dining area. Average over all experience"}
{"text":"Always get our take out from China House.  We enjoy the Moo Shu Pork and Mongolian Beef often."}
{"text":"cheap price, great take outs. You can sit in as well, but we are in hurry so we get take outs. try their orange chicken or general tsaos beef. for the price in this neigborhood, you can't beat it. very nice owners. as someone else says \"This is the kind of place you want to give your business to, to make sure they stick around.  Food is excellent, and owners are hard working and friendly\""}
{"text":"Great food and awesome staff. I love their shrimp lo mein. You get a large portion for a small price."}
{"text":"New York-style Chinese takeout. [The owners moved here from Brooklyn, NY]. No frills Chinese takeout (or dine in) that is much better than anything else in the area. Relatively cheap and very friendly."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant.  I've been coming here for about a year, and I've had very good results every time.  Every item that I've ordered was tasty.  They are very prompt to make your order, and are very accommodating.  If you're looking at other Chinese restaurants in the area, look no further.  Trust me, I've tried many, including other ethnic foods.  The prices are very good (around $5) for the lunch special (you get a can of soda with it), and essentially around $6-7 outside the lunch special.  The amount of food you get is plentiful, and will last you more than 1 meal."}
{"text":"Best in the city. The food is fantastic, and the owners are great people."}
{"text":"Ordered Kung Pao Chicken and 1 hour later i am still looking for the chicken. the chicken portion was very small pieces and hard to find. Big pieces of filler such as celery and green peppers. Kung Pao Chicken should be spicy, but this was not. I would not order from them again."}
{"text":"Best chinese in the city! Been coming here for years when it was the only chinese in Bloomfield, best general tso chicken hands down"}
{"text":"As a fan of oriental food I have had the pleasure to experience a variety of different hosts, food and service.  My immediate impression of China House captured me as a place of pride and presentation in food, service and atmosphere. It's location serves us well for the White Oak area and plan on frequenting the restaurant for dining in and take-out."}
{"text":"I think another reviewer accurately reviewed the location as blech....  In comparison to other places, the food was rather bland. I ordered the General Tso's combination platter, and none of the flavors \"popped\". It didn't feel all that fresh either. The chicken tasted like it might have been fried, and then fried again. The egg roll was bland as well. That went in the trash immediately.   Also, when I went into the restaurant, it didn't seem like the cleanest of places - a woman had one one glove and was putting food into those little bags, then taking people's money and credit cards without removing the glove. When she went back to preparing food, she never changed her glove. Gross!  Needless to say, I didn't finish. I didn't save it either - it all went in the trash.  I won't be going back. If I recall, there is MUCH better Chinese up Lakeshore, near the Collinwood rec."}
{"text":"Good prices for good food! Nice people..Love this place! Some of the best general tsos I have eaten!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese fast food I have ever had!!! Fresh fast and delicious! Had the General Tso's chicken and can't wait to try more on their menu."}
{"text":"For a buffet,  the food was excellent.  Was excellent In any manor actually. The only problem I saw was that they did not have that much of a selection.  But what I would like to emphasize is what they did have was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you want to give your business to, to make sure they stick around.  Food is excellent, and owners are hard working and friendly.  They aim to please and are always willing to handle special requests.    I'd give it 4.5 if I could."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gotten takeout from here for years and  I've always thought it was just normal  standard Chinese take-out.  We have always gotten the General Tso's chicken, Fried Rice, Eggrolls, and Teriyaki Beef Sticks.  Those items are fine.  Not by any means fancy, but not the chinese takeout grade that is overly greasy tasting.  Tonight, I decided to be adventurous and get the Chicken Chow Mein.  I uploaded a picture because it was laughable.  Seriously all onions and celery with inedible chicken strips that I thought were spatzel even after eating a strip.  I tried to call to get my money back, but the phone  said it was disconnected.  Not sure what is going on there."}
{"text":"Decided to try this out vs the other local Chinese places. I was weary of the bad reviews but the newest ones were pretty good so I thought I would give it a shot. My mistake! I ordered the sweet-and-sour chicken combination plate. The sweet-and-sour sauce was more like water, the \"pork\" fried rice had no pork in it whatsoever. The fried dumplings looks like they were boiled. The eggroll was soggy. Everything was tasteless. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"My lunch was without question the worst Chinese food I've ever tasted. The General Tsos was oddly tangy and peppery, not spicy in the right way. The spring role also had and old, moldy taste to it. The fried wontons were dried out and over fried. I will never, ever order from here again. Absolutely terrible, so bad in fact, that I created a profile just to make sure people know to order elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good chinese place with a broad menu that contains many healthier options with grilled instead of fried meat.  Slightly on the pricier side (most dishes $10-$12), but the portions were reasonably large and of overall high quality."}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to dine here while I was staying at the Palms. As my friend and I entered the establishment we were not greeted at all but there were three hostesses standing behind the podium they just looked at us blankly. We smiled and nodded and we asked if they were open. (It was dinner time) one of them said \"yes\" and proceeded to take us to a table.  The server brought us drinks which was fine and then our waiter seemed a bit disturbed.  We proceeded to talk and order our food which was also fine. The waiter didn't seem to pay attention to us once the food came.  Though there was a brief moment he just stood beside out table.  Additionally I witnessed him take a piece of fruit from the bar and eat it.  Then a loud conversation between the manager and one of the blank hostesses took place at the bar. It was about shift changes and didn't really seem appropriate for a restaurant.   Overall, the food was fine but the staff needs better training."}
{"text":"Predictable Chinese food. It's a B/B+, exactly what I was expecting. Good size menu, good lunch specials, lots of options. Delivery time varries, but I got mine on time in the middle of a blizzard, so that's a plus. We got chicken lo mein and sweet and sour chicken with a couple of apps, food was good."}
{"text":"Very good American Chinese food - both dine-in or take-out. I'm always taking out on the weekends. Food is always good and plenty of it - veggies always fresh. I've never had a bad food experience here.   They get busy at typical times - Friday dinner, etc. So, yeah, if you order then or try to eat in at those times, you'll likely wait longer than normal. I think some people tend to get impatient when their order isn't ready in 10 minutes every time. I'd rather they take the time to make it right, even when it's busy.  The restaurant owner/staff always are nice and patient. The restaurant is clean.  They also serve sushi, which some say is excellent - I've not had it.  My only advice is that if you're ordering on a typically busy take-out night, give yourself a half hour rather than 10 minutes. If you plan to eat in, you might want to avoid the take-out rush.  Otherwise, we really enjoy this place and order from there frequently."}
{"text":"China House has great food.  The family that owns and works in the restaurant are the nicest people you will ever meet and will bend over backwards to make you a happy customer. They will custom make anything you want. They are one of very few restaurants that will give you brown rice. The food is very, very good and the prices are the best around.  The only down side is the restaurant itself.. it's small and not realy \"eat in\"."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Eat there all the time.  More for take out....  The dining room is quite small."}
{"text":"I've been to China House many times, the service has always been average and the food has been the same.  Last night, however, I had a very different experience.  I went with two friends and we ordered 3 dishes: two orders of sesame chicken and one of orange chicken.  We brought the food back to my house and found that all of the dishes were exactly the same, but that the sesame just had seeds sprinkled on top.  The sesame chicken even had orange peels in it.  The chicken was dry and tough and none of us even came close to finishing our meals, as they were gross and strange.  We all agreed to call the next morning to discuss it with a manager.  This morning I called and asked to speak to a manager.  I explained what had happened and she literally told me that I should have called last night and brought the food back up, and because I did not that she could do nothing for me.  I explained that it was nearly 9 pm by the time we were done eating and she told me still that because I did not call and return the food last night that she could not help me.  I told her that I would not be returning to China House if they were not willing to do anything to right this, and she told me that was fine, said goodbye and hung up.  At no point was I rude, raised my voice or did anything to warrant such treatment."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is not so nice. I called to place a delivery order 45 minutes before closing. They told me the delivery driver went home for the night. I said I could have someone pick up my order if I could pay over the phone. They said they could not do that either but could not give a valid reason as to why. I dont normally complain but they were very rude to me. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Very tasty, and super affordable lunch specials! I'd say one of the top two General Tsos chicken I've had."}
{"text":"try the sesame chicken or mixed vegetables w fried tofu- ask for it spicy. the owners are very nice too."}
{"text":"For Chinese food in this area, China House is pretty decent. Prepared quickly, and the ingredients seem to be of a relatively high quality. The restaurant is clean, and the kitchen itself appears to be quite clean and sanitary. So this place is definitely a notch above a lot of other Chinese take out places. Some of the dishes tend to be a bit on the salty side, but overall are tasty. The service is helpful and prompt, if not terribly friendly."}
{"text":"Authentic is one of those foodie buzzwords that tend to be tossed around with alarming frequency.   Usually, it denotes a standard of excellence.  To me, authenticity is not an end goal with food (my end goal being taste) but a possible step along the way to achieving said goal.  Which brings me to China House.  A glowing, neon red time capsule, duly pumping out the same pseudo Cantonese based cuisine that was so successful back in the 1960s.  Your parents loved this stuff when their parents took them out on a Friday night for dinner.  You probably love it too.  Authentic, it is surely not.  Tasty, it is.   So leaving your Scarborough dim sum memories behind, journey over the magical bridge of wishful loonie dreams and make sure you get a seat in the main room.  If you are lucky, you'll be seated under the artificial tree in one of the prime round tables.    A waiter will immediately plunk down fried chow mein noodles, electric red sweet and sour sauce and nasal blasting yellow mustard. These \"little fried worms\" are to be added to your meal, but I've never seen it happen.  But then, we never order the chow mein either.  Dip them instead into the sauces and eat, like some fusiony, Asian version of salsa and tortillas.    Said waiter will return a few minutes later with tea and to take your order.  He will be anywhere between 50 and 183 years of age.  He will be wearing a uniform of red jacket, bow tie and black pants.  If you're lucky, his name tag will say \"Tom\".  At China House, there has always been a \"Tom\".  Those familiar with the operations of the Overlook Hotel will understand.  Take one part Borscht Belt Comedian, one part smirking Bill Murray and one part trickster mythos and that would give you an idea of Tom's charms.  His whole demeanor is one of impish delight.  His body language saying, \"Let's do this order thing again\" as he whips out his pad with a flourish.  \"I've literally watched the finish wear off these plates over the past thirty years, yet I still enjoy my job\".  Many of the city's young, bored and disaffected \"servers\" could learn a lesson from Tom.  While you wait for your food, enjoy the room.  People watch, because you are not going to find a group like this in many rooms around town.  If you went to central casting it could not be more perfect.  Notice also that China House does a regular take away business that clearly keeps the joint running.  As stated, the food is more pseudo Cantonese then pseudo Sichuan, so those looking for serious or even casual heat should look elsewhere (mostly at that excellent mustard sauce).  Never you mind, your Bubbie can't digest those chili peppers anyway.    The classics are executed with panache.  Egg rolls are crispy and light; won ton soup with consommé is clean and satisfying.  Spareribs are sticky sweet, redolent of 5-spice mix with a nice chew and rich pork hit.   This is probably one of the better ribs in the city, if rib fanatics are willing to look outside the category of smoked/grilled western style.  It's an appetizer portion so order double if you care for more.   After that, it's a hit parade of faves like Kung Pao Shrimp, Sautéed Seafood, Vegetable Delight: basically, properly stir fried vegetables in light sauces.  You'll find none of the all-purpose onion and carrot heavy utility veg mixes that happen in most Canadian/Chinese take out.  The \"protein\" additions of chicken, seafood and pork are also of good quality.  I'm not too fond of the beef here, and that may be my only complaint.  Once done with your meal, enjoy fortune cookies that actually taste good, possessing a nice, sweet almond flavoured crunch.  Try to avoid the charms of the Phoenix Room on your way out.  The bathrooms have seen better days.  The same could be said of China House, but I would say \"not so!\"  A more authentic experience of mid 20th century westernized Chinese food cannot be had in Toronto.  It's a slowly fading memory that won't be replicated again.  Visit it soon and keep the tradition alive."}
{"text":"Service was great adrian was very sweet. However food was too chewy and not seasoned well"}
{"text":"I am a lunch fan of this tiny Chinese restaurant in Grafton, OH.  Do not let the Akron address fool you.  First off, this restaurant is squeaky clean.  The cooking area is visible from the check out/waiting area.  I have also witnessed dumplings being rolled by hand.  The won ton dumplings in the won ton soup are thick and delicious and larger than golf balls.  A quart of this delicious soup is loaded with 8 - 10+ dumplings and sells for $2.75.  A total delectable deal.  The steamed pork dumplings are very tender and delicious.  Items are packed carefully in bags, separated by cardboard.  The service is quick and friendly.  Good items on the menu include the chicken lo mein, steamed dumplings, shrimp in mixed vegetables, sweet/sour shrimp and egg rolls.  Only one critique...when spicy food is requested, it is not spicy.  Overall, a very good deal for very little cash.  Great for take out."}
{"text":"We order from here a lot! We joke and call it 10 minute Chinese because they always say it will be 10 minutes no matter what you order! But really it's good Chinese. Would recommend for a quick dinner option."}
{"text":"After recently moving to Ohio this is by far our favorite Chinese restaurant, and we have tried many places. The service is super quick and the food is fantastic. I noticed some less than favorable reviews and was very surprised. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Best Chinese food around, and the owners are nice, super hard working people. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. It definitely seems like somewhere you shouldn't eat, like kind of sketchy but I do order from here sometimes because the food is really good"}
{"text":"An absolute institution when it comes to kitschy old school Chinese. The decor is indeed a time warp, and has not changed in 50 years. From the artwork, to the black lacquer walls and down to the red velvet, this place drips with character.   The food is good old school Chinese and the Peking duck is still the best in the city.   The establishment is under new ownership as of a year ago, so anyone who may have come before that could have had a negative experience. The cleanliness and vibe has done a complete 180 in the last little while so those of you who may not like the place, I suggest you give it another try.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best crab Rangoon and general tso's chicken I've ever had. Every time I'm in town, I order from China house constantly."}
{"text":"Poor service. Very rude on the phone. Delivery took almost an hour and a half. Never ordering from her again."}
{"text":"I can not understand how some people actually like this place. It is so dark and dirty inside.  I think the carpet is 50 years old. We recently decided to try it out after a long time since we heard there was a new owner.   Horrible.  The soup was terrible.  One of our mains, an easy standard, Beef with Broccoli was ruined.  Portion size is small.  Do not order hot and sour soup, it lacks flavor.   I can name 10 chinese restaurants to go to before this one.  save your money and eat elsewhere.  Once you eat at China House you will never go back.  Ashley T. must be related to the owner or something to say Best Chinese food in Toronto.  That statement is a joke. I can assure you, my family had not gone there in years and will never again after this last visit.  What a waste."}
{"text":"The staff seems to need an attitude adjustment. As my wife and I approached to enter, here was no \"hello\", or \"welcome\" by the greeter. Considering that's the only job she has; really what else is she there for, you would think she would put a little effort in it.  My wife actually asked how she was with no reciprocation from her; really. Then once seated, the waitress coped an attitude because we didn't opt for their bottled water or for any cocktails. Never mind that we bought an appetizer and two entrees. The food was good but not so much to compensate for their attitude. One and done..."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but there's nothing good to say about it. The food was the worst Chinese I ever had- from uncooked chicken to old tasting vegetables... The people at the desk were unfriendly. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ordered take out from here and for one they didn't tell us the price over the phone.  But we were looking at their menu online and we were expecting to pay 27 dollars.  We went to pick it up and the bill totaled 37 dollars!!  For 2 people to eat at a Chinese restaurant this is crazy.  Not only were the prices online misleading but when we went to pick up the food the woman was extremely rude.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was by far my worst experience with Chinese food..we were hoping for a nice dinner but in return received cold food..very over seasoned and dry ..rushed service and the place was down right filthy..i will never return nor will I recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered General Tso which was excellent.  The egg roll was very fresh and flavorful.   Some old reviews are pretty negative.  Seems like they have turned things arid.  Great place for takeout."}
{"text":"This restaurant is FANTASTIC! We go there every other week. The service is great, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"So, yeah, China House is typical American-Chinese food. Nothing special at all. But they do it the way I expect them to. They're fast, and nice, and the price is right. I've also had them cater some events and they've been very helpful, delivering huge portions of food, on-time and for a reasonable price.   I've seen the owner in there feeding her kids Chinese water spinach--real Chinese food. I do kind of wish it was on the menu, but alas I'll just go to How Lee for that."}
{"text":"You know it is bad news, when the ONLY Asians in the house are the wait staff.  Even the front of the house manager, is a 80's dressed white guy.    Tiny portions and high prices ($13 for Beef Broccoli size of McCain's frozen entree?) never helps.  But worse, it is the flavours makes me want to never come back.  It tastes like Chinese food that your college roommate would attempt to make.  Yep.  All soy sauce, soggy vegetables and weirdly seasoned food (why do I taste all spice in every single dish?).  It appears that this place caters to unassuming upper income families that are afraid to travel to downtown or even Markham.  Ok.  Enough.  My mom said if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.  ... .. ."}
{"text":"I visited PA in 2012, where I stayed for a month. During that time, I stumbled upon this little gem when the hotel offered me some menus from around the area. I took a shot on China House and was so unbelievably surprised by the food. It was easily the best Chinese food I've ever eaten, and that's saying a lot, as Chinese is, without a doubt, my favorite cuisine, so I've eaten it a lot in my life. the boneless ribs were the juiciest, most tender boneless ribs I've ever had; the rice was superb, and the egg rolls were amazing. It was so good, I wound up eating there numerous times in that month I was there, and still today, I find myself comparing it to the Chinese food here in Miami where I live. Still have not found any that comes close to PA's China House. My father felt the same way, and when he learned he might have to go back to PA in Sept, he taunted me with how he was going to the China House, it was that amazing! On a final note, it was so good, I made sure to bring back a menu from there so I wouldn't forget where it was, in case I go back."}
{"text":"Good portions. Fast service. Just came here to pick up the lunch I ordered. I was surprised at how big the bag was. I thought maybe it wasn't mine. It sure is and I am going to enjoy this. I've eaten their food before, so I know it's great. I just didn't know they were so generous with their portions!"}
{"text":"China House is the best chinese food I've had in the area. The ingredients are very fresh and not your typical chinese food freeze dried consistency. We had the vegetable dumplings, crabmeat ragoons, veg fried rice and the thick noodle dish. Everything was absolutely delicious. The price may be a big higher than your average chinese food, but it is well worth it for the quality."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places around. Very friendly and clean.  Highly recommend their hot and sour soup. Chicken and eggplant was very good, along with their Singapore Mai Fun.   Make sure you try their homemade spicy mustard with your eggroll. It's got a kick and will definitely clear your sinuses."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this food my favorite Chinese place hands down. I haven't had a bad plate yet!"}
{"text":"I was shocked how negative the reviews were compared to out experience. Service was excellent, attentive, personable and funny. Food was good esp the potstickers. Our lycheetinis were awesome!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! From the moment we waited in line and watched the hostess leave the podium to seat guests leaving an unattended line; to the extremely Poor service, understaffed for a concert night,  disorganized, cold food, wrong food brought to table, check presented uncorrected, what a mess! Had the food been served hot it would have been good. One dish was finally served after we had finished everything else. We thought the waiter forgot but couldn't find him tomcatch his attention. When the busboy finally delivered the fried shrimp it was lukewarm! Terrible to bite into deep fried shrimp and not even warm. I'll never return and sadly the server was very nice but not a nice dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised no one has left a review for this place yet. I've been here quite a number of times and I've never been disappointed. Service is good and the food is wonderful. This is the closest thing to getting Chinese food from D.C.  You definitely have to get the general tso's chicken. I drove all the way to get some food from here during last years horrible winter storm. When you have a craving, you have a craving."}
{"text":"I love it here, it's the only Chinese food my boyfriend and I get in Pittsburgh. It's always consistent, the prices are good, and it's amazing everytime!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at China house twice. Never again. What possessed me to go the second time, I just don't know. In any case, being pretty much a salt freak, I usually find myself adding salt to most restaurant food. Not here. The food was so salty that I could hardly eat it. Everything was salty, starting with the wonton soup. I ordered from the menu the second time I went. Very salty. Very. When the server brought me the check, I told her that the food would have been good, but that it was too overly salted. It was clear that she didn't understand what I said, so I just let it go and got out of there."}
{"text":"The food is decent but by god it is filling and plan when you eat it because it does not feel good coming out. But I will admit the rice is pretty good so you know what I'll be conservative and give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"I ate china house for dinner. I had the shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce combo that came with pork fried rice and an egg roll. I substituted steamed rice for the fried rice. I also got wonton soup (small). The price was great! For all of that and a can if sprite I paid 10.17! And the service was prompt and the lady in the front was very pleasant! Bottom line is the garlic sauce on the shrimp and broccoli was not good at all! It was very thick to the pony of sticky. It was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice. I could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross. The portion size was nice. The wonton soup was fine. Basically I will most likely give this place one more chance with a different item on the menu because of its proximity to my house and the great customer service. Hope I have better luck next time!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Chinese take out! I've been ordering here for years and have never been disappointed. I have tried a little bit of everything on the menu. The beef sticks and their sesame chicken are really good as well as their sweet and sour chicken. The service is great and the pick up order never takes long. This is also the kind of Chinese take out you can enjoy without feeling sick afterwards or the next day.  And apparently the reviews for this place needs a group consensus so my group of five thoroughly enjoyed their food from this place and will keep ordering from here."}
{"text":"love the pan-fried dumplings & crab rangoons :) everything there has been great. Very nice people too,,"}
{"text":"Out of the two Chinese restaurants in White Oak, I'm glad this one is still open.  The buffet is hit or miss with the amount of food, but the quality is usually very good. Their takeout is WAY better than the buffet and well worth the trip down.  The atmosphere is your typical Chinese buffet place, nice music, good lighting, and a simple layout. The wait staff is very good at keeping the table clean of used plates, and the beverages never run dry.  No matter how many orders there are for takeout it's always \"15 minutes\""}
{"text":"Good Chinese in a hurry? Never had a problem."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  The wonton soup was awful! Girl at the counter was dismissive and sort of rude.  Doubt if I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Best food, fast delivery, good portions, fresh vegetables. . . This is my go to American Chinese delivery. The ingredients are fresh and the food is delicious. I recommend it. Hunan dishes especially good with nicely prepared veggies. I've tried the general tso and it was nicely prepared with a little bit of spice. It seem like this food is prepared with care and that shows in the dishes!"}
{"text":"The food smelled delicious on entering. The woman behind the counter was very nice. It's sit down after you order or take out. I ordered the General Tsos dinner special with a soda and water. The egg roll came out very promptly very warm and crisp. It had a great taste to it.  The dinner plate came out less than ten minutes afterwards despite about three other diners in house and a steady stream of take out.   It was very good flavor and the right amount of heat by default. The fried rice was good. The only bit I had was it only had two small florets of broccoli. I would have like about 6 more to balance he dish.   In short I just found out go to Chinese place."}
{"text":"I have found my favorite Chinese place! Finally!  We wouldn't have known about this restaurant, but we were with some friends in Rocky River who ordered from here.   I decided to switch it up a bit and order STEAMED chicken and broccoli instead of regular, with the brown sauce on the side. Daring, I know. Well, for a dish that is essentially tasteless, they did a great job. The brown sauce it came with was the best brown sauce ever. It wasn't just like a brown gelatin glob, it was actually smooth and tasted slightly sweet. I liked this sauce better than the normal chicken & broccoli sauce. They did throw some carrots into the dish, which I wasn't too excited about (especially since they looked like crinkly-cut fries - for some reason, I hate it when carrots are cut like that). But a home run nonetheless.  And of course, the wonton soup. Thick, chewy dough, slightly salty broth without making you feel like your hands and feet are going to swell. It came with some noodles that I didn't try. But nice touch. I always appreciate the noodles. My only complaint, but this is minor, is that they didn't include any roast pork in the broth. But maybe I just got a dud serving.  And the fortune cookie: \"Don't listen to snide remarks.\" Why are fortunes never fortunes anymore? They're more like watching contestants from The Biggest Loser wax poetic: \"It's not what you have done already, it's what you CAN do;\" \"A nice person and a good person are not the same thing;\" \"Begin your journey today, even if your vacation starts tomorrow.\"  Anyway, five stars to China House!"}
{"text":"Just bought a place in Oakmont and these guys are close, general Tso's chicken was nice thick chunks of white meat, sauce not too sweet. Very good Chinese food, glad to have found a great Chinese option here!!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. I ordered $75 bucks worth for a group of girls and everyone loved it. My only complaint was that they had the nerve to charge me 25 cents for each pair of chop sticks I needed. The crab rangoons and chicken teriyaki were my favorites!! Best Chinese place around."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Toronto. I've been coming here longer than I can remember. I don't live nearby, so sadly I only manage to go about once a year, but it's worth the trip every time. The food is fantastic. The service is friendly and unobtrusive. Very reliable, with the same menu, staff, and dining room decor for over twenty-five years."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I usually judge a Chinese restaurant by it's General Tso's Chicken.  I popped in for lunch today.   The restaurant was clean, the staff were friendly, the food was excellent and the price was very reasonable.    --I had the General Tso's Lunch Special w/ white rice and egg roll.  Eat-in--  Rice is nice.  Their's was not over/under done, appropriately chewy, and clean tasting.  The egg rolls were \"blah\", but they weren't greasy like you sometimes find.  The General Tso's was excellent:    Sauce - I was pleased when they brought it out and sauce was not the \"Red General Tso's Sauce.\"  I don't have anything against the Red General, but their sauce was bright tasting, balanced, sweet, and had just about the right hint of zip.    Fried Chicken - crisp and \"clean oil fried\" (if that makes sense?), not soggy or overly battered.  The chicken bits were bite size, and fit comfortably on the fork.  Portion size - Appropriate for lunch.  The plate was full, but not piled on like they're trying to make up for any lacking qualities in the food by providing volume.  Overall, I will definitely be going back here to try some of their other dishes.  The wait time was appropriate, the food was fresh tasting.  I like soda pop.  They offer that in cans or 20 oz bottles.  Seating is adequate and the large windows and adequate lighting make for a bright, casual experience."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed ,after reading all the five and four star reviews we went and dined . Not impressed. The beaf low-main was very chewy ,the general-pso's chicken was over cooked and not good . Service was minamul tea was warm water .  Never again . Would not recommend ."}
{"text":"This is simply great food. No frills, no fuss. I've used the takeout a number of times and have never been disappointed.  So if you are looking for a reliably good Chinese take out, lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong.    They have a few dine-in tables, but living as close as I do the take out is for me."}
{"text":"I think it is good food for take out. The reviews on here make it seems as if the food is horrible. We order here for delivery all the time and have never had a problem."}
{"text":"Best takeout Chinese food in the area, including Cranberry. Always fresh and delicious, and inexpensive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place does not have a big YELP following but it should. This is hands down the best Chinese Food Restaurant in Las Vegas.  Our Server Adrian was absolutely amazing....he was attentive, kind, funny, informative, and knowledgeable about the History of the Hot Pot Special.  There are not a lot of descriptions on what the Hot Pot Special is but I would describe it to be very similar to Fondue in that you pick two \"broths\" or \"sauces\" if you will to cook what you order. It truly is all you can eat and you pick what types of produce and veggies you want to the type of protein you can pick and choose whatever you want. I have to say surprisingly the Tofu was by far my favorite though. It has a sweeter taste to it.  Definitely try the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef too those were outstanding.  And they have this Chili Oil sauce that they make in house which is to die for.  We finished off our feast with their Special Coconut Ice Cream which is out of this world. I wish they would box it up and sell it by the carton.  So when you try this place as for Adrian to be your server and I promise you will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The dumplings and fried rice are my favorites.  The dumplings are filled with a delicious mixture of pork and they really fill them well.  The fried rice has a flavor, almost smoked that sets it apart from others I've had.   All other foods I've tried are delicious too!  They spoiled me for other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden in Grafton, a blink and you miss it location. The food is is good, standard Americanized Chinese food but very prompt and clean. The mei fun is not oily at all and the wife loved the Kung Pow (sp?). We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great food, super clean, bright restaurant, and the staff is always friendly and inviting. Hubby and I used to go nearly every weekend for lunch, but a job change and health issues made it so we could no longer continue that tradition. The next time we went in (after several months), the owner gave us hugs and told us how much they missed seeing us every week. We explained what happened and said we would try to be sure to get there at least once a month. When it came time to pay the bill, they refused to take our money - meal on the house for their long lost friends! Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I stopped into this restaurant. I lived here for years and never thought that it would be good. I was amazed how good this place is. It is very clean and the staff is friendly. I got my order to go from the menu. I saw two young men come in and get a styrofoam container and fill it up with food. So you can get the buffet for take out. I think that this is a fantastic deal. My hot and sour soup was very good and so was my shrimp fried rice. I would recommend this place to anyone. The food in the buffet looked fresh, even at 7:45pm."}
{"text":"Cheap little hole in the wall chinese take out restaraunt with good food and good prices.  I've never gone wrong with this place.  Excellent Steamed or Fried Dumplings and General Tso's Chicken.  They've got a few small tables inside, but I've never actually eaten there.  Just takeout."}
{"text":"Chinese food on Chinese food. This place is the closest if you live in Berea so it's easy for it to be everyone's first choice in the area. The file very is awful and always takes about an hour or longer. You're better off just driving there and picking it up because then you get it in 15 minutes instead of 90! There was this one time I paid, waited about two hours then called and they said they didn't even have an order. So I've been busy picking up. The combo plates are the best value. Meat, rice, and an egg roll - good food Staff aren't really talkative but they are pretty much just running around cooking the food so they don't have the time Over all I like this place, it's my go to for some quick easy food.  Orange chicken, crab Rangoon, and wonton soup is delish!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the family that owns and runs this Chinese restaurant. The food is great and the prices are really inexpensive. I always walk into smiling faces:) I enioy givng my business to the China House. Fan for life. 100% recommended"}
{"text":"Recently someone asked me if there were any great Chinese places around here and I said No. But this place is good. More like a 3.5 than a 3 star rating. The lunch special menu is limited but sufficient.   General Tso is good but I wished it came with broccoli. You can't go wrong with the Pork lo mein and shredded beef with garlic sauce either."}
{"text":"My family loves getting take out from China House.  The food portions are good and the taste is great.  Our favorite dish is the roast pork lo mein.  The staff are always welcoming and friendly.  I like to get a little side of the red sweet and sour sauce with our meal.......I don't even have to ask anymore because they know us and make sure to include it."}
{"text":"The China House is our go to for  Chinese food. It is delicious, done quickly,  and hot when we get it home. Everything has a distinct flavor. The moon gai pan had a garlicky taste that was absolutely yummy! Beef with broccoli outstanding! They also have moo shu chicken, my absolute fave, which others don't usually have! You have to go and try it!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill over the years!  I've been a customer for almost ten years and have seen the transition into dismal.  My last two meals have been disgusting.  I don't know what kind of meat they are services but usda needs to be called.  The general tsoas chicken was some kind of dark black meat under the sauce and didn't have the consistency of chicken.  I could hardly chew it.  The fried chicken wings are darn sure NOT chicken!  The rice is hard one day later.  I believe they are used Old and expired good products. The delivery times are well over and hour also.  I won't order from them ever again!  I wish the other Chinese restaurant on front street never closed. Forgot the name but I ordered from the a lot before they closed about 5, 6 years ago.  This is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Fast, inexpensive, good portion size, consistent food quality... what's not to like?"}
{"text":"My husband and I are Chinese food afficionados and we stopped by there for lunch buffet. I got my usual try-out foods: Lo mein, General Tso's, string beans, egg drop soup, and egg roll. Since these are staples of most every restaurant, I figure that if they can't get these right, they won't be appealing to most patrons. The Lo-mein had good flavor. The noodles were al dente, and the veg had a decent crunch without being raw. The General Tso's was more sweet than heat. Although I like things on the milder side, there wasn't much spice to this dish. The egg drop soup was flavorful and stick-to-your-ribs thick. Definitely something for a cold winter day. Their egg rolls were crispy, but not over done. I did find these little tiny sweet corn fritters that were just a bite but had a lot of yummy trapped in that bite.   My husband sampled some of the other dishes. There were these filled dumplings called Seafood Delight that he just couldn't get enough of.  He also got the chicken teriyaki on a stick that was just perfect. His hot and sour soup had very nice flavor. He had me try their Walnut Chicken. It was so sweet, it could almost be dessert.  Their dessert bar was simple and light. There was plenty of fruit and small portion cakes and cookies. Just the right amount after a very nice lunch. I know next time we will try the dinner buffet and bring the kids!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best bang for your buck, Chinese takeout wise in the area. The service is super fast and they are pretty friendly. The shrimp eggrolls are amazing. The general tso extra spicy is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, prices were what I expect in a tourist joint.   Scallion pancake - perfectly fine, but this is a hard dish to mess up. Soup Dumplings - also perfectly fine but this is one of the weakest Chinese dishes in town so perfectly fine beats a fair number of other joints. Tea Smoked Duck - cut by someone who doesn't know how to do it properly, this is dry and overcooked with nothing to it that hints at the tea smoking and not just an over roast.  I suspect this is done in a fast high heat manner as most of the duck fat had rendered away, leaving nothing to cover how dry the meat was. And again, no smokiness to speak of."}
{"text":"There is hardly any beef in the Mongolian beef.  It should be called Mongolian onion, at least half the bites have no beef.  I like onions but this is just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I don't write that many reviews but this place had good food. And great customer service.   I came here with my family and their friends, party of 8. And we did the all you can eat hot pots. Boy did I get full really quick. Hahaha. Anyways, half of us came early so while waiting for the rest of the group, we were seated right away. It wasn't busy when we first arrived, but did pick up really quick right after. While we were waiting for everyone, we did order our drinks and started ordering what we wanted with our hot pots.   Everything came out perfect. Our waitress checked up on us constantly to make sure we got everything we need. I never once wondered where my server was because he was always present.   I'm not an expert on hot pot or anything but all I know was my belly was satisfied and I had no complaints the whole time I was there."}
{"text":"I love China House! My wife and I get takeout there all the time and we both get meals with leftovers for lunch the next day for less than $20. I was recommended to them and I recommend them all the time. You should try it!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here last night- and will not order from here again.  Agree with other reviewer that says it has gone downhill. We used to order at least once a month, but the quality is absolutely non-existent at this point.  Sesame chicken was rock hard, tasted old and warmed up.  Rice was also hard and flavorless. LoMein was full of garlic and greasy, hardly any chicken to be found.  Even fortune cookie was stale.  Very disappointed in loss of this take out place."}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant on numerous occasions (for take out). The food has always been freshly prepared, piping hot, with clearly fresh ingredients.    I like the little station with soy sauce packets, duck sauce and hot Chinese mustard, that I can toss into my bag to complete my meal.  There is always enough food to make two meals and the staff have been pleasant and courteous whether on the phone or in person.  If they added a delivery service, they might just get the 5th star.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is not up scale by any means but it is very good. Lunch will only set u back about 5-7 dollars. And it is always fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped here tonight at 5:50pm.  The place was empty and we were seated quickly.  We had our orders in before 6, we each ordered one entree and no appetizers or sushi.  Just chicken and mixed vegetables.  At 6:35 we had no food.  The place was filled up with take out customers waiting for their food, everyone was annoyed.  I left cash on the table to cover our two sodas and left.  Can't comment on the food.  Good luck if you decide to go, I'm not going back-there's other options for Chinese food."}
{"text":"the food is good, the woman is very nice. The child signing youre gonna miss me when im gone made us wish we were gone. We go out to eat to a restaurant to eat and relax. Not for child entertainment."}
{"text":"China House has been in Berea for Ever!  Ok, maybe not FOR-EV-VER but, a long time.  It isn't a place you want to go and sit down and have dinner but for some take-out Chinese, it is great.  The employees are really nice and the cooks are speedy.  The food is non-to-bad as far as Chinese food goes and there are some nice vegetarian options or \"diet\" options w/ steamed vegetable too!  I just wish they had brown rice."}
{"text":"Very tasty fast and accurate.  Excellent Won Ton Soup!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese around Bay/Westlake. Fast. Always good. Not greasy or tasting of old oil. Consistent quality, too."}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences the past couple times I've been here.  This used to be one of my favorite Chinese buffets, but my past 2 visits the food has not been good.  Both times the buffet was running low on quite a few of my favorites, such as the walnut chicken, eggrolls, crab rangoon, etc. and these were not re-filled the entire time I was there.  Most of the food that was out had clearly been sitting for hours and was cold and rubbery.  I think I will stay away from now on so I don't continue to waste my money."}
{"text":"China House..where the customer isn't right... All you needed to do was make an honest effort. Instead.. after screwing up my last two carry out orders I'm taking my hard earned money elsewhere. Awful customer service will never make up for pretty decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and wasn't disappointed.  The General Chicken was great and the kids enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken.  Needs some curb appeal, but don't let that stop you for trying this place."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, only place in Pittsburgh that puts brown sauce on chicken and broccoli properly. But also, when I went there it was only two people, a cook and the front desk lady. & she was very kind about everything and just seemed like a really sweet person, and I respect that a lot if it's just them two working. Keep up the good stuff! The food is really good too!"}
{"text":"Called up to order lo mein and eggrolls for takeout when I was less than 10 minutes away. I walked and and walked out with some yummy grub.  The lo mein was very good and flavorful with chicken and shrimp. The only thing I missed was the roasted pork but no biggie. The eggroll was crispy and the filling had the right texture...not mushy. The cabbage was crunchy too. Very good with great service to boot."}
{"text":"Absolutely vile. Some of the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted. The boneless \"spare ribs\" were dry and has very little sauce on them. The fried rice was crunchy.  The crab rangoon was greasy and had very little cream cheese in it. The egg rolls tasted like frozen store bought ones that had freezer burn. Never again. Plus, they were more expensive than some of the better Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"No delivery, but takes cards! (Unlike other cash only Chinese place in town). We had a spicy beef and cashew chicken dinners and they were both good. Will order from here again for the quick Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I think they have good quality food for a very reasonable and cheap price. They're pickup time is maximum 10 minutes... they are VERY attentive and eager to work fast for their customers.  China House defiantly has the best \"Happy Family\" plate around as well featuring chicken, shrimp, and beef. I would pick this take out over any sit down Chinese restaurant. I am more than pleased with the multiple meals I have purchased here!   Thank you China House for great value and unbelievable quality!!"}
{"text":"Blech.   My husband's Pork Lo Mein was mushy and bland, even for Lo Mein. He couldn't eat it.  The Po Po platter was another letdown. A nice big chunk of mystery \"Krab,\" some greasy chicken wings, and dumplings that were barely bigger than my thumbnail. Also something that was supposed to be a teriyaki stick which actually came close to being what it should have been. I didn't bother eating the sparerib.   My General Tso's chicken was those little popcorn chicken bites you get in places like this, tossed in some sweet & sour sauce with a chili pepper thrown in it. The fried rice was utterly lacking in flavor.   The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was better than Win Hope, but that's not saying much.  Also, they staple the styrofoam containers shut. PLEASE DO NOT USE A STAPLER THAT CLOSE TO MY FOOD!"}
{"text":"Only got wonton soup and fried noodles, and it was good. I told them I were eating in, and they put it for to go. Then as I sat to eat, the older lady there was pestering me about places to sell her iPhone and get a different one. Luckily it was cheap so I dodn't really complain, but it was very annoying.  Would return, but for take out only."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill.  What we once considered pretty good Chinese takeout has now become completely devoid of flavor and nearly inedible.  The vegetable fried rice was terribly bland and dry, the sesame chicken was slimy, and the kung pao chicken was overloaded with peanuts and full of chunky carrots that were nearly raw.  What a huge disappointment.  We will not be ordering from China House again."}
{"text":"China House in Bay Village is an OK place to go for takeout Chinese food, three stars for this visit. I view and am reviewing China House in the same category as other fast food takeout non-chain restaurants and deli's, a step above the burger & sandwich chains but not sit down place with servers. Few general observations include good parking as the place is located in the middle of Bay Villages \"downtown shopping district\" in a small storefront by the drug store. The interior waiting and small dining area was clean but very dated in looks.   Lunch and dinner orders are placed at the front counter, phone orders are also accepted. While waiting for the cashier to finish taking a phone order I was checking out the kitchen directly behind her. The cooking area looked clean with no issues visible to my untrained eyes. I ordered the Hunan Beef and an egg roll to go. I waited approximately 10 minutes for my order. I had no issue with the wait considering the amount of customers in line before me.  My lunch portion of Hunan Beef and egg roll total charge was $6.60. The good news was the portion was a nice size with a lot of fried rice and crisp veggies. The beef was cooked well, not overdone or \"chewy\". My issue with the meal was the lack of spice and \"heat\". I asked of very spicy and was disappointed with the blandness of the meal, glad a took a few packs of hot sauce from the utensils / condiments table."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese takeout- though a little slow (usually 20-30 min for a basic order- not ideal to swing by on the way home or a quick lunch).  However, you can order ahead, and while I'm generally suspicious when it comes to oriental restaurants, their kitchen (which you can see from the front counter) looks clean and I feel confident in what I'm eating and the food is pretty good.  Their portions aren't quite as large as some other local places, but their prices are pretty average- it seems.  So all and all, it's my current go-to for Chinese after a bad experience at my old local favorite. I say go for it!"}
{"text":"I love take-out chinese food, especially the kind that isn't so saturated in salt that it makes your tongue dry out and have heart palpitations the next day.  And this is a great little find.   Everything we had was good, (wonton soup, moo shu combo and sweet and sour chicken). The chicken portion was a little small in the dinner sweet and sour chicken, but it wasn't a cakey thick batter, and they were smart enough to put the sauce on the side, so it wasn't soggy by the time we ate.  Two thumbs up, can't wait to order up from them again soon!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this spot due to me staying at the Palms Hotel & Casino and having a $25 a day allotment with Groupon.  The hostess sat me and my hub down with no issues.  The server Rachel came over and took our drink order with no issues.  She seemed alright at first however when she came back to take our order it went downhill.  I informed her I wanted an order of crab Rangoon, veggie fried rice & wanted to know what came in the orange chicken & also that it was a decent portion.  She informed me that she was not sure how much much I eat being a big boy, then laughed about it.  I informed excuse me, then she said it was a family restaurant but she didn't know if that was gonna fill me up.  I placed order but then I acquired a bad taste in my mouth for her rude comments.  We left table and went to speak with hostess & informed her of the situation which she apologize and brought out this manager on duty Name Michael Martin who didn't properly introduce himself but stated that he was covering for Cathy the regular mgr on duty.  I informed him of situation and he looked at me like I walked off the street though I am a guest there.  After going over facts I informed him I prefer a resort mgr.  He escorted me & my hub to the front desk which we waited & spoke with Shelby Masacek.  She seemed much better than the arrogant Michael.  I informed her of situation and she also apologized but informed me that they are not affiliated with Palms Casino & Hotel.  She took my info and said the food & beverage director Stacey will get in contact with me.  I will update review once I get a resolution from this situation."}
{"text":"Due to the restaurants close proximity to work we order from here a lot. The only positive thing I can say about this place is that they are generally quick to deliver. However, the quality of the food is severely lacking. After being consistently let down I had to rate this place 1 star. The wonton soup was flavourless, I had to add salt and two packets of soy sauce to make it palatable. The Hunan Chicken was terrible. The sauce was good but I don't know what I was eating, the \"chicken\" was soft and spongey. I couldn't even eat more than a few bites before I tossed it out. The eggrolls were just okay. I opted to pick up instead of having delivery and had an unusually long wait. This gave me plenty of time to look around and see that the place is in dire need of a major cleaning. If the front is such a disaster I can only imagine what the area behind the counter looks like. Eeek."}
{"text":"Decent, cheap Chinese food with friendly service. The waitress was very friendly and also spoke Chinese (?) with the cooks which is always a good sign. Did I mention it was cheap? Good eggrolls."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Chinese buffets, but I have to say this one was a huge letdown. To start, when I walked in and during the time I spent eating, I was the only table there. Also the buffet itself was quite small with limited selections. The food that was out seemed to be reheated from the previous day and dried out. I'm a vegetarian and Chinese buffets normally have lots of options I. An choose from but I had trouble finding things to eat other than rice and lo mein. They had no plain veggies or cheese wontons. The desserts were also just as disappointing. The buffet had a few different types of cakes and such piled on top of each other in one container. The restaurant itsself seemed to be clean and the waitress did refill my drink often. My bill for one lunch buffet with an iced tea was 15.29 which I felt was a bit high. Especially since I was leaving hungry. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I've gone to China House a few times now, and I can safely say I really like it. In my book it's better than Wai Wai a couple blocks down, just because the prices are lower and the food is spicier. There is also a wider variety of menu items available here than other Chinese takeout places in the area, and while that doesn't necessarily indicate superiority I've found that the various dishes actually taste different from one another and the quality is consistent. I don't like it when the General Tso's chicken tastes exactly like the sesame chicken, and that's definitely not the case at China House. Also, the employees are wonderful and they're open super late. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Had the general tso's chicken. Did not enjoy the general tso's chicken. I've heard such good things about the place I'm going to give it a second try. Will update accordingly."}
{"text":"Not many places deliver to where we live so we were hoping and praying this place was okay. So far so good. Three times ordered and we haven't had any complaints! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Amazing egg rolls! The food is good, I do prefer to order from the menu rather than eat the buffet, but I think it is just me being picky! The staff is usually friendly and efficient!  You never need to ask for a refill and your plates are always cleared!"}
{"text":"Went in search of a Chinese restaurant and went to China House.  Food was Fresh and Tasty!  Fast Service to our table, had the lunch Menu,  Beef and General Tao both were very good.  I'll def come back!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for. Just good, fast take-out Chinese food. The food was really good and the vegetables were fresh. I'll definitely be a return customer."}
{"text":"Your standard chinese takeout place, but they are fast and consistent."}
{"text":"A. Fucking. Time. Warp.  The last thing I want to see when I first enter a Chinese restaurant is some gwai lo greeting us in his accent-less English.  Seriously, who wants this?  That should have been a warning sign or maybe the 70's style wall paper, carpets, or staff  uniforms should have screamed \"WARNING\".  But whatever, it's all about the food, right?  Damn, even their food is outdated.  Picture walking into a Chinese restaurant in Barrie in the 1980's.  Then picture red sauce, yellow sauce, and deep fried.  Clearly this business model still works because this resto has been there forever.  It doesn't mean I can't blacklist it.  Sidenotes: deep fried shrimps were pretty good.  Everything else?  Meh.  Staff was exceptionally nice, saving this place from a one-star review."}
{"text":"Hard working immigrants. These fine folks came to the US in the early 1990's and have managed to run quite a successful establishment. They are nice, courteous and their food is fantastic. I eat from here about 3x per year. The walnut chicken is to die for. Give it a shot. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food and very good lunch prices. The pan fried dumplings are homemade and delicious. The General Tso's is excellent. Don't miss the wonton soup either. This will be a regular lunch spot for us - the nice part is they give you enough for two days and it is in microwave safe containers!"}
{"text":"way super over priced! And the plates where so small, I don't mind paying the price when I get my money's worth in return,  it was a $70+ bill and we left with zero leftovers and only had water, and we definitely could have eaten more."}
{"text":"Stopped by and they were very friendly. My wife and i dined in. We had the sesame and amazing chicken. I can say the quality of food was better than the usual places. Priced fairly for the quality. We had a pleasant experience. Will be going back."}
{"text":"The BEST! I got general Tso's & chicken fried rice & it's amazing! I would highly recommend this place to anyone i come in contact with!"}
{"text":"We originally tried China House because we lived in the apartments next door and could walk over. We have since moved but it is still our go-to Chinese place and we prefer it to Lin's. It's cheap, it's incredibly tasty and no matter when I call for takeout it's always \"15 - 20 minutes.\" They even saved my behind last Easter when I had no food and the grocery store was closed. Customer for life.   The only thing that would be better is if they delivered."}
{"text":"Inexpensive (especially lunch), yet quality Chinese food. As other reviews have said, the people are extremely friendly (yet straightforward) and this is the kind of place you want to give your business to. It's the best Chinese in the area (there is another sit-down place in the area that isn't as good) and a pleasant alternative to the nearby fast food chains. And yes - optimal for takeout."}
{"text":"Good prices, decent food. The staff...well. I watched a guy pick his nose while prepping food."}
{"text":"Food not so good...hard to find good Chinese food around this town that doesn't cost an arm and leg...didn't get sick from the food which is good...they need to do a better job cooking their food and make it look appetizing.."}
{"text":"We ordered a large take out order on a early Sunday afternoon. I didn't expect them to be busy, but I was amazed how fast they had 8 dinners ready for us. The food was ready and waiting all boxed up for us. The people were super nice. And best of all, the food was really good. Everyone raved about it.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So so chinese food. But maybe it was what we ordered.   Bad: my moo shu was way too salty and my sister didn't like her soup or lo mein.  Good: my veggie fried rice was good and had a nice variety of steamed vegetables in it.   If I came again I would get a veggie and chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"So we left the movies and passed this place. I'm a sucker for this style of food. Can't say I'm thrilled I came here but there are a lot of positives to this place.  Place has a really nice ambiance but I've gotten wind that this place isn't doing well. It's got a really beautiful dining room and a very nice bar but maybe the lack of tourists during this season makes places look even slower. This place was slow but the food didn't take long at all.  Ray the bartender took great care of my partner and I. Great convo and laughs. He made me a very good cocktail based off exactly what I like.   The food was so and so. The pot stickers and spring rolls were better than the Mongolian beef. I'm a sucker for mongo beef and maybe that's why I shouldn't have ordered it. The crispy noodles were good. Nothing over the top but good meal. The appetizers shouldn't out shine the entrees.   When you check in on yelp you get free spring rolls"}
{"text":"Let's not talk about the food. The only thing worth noting is the remarkable sheen on the vegetables, one that I haven't seen since falling face-first on the freshly waxed gymnasium floor back in grade seven. My asparagus was glistening! Even the noodles looked freshly shellacked.  If we're going to speak in glowing terms, let's talk about the top-notch service, snazzy décor, and delightful cocktails. My Cosmopolitan, served by a wonderfully attentive waiter, was a work of art. Frosty and delicious, it sat proudly on it's little tray, the perfect shade of pale pink, frosty droplets forming on the outside of the glass. It was exquisite.  The décor is also quite splendid, and will fulfill any desires you've ever had to be in a scene from a 1960's movie in a Chinese restuarant. The colour  scheme (obviously)  is red and gold, with occasional ornamental money-cats, and rounded doorways. Once we crossed the tiny bridge into the dining area, we were seated under a giant Bonsai tree to enjoy our meal.  And enjoy our meal we did. The food was tasty &  attractive... albeit a little expensive.  Service? Top-notch, and befitting of a place that puts so much effort into the perfect martini.  The staff appeared at exactly the right moments, offering gentle menu suggestions, discreetly offering forks, and removing silver domes with a subtle flourish.  Would we care for another round of drinks? Why thank you! And yes, we will come again."}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout from here several times a month.  I have also found the service to be prompt, the food is tasty and the service friendly.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Gaaaaaaaaaaarose!!!! Not sure why I came in here buy lesson learned....REALLY dirty seating area(loose spider webs to start)  and really NOT GOOD food....So my folly is your heads up to NOT GO HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a schezwan chicken take-out at maximum spicy level, but was extremely disappointed to find no spices in the chicken at all. Besides, some of the chicken was under-cooked. The best part of this Super Bowl meal was a can of Coca Cola. Thanks Coke!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for take out. My friend ordered Sesame chicken and I had the orange chicken. Although my friend was the one ordering, it was a bit difficult to determine our orders since the person taking the call said that it was an additional $1 for fried rice and the total came out to $10+ per dish. Gosh! We just wanted sesame chicken with fried rice! She finally said that we wanted the combination platter which came out to $8.29 each.   The food was ready quickly. We were SO hungry! The meals came with an egg roll which wasn't bad. However, they forgot to put utensils and sauce. The food itself wasn't too bad. It was filling and what I had expected. It wasn't anything extraordinary but it was good enough. Lunch is definitely a good deal since the dishes are about $5.50 each or so."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such bad reviews; it's your standard hole-in-the-wall Chinese take-out place and I had no problems with the food. Sure it's definitely not fancy, could use a good cleaning, and the staff speak broken English, but the prices are cheap and the food was A-Okay. I actually liked it better than King Wah. When we stopped in there were four other customers picking up/placing orders so you know it can't be that bad.   We went with the Special Combination Plates which includes a meat with pork fried rice and an egg roll for less than $8. We got the Coconut Chicken, the Sesame Chicken and a side of Crab Rangoons. The rice was yellow and had bits of pork, onion, and bean sprouts in it. The Egg roll was standard size, crispy and tasty. I also enjoyed my coconut chicken dish. My only complaint with the food lies in the crab rangoons which were more chewy than crispy (could have cooked longer) and they were more like cream cheese and diced onion rangoons as there was no crab in these babies.   Overall, I'd hit this place up again for some satisfying Chinese take-out! I'd like to try their Honey Chicken and Steamed Dumplings."}
{"text":"I had their dinner buffet and was disappointed in the selection and variety of the food, was concerned because the temperature on the buffet table wasn't keeping some of the food hot enough, and the overall quality of their food was sub-par.  The only good thing I can say is their walnut shrimp has a marvelous taste to it, but one item on 3 buffet tables is not what I call worthwhile.  It's worth traveling to another Chinese place in McKeesport or Monroeville than eat here.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Wednesday night.  Place was busy with take-out business, but my order was taken pretty quickly and efficiently.  Food was ready in about 10 minutes.  Ordered the General Tso's (w/white meat), which is my go-to when trying a new spot.  The portion size was good (even had fried rice left over, which is rare for me), but it wasn't the best General I've had.  The egg roll was pretty bland, too.  Like a lot of Chinese take-outs, there's some good dishes, and some not-so-good ones.  Not sure if I'll be back to try again."}
{"text":"Place has gone downhill in recent months.  I used to eat here a couple times a month, but after a run of bad experiences, decided to look elsewhere for Chinese."}
{"text":"Easy to order online, and the delivery man was super friendly. I got beef and broccoli which tasted pretty good and chicken lomein which also was good. Decent price as well. Did take about 45 minutes to an hour to get there, but I wasn't in a hurry so it was fine."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Not that impressed. They have some good stuff but a lot of items are mediocre. Beef is questionable or of the lowest quality. Egg drop soup and spring rolls are good."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for the past 6 years and the food is always great and consistent. It has been the same owners this whole time. Whenever I am in there playing Dou Di Zhu or pop locking beats from Korea,there is a large customer base coming and going all the time. The prices are cheap and you get nice sized portions. Open late for Bay Village. You can dine in, there are about 10 tables in there."}
{"text":"Delivery time was excellent.  The Chicken Fried rice was average. Vegetable egg rolls good.  So, I'm giving it 3 stars for average."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out in Bay! We love this place. The food is consistently delicious and the price is right. It is also nice how quickly our order is ready for pick up. Usually about 15-20 minuets. For 25 cents you can add a 2 liter of pop to any order $25.00 and up. We order a combination of vegetarian dishes and the moo shu vegetable is amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food and great prices. Lo mein was delicious! My boyfriend said this was the best Chinese delivery we've had in our area. We will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Very good food at reasonable prices. I like the szechuan chicken. Friendly staff. Quick cook times. Even at busy hours I only have been told 20-25 minutes. I don't give 5 star reviews unless I am amazed. But a very good Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to eat at this Chinese restaurant many years ago when we were college students. Wow, our taste buds sure have improved since then! The buffet food this time was a very low quality. Most of the food looked as if it had been cooked days earlier. At one point, a waitress poured a bucket of water on top of fish that was drying out. The waitress was nice to us and did bring us drink refills. This restaurant has sentimental value to us, but I cannot come here again in the future for food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Chinese place, it puts many others to shame. Chicken and Broccoli and all of their lo mien dishes are my favorites. Always ready in 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"As someone who is constantly on the move between Shadyside and Bloomfield during the work week, I am always looking to find a quick, cheap lunch spot. While flipping through yelp, I came across the China House on Liberty Ave. I was less than a mile away and the reviews were good so I decided to give it a try.  First of all, most of the lunch specials are around $5.50 including shrimp dishes and dishes like General  Taos's which can sometimes be a little bit more. All of the lunch dishes come with a generous serving of pork fried rice.  I ordered the chicken and broccoli directly from the yelp app. The broccoli had great flavor and wasn't over cooked. The chicken, although a little chewy, was comparable to most other Chinese restaurants around.   Overall, the portion and quality was substantial for $5.72. I will definitely be returning to try some of the other lunch specials.  Ps. Don't forget your fork and napkins!"}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp and broccoli and chicken wings. The shrimp and broccoli was good but not great. The chicken wings were small and didn't have any flavor. If I'm desperate I'll go back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I agree this takeout Chinese food is the best in the North Pittsburgh suburbs - hands down."}
{"text":"The best place in town. I cannot stand overly sweet Chinese food. They will make it as spicy as you want unlike other establishments ***Wai Wai's***"}
{"text":"Why is it soo hard to find good Chinese food? This place will deliver, the beef n broccoli is ok. Fried rice used to be ok, last time we had it, there was a rubber band in my rice! Like the big rubber ones that are found on a newspaper.. yeea. So we've never ordered again."}
{"text":"Cozy place. Takes a few minutes to get your food, but that's because they cook it when you order it, instead of using heat lamps like oh so many Chinese food places I've been to.  I ordered fried rice, spring rolls, and a sushi roll. The fried rice was incredible, especially for the price. You get more than enough and there's plenty of vegetables, meats, and seasoning to make it taste great. The spring rolls were delicious as well, and the sushi roll was alright, but definitely adequate for the price compared to other sushi places in town.  Sadly they don't deliver outside of a 3 mile radius, otherwise I'd be taking advantage of that. However, I'm certainly returning for more."}
{"text":"We usually order delivery with China house, the sushi is great. They are always quick and the delivery guy is so nice!"}
{"text":"So I had a hankering for sushi so heard this place wasn't to bad and decided to get some take out style.  First of all the packed all the sushi in one container which was real crappy since I like spicy stuff and my ordering partner did not! We had to sort out 4 different rolls and fig out which one was which.  Second some of the rolls (angry dragon) was way over priced for me I can Pay that much for and sushi roll and get more for my buck at better quality. Over all we got 4 rolls and an order of crab ragoon which were cooked perfectly best thing of the bunch the plain spicy tuna and California roll were decent.  If you want high qualify stuff I would look else where. Never had there regular food yet but might try it still"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant with BIG excellent tasting Chinese food.  It is my wife and my goto place any time we want to get Chinese take-out as everything we've ever ordered there has been excellent:  deliciously tasty, and plenty of it.  Last night we got a couple of soups (Wonton and Hot and Sour) and a couple of stir fries.  All were delicious (as usual) and actually though we got them for supper, we got 2 suppers out of them.  We always call our order in as we're only about 10 minutes away from China House, and our orders have just about always been just being finished when we arrive to pick them up.  Not only tasty, but fresh and warm."}
{"text":"We tried this place because we work right down the street from it. The food was mediocre at best. There was absolutely no flavor to anything that we had, and the flavors that you could taste, are ones that did not belong to the foods that we got. Very disappointed and would not go back. Wonton soup had no flavor and the meat inside the wontons were chewy, shrimp chips were old, chicken tasted like it was cooked with shrimp (it was supposed to be sesame chicken), and the egg roll had no flavor as well. Ended up being a waste of money as we all threw our food away."}
{"text":"We placed a large (over $40) telephone order and were given an estimate of an hour.   After waiting 90 minutes, I called to check on the order: the person who answered took my address and assured me the driver was on his way, so it should arrive in 5 minutes.  Another 30 minutes and I called again. This time, they denied ever taking my order!  Now I have a hungry family and no food.  They will never get my business again. Their food isn't good enough to tolerate this kind of service."}
{"text":"Amazing taste!!!!!!! My fav Chinese restaurant in pittsburgh. We called to order sesonal chicken with fried rice and wonton soup. I love it! Even more than pf chang"}
{"text":"I have ordered food twice from China House and both times received delicious food and very quick delivery by a pleasant driver. The portion size was huge, the meats and sea food was prepared very well and the veggies were fresh and crunchy. The entire order was great and don't forget to order the pan  fried  dumplings stuffed with meat and wrapped in a delicious perfectly fried bun. This place is great  !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little gem in Chardon! The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is always clean and inviting. We haven't had a bad dish yet! The cashew chicken, beef lo mein, pork fried rice and egg rolls are the current favorites in our house. The only seafood I have tasted is the crab rangoons, and they were absolutely delicious. Everything always tastes fresh, prices are very reasonable, and the portions are large. I highly recommend checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"China House is akin to a brick-and-mortar style mall eatery, with the typical menu mainstays.  The pleasant and dedicated staff make this place shine.  The food is fresh, well-portioned and seasoned with some care.  Perfect if you're in need of tasty, inexpensive eats nearby.  Not sure I'd bother if I wasn't already close tho."}
{"text":"Not great. Fast food quality, generic Americanized Chinese food. I've eaten several of their dishes as shared late night dinners with friends and it's okay for that purpose, primarily due to lack of other options and because they deliver.   Recently had lunch here and it was 1 star. The sesame chicken pieces were odd mixtures of dark and white meat, most of the pieces were overly fried for how small they were, and some of the pieces were just chunks of breading. I can't imagine it was cooked to order (even though I did see them heat a pan for it) since it took them about 90 seconds to reheat it on the stovetop.   THE WORST PART:  by the time I got home, the brown paper bag the lunch was served in was completely soaked. I assumed the sesame chicken container had come open, but in fact the egg roll was so incredibly greasy that it soaked through its own separate wrapper and the bag! When I opened the egg roll wrapper, there were literally tablespoons of grease sloshing around the egg roll. The egg roll itself was totally burned to black on one end. I definitely would not have accepted it had I checked my order before leaving the store.  Beyond the food, the service, prices, and wait times have all been acceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing hole in the wall! Cheap, fast, and delicious! Tangerine chicken is the most tender I've ever had from a take out. You'd be silly to not eat here if you're craving take out."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese place. Everyone has their favorites for General Tsos &/or Sesame Chicken, but if you havent eaten here... BOTH are among the best. Some of the best steamed dumplings too"}
{"text":"This order is based on delivery (yelp). During the most recent snow storm we had I didn't want to leave the house so I ordered Chinese through yelp. My food arrived within the time slot given to me, and my driver was very friendly and quick.  The food was warm, and delicious. I got the sweet and sour chicken, and the sauce came on the side. I enjoy when they do this because I can use the leftover sauce to dip my egg roll in.   A few negatives included: no fork or napkins in my delivery order, thankfully I was at home and had some on hand. They also didn't read my special request, in which I requested duck sauce on the side. Thankfully, I had the sweet and sour sauce to hold me over.  Overall, I will order from them again!"}
{"text":"I worked here five years and still go up to CH to say hi to Tina and Paul whenever I'm in town.  As most of berea and OF already knows, china house is first rate.   Having worked there, I can say that they do things right, don't cut any corners and are always preparing their food fresh.  Living in New Haven/NYC now and I still long for their spicy szechuan chicken with added black beans. Nobody does it quite like them.  Here's a secret:  Most orders taste just as good if not better steamed or w/ 'light oil' (just ask) and you won't have that 'oh i wish i didn't just eat a quart of greasy chinese food' feeling afterward.  Really.  Also, ask for your Beef Lo Mein to be extra spicy, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food. Call ahead, food will be ready in 5 minutes. Full Chinese menu with more than 100 plate/combinations. Can't go wrong with this place. Prices very reasonable!!! Probably the best place in Euclid/Willowick/Eastlake area."}
{"text":"Good food, very fast takeout.   Get a good lunch for a little less than a combo deal at a chain, and just as fast. average lunch with rice and veg is only 5.00.....20 specials under 5.50 They make the wonton and Crab Rangoon by hand ...not frozen!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall, but was pleasantly surprised.   The atmosphere is nothing special, just tables in front of the ordering counter.   The menu was very extensive and they have lunch portions for $5.20 which includes pork fried rice.    I got the chicken chow mein and my husband had the Kung Pao Chicken.   We probably waited 5 minutes and our food was ready.   The portions were very large and piping hot.   My chicken chow mein was great.   The vegetables were cooked well, there was enough chicken and I liked the fried rice.  My husband enjoyed his Kung Pao as well.  Plenty of chicken and Vegas and peanuts.   If anything, it could have been spicier,  but still had a good flavor.    I would definitely stop when in the area again.   There were plenty of people ordering food at lunch time so others must feel the same as they seemed to be regulars."}
{"text":"Reserved entire restaurant for a company event recently and was super pleased at the great service and food. Very attentive staff. Appetizers were amazing.  Also came back for lunch the next day with co-workers and got lunch specials which were great. Recommend if you are near or at the Palms."}
{"text":"There's nothing great about the place but its pretty good if you want chinese food in this area. The lo mein was pretty bad/might have been old but I liked the general taos. The dumplings were pretty standard but the egg rolls were good.   At the end of the day, I'd say this place is worth trying out. It's not great but pretty standard in the American-Chinese food department."}
{"text":"Great food as far as Chinese takeout is concerned. Owners don't speak English too well though, so communication is sometimes difficult."}
{"text":"First off this review is not the best as far as the taste and quality of the food , I tried to order 4 meals  it the snotty teenager who insulted me while I was trying to place my order stopped me cold turkey .  Just couldn't take one my second of this condescending little twit .  Fuck it , the absolute best thing to do is thank them and just walk away and spend my hard earned money at another restaurant who is happy to accept my business.  Hopefully this is read by the owner and hopefully this Littel twit learns a life lesson , be nice to people :)"}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price.  I'm probably there once every two weeks.  A nice mix of sushi and traditional chinese food.  Very clean and the service is great - owner is very friendly!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was was not good for me.  The atmosphere and staff is fine, but the food was over-sauced and oily.  It just seemed like the colors and texture of the food was wrong -- very different from other chinese buffets we've eaten at.  Everything was extra dark like there was too much soy sauce -- the fried rice, General Tso's chicken, lo mein etc.  If you go here, I would suggest you walk around and look at the food first, before you decide to sit down and eat here.  If you like buffets like Fortune Star and Hokkaido, you will NOT like this place."}
{"text":"Ok, my wife and I have frequented it as it is IN Bay.  Last time we ever do that again.  When I got my order, I took it home and spooned it out onto a plate.  Thanks goodness I didn't eat it out of the box!!!!  There was a dead fly in the food.  And this was winter time.  So it is not a common thing!  Flies in the winter time.  So it just showed how bad the cleanliness of this place is.   Do not go here."}
{"text":"I've never been quite sure what is considered true or authentic chinese food. All I know is what I like and what I don't like. And I like China House. It tastes like most other small-town Chinese restaurants. Wonton soup is good. I am not a fan of the hot and sour soup. Crab rangoons are good. Every entree I've had there has been tasty. I tend to stay away from seafood dishes though, so I there are definite blank spots in my review."}
{"text":"They have amazing chicken pad Thai and sweet & sour chicken. It's a lot of food for a good price.  100% recommend!!"}
{"text":"Update: As of August 7, 2017, they will be moving to a new location in the strip mall at 420 West Bagley (about 4 blocks west of their original location in downtown Berea). This is average Chinese food; fast and efficient, with all the usual dishes you expect from Chinese take-out.  We go here for take-out when we don't feel like cooking, and they always have the food ready by the time we get there. Restaurant is clean and well kept.  If you like, you can stand at the counter and watch the food being cooked in two enormous woks."}
{"text":"General Tsao's was slightly below average. Egg roll was awful. Haven't found Chinese in Mars area that is any good."}
{"text":"I was looking for local Chinese and so far this has been a hit for me. They have really good deals for lunch specials, absolutely love their white rice it seems to always be fresh and done to perfection. I've had their, pork and shrimp egg foo yung, their beef and broccoli, orange and sweet & sour chicken. I have yet to explore a few more of my normal Chinese food favs from here but my experience has been good so far so I trust that everything else will be made certified deliciousness"}
{"text":"Pro:  1- very professional staffs 2- very clean 3- food is great, our group ordered, shrimp, chicken, beef and duck. The first 3 were well prepared  Con: The restaurant failed miserably with Duck!"}
{"text":"Nice people... Worst chinese meal I have ever had. The seafood was gamy and mushy and everything tasted like it came out of a can. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Good sesame chicken combo , reasonably priced for takeout  Comes with rice, broccoli, egg roll and enough for two"}
{"text":"New to the area, my wife and I have been searching for a go-to Chinese restaurant. We were in the Avon area for a doctor appointment and noticed the restaurant as we were traveling to another destination.   Located in a small strip mall, the restaurant is less than impressive. In fact, it resembles more of a takeout place than dine in. The restaurant is spartan and seats only about 12 people.   The menu is typical of a Chinese restaurant. There is a luncheon selection that offered about 10 or so items, priced around $5. My wife ordered chicken chow mein and I ordered Kung Pao chicken. Both were ample servings. The food was served hot and both meals tasted great. The meals were served on styrofoam plates and with plastic cutlery.   Good food at a great value! You can't go wrong.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is located a bit too far from our hometown to consider as a regular take out restaurant (which is what I would recommend)."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive lunch specials with nice sized portions. Everyone is super friendly and the food is done very quickly. The brown rice is a little different than \" normal\" brown rice; it's hard to describe but I usually ask for noodles as a sub. ( small up charge but worth it)."}
{"text":"Poor Poor Poor!! Asked for a Garlic Chicken with no Water Chestnuts, because a co-worker had an allergy to them, guess what? Still in there!! I would eat here again. The food was pretty bad. Im starting to think all the Chinese food in this area is conveyor belt. Absolutely terrible! I'll make sure to tell my friends!!"}
{"text":"China House is my new go to Chinese take out restaurant in Pittsburgh ever since yen's closed up and then changed hands.   Keep in mind it's a take out place. You're not expecting to get gourmet food on gold lined plates - you're getting tasty food in plastic containers and not eating there. (There's only two tables)  With that in mind it's great. Big portions and I've never been let down. Sometimes you get free stuff too. Coupons for 10% off and free soda."}
{"text":"Great delivery! 30 minutes, good quality, wish I had taken pic of the delicious pork eggrolls. Some of the best Chinese I've had in Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I cannot imagine this place will be in business much longer. My husband and I ordered an inedible mess of Chinese vegetables and moo goo gai pan. My veggies were 90% napa cabbage. They should have called it Chinese vegetable. The sauce was orange water--no flavor whatsoever. His food was equally bland and awful.   When we called to complain, the owner showed no signs of caring.   We've lived in Fairview for nearly 13 years and I'd say the first ten years or so, they were fine. Quality and customer service has totally gone off the rails. We will never be going back."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place and decided to give it a try. The food was actually OK just standard hot pot items for $29.95 per person which is reasonable. However, the service was pretty bad especially for restaurant inside a casino. The server was very busy and when he finally came to our table, he kept talking Chinese even though it was obvious that not all the guests were Chinese. We waited for more than 40 minutes before getting our food. The server was always busy and other staffs pretended they didn't see you when you call, they rather clean up a table then response to you. It was a challenge getting service in this place and the server forget about you coz they are under staffed even though they are not too busy. They also missed some items we ordered since its all you can eat. Dropped off the check when we were still eating. Will not recommend. Service staffs need to be trained."}
{"text":"Very well priced. They were in the middle of cleaning up when I came in and placed an order. Two sweet & sour chicken combos. A very simple order. Came with rice and an egg roll with each. It's a good place to go if you're out this way - not going crazy over it but it's decent to grab a quick bite of Chinese."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I both got horribly sick from their food two nights ago. We had to miss a day of a convention we traveled down to Vegas specifically for. I had the House Tofu and he has the Chicken Chow Mein. I wouldn't recommend either of those at least. Would not recommend, would not go again."}
{"text":"Seriously yummy! Great portions for the price. Staff is awesome and friendly! We've tried lots of their dishes; haven't had a bad one yet! My favorite: shrimp with lobster sauce and crab rangoon. Hubby loves the chicken mei fun. SO good!"}
{"text":"When I think about this place, think about small portions,meager servings like small shrimp, and just a a little bit of meats.Orange Chicken was over cooked,. Shrimp with lobster sauce had tiny shrimp. Their noodle dish did not have much of anything. The sea bass was okay. The war wonton soup was grossly overpriced.  Want chinese food. go across the street to Ping, Pang Pong, at the Gold Goast.  10 times better, witht more reasonable prices.They charge for hot tea, and white rice..The service was very good. The food delivery was timely. A nice looking place.  Wish their food and prices were better."}
{"text":"1word DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!

{"text":"China House  I'm lucky that to this point, I've never had to write a eulogy. So here goes nothing.  I write this note days before the scheduled closing of China House, a 53 year veteran of the Bathurst and Eglinton strip. Following the demise of Ken Fong last year, it seems as though House of Chan will be the only old-school Chinese-Canadian establishment left standing in this neck of the woods, which is not entirely fair, since HoC made it's reputation on steak, not Szechuan.   For that matter, China House was never much for spice. As my colleagues below have pointed out, China House specializes in Westernized Cantonese food in all it's deep-fried, corn-starch-slurried glory. A 'secret menu' with more authentic fare was once available to Chinese customers, but an intrepid Joanne Kates outed it, and in so doing mainstreamed many of the dishes that we take for granted today. Many of the dishes that she described have made their way onto the regular menu, while most of the dine-in traffic has fled to even more 'authentic' haunts along Spadina, Gerrard, and the untamed jungle of Markham.    China House's greatest disappointments lie in it's attempts to venture outside it's traditional Cantonese formula. Hot and sour soup tasted like thickened egg-drop soaked in vinegar and sriracha, while General Tso's chicken saw crumbly yellow breading soak up sauce that was far more sweet than heat (despite a request to ditch the sugar for the sake of a diabetic diner). We had yet to try the new, healthier options, including Greg's ice cream for dessert. I regret the latter; Greg's sells some of my favorite ice cream.   Our China House experience boils down to a few routinely excellent dishes: The Dop Voy Won Ton soup is possibly the best thing on the menu. soft dumplings, assorted meats and veg in a light chicken stock. Served communally, and accented with a hit of soya sauce and a fistful of little orange noodles, it's a meal in itself. Spring rolls are competent, egg rolls are greasily good, especially when dunked in sinus-clearing mustard and iridescent plum sauce.   Deep fried butterflied shrimp are fantastic. Cut almost all the way though, they arrive as perfectly done rings of shrimpy goodness. Shrimp in Lobster sauce is similarly well-done; sauteed shrimp under a blanked to ground pork and black bean sauce. it demands an order of yang chow fried rice (more shrimp, please!) to soak up the sauce.   Moo shoo pork is also good, if on the sweet side. The meat is tender, and there's plenty of black mushroom and scrambled egg. The use of bean sprouts instead of cabbage makes plain ol' chop suey redundant, but you can feel good about ordering either. Almond Soo Guy is another deep-fried delight. We order stir-fried vegetables, if only for appearance's sake.   Other dishes feature a range of proteins and univeg accompanied by indistinguishable sauces.  Cantonese chow mein replicates the wonton soup's success, although its gravy is sweeter than most. This last reason may be why we didn't go as often as we used to, despite new ownership's best efforts (and they do deserve a lot of credit for breathing life into the space). As the neighbourhood's tastes have changed, and health issues have grown, China House kept a heavy hand in the sugar bowl. It became an occasional treat rather than a regular option.   Soon, China House will be demolished in favour of a condo development. The neighbourhood's biggest loss may be the decor, with it's bridge and pond and indoor trees. I hear that management is looking for a new home. May I humbly suggest Forest Hill Village, where I can guarantee it will be packed, at least on Christmas Day?"}
{"text":"Food is good, I drive further to get to this place. Unfortunately, they just changed the dumplings, which was the main reason I went here. I usually get just dumplings every week or two so this change happened within the last two weeks. Now they are overly salty generic chicken potstickers when they used to be some mix of red meat in a thick doughy case. When restaurants start changing menu items without telling customers, I can't trust what I'm ordering. But at least they asked my feedback when I called back the next day. Also, tried the pad Thai a few times, ok but not that great if you're used to getting it from a Thai place. They also can't make spicy food. Love the bbq boneless ribs and the lunch menu is nice, you can add a soda for 25 cents. Also get a free 2L with $25 purchase. Not sure if I'll return as often since I usually just ordered dumplings. But still better than the Chinese place by my house."}
{"text":"Extremely attentive service.  I have been three times and was served by different people each time.  The service couldn't be better.  My wife is a diabetic and we asked the server if we could get the Mongolian Beef without sugar.  She came back and said she would have every dish made without sugar but would let us know if we chose a dish where that was impossible.  We had a great meal and when we got home came the real test.  So many places lie and say the food is without sugar but it is.  My wife took her blood sugar and it was normal.  Truly a meal worth repeating."}
{"text":"Classic little Chinese restaurant for dine in/carryout.   I had a craving for Chinese and saw mixed reviews but went for it anyway. I got the General Tso's lunch special and an egg roll.   I was very pleasantly surprised by the General Tso's. Nice flavor, good crunch on chicken but not overly greasy or over sauced.  The rice was the real winner- it was not greasy at all and was quite delicious.   For the price, this was a generous serving as well.   Egg roll was ok, not much inside but killed the craving for an egg roll. I probably wouldn't get again.  Overall, solid take out place that I Willy try again."}
{"text":"Terrible, rude service and I got food poisoning I really don't recommend i was throwing up 10 times after, they only make the food look good I barely write reviews this had to be posted"}
{"text":"Y'all all are some hating ass white bitches this place is cool for a quick Bite of Chinese. If u don't like something so much why tf did u go there in the first place. Y'all folks can be so miserable. I love my Asian folks"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Chinese food. They're always quick when I order delivery and don't charge a delivery fee. Food is good and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The guy taking orders picked his nose and ate it while I was standing waiting for my order. Not sure how I feel about this place now? Foods good, but wow. I want to puke! Not sure if I'll order from them again. Gross"}
{"text":"This is a very classy beautiful Chinese restaurant. My husband and I had  Mongolian beef and Kung pao chicken. We were surprised how much the food they gave us. The food was very delicious. The service was great. The price was good for what we got. We were very impressed by the friendliness and the quality of the food. We were glad we ignored the negative reviews. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"At the Palms for a conference, figured I'd try this place, since I love good Chinese food (former New Yorker, where nearly every corner has an authentic Chinese take-out). Ordered spring rolls and General Tso chicken. Spring rolls so greasy I sent them back after taking 2 bites. I told waiter they were greasy, but they remained on the bill. Ordered my fave, General Tso's, which was composed of hard, deep fried \"chunks\" of chicken, and no broccoli. White rice was perfect. Cursory, silent service. Ample servings. Beautiful space, too bad the food isn't better."}
{"text":"Food is always good hot and authentic.  It is a good takeout Resturant small dining area but the food is good."}
{"text":"Such nice owners, and the food is always great! Good portion size, and they are willing to customize anything. Favorite Chinese food around."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese, typical offerings and atmosphere.  This is a place that you take out and call ahead.    I think that it depends what you get here.   Their egg drop soup is one of my favorites and my husband said it is in his top 5 for general tsos, but.....   their chicken with broccoli is bland.   I would say try  it out."}
{"text":"Just your typical Chinese restaurant. I've asked the owner how long they have been open and they said it's been open for about 2 decades and there is a good reason why.   From the moment you walk in, it laid out like every Chinese restaurant. The one thing that sets it apart is the quality (and the taste) of the food. Looking at the few reviews this place has (most over 2 years ago), I think this place serves the best Americanized Chinese food in Cleveland.   My go to is the chicken & beef with broccoli and it is the best I've tasted. Their general tso chicken is pretty good too. They have a lot of options and I've never been disappointed by their food.   I've talked to some of their customers and they come from as far as Eastlake and Beachwood just to get carry out.   So if you are looking for a place to grab some Chinese, this place is it. Yes there are some bad reviews but don't judge a book by its cover. Go and try it out yourself!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the reviews for this place. It seems you either love it or hate it. Either way, you are bound to leave this place with a strong opinion!  As for me, I've never had a good meal at this place, and I been there countless times. Why do I keep going? I guess I'm a masochist. I keep thinking: \"This is going to be the day that China House surprises me with a plate of delicious food\". Well, it hasn't happened yet, and I don't think it will ever happen. I've learned my lesson, China House!  The food is watery, bland, and soggy. Most of their dishes taste like they've been sitting in the sun for days. To make matters worse, the food is ridiculously over-priced, and the portions are meager. If you order any of the meat dishes, you'll soon discover that meat is almost non-existent.  I dare you to order the Cashew Chicken and find the meat. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack!  If there is a buffet in hell, it is probably catered by China House. The flavors are a complete nightmare. Yes, it's that bad. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Being new to the Pittsburgh area, I am really trying to find that go-to Chinese takeout place. Unfortunately, China house wasn't quite it.  This place is a 2.5 when it comes to food. Got the Hunan chicken and general Tao tofu and a spring roll. The food was didn't taste very fresh and the flavor was very bland. The tofu looked and tasted like it was microwaved quite a few times.    I probably wouldn't order from them again."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Chinese is the area. Huge portions that are always hot and cooked very well. Everything I've ever had here has been fantastic. Try the steak skewers, the meat is so tender and well done."}
{"text":"Great little place in my neighborhood for takeaway. My typical order consists of spring rolls and one of their soup selections. I have never had a problem with anything I've eaten here. It's always good and it is super affordable especially when compared with others in the area."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has changed and the people working there have the worst attitude. If you ask a question, they get annoyed like you should know what the menu is. They are not thankful for the business and barely say thank you when you order and pay them. Time to find somewhere else to order Chinese!"}
{"text":"Tried it again:  Delivery took 30 minutes this time around (which is great considering it took 2 hours last time).  Food was still good, hot and filling. Will continue ordering from this place."}
{"text":"Neal is very happy.  He is so happy he has allowed himself the indulgence of referring to himself in the third person.  So, why is Neal happy?  I have made a discovery today that will make my life just a little bit better.  My hometown of oakmont has been desperately in need of an asian restaurant that serves sashimi/sushi.  And, not just the tired old takeout places around here specializing in fat and grease laden egg rolls/general tso's.  Verona's got Nicky's thai (which is really good) and now Oakmont has this place.  I made my first visit to china house today for takeout.  I was actually on my way to tomanettis to get a small pie, but then I noticed this little gem.  It's located in an office building right below the tracks next to Brueggers.  Now, let me preface this by saying it isn't that the food is so amazing, although it's good.  It's that I can now get sashimi/sushi without having to drive 20 minutes,,, and they deliver!  This is the convenience that I need that I'm sure will put me over the top with mercury poisining with access so easily to raw fish.  Okay, the spot itself is what you'd expect a few 4 tops a few booths and a mini sushi bar.  It's byob and they also deliver and do take out.  It looks clean and the staff is all asian which is a good sign.  The surprising thing about this place is the menu is pretty diverse.  They have the usual stuff (general tso's, chix w/ broccoli, etc.)  However, they offer a few unexpected dishes such as baked new zealand green mussels, lamb, marinated japanese squid salad, a really big selection of sushi rolls with ingredients like soft shell crab, lobster, and salmon roe.  They also have a special diet menu.  Not the usual diet menu's which are just the normal dishes, steamed without any sauce or flavor.  They have this \"revolution diet\" menu that has actual dishes with flavor and list the calories next to them.  Today I ordered the Prawns with snow peas, broccoli, bean sprouts spicy szechuan style (475 calories according to the menu).  It was really tasty and if I didn't order it myself nothing about the dish said \"diet\".  There were about a dozen big shrimp in a flavorful sauce with really fresh crisp veggies.  It was 11.95 which seems reasonable when you consider it was packed with seafood.  I also ordered the \"white tuna\" and \"salmon\" sashimi.  I was a bit nervous because Sunday is not a good day at any restaurant to order sashimi because you know it's at least a couple days old, but this was pretty good.  It was sliced properly and was fresh.  For some reason I have a hard time finding \"white tuna\" at a lot of the sushi places around here and it's my favorite, so I was glad to see they have it here.  They also offer sashimi combo's where you can just get salmon or tuna if you want and not have to default to whatever mixture of fish they give you.  Overall, this is a great new addition and I'm really happy I can now have sashimi whenever I want without having to make a special trip.  Okay, Neal is going to finish his dinner now."}
{"text":"China House is consistently, reliably, delicious Chinese food.  Not only that the wait staff is very attentive and remembers what I like."}
{"text":"Adrian the server was fantastic explain few items on the menu in a very pleasant way . we have dinner family style he service us  like French service Style so professional you don't get that into many restaurants anymore in Vegas unless you paying $$$$. Portions on the plates are smaller than before. Not too many people for a Friday night I guess everybody's doing something else hopefully at Station Casinos don't f*** this place up"}
{"text":"Misfortune Cookies from China House.  Had I cracked them open before sampling the four different take-out items, my fortunes should have read something like this: -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Mystery Meat Chow Mein is in your future.                 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------   You will soon be very disappointed with your order. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Don't expect happiness from China House. -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Maybe just plain bad luck, but out of three visits in 7 years, with at least 3 dishes each time, we've never had anything even \"fair\".   Nothing was ever salty, but neither did any dish taste even remotely Chinese.   I've never eaten canned Asian meals---don't know if there is such a thing---but this is what I'd expect it to taste like.  This last visit was the worst of all.  Maybe other dishes are okay, but what we ordered I'd never recommend.  CHICKEN CHOW MEIN * . . . Worst \"velveting\" preparation I've ever had.  Every chicken piece looked like---and had the texture of---fat.  Pale yellow and sponge-like.  After trying just two pieces, all chicken was shoved to the side of the plate, then thrown out.  I've made chow mein several times, and whatever China House did to get this unappetizing result was either a huge mistake or ignorance of Chinese cooking techniques.  Out of necessity, I added my own soy, sesame oil, and oyster sauce to the remaining ingredients, in order to flavor this unseasoned dish---which consisted of just celery, bok choy, and a total of 6 or 7 single onion wedge slices.  No other ingredients.   No bean sprouts, water chestnuts, mushrooms, or bamboo shoots.     VEGETABLE EGG FOO YOUNG * *  . . . peas, carrots, bean sprouts, and eggs--- that's all.  No water chestnuts, mushrooms, discernible onions, or snow peas.  As basic as basic can get---and without flavor---except for the unpleasant \"earthy\"-tasting fried exterior with burned edges.  The only redeeming aspect was the brown sauce and steamed white rice.    PORK FRIED RICE * * * . . . the plainest-tasting and looking we've ever had.   Very few pork pieces, but at least no chunks of fat or gristle.  EGG ROLLS *  . . . a large (1.5\" x 1.5\") piece of hard, barely-cooked cabbage in the one I had.  Very firm exterior.  Was probably re-fried or re-heated---to warm it throughout---when we ordered.  If there was any ingredient other than cabbage, we didn't taste it or see it.  CARRY-OUT CONDIMENTS . . . no stars, since none were given.  No soy sauce, or hot mustard and sweet sauce for egg rolls, in the bag.  Used my own.   Contacted them and was given no apologies for the omission.  She said that they never give condiments unless they're asked for.  (Noticed no sign to indicate this when order was picked up.)                                                                 ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  Because it had been about 4 years since our last visit, I ordered what I believe are the easiest to prepare and probably among the most frequently chosen.  I try these dishes first from all Chinese places where we've never eaten, BEFORE any other dishes.  If a restaurant can't get THESE right, I can't imagine they'll do a satisfactory job on others.      CHINA HOUSE has the worst Chinese food we've ever eaten---all three times.  We gave it three tries and will never return.  When you think of all the wonderful ingredients that make up flavorful, inviting Chinese dishes---whether authentic or Americanized---from the unique vegetables, to the sauces and seasonings---but then to serve up such surprisingly bland results---with the absolutely bare minimum of poorly-prepared ingredients---I'd say it's time to return to square one, and begin using recipes from even the most basic of Chinese cookbooks."}
{"text":"I am truly sad. This has been my go-to place for Chinese since joining my place of employment almost 15 years ago. 1. Because they delivered to work  2. The food was tasty. 3. The price was excellent. 4. They were able to handle group orders with ease.  But, today that may have changed. (Will give them one more chance and see what happens)  The older decor of the actual business never bothered me. I think that kinda comes with the territory for most Chinese take out joints - fake marbled counters, crappy murals of strange things - like the giant cruise ship located God-knows-where?, a token fish tank (though the new fish is huge and intimidating and his tank is scattered with slightly decaying goldfish bodies among the glass marbles at the bottom), an awkward \"Asian Lady in creepy poses\" calendar freebie from some food or restaurant supply distributor, a cooler of pop cans (and random family food), a few misplaced children's toys, and a poorly light, slightly outdated light up wall of stock photo food with prices. Today the entire place seemed dusty and slightly messy compared to normal.  The owners and workers have always been polite and cheerful until today when they were short and seemed annoyed I had stopped to place my order instead of calling.  Hoping it was just an off day, I ordered the Lunch Special Shrimp Egg Foo Young ($5.25) with pork fried rice and an egg roll (+$0.60) as carryout.  When i got the bag to work there was no plastic silverware or chopsticks and no napkins or duck sauce - things I have never had to ask for before. The gravy is lumpy, oddly yellow colored and bland. (glad I asked for a few mustard packets and had salt and pepper at my desk), the egg pancakes themselves have a nice amount of shrimp but barely any veggies, and are very greasy. The fried rice has an ok flavor but has almost no veggies or pork in it.   The egg roll was basic and tasty - the shining star of an otherwise disappointing take out experience.    Did they switch owners? Was it a bad day?  Who knows? I will certainly give it another go, out of loyalty, but if it was anything like today, I'll have to say goodbye to a formerly solid place."}
{"text":"When I go visit my brother and it's just the two of us (or three of us if my wife Sheila F. comes along), we always go here. I wish this place had been open when I used to visit my dad on a regular basis when I was younger so that I could have made some late-night visits on my way home!   The food here is really good--I always get the General Tso's Chicken and it's great...nice and spicy. Portions tend to be pretty generous too.   One bonus about this place is that they don't charge for mustard sauce. Other places in Cleveland charge a quarter or something for it. Sure, it's not a king's ransom...but the free sauce is one of those nice little touches that makes me want to hop on Yelp and review China House in the hopes that it'll drum up some business for them.  Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"We order takeout fairly regularly and it's always good and fast. Service is very accommodating. I requested less broccoli and more of other types of veggies in my steamed mixed vegetables, and they were happy to adjust. They also offer brown rice, which seems like it shouldn't be a big deal, but sometimes surprisingly is at other places. They give you plenty of sauce with takeout orders too.  Very happy to have them close by."}
{"text":"Great, fast delivery... Remember this is like the Mickey D's of fast food.  My food has always been tasty and arrives hot. Some have not so good experiences and say don't go back, but that's what people say about the chains and there still swamped with loyal (and not so loyal  ) customers. :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited about this Chinese takeout place. I had read so many positive reviews online. When I arrived, I discovered that the entire place was in poor housekeeping condition. The tables were dirty;the chairs were dirty;the floors were dirt; even the walls were dirty. There where lots of bugs like gnats, flies, and other insects flying everywhere. All of this is concerning when food is being prepared in a facility. My friend and I decided that we would just get the food to go, so it wasn't such a big deal if the dining area wasn't in great shape. Unfortunately, later on we both ended up getting stomachaches from the food that we ordered. I don't really have a lot of confidence in this restaurant at this point. If you go for a meal, be aware that the state of the place is certainly far from clean. This may present health risks, but the best way to determine that is by checking with the health department."}
{"text":"The perfect americanized delicious Chinese food. Has everything and its all great. I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Don't know if the food is any good because the girl that was taking my order was so rude i hung up and called asian wok on Detroit."}
