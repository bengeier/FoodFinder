{"text":"What a surprise this place was!   We stayed at the hotel for an in-town vacation and intended on having quick appetizer before we went out for dinner. The lake views at night are incredible and the server was an expert in describing the dishes. My wife and I decided to stay for main courses and the halibut and steak was delicious.   Our server offered to pair a wine with each course and our whole experience was surprisingly great! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The menu is extremely limited and pretty expensive. The lettuce wraps don't even compare to PF Changs. It's too bad because the view and atmosphere is really nice."}
{"text":"Good ambiance, good dinner 3/5  Berk, Dorfy and I were at the Pinon Grill restaurant on Saturday night for our long-needed girl night out! Berk and I stayed at the Millennium Resort at Scottsdale, where the Pinon Grill is located that weekend.   We started with two appetizers - baby ribs and mozzarellas and tomato salad. We were really impressed by the ribs and the salad! Good job on that! On the entree, we had the scallops + grill shrimps dish, buttery sea bass dish and a steak dish! The seafood was good but only so-so in their steak. Overall, I think with the price of every dish (average of $28-$30 per dish), the quality of the food was average. Service was good, but not above the par compare to other fine dining. Not above average with the price. Desert time!... we ordered a fruity cream brulee and a very chocolaty  chocolate cake! They were good! Berk and I hit the sack after a good dinner and good laugh. Good restaurant with good friends on Saturday, but a bit doubtful I will check back again in the near future! Too many good options out there! :)"}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem. Food is outstanding, service is exceptional. The setting is super nice, on the lake with great fire features."}
{"text":"We ate at pinon grill while staying the weekend at The Mccormick. Everything i ordered was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. i was vary satisfied with the view. I dont understand the couple negative reviews i have seen because i experienced quality service and food... Maybe its hit or miss?"}
{"text":"Having lived in the Valley 25+ years, I'd come to the Pinon Grill 2-3 x a year, especially for special occasions or to bring out of town guests.  The beautiful view of the lake, golf course, gorgeous flowers and good food made it a favorite.  However, a month ago, a friend & I came to celebrate my B-day, but were SO disappointed at the dreastic menu change. No longer available were the great salads (Cobb), sandwiches or their specialty burger.  Also gone were the chips with a spicy cream cheese spread, previously put on your table without charge as a welcome while you were seated. Now the menu is mostly Asian and a bit \"weird\".  My friend ordered \"Sweet/Sour Chicken\" which looked like a McDonald's order of chicken nuggets with a gelatinous sauce on top. No rice - that was $4 X-tra!  Even the fries for the expensive burger were X-tra as well. Our waiter, Jesus, was very attentive and efficient, but was upset at hearing all our negative comments about the new menu, especially when I said \"We were NEVER coming back again\".  Of course it had nothing to do with him, just the sheer disappointment of how much this fine restaurant has changed.  The views are still stunning & tranquil but can't make up for the \"weird\" menu."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel, so went here sheerly because of the convenience of location.  Pretty room, and had it not been raining biblically, the outdoor seating would probably have been gorgeous.   After about 5-7 minutes, the table (seated after us) had water and coffee.  We...did not.  After attempted flagging and eye contact, finally a server appeared.  We ordered our breakfast, eggs Benedict and fresh berry waffle, two waters, a coffee, and a small OJ.   They removed one of our two coffee cups, understandable.  So I wanted the coffee, they took my cup.  Fine, I took the mug left by the boy and put it by me.  Several minutes later, coffee!!! The server poured the coffee, placed it by the boy.  Odd.  What, did he look more like he needed the coffee?? Anyway...the food.  Fresh berry Belgium waffle, was just a waffle with an orange slice and one (1) raspberry.  No whip? Com'on!  Eggs bene... Decent.  The hollandaise sauce had something different to it, but I still cleaned the plate.  And the Sonoran potatoes...omg, delish. I could have eaten a whole plate of those!  Either way...not the best experience.  Terrible service.  Just 'ok' food. For convenience staying at the hotel...just go have breakfast."}
{"text":"This resort's website states:\"Piñon Grill serves up the finest Sonoran contemporary cuisine in a relaxed and tranquil setting.\" Not when I was there two weekends ago. My wife and I were one of three tables and the beautiful day and view from the restaurant patio were ruined by loudly played hard rock. They did turn it down, a bit, when all the tables asked, but would not change the music choice. Kiss, Led Zep. love'm, but not when trying to enjoy a tranquil view and a quiet meal. As to the food, it is hit and miss. The lettuce wraps are the best I have ever had, by far. But the Asian, sweet and sour chicken dish looks and tastes like a serving of Chicken McNuggets topped with a neon orange goo. Our soup was good, but ruined by the fact it was chock full of some type of chips that quickly turned into gloop with texture of soaked saltines.  Pinon has a great location, but it needs more TLC."}
{"text":"My family frequents this restaurant as locals and it is always a guaranteed good meal. There are often numerous specials to choose from. Damon is an incredible server who goes above and beyond in every way, especially accommodating my elderly grandparents. There is a large tv if you are interested in watching a game otherwise you can be seated in the dining room away from the tvs. Good spot!"}
{"text":"I went here on a lunch date and fully enjoyed my meal as well as the view. Not only where these two key things worthy of a 4 star rating for my dining experience the waiter was extremely attentive even though when we walked in there was not a soul to be found in the front lobby. Once we were seated by a very kind waiter (don't remember his name, sorry!) this experience was a real treat! I will definitely be going back to this place the wrap I had was phenomenal, nachos were unexplainable! My vodka cranberry I ordered was good and strong again another key reason why this place was all around winning! Get the nachos, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"It's just okay. It's a hotel restaurant. They try but you cannot shake the feeling that you are in a spruced up coffee shop."}
{"text":"An obscure restaurant in the Millennium hotel. Fabulous service! Wonderful food. Thank you for accommodating our breakfast business meeting and treating our group fabulously. Pedro and his team rocked!"}
{"text":"I stay at this hotel often for work and although I have never sat in the dinning room I have ordered room service many times. The food is great. Always perfectly cooked from breakfast omelets to salmon and asparagus. I only gave three stars bc I have not had the full dinning room experience."}
{"text":"My family and I have been staying here and eating here for years.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Always a wonderful experience.  It has been two years since we have been here but arrived last night.  Dining room was closing in 8 minutes.  They stayed open for us and we had superb food, wonderful service and the prices were amazing.  Absolutely wonderful.  No place in Scottsdale has the view this place has.  Would like to post a picture.  Look for it."}
{"text":"We live a few minutes' drive from Millennium  McCormick, home of the Pinon Grill. We recommend it very highly. The entire facility is inviting, open, bright, and airy. The restaurant overlooks a beautiful, large covered patio by a lake with mountain views in the distance.   The friendly hostess seated us at a table by a large window. Irma, our server, greeted us warmly and took our drink orders. My wife and I explored the breakfast menu as we sipped our  coffee and tea. Ellen ordered what turned out to be amazing lemon ricotta pancakes with bacon. I ordered their loaded breakfast sandwich on toasted rye. It was superb!   Irma checked on us during the meal with a highly professional touch, giving the Pinon Grill a special warm character. We plan to go back for more of their special brand of hospitality, good food, and relaxation."}
{"text":"This place is really trying to be upscale, but it's not.  To me an upscale place is where you can't afford to bring your little brats.  First, the good.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  Refills kept on coming.  I ate here for 6 meals over my 2 day stay at the resort and I never ordered the same dish twice just so I could try a variety.  Here is a rundown of what I ate and the quality:  -Chicken Quesadilla: So soggy it was falling apart, inedible -Arcioech (sp) Scallops:  It's Arizona, there are no fresh scallops.  They were overcooked and the seared spices were a soggy mess.  The potatoes and Dijon dressing were great though. -Eggs Benedict: Very good, cooked perfectly.  They do it a little different and give you smoked salmon instead of canadian bacon.  Not a bad change but they were a little cheap on the quantity of salmon. -Matador Hamburger: Fantastic burger and they will cook it rare.  If you order one well done, you shouldn't be allowed to review any red meat. -Center Cut Filet: Obviously not a prime cut.  Perfectly cooked and seared.  Veggies were also well seasoned and not overcooked.  Good choice. -Salmon: Great seasoning, slightly overcooked and bizarre sauce with the consistency of pudding under the garnish.  The sauce added nothing to the fish. -Creme Brulee: Very nicely done, maybe a little too much heat on the sugar, but still delish! -Caprese Salad: Tomatoes were flavorless and old (dried out appearance). Mozzarella was obviously a Costco purchase (not bad though).  If I wasn't eating here for free, I would balk at it just for the prices let alone the mixed quality of the food.  No hot waitresses here, but the server staff was great."}
{"text":"Ugh, this place is just terrible. It tries to be high-end but has nothing going for it -- not even that view of the ugly fake lake. Definitely not worth the hefty price tag!   We had a 6:30 reservation that night and they had already run out of the rib appetizer by the time we got there. When I ordered a salad and soup as an entree, they told me I shouldn't do it because the two plates \"wouldn't fit next to each other.\" I persisted, and they made it seem like a huge inconvenience -- but when the plates came out, everything fit just fine.   My mom's salad was wilted and my lobster chowder was bland with absolutely no taste. The salmon entree was dry and the carne ranchero annoyingly chewy. We really couldn't get out of here quickly enough, and ended up snacking in our hotel room afterwards!"}
{"text":"Defrigginlicious. The food was superb, the view was gorgeous and the service was phenomenal. We were seated out on the patio where it overlooks the water and fire features. Once you sat down it was so peaceful it was like you stepped out of the city into a romantic getaway. We both loved all our food and Damon our server recommended a great appetizer of ceviche tacos which normally I never would've looked twice at.  The only reason I'm not giving it the last star is because the restaurant should've scheduled an additional server. We had to wait much longer than usual to order, ask for desert and to get our check, although our food came out quickly. No fault of Damon but at one point he had 11 tables going and could've used some help."}
{"text":"Excellent steak dinner for our party of 4 with a Groupon (avail right now). I had the filet and the others had ribeye. Everyone was extremely happy with their food. The staff was attentive but not bothersome. If it was daylight the view would have been great."}
{"text":"This was a real mixed experience. Had I paid full price, I would have been pissed, but I used a restaurant.com discount, so we got $25 off our $57 meal. We paid $32, which was about what the meal was worth.  First, the weird: We walked in on a Tuesday night at 7:15, and there was no one at the hostess station. Oh yeah. There was no one in the entire restaurant, either. After a while, a waiter came out of the kitchen and greeted us. I've never been in an entirely empty restraurant before. Eerie. A few other diners came in after, but it was basically empty all night.  The food was okay. I had a sirloin steak that had a nice char to it as well as a decent red chili sauce for a good kick. But the portion was TINY. Like, maybe 6 oz. The fingerling potatoes tasted like fingerling potatoes. The spinach was uninspiring.   My other half had the fajitas, which smelled good. He said it was fine, nothing special, but nothing bad, either.  It was one of those meals that necessitated a meal after it. Or a big snack, anyway.  The service, given that there was no one else in the restaurant, was really slow. Nice waiter, not negligent, but we waited a long time for everything. Not sure why.  This restaurant is worth a trip if you have a coupon. Otherwise, I think you can do a lot better."}
{"text":"The BEST restaurant in Scottsdale hands down. The chefs, Thomas and Colin, are incredibly talented and make the most amazing specials. Tonight I had butter cod with a prickly pear reduction. Last week the surf & turf. DELICIOUS! Make sure to sit lakeside on the patio. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 3 or 4 different times.  We always take an Entertainment or Restaurant.com gift certificate for a buy one get one free or $25 off deal.  Last night was our best experience yet there.  We ordered a caesar salad to share and when it was delivered the kitchen had already split the plate. I was surprised how much there was after it was split, it was plenty.  I must almost mention the rolls and butter.  I usually don't, it's like commenting on a mexican restaurant's chips, but these were great, crusty but still chewy. But it was the honey butter that really made it great.  After salads, the entrees came.  I had salmon and my wife had the sirloin (it was her concession since I would take her to Flemings because we already went to Temple and a reception before dinner).   Both were amazing.  the salmon was the best I'd ever had and I boarded with a family who fished for salmon in the north pacific off Alaska every year and they knew how to cook salmon.  It had a great slightly spicy glaze with this amazing lemony sauce on a bed of greens.  My wife's sirloin was melt in your mouth tender with a spicy, smokey barbeque sauce served with garlic and buttered spinach and roasted baby potatoes.  This was a meal fit for a king, yet we left without leaving more than $40!  4 stars to Pinon Grill."}
{"text":"Went to Piñon Grill for the first time today. The food was unreal. We had the Flat Iron Steak and the Braised Short Ribs. Both were fantastic. The Bruschetta was also a very good appetizer. Our server, Damon, was incredible. He makes very good recommendations and knows the menu very well. Also has great customer service. We'll be back soon!  Oh ya and get the creme brûlée for dessert, whether you have room or not, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The place is nice. Nice ambience. Our dinners on the Special menu, salmon and halibut, were very tasty. Great location.  Please, please stay away from the wonton Nachos. They were very salty, the chips tasted more like burnt, fried chips and the teriyaki and quac really didn't come together as well as I had hoped. Other than that, it was reasonably priced, portions are plenty and a good date night."}
{"text":"Service was so slow even though the restaurant was completely empty! Our waiter was also slow and in a bad mood! The food was close to average not worth the money!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is fucking amazing like wow. The food, the drinks wow . Our waiter Damon was just amazing with amazing recommendation on what to eat, drink and pair with the steak. I had the rib-eye and oh my god cooked to perfection, nice soft and melted in your mouth. This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale , the views are breathtaking. It was definitely an amazing night. Thanks to Damon and thanks to piñon grill the experience was divine. Definitely recommend this place . WOOOOOWWWWWWW"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place has only 2.5 stars, and feel obliged to review. We both had the ribeye steaks, medium-rare and medium-well, cooked to perfection. We were warmly welcomed upon entry by the bartender Lamar, and our server Damon was excellent, being extremely attentive and knowledgable about the specials, how every item was cooked, and its origin. The view was also excellent, and they had a few good local beers on tap which wasn't necessarily expected for an upscale place in Scottsdale. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I went here for a beer and food pairing event hosted by Dogfish Head Brewing.  The meal was ok, the service was very good.  I don't know what a normal dinner here would be like, but I am pretty sure some of the appetizers we were served could easily be purchased at Costco and the various courses were not nearly as good as I had expected.  I don't know if they were unable to deliver great food due to the menu of this event or what, but I don't think I would ever go back."}
{"text":"Living in McCormick Ranch has allowed us to find some hidden treasures. The Pinion Grill in the McCormick is a nice place to enjoy some of Scottsdale scenery. The patio has done of the must beautiful vistas overlooking the lake at McCormick Golf Club. The only negative is the lack of a happy hour. Homero event manager and Antonio the bartender filled us in on the event scene at the hotel and in the neighborhood. Come at sunset.  After my review Homero brought out a sample of the lettuce wraps. Awesome!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Going to start with the only good thing, the view. Pond and ducks it's good atmosphere, however food it's very poor. Reserved a table for the holiday and it wasn't ready when we got here, it was given away. On Mother's Day, we got pancakes for breakfast. Very under cooked, they took back for re do and couldn't fix it. So we gave up on that and still payed full price. Messed up the kids orders and other orders as well. Then they ran 2 good credit cards and told us they were bad.... Had to re boot the system and make us wait. Think, you have 2 credit cards and they are not working, don't tell the customer the card is bad. Not good business practice, on a holiday this place is empty, and now we know why. Being attacked by flys we moved on, sorry to say this place is a fail. Wish it would have been different."}
{"text":"Character bartender. Great broasted chicken. Want to go back and try the prime rib. The bar is awesome. Ice around the bar to keep your drinks and beer cold. Fun little place. I'll be back"}
{"text":"The service was so great we used a groupon and our server kept updating us with how much we had left. The fried rice and lettuce wraps are super. Yummy"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place was so empty. I'm a local and had a friend in town from NYC, so thought we'd try something off the beaten path. Great prices, nice selection, great food and service. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the a previous reviewer when he says that he had 'a real mixed experience'...I am giving it 2 stars, but part of me wants to say 1...   We ordered this as room service, they were having a really good deal on room rates, which included $25 dining credit and waived resort fee...(but enough about that, I'll talk about it in the hotel review later...)...   Anywho, we ordered from the breakfast menu (YAY! Look at us, awake before 11am on a Sunday! hahahaha in your face, Sucka!)   Um...yeah, so the boy ordered the chicken fried chicken breakfast w/ a bagel on the side and I ordered the McCormick Omelet w/ a side of toast (yes...you have to pay extra to get toast with your omelet, bizarre) and 2 small cups of juice...um...$44??? YIKES! Okay, so yes, it's room service, but do you really need to GOUGE people like that?   Nevertheless, we paid the piper...(only to find out that the $25 dining credit isn't valid for breakfast the next day...only for the night you check in...would've been nice for someone to SHARE that info...but again, that's reaching back into the hotel review...   Here's the bad...when the $9 chicken fried chicken \"breakfast\" was revealed, it turned out to be two chicken strips on a couple of biscuits with sausage gravy drizzled on it...and no...I don't mean some sort of fancified McDonald's extra crispy chicken breast select strips, I mean, the kind that you get when you order off of the kids meal at a restaurant. 1/2 a step above a chicken nugget. *sigh* He was heartbroken. I could see it in his eyes. I was also heartbroken, because I had planned to scam a biteful from his plate. *sniffle*   Here's the good...the omelette was very tasty. But the BEST part of it was the Sonoran Breakfast Potatoes. Absolutely delicious, I believe they are hashbrowns with sour cream, jalapenos, and some other seasoning in them, but it definitely is the reason that the review is at 2 stars instead of 1.   (Also, once we got past the whole chicken strip mental barrier, it wasn't bad...but seriously, that was not a $44 breakfast, we didn't even get any alcohol in the juice!)"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for Valentine's Day the parking lot was the first sign no to stop.  We went to check it out and the view was beautiful over looking the lake but the stench made us leave. So can't say anything about the food but can tell you smell is awful. This might be a good place for visitors but for locals so many other great Scottsdale restaurants with better views."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this restaurant.  We sat outside in very comfortable chairs with a great view of the lake.  Service was fantastic and it should have been as we might have been the only customers.  So the beer was $6 a pint and food was expensive.  A couple two OZ BBQ sliders were $9 and everything was ala carte.  The specials would get you a nice steak for a nice price of $34.  The food was good except for the nachos which appear to be a hold over from some cooking show.  Really putting Pork Rinds on nacho's?  Just ok which explained where all the customers were."}
{"text":"Waters were already served when we sat down. We had floaters in one of them. We ordered flat iron steak medium rare with over easy eggs. What we got was the total opposite. We sat down and waited at least 15 minutes before having a server come to us. The food was something I could have made at home. The server never checked on us once after bring our food but didn't hesitate to bring us our bill."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast as we've read about the $4 mimosas all day. The hostess asked us if we want to sit inside or outside on the deck. We said deck. Here's what we didn't know - the deck is part of another restaurant where there are no $4 mimosas :( .   There are, however, $4 miniature glasses of regular orange juice, that on top of being pricey, just tasted bad like it was spoiled.   Now for the good part: the lake view is splendid! (always wanted to use this word in a review - I always imagine it being said with a British accent).  The service was high class. Tentative and luxurious.    The food was good. Waffles were served with real maple syrup. Portions are not large (which was perfect for us).  The whole menu is a little overpriced and I just feel that value for the money is not that great.  I know there's a lake and it's in a \"resort\", but drop a few bucks from every dish, make the OJ freshly squeezed and I'd throw in 2 more stars."}
{"text":"The four star is for breakfast only. The service is good, food is good, the setting is five star. The pricing is fair for the setting. Would give a five star but for some reason they shut breakfast down at 11am, which is senseless and especially disappointing on Saturday and Sunday.  It would be a 1 star for dinner. Very expensive to get poor service and ok food. I am glad I had a Groupon or I would have been very upset with the dinner."}
{"text":"Most amazing dinner experience. This is our second time coming here. First time was already great. The atmosphere, the location, the excellent service and the most amazing food. And also this time we were not disappointed. We had Alaska grilled Halibut and grilled Salmon with truffel. Both dishes prepared to the highest point of deliciousness. We were very grateful for Damons recommendation and his stunning service. Best waiter ever."}
{"text":"The restaurant was awesome experience. Food and service was superb. The lake side view with fire pit was to die for. I loved it"}
{"text":"Lamar was a awesome server and was very attentive made the visit great! The food was wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we are always a bit unsure about a hotel restaurant. Wow, were we pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, the prices were realistic, and Damon was a great waiter. My husband had the Halibut special, and loved it. I had the grilled salmon, also prepared perfectly and very flavorful. The sides were great. Loved the broccoli &a cauliflower with aioli. You can sit inside or on their huge patio. Overall a very enjoyable meal/experience."}
{"text":"I learned of this restaurant from restaurant.com and tried this restaurant for the first time for a romantic dinner.  Although restaurant.com is a great opportunity for a restaurant to obtain new customers by showcasing its food, service and ambience, this restaurnat feel far short and I will not be returning.  The dining room was closed due to a private party, but I was not told that when I made the reservation one hour prior.  Therefore, we were seated in the bar.  Very romantic---not!  It had no atmosphere and was very cold; therefore, we had to wear our jackets during dinner.  Waiter was not accommodating, not attentive and charged us an automatic 20% tip, despite the fact that restaurant.com coupon did not require that."}
{"text":"We had a pleasure of having a dinner there tonight. I've had a Groupon from there I needed to use so we went not expecting much. It was in McCormick Millennium Hotel in Scottsdale. The parking lot was almost empty and the restaurant was empty when we got there. Was seated right away and a friendly waitress told us about the specials as she gave us the menu and took drink orders. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and every thing we ordered came out beyond our expectation. The chicken was cooked perfectly with this delicious sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus as side dishes were wonderful. We had a lot of food yet still didn't come out to be the full amount of the Groupon so we took 2 desserts home for later.   All in all, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant even if you are not staying there. The view of the golf course was nice and the restaurant is very casual. Great service too."}
{"text":"My fiance had the New York strip and he ordered medium but it came out medium well. It was still tasty. I got the grilled sockeye and it was a thin end piece and over done and waay over sauced. The mashed potatoes were good but they weren't the garlic mashed as stated on the menu. Presentation was good, service was good as well."}
{"text":"Don't understand the bad reviews...I have been coming here for a long time and the food is great!  Damon is always spot on with his recommendation and the patio view is absolutely gorgeous!  I am a realtor in town and always refer this place and my clients always are happy!  Good Job Damon and the other crew behind our meal!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance.  Romantic getaway in Millenium Hotel on Scottsdale Rd.  Enjoy it all. Irma the server is out of this world, & so is all the good & Chocolate cake"}
{"text":"Food was decent and fresh. The staff is always friendly and the views are great, especially at night and during the holiday season.   If you can get a Thanksgiving type meal here, I recommend that you do."}
{"text":"Looking for a romantic dining experience with below average food?  Here it is.  We were excited to try this place because we'd heard about the patio seating overlooking a lake, romantic lighting, and even an outdoor fire pit.    But as we were being seated, we noticed the restaurant was almost empty.  Not a good sign.  It took a while for a server to approach our table.  When we asked to see the prix fixe menu, he seemed annoyed.   We decided against ordering from the prix fixe menu anyway, because it was solely Irish food designed to commemorate St. Patrick's Day, even though we were there a week or so after the holiday.  It took another long while to actually place our food order.   I also asked for an ice tea refill, which never came.  This is not the kind of service you'd expect for a \"fine dining\" experience.  As for the food, after our salad course, we were presented with a complimentary amuse bouche which was a little bit of olive oil, cheese, and a cherry tomato, served stylishly in a shot glass (see pic).  This seemed like a promising way to start our meal.  My husband had the filet and he said it was good.  I had the pork chop and it was awful.  Most of it was grizzled fat, and when I could find a pocket of lean meat, it was dry and flavorless.  I'm usually not one to complain, but the meat was so tough, I had difficulty cutting it, even with a big steak knife.  I should have returned it, but I didn't want to make a scene in such a beautiful environment.  I regret that decision.  Yes, the patio setting is lovely, but given the poor service and sub-standard food, we won't be returning"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here. Quiet, peaceful dinner with a beautiful view of the sunset. The waiter was very helpful, attentive and knowledgeable of the dishes as well as the area and other fun things to do for the weekend. I had the Kobe Beef Flat Iron and it was amazing! So tender you could cut it with a butter knife. My boyfriend had the Grilled Sockeye Salmon and was also very impressed. I also highly recommend the prickly pear margarita of course being in Arizona"}
{"text":"My mom and I ate here during our stay at the hotel and our experience with both has been the same: beautiful setting with mediocre service.  Upon being seated for breakfast, it took us 25 minutes just to receive water and coffee. This included getting up to find a server since we didn't see anybody in the first ten minutes of being seated. Once we finally got our water, then our coffee, we waited another 10 minutes to receive the cream we asked for. The restaurant probably had about 10-12 tables occupied at the time, something the 3 servers working certainly should have been able to handle in a better manner. (The tables around us waited just as long to be greeted and receive drinks.)  The food came within a more reasonable time frame and was average and what you'd expect of a hotel breakfast.  If they upped their service level even just slightly, they'd offer a much better dining experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  We chose the Pinion Grill for a special occasion.  Very nice view but very slow service and unacceptable food.  We both chose the rib eye steak which was a huge mistake.  It was very thin and tough. The waiter apologized for the slow service and comped one of the steaks, but both the venue and the food choices were a mistake."}
