{"text":"Minimal selection of books. Staff is as cold and unwelcoming as I've ever found in a library."}
{"text":"Great small library, usually very quiet, with a history museum next door. They cater to an older clientele, but you can get books from the other Maricopa County libraries sent to this branch."}
{"text":"Finally made time to go to the library today and got my library card. It took a whole 10 minutes and was quite painless. Library is adjacent to town hall and where the new ritzy townhouse are being constructed near the famous Fountain. The outdoor space is very calming and quiet. Outside you will be surrounded by beautiful bronzes and sculptures ranging from chlldren to musicians to animals before you find your way into the library.  As far as the library is concerned, it's not a sprawling 2 story library like my favorite one in Vegas but it does the job. Since I only read new books, if you like personal development and business books, they are scarce. Usually I'm able to check out a dozen at a time but I was pushing it pretty hard in trying to get 3 new books to read for the week. Looking forward to diving into a ton of winter reading here and can't wait to see how their inter library exchange works in regards to ordering books from other locations. Stay tuned.  Will write an accompanying review soon about the museum next door. Heard it was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Rude staff, Nasty actually. Heaven forbid you interrupt their personal conversations at the front desk. Decent selection of everything! loads of computers, clean and very organized.... Staff is the only problem."}
{"text":"I've resided in Fountain Hills for a little over 6 years now and love my community, including our lovely library!  The library is in a nice building and centrally-located to all residents. They do have books, but I wish they offered more inventory as I'm too lazy to pre-order from another location. Or (God forbid), drive to an alternate branch. Tons of DVDs (movies, TV series/seasons) which I love!  They have a generous amount of PCs for folks to use for web surfing, job searching, Facebooking - whatever. I wouldn't attempt to pull up porn or anything illegal though - you'd get maybe a block alert, or suspended from library and privileges revoked! Ha ha!  I also like that my library sells used books for sale in front entrance area at times.  I've never had a negative interaction with any of the staff there - everyone is helpful and pleasant! If you don't want to have any interaction with humans during your next library visit, don't worry - they have auto-check-outs via computers towards main doors."}
{"text":"This is a great library for such a small town. They have tons of DVDs to check out. Carmine, one of the front desk staff members, was very helpful finding me what I wanted. Their selection of books isn't huge, but they do have an online lending library that you can download to your e-reader which I find very user friendly."}
