{"text":"Pretty good food.

I've never gone there, always gotten delivery, so I can't say anything about the location.

The best thing about Joey's food, is the price! You can get really good burgers for under 4 bucks. You'd probably spend more at McDonalds for less quality. 

They have a pretty good variety of food on their menu. A little odd that the variety of beverages outnumbers the food, but menu is still great. 

My favorite is their french fries. Taste great and always HOT!

My only complaint is the amount of ice that is put in their sodas. Back off the ice guys. 

We love Joey's and even have them labeled in my contacts under, \"Mmmmm Joeys\". =)

UPDATE: They have changed their fries and sadly, they aren't as good. This was my favorite menu item and I really dislike the new fries. Bummer."}
{"text":"Dine in your car, dine outside, order at the drive-thru window or online for delivery or take-out.  I have never been to a fast food restaurant that offers so many options before. Talk about convenient!

Hubby and I enjoyed a quick lunch at Joey's last weekend on our way to the movie theatre.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I ordered the 1/4 Pounder Deluxe and my man ordered the Prime Rib Burger with mushrooms.  The fries were golden and the beef was tasty.  The only complaint my husband had was that his burger didn't come with condiments.  Next time, we'll ask for them to be added.  

We're looking forward to trying their gyro, the South Side Sea Dog, onion rings, and the Texas BBQ sandwich they're adding soon.  Joey's is a burger joint made for those in a hurry. . without compromising taste or quality.  

Every town needs a Joey's!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place from the hotel directory where I was staying.  The menu looked good for what we were looking for, so I decided to order for my family of five ( three kids under 5).  About a half an hour later, my phone rang.  I was expecting it to be the delivery in the lobby.  Instead, it was the girl who took my order telling me that they re going to have to charge me a long distance fee AND that it would be an additional 30-45 minutes until my order arrived.  I asked to speak with a manager, who was more than accommodating.  He took off the long distance charge and comped one of the items.  One hour went by and i still had no food.  The delivery man called and informed me that he was given the wrong address.  Another 30 minutes went by, still no food.  When he finally showed, i still tipped him well, since he seemed frightened to be the one to have to deliver my food.  The order was accurate, but the food was cold, over-cooked, and flavorless.
     
I will certainly never order from this place again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I used to claim to be a vegetarian. Thank you Joey's South Side Burgers for helping me break that. I mean, its right down the street from where I (sometimes) work, super cheap (under $4 for a burger, fries, and drink), locally owned, and delicious! I try to not eat fast food all the time, but I guess Joey's isn't the worst. Fast and friendly service too. The only issue I've had is sometimes they put too much condiments on. So, get plenty of napkins."}
{"text":"Nothing more than average burger. Tasted just like a Mc'Donalds dollar menu burger.  Fries were awful. Whole family was disappointed."}
