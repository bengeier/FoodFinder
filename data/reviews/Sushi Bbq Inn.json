{"text":"I love eating here. Make sure you make reservations, because it can be really busy. But be aware that you often have to wait for long periods of time even if you do have reservations on a busy night. The food is worth the wait though! Great staff."}
{"text":"OMG this place is the best! I am an all time sushi lover and the BBQ was even BETTER then the sushi!! My husband brought me here as a surprise because he knew i loved sushi and now i ask to go back all the time !!  Im the type of person who like really interesting- unique experiences. (Im still looking for a place where you can sit down on the grown to eat like they do in japan if anyone has found one yet)   anyways they are a bit unique because they have a fire BBQ in the middle of the table which your meat comes raw and you cook yourself..   its kinda busy.. but the staff are really quick.  the lighting is pretty dim. good for a first date   definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"The price for all you can eat was great but all I could eat wasn't always that good. Okay so Calgary is land locked and sushi will never be as fresh as it could be here. That being said some of the rolls I ate tonight were not the greatest.   I ordered a volcano roll though I think they brought me something else... it was ok. The texture was strange and it tasted alright but not like a volcano roll. I also kept ordering yam tempura which never came so i was really sad about that. I LOVE yam tempura. I did get 1 yam with the shrimp tempura but it wasn't enough also sooo strange that they kept the skin on the avocado.  Anyway my boyfriend wanted to try the BBQ bit but after I looked inside it and saw mold I decided maybe we better stick to what we know. The place was super busy for a Sunday night.  We ordered tea which was luke warm and quickly got cold even in the little tea pot. Meh I've had better I did like the cooked portion of the meal. I also really enjoyed my spicy tuna cone. Other than that it was alright. Service was quickish. We did miss out on some of our orders but decided we didn't want to sit there all night waiting for it to come. Although I really would have waited for the yams... I have issues. I'd go again. I'll just have to stick to the more common rolls at this place."}
{"text":"This place is usually packed! It's annoying to wait a while to sit but the sushi is worth it.  My favourite dish is the tofu teriyaki.  It's sooooo good.  I haven't ever gotten the all you can eat sushi; I just order a la carte.  I have never been disappointed at sushi bbq in and that's why I'll always return, even if the service is not so great and the parking lot is always jammed."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this location for the last 7 years and this last Friday, I  was extremely dissapointed by their \"service\".   First, let me inform you that they have JUST opened after being closed for a few weeks due to the recent renovations which look like they were rushed. None of the tables have been replaced, or reupholstered. The old outdated in table BBQ's are still there and still unreliable as those who frequent here know how they are in need of replacing . The dining area has been expanded since their recent aquicisition of the space that used to be the Frame+Art business right next door, which gives them a bigger seating area around the sushi chefs station and a separate dining area that does not have the in table BBQ's. For when you wish to order from the regular menu.  The menu itself hasnt changed. The all you can eat menu food quality is still outstanding. Portion sizes are good and will fill you up before you know it. And that's where the good things end.  Where they lose points other than the lack of reinventing the space is the lack of service. The staff is disorganised, unmotivated, have no tableside manners, don't communicate with one another, show no initiative that they want to be there. Any kind of managerial or leadership is non existent. Or any management for that matter.  It took 25 minutes from when my wife, two daughters( 7 and one year old) and myself walked through the door before anyone acknowledged us and offered us a table; even though we told them that we has a reservation and the place was empty.  When we did sit down it took another 20 minutes before a server came and took our drink orders. But we were not given an all you can eat menu list or pencil, drinks, plates, chopsticks etc until after we reminded them the fourth time.  When we finally put in our food order and got our drinks, the restaurant was only a third full and yet, it took almost an hour before we received our FIRST round of sushi. An hour! And the entire time we had to keep asking for missing food items and sending other items back that were sent to us by accident  I am very dissapointed and will not be coming back here again. Which sucks to say because again, we have been coming here for 7 years. And if you think I'm joking you can literally just walk out without paying for anything because no one gives the host station a second look.   My advice:: Go to SAIT across the street and take their 2 day sushi making course and make your own at home for half the cost of paying $25 a head."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Sushi BBQ Inn. It's the kind of place my group of friends all went to when we were teens (because we all know how fun it is to play with a propane grill when you're 16). I know back in the day you used to get large portions, and the quality was A-OK, but not so in present times."}
{"text":"Definately one of the best Korean BBQ places in Calgary. I say that because the best deal at this place is the all you can eat for $23.99. The only rule is, you pay for what you don't eat, which is fair. They have a large menu with all types of sushi, and as far as the bbq goes, they offer lamb, chicken, beef, and pork, squid, fish etc... You are sat at a table in which you have a stove type deal in the middle. You are brought your meat on plates, and can cook it to your liking. The service is friendly enough, but more about eficiency, and getting people in and out, but despite this, worth every penny. On weekends this place can have long lineups around inner time, so don't go hungry."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 3 years now, and I haven't been since last August, until last night. They've added a few new items to their menu, and overall quality has improved. Don't expect the best but I enjoyed every roll I ate last night. The bbq  in the middle of the table is fun, and adds to the experience. Sometimes you don't get all the sushi you order, but hey, who doesn't over order at all you can eat anyway. Our server was also great.  It's good for an all you can eat place. Price wise, it's probably the same as going to your favourite sushi place and ordering quite a bit. I still go because I like the bbq aspect, and I can order all the yam tempura and gyoza I want :)"}
{"text":"Would not recommend all you can eat.  Food is average, but lots of rice and thin slice for sushi.  Would not come back."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years... We don't *love* the sushi, it's pretty basic style and the service is hit and miss. However, the fish is always fresh, the place is always buzzing, and the prices cannot be beat!  Don't go here to impress someone, go here when you just *need* your sushi fix.   Tip #1:  You cannot order a la carte Friday through Sunday nights.  Only all-you-can-eat is available on those nights.  Tip #2: The prices are low enough here that you only really need to order all-you-can eat if you are planning on having the BBQ meats.  Tip #3: The sashimi is not all-you-can-eat, but rather one order per diner.  Tip #4: If you get the all-you-can eat, order the tapioca milk for dessert.  Mild and unusual, it's strangely addictive."}
{"text":"Not the best BBQ. Salmon nigiris were good, however ive had better. The meat we had was still frozen when it came out. Service was super slow on a Monday night..."}
{"text":"I've been here probably about 4-5 times since they opened and it's a solid \"alright\". One thing that thankfully has not changed is the $25 price tag...for that I give them respect because many other similar restaurants would have hiked their prices by now. The thing is, I can spend about $25 at a place that serves better sushi and leave more satisfied. Sushi BBQ Inn has all the makings of a great experience, but I guess I feel like something else is missing and I think that it is the quality of the food. The whole BBQ at your table thing is kind of fun I suppose. The thing is, just like I'm having trouble writing the review, it's hard to find anything to say about this place that really stands out from the rest. I think I might just leave it here then...it's worth a trip if you haven't gone, but it's your company that will enhance this experience more than anything. Oh and don't over order because you will get stuck paying for the food you didn't eat (unless you hid the food in napkins and made a trip to dispose of that in the bathroom garbage - or throw them in a purse for later)."}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi and Korean BBQ is good, but it use to be great. I've been a repeat customer for approximately four years. The sushi and cuisine use to be fantastic and flawless. The Korean BBQ dishes were always juicy and tender. However, something happened over the years. The portions started to get smaller and the food became very bland. The experience of actually cooking your food is still fun -- for about 10 minutes. Still Sushi BBQ Inn is one of the cheaper alternates for sushi, that is if you're a big eater. They follow the standard AYCE rules, so there's no need to complain, or cause a scene if you over order.   I would recommend the Spicy Tuna Cones and the Deep-fried Spicy Gyoza. However, once in a blue moon, the Gyoza tends to taste like cardboard. Sushi BBQ Inn is fine until a better AYCE Sushi restaurant opens up in the NW/NE region. Until then, Sushi BBQ Inn will have my support."}
{"text":"It seems like a hit or miss for a lot of people, I personally love this place and have been coming for almost ten years.   The price beats it all, I don't expect amazing service but we are always taken care of. I can't say that a lot of the new hires have been very bright but their regular staff are great.   I love that I get sushi and Korean BBQ; the sashimi is good, not always spectacular but for under $26, I can't complain.   If you're coming between 6 PM and 8 PM, make a reservation and don't expect fast service, there are only so many servers and at most 4 chefs making the sushi. Be a little patient!"}
{"text":"Great food when u can get it. Service is horrible. Over 2 hours and just starting to get out second order of food.  Find a new place and let me know. This one needs work."}
{"text":"Food has always been very good at this place but service used to be very slow. On the last two visits service had much improved.  4.5stars, one of the best choices for sushi in the city if you are a big eater. Request  to management: please add seaweed salad to the all you can eat menu, it's on the regular menu and very tasty but not available on the all you can eat menu."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. The renovations were needed and appreciated. Also, they switch up items on the menu every once and awhile which keeps things interesting. Very unique dinning experience and the price is certainly reasonable."}
{"text":"Stars are going to the food. The service was horrible. Wasn't offered a table for a half an hour, was given water but wasn't offered any other drinks, only got the all you can eat menu. Slow, disorganized, unmotivated and extremely rude wait staff. Heard one of the waitresses complaining about our table (customers can see the table numbers on them), other tables, and asked the table beside us if she could take the sushi with her that they couldn't eat."}
{"text":"It was just average. The sushi for all you can eat at lunch time was STILL 25$... The waitress came back and barked that we need to decide soon as they close at 3...it was 145. Fine my family and I opted for bento type boxes. The food came with the waitress practically throwing it on our table- it was average like I said- and she never once came back to check. When I went up to go pay? She said \"that price doesn't include tip\" I was so shocked I said \"yea I wasn't exactly planning on tipping the service was so bad\" and she said \"you're a bad customer\" perfect. I'm actually no longer a customer. If you have a choice? Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place, and though I was skeptical, we gave it a shot.  The service is generally efficient but not terribly friendly (the cashier was sure to remind me that \"Tip is not included\" when I was processing my payment).    The rolls are generally pretty good, definitely get the chopped scallops roll.   There are only two options for sashimi, disguised as three - the third is just a spiced-up melange of the other two options. All three options were rather stringy in texture, perhaps they were just poorly cut.    The BBQ was yummy and I wish I had focused more on it, especially the beef ribs and the pork.   The desserts are awful, avoid each and every one of them.  As well, stay away from the spring rolls and the tempura (not panko, it was more like fish and chips batter).  The price is also outrageously high, so only fill you belly with the stuff you like."}
{"text":"Rolls are sliced very thinly, and all the innards fall out when you attempt to pick it up with your chopsticks. Everything is smothered in sauces. Not a good choice for someone who actually likes tasting their food."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, I'm a fan alright!  If you want fun with friends, this is a sure must.  However, there are some RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW.  This is a great place to eat so many show up.  Rule #1, make a reservation, no matter what time of day.  It's just better not to be disappointed.  Rule #2, take one car.  The parking lot is very tiny and you may have an issue getting a spot in this micro-mall.  Parking a few blocks will be worth it especially after the meal.  Rule #3, must have tapioca for dessert.  It is so delicious and cleanses the palate.  Rule #4, come hungry!  You may think those little portions are not enough but they sneak up on you like crazy! The food is diverse and I recommend the all you can eat buffet to experience both the sushi and bbq at your own table.  Cooking is half the fun!  If you want something more romantic ask for a quiet booth in the back *wink-wink*."}
{"text":"Ok first off, this place was recently renovated and a vast improvement from the previous.    Second off.  This review holds high as im from Vancouver and have eaten at a ton of sushi joints and know whats good.   So im gonna get to the point.  For a sushi and Korean BBQ all you can eat place, this Joint honestly is the best place  ive ever been to thus far. Super quick, friendly staff, vast amount of variations of rolls and just hands down awesome.    Bring your date, or your buddies and enjoy!!!  I dont need to explain in detail because i have nothing negative at all to say!!   Price was perfect for everything you get.  This place is now my go-to spot.   I actually get excited thinking about going back.   BBQ at your table- so many options Kitchen - So many options Rolls, cones- again.... so many amazing options!!  Go and enjoy!!! Bring lose clothes ;)"}
{"text":"My family comes here once a year for a holiday dinner and we have it down to a science. You've gotta pick one person to speak for the table or else the various servers who will come visit you (lots of \"teamwork\" going on there) will get confused. I filled that role this year and it went off without a hitch.  Perhaps it isn't the highest quality food and the service can be dodgy at the best of times but with my ever-expanding family its a guaranteed way to make sure everyone is fed and happy.    Remember: 1. Don't over-order or you'll pay extra. You've had fair warning so don't complain.  2. MAKE RESERVATIONS!!! I cannot stress this enough. 3. If you order a JELL-O for yourself your older sister WILL steal it from you no matter how old the two of you are. 4. If you want ginger, ask for it right-away or else you'll have to wait. 5. Did I mention you have to pay for over-ordering?  Happy Feasting!"}
{"text":"Absolutely exceeds expectations, in service, quality promptness but also cost.  Myself and my mother were having a rather rough day but I suggested we try and lighten up the night with a dine out.  Sushi BBQ Inn blew my mind, a very authentic Japanese feel that is also very well suited to a western (Canadian) diner.  We stayed away from the Sashimi and Nagiri due to us being green when it comes to sushi eaters.  However the Maki rolls and cones were divine, a special recognition for the Volcano rolls.  The BBQ aspect was also very pleasant, focusing on the marinated beef and corn.  A draw back however was the BBQ squid, yet that could have simply been my ineptitude to cook it nicely or that particular portion may not have been the greatest.  For drinks we had the house tea throughout the course of the meal. For desert I had a grapefruit Italian soda (which is actually a american style traditional soda), while my mother had the milk tapioca which was well received.  Service was extremely attentive and fast when filling out the order sheet, however when I wanted to order my soda for dessert which is not part of the all you can eat menu (AYCE) it took approx 5 minuets of attempting to make eye contact with a server before I could do so, which was still extremely reasonable.  The place was also not busy at all with only 2-3 other tables at 7:30pm on a monday night.  Approx 10 people in a restaurant that can seat 70-90. And we were seated right across from the sushi chefs. And other customers came in even later then we did. But I believe you must be seated prior to 8:30pm to qualify for the AYCE menu service.  In total we had probably 30+ pieces of sushi rolls, 1 cone, 15 pieces of beef, 2 corns, 5 pieces of squid, 4 pots of tea 1 soda and 1 milk tapioca.  The final bill was $60.80 and I left a 10% tip only due to the fact that I had not prepared for the cost and had to pay for debit and had no spare cash on hand.  Otherwise a much larger tip would have been well earned.  I fully recommend this place and already am very excited to bring all my friends so I can come a lot more.  Any previous reviews about cleanliness or atmosphere being dull or dirty etc. are either outdated themselves or have been resolved.  I plan on making it a long time place to eat.  Having signed up just to post this.  ?????????????????? (Sutekina o shokuji o arigat?gozaimashita)"}
{"text":"Best all you can eat, in terms of food quality. Service is expected to be slow during lunch and dinner hours, but during other times or if you're fortunate, service is just fine. I find that being in one of the window seats for AYCE will get you faster service.  Occasionally food ordered (AYCE) will come out much much much later or not arrive at all. I don't find this too troublesome because you can just order it again and it's only ever one or two things missing every 3 sheets/orders or so."}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had. Only a quarter of the food came out. When food came out the cooked food was cold. Service was slow. Only time I went to a all you can eat and starve......"}
{"text":"I came here twice during my visit to Calgary in September 2010!  It's my cousin's favorite place for AYCE Sushi.  There's so much more than sushi, though, which is what I actually love about the place.  It's been sooo long I don't remember what I particularly liked in terms of the special rolls...  It had avocado on it, though, and you can never go wrong with avocado anyways, so try to find it!  I'm a huge fan of their Unagi rolls!  TOTAL YUM :).  The most vivid thing in my memory was the Korean barbeque.  FORGET THE SMELL!  They marinate their stuff goooood.  I think I got the kalbi, and real talk.  I get kBBQ all the time in LA, and it's comparable.  There was a lot of flavor soaked into the meat.  I don't remember seeing a lot of people get the kBBQ meat, but y'all are missing out.  You can wait for it to cook while digging into the sushi, no biggie.  Let's keep in mind that this is Calgary and not Vancouver, so if you came here expecting hella fresh fish...  Seriously?  My cousin and I didn't have to wait long for a table both times we came, service was wonderful, and dining never felt rushed.  We definitely ordered more than two times, too.  Who knows, perhaps I had some foreign American luck~  If I'm ever back in Calgary, I'm definitely stopping by again!  P.S. $60 for two people including tax and tip. P.P.S. Gyoza!"}
{"text":"We came here with our son and everything was perfect. All the meats were juicy and flavorful and cooking them right on our table was super fun.   Pros -Fast and friendly service -Nice decor -Great food especially sashimi and bbq beef, lamb and chicken. Great gyoza too.  -All you can eat -Only $5 for our five year old son  Cons -Some of the sushi rolls we ordered tasted like they weren't fresh. Probably won't get sushi rolls here again but we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Coming from Edmonton, we don't have KBBQ + sushi AYCE. We were just here over night and stopped by here for lunch. I thought it would be relatively cheaper but it came out to be $25/person. There IS a cheaper option for $18 dollars but it has less items. I kind of regret ordering off of the more expensive menu.   What mainly brought us here was the KBBQ. I got confused with the charcoal and Korean bbq options as to which one was on the grill, but after regretfully ordering steak instead of the KBBQ at the end of my meal, I realized what meant what. Charcoal was NOT on the grill you cook yourself, don't make the same mistake as me!!   That being said, the sushi we ordered here as well was sub-par. I really didn't enjoy the rolls as the sushi on them didn't seem fresh. The nigiri though had really nice cuts of salmon that almost melted in your mouth. The rice is a bit sweet though.  After experiencing what this is like, I don't think we'd come back after realizing how little we actually ate. It wasn't worth the $$$ as my boyfriend has a pretty small stomach compared to me (lol) and ate much less. They charge for leftovers so BE WARNED. Limit how much you order, per order."}
{"text":"Was at the McLeod location a few minutes ago. Their level of service or lack there of, was disappointing.   Our server definitely lacked training. I used to be in the food industry and was taught never to hold a glass right at rim. Well our server did just that. Couldn't even drink my water.   Food wise, can their meat get any smaller? By the time you cook the meat, there's hardly anything left. Also got their sushi. The fish was paper thin and didn't look very fresh.  For $26/person, this place definitely isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4-stars strictly in relation to their lunch special. It's practically become language for my friends and I who went to SAIT years ago. $9 for 18 pieces of sushi and a pop! C'mon, no where else on Earth has the kind of deal for sushi. I will admit, it's not the best sushi I have had but it's still very good, and at that price, it's a bargain I look forward to during lunch times."}
{"text":"Amazing!! All-you-can-eat sushi AND Korean BBQ for $25?! Woah! That's a DEAL right there, my  friends!  Contrary to some of the other reviews here, I actually got great service! I made a reservation 30 minutes before showing up, and I was seated promptly. My waittress was constantly smiling, laughing, and was very prompt in bringing us food, water, etc.  Their menu is EXTENSIVE! I loved it, because you could order a bit of everything!! The food was great... I *loved* the part where you can just grill your meat yourself on the table! It definitely added to the experience! And I even ordered the sashimi, and it was good!  Anyway, in typical AYCE fashion, we ordered wayyy too much, then stuffed ourselves silly trying to finish everything.  I would MOST definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Terrible place, 25$ for a 2hour sitting even if you don't want to have their disgusting food. It takes so long between orders that after having few bites you wont feel like eating at all. The drinks are extra on top, save your money and have a nice meal at a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We came here for all you can eat BBQ and ordered a bunch of orders but only a few came. We asked the server and she said she'll check but we never heard from her and never got the food to our table. We waited for 30 mins to get our food. We had to wait more to send our orders again. This place is not worth the money and time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here numerous times and always had a good experience. Our favourite bbq sushi place is closed for renovations so we decided to come here for our fix. This trip was NOT a good one. We placed our first order and while slow considering the restaurant was not very busy, service was good and we got everything. The second order was terrible... Less than half of what we ordered was delivered and we had to ask for our meat to bbq. It eventually came and then we waited for 15 minutes for an employee to come around so we could ask them to light our bbq. Then the bbq temperature was too low that it wouldn't cook our meat, just dehydrated it (if I wanted beef jerky I would have gone to 7-11). Then it shut off and we had to wait again for an employee to come by and ask her to re-light the bbq. We asked her to turn it up but she said she couldn't. Safety concerns and all that, okay I can understand. But we spent 20 minutes cooking 2 tiny pieces of beef because there was only one spot on the entire bbq hot enough to cook on! I could have cooked an entire steak faster over a candle...   Long story short, I gave the restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 because they have been good in the past. After tonight, we don't plan to be back."}
{"text":"Really cool to find a combination of both sushi and Korean BBQ. Usually with one or the other, you get stuffed with rice or meated out, so this gives a really nice variety and change of pace. They have a smaller lunch menu for $18.95, and full menu for $25, which was a little pricier for dinner. I went with the 18.95 and it was more than enough variety for me, maybe a little simple on the bbq meats section (chicken, pork, and squid I think) but can't complain for the pricing. There are plenty of side dishes as well like miso soup or fried stuff from the kitchens.  I went on a weekday lunch so it wasn't busy. But service was fairly prompt and decent.  I think I'm fairly tough on sushi, and I thought the quality here was great. The salmon was fatty and the fish in general was fresh. It's wayy better than typical buffet-quality sushi.  The meats were eh. Partially I think the grill was hard-wired to be fairly low, it really did not get hot enough to char the meats properly without making it all well-done. The salmon cuts were kind of crappy, and only the spicy pork was really marinated with enough flavor, IMO.  I would stick with the sushi, but the kbbq was nice to have as a changeup. And I think the full dinner menu had some nicer meats to grill (but grill heat still holds them back)."}
{"text":"This is actually a 3.5, felt bad giving it the full 4 though.   I have driven by this place oh probably ever day for a really long time, plus one of my best friends runs the framing store, which is next door. As per usual of being lazy and not wanting to cook supper we went for sushi. My gf recommend we check this place out. I said sure, the BBQ portion was pretty cool.   So we got there and were able to get a seat, it's crazy how busy it is, all the time. First not impressed moment, was the entire table had to do the one type of menu, the all you can eat or you did regular menus. My husband didn't want to do the all you can eat, but he had to anyways. Strike one.   The sushi that we got was ok, I've had better, a lot better actually. Plus not much selection. I'm super picky with my sushi. So strike two. The BBQ portion was really enjoyable though, so that made up for it. But when you go for sushi, you kind of want sushi, not BBQ.   So long and short it wasn't bad. I would probably come just for the BBQ, but will double think it I really want sushi, I doubt I'll come here."}
{"text":"Awesome place for your raw fish and meat fix. It comes out to $25/ person which does not include any drinks. We went at 530 pm on Saturday and the place was not packed yet. We were seated instantly and started or glutinous food adventure.  We came here quite a few times over the years and I want to say the expansion of the place as well as their extended menu made this place so worth while.   Their sashimi was super fresh and cut in thick liberal pieces. Their nigiri was awesome too and their sushi rice wasn't all that bad.   Though their BBQ selection was small their were fresh and came in good portion sizes. The food came out quickly as well.  The only thing that wasn't as good was their tempura icecream, then batter was too doughy, as if it was not fried enough."}
{"text":"My lovely wonderful husband and I went here for supper and it was the most awful-est experience of our lives.... we got sick...... Highly suggest not going---- totally not worth it"}
{"text":"I hope this place has had a change of management. But our experience years ago was so horrible that it deserves resonance on YELP.com.  We were a group of 6 guys that reserved a dinner @ 6:30. When I had arrived early @ 6, they were ok with sitting me down to wait. Some middle-aged Asian lady (who I assumed was either the owner or manager based on her authoritative look) took one look at me and must've judged that based on my appearance I was up to no good. So she sent her lackey waiter to inform me that the all you can eat time officially began the moment I sat down. No problem. When my friends had arrived we began to order our food via checklist menu. We ordered what we thought would be enough for one round. It took one hour for the food to come out and once they brought a second sheet for us to order again, we had only received a third of the food we thought we had requested. So at the time, we thought it was logical to increase our orders so that they can bring the right proportion of food that we wanted. We waited for another half hour and the waiter only brings out two plates of teriyaki chicken. Another 5 minutes passes by and he informs us that the kitchen is closing and our all you can eat time is up. We are usually a passive group and even in situations where we didn't enjoy the food we ordered we often accepted the meal and only passively resolved to never come back. But this place BARELY served us food over the course of two hours. We didn't ask for slow-roasted stew, we asked for quick meals such as sushi. In fact the meat we received for BBQ was raw so what was the half-hour to one hour holdup for?  So by the time the waiter decided to come back and ask \"any dessert?\", 6 hungry guys let him have it. Only through the mid-point of the argument did we realize he was only the messenger and our angry stares were met by the sneaky manager who didn't seem to care. I assume that she assumed we were a bunch of mangy college students out to rape and pillage her place (why on earth would you have an all you can eat place across from SAIT anyways?), but we were working class professionals willing to pay for the service and food we received. Again this was an assumption, but see how it made and ass out her and me? That made no sense but it's been 3 years and I'm still pissed as shit about this incident.  Point being: DON'T offer an all-you-can eat service if you don't have the capacity to support customer requests."}
{"text":"Got the hankerin' for the sushi? You need it now and you need it in quantities that will leave you rolling around on the floor in over eater's agony. Sounds to me like Sushi BBQ Inn is your kind of place!  All you can eat sushi - here are some important guidelines: You only get one order of Sashimi per visit. They charge you full price for leftovers and that includes the sushi rice. So, how's the nigiri? Well, it's ricey. All you can eat sushi iss like a game of sushi chicken. You roll up to the table and go \"$25? Aw yeh! I bet you I can eat my money's worth!!\", and they go  \"oh we bet you can't!\"  You argue back and forth for a while, but little do you know - just like Vegas, the cards are stacked in the (sushi) dealer's favour. This favour comes in the form of rice, and lots of it!  Don't think you can get all smart on them and just eat the fish off the top leaving the 1.5ç worth of rice remaining. Not a chance, cowboy - you're getting charged full price. Service is also incredibly slow. They give you all you can eat sushi, but they'll sure try make sure you get bored before you're full.  I ordered the All You Can Eat some time ago, so this time decided on the \"Dinner for 2\".  Typically, restaurant portions are more than enough to fill me up so we went for the quality over quantity option. I can't say I felt the quality was any different. For pretty much the same price ($48 opposed to $25 each) you get a few different servings of some rather mediocre food that still seems cooked in a way as to challenge you to a rice eating contest instead of taste good. The service also seems to remain the same. I'm a pretty big sashimi fan and I had a little bit of difficulty choking some of it down. It was really fishy tasting  and I wasn't a fan. This was the first time in my life I've ever seen wasted sashimi at my table.   Why 3-stars? I think you get way you pay for if you come with the right mindset. Don't expect the best sushi of your life, but if you're in the mood for a stuff your mouth hole with fish, food challenge, Sushi BBQ is a pretty safe bet. Plus,  *you could always bring a ziplock bag for that huge amount of sushi rice, or throw it down the BBQ pit, but you DEFINITELY didn't hear that from me.*  *Really don't do this"}
{"text":"The problem is the size of tbe Nigiri sushi pieces. They are too big. The staff should pay more attention to customers. Bbq Grill was dirty. But they have a really good tempura."}
{"text":"Hey, this place doesn't have the best sushi but if you're craving sushi and heavy amounts of it; I recommend it.   But if you want excellent service, then I have had good days and bad days at this place. The sushi chef doesn't hesitate to give you a big smile when you walk in, but if they're busy then don't expect them to run around for you at all.   The new renovations do look great, and I do appreciate it more than what they had before.   Why 3? Because it means above average, And that's exactly what this place is. Above average but you won't call you mom telling her about your sushi adventures (maybe that's just me ;) )"}
{"text":"Overall, it is a fun experience with mediocre food. Definitely not 100% worth the money with the food quality or service. For people who struggle with air quality or sensitive to smoke, this might not be the best experience. However, it's by far way better than Seoul Korean BBQ, where it doesn't seem to ventilate the internal air sometimes.   The servers, when they were attentive, were really quick to help. However, I felt left aside for awhile when no one would bring us the bbq dish, and we had to ask 3 individuals to help.   The sushi rolls and nigiri we received were slightly dry. Some of the rice did not feel fully cooked. The upside, they were quite generous with the wasabi and ginger.   The sashimi was okay quality, but acceptable for the set price we paid. The spicy salmon was not worth it. The meat was definitely of a lesser quality with more chewy parts in it.   The salad, miso soup and sunomono were decent. However, the three tiny little broken, shriveled looking shrimps in the sunomono were a great disappointment.   The squids were quite nice. Char boiled steak pieces were nicely done and tender.   For the bbq menu, the meat were quite tender. The salmon belly/head parts were deliciously fatty. We were somewhat worried with the burned parts, and our server brought us some lemon slices. Although it would've been better if the slices were actually wedges.   The tempura ice cream was interesting. The green tea ice cream was alright.  Overall, it was a decent enough place slightly on the pricey side with the food quality. But worth a try!"}
{"text":"It was my boyfriend and I's first time coming here and I had high expectations due to the good reviews I heard about this place. We ordered off the all you can eat menu but the meat took about 45 minutes to get to our table. On top of that we still had to wait at least half an hour for the meat to cook due to the terribly slow grill we had. I asked the server if we were able to increase the heat and she informed me that it was already at the highest setting. Other than the slow girl the meat tasted really good, it had delicious sauce and seasoning. The sushi was okay nothing out of this world. We ordered the tapioca milk and green tea ice cream for dessert and after waiting another half an hour it still had not arrived. We decided to just pay for our bill and leave. Biggest disappointment because we were both starving and had high hopes.  The service was really slow and it looked like they were understaffed. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible service, mediocre food. The problem with ayce places that serve more than one cuisine is that they're not specialized in either cuisine (sushi, BBQ) and therefore fail at both. Literally.  The sushi was poorly made--rice wasn't very tight, and it was more of a fill-your-stomach kind of thing, rather than a savory-flavor kind of sushi.   The BBQ strips are tiny (compared to other Korean BBQ places), and it's very, very fatty. Again, very mediocre.  Like other reviewers said, this place believes that the \"customer is never right\". They 1. Brought our orders in late (we ordered chicken for our second round, they gave it to us at the end of our third round when we were about to leave). We told them we didn't order dumplings, yet they made us eat it!  It was so unfair. And the worst part of it was that with a party of 5, they put on tip for you. What kind of restaurant does that? Sure, if it's 8+, but 5? Really?   They were slow to bring food, and even though it's $25, it's not worth it. I advise you to go to other places for food, and I recommend never going to restaurants that don't concentrate on one cuisine. Honestly, all the best restaurants out there have one main focus, not two or three."}
{"text":"All You Can Eat Sushi is one of those danger zones for me. I always think I'm hungrier than I am, and that I can eat more than I can. When I was younger, my friends and I would strategize about how to maximize our intake so as to get the full value of our meals. The thing about AYCE is usually that it is not as good as ordering by the roll, or by the piece and that you have to eat SO MUCH.  That being said, Sushi BBQ Inn was the best of them all, but also the one that finally broke me of AYCE. The fact that it had Korean BBQ just elevated it to awesomeness. The barbeque in the middle of your table was a little hard to get started, but a ton of fun to play with. Too bad I always sucked at cooking! The sushi was fresh and alright.  But yeah, a visit last year broke me of AYCE once and for all. It is perfectly situated across from SAIT, filled with students who have not yet learned their lesson (as the general age of the restaurant attests to). It is decent, it's fairly priced, but it does a number on your stomach and isn't it better to just enjoy your food?"}
{"text":"Take out was underwhelming. Beef udon soup was flavourless, sushi rolls which were all mashed together in one container were less impressive than food court sushi, beef short ribs were decent but a really small portion I think. Would defs not order again."}
{"text":"Of course it's not your high-end sushi restaurant (nothing that's \"all-you-can-eat\" ever is), however for the price it's a fantastic meal with plenty of choice.  The BBQ to cook the meat on in the centre of the table is a lot of fun - private booths make it an excellent venue to catch up with friends and enjoy a (slightly stuffing) meal!"}
{"text":"For $17.95 the all you can eat lunch menu is a good deal. There is a large variety of sushi, rolls & BBQ to choose from. Dinner is about $25 I think and has a few more sashimi, sushi roll and BBQ meat options.  The service here can be really good or really bad. When I visit I always expect the worst and am pleasantly surprised if I get an attentive server. Sometimes a reminder to the staff about items you are waiting for is required. Why would I even bother visiting if that is the case? Well, I have yet to have a bad experience with the food quality and actually find it to be the best AYCE sushi, taste wise, I've found. All the rolls and hot items I've ordered have always been delicious and that's what keeps me returning.   They could really do with cleaning out their BBQ grills at each table more often, sometimes there is some funky water in the bottom of the grills that can be off putting. But the sushi prep area is always very clean so I tend to overlook that.   I love the option for both sushi & Korean BBQ for variety so I will continue to visit here when a sushi craving strikes."}
{"text":"Oh goodness worst restaurant experience of my life! And let me tell you I have had plenty of bad experiences in restaurants. This place takes the poop cake and looses on all counts! I would sooner recommend you buy a microwave burger from 7/11 than go to sushi BBQ! No, I am not kidding.  Have you ever been to a restaurant where you actually feel like you are not welcome? Well if not, and you wanna be treated like shit go to sushi BBq and find out! The service was beyond terrible, the food was disgusting and they did not even bring everything that was ordered on the ordering sheets. Lets just say I left the place very, very disapointed.   Most great restaurants go by the motto \"the customer is always right!\" Sushi BBQs motto, \"the customer is always wrong!\"   Lastly I would like to say that this place is a disgrace to the great tradition of Japanese/korean hospitality and japanese/korean food. Just don't go here... save yourself from having a very poor dining experience..."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of friends and they are what made the experience enjoyable.  I'm a fairly picky sushi eater but what I had was okay, noting a few decent dishes.  I wasn't impressed with the service or our crowded booth, even though it was meant for 8 people.  8 small people, I think.  The restaurant wasn't memorable enough that I'd go back but I'm sure a real sushi lover would have a different opinion."}
{"text":"I can't believe all the bad reviews! It was totally worth the money and food was fantastic. The wait staff were friendly and fun. The food came out quickly every time. The guy at the front greeted us with a smile and processed our bill promptly. The only small hiccup was their liquor license was expired so we couldn't enjoy our meal with a beer. Oh well, more sushi instead! We will be back. There were 6 of us which was a perfect number to go with."}
{"text":"We come here all the time when were in town, at least a few times a month.   The sushi is high quality and very tasty. Definitely worth the price when you're having the all you can eat. Though the line ups can be long to get in, the service is lightning fast once you're seated and the Korean BBQ warms you up on a cold winters day. The mango pudding and tapioca milk after a big meal settles the stomach like nothing else.  We would recommend this place to anyone visiting Calgary, and especially over any other all you can eat sushi restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"I used to love going for sushi here. but recently the service and quality has gone down hill. the serving sizes are not even half of the size as normal place. not very happy recently with the service. the service is normally slow but recently it has come to a crawl. There are much better places these days."}
{"text":"The food is good to be honest, barbecue and all you can eat sushi, it just never go wrong. But the fact the rating is not high is because the service, you won't see smile on any of the waiter and they just have this \"don't give a f**k\" kind of face all the time. Well, I will go for the food again probably."}
{"text":"Ok - so if you can get over the absolute atrocious parking and walking into sheer chaos waiting for a table or someone to talk to you, the food here is pretty spectacular. We tried this place out last night on a friends recommendation and loved it. The all you can eat is the way to go. The sashimi was melt in your mouth and the food came out super fast, hot and tasty. Our only criticisms was that It took over 10 minutes for someone to greet us or take our name for a seat, which was frustrating. We will go again now that we know what to expect!"}
{"text":"The place was up and down for awhile.Last 2 times they were on the ball.Great service and food.Still could use a makeover."}
{"text":"wouldnt go back.....sushi is not as good. all you can eat though....so quantity vs quality. and you can only be there for 2 hours...if you cant finish it, you have to pay... so make sure you only order what your belly can hold"}
