{"text":"Great place to grab a quick and cheap bite to eat. If you are in fort mill give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Number 19 All the way everyday!  Can't beat this spot for a consistent high quality lunch at a great price.  Always fresh sandwich with awesome bread in a clean environment. To top it off the service is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Great Subs! Bernie is the man. I have been eating his subs for over 10 years. I've always gotten good food and never have to wait. The foot-long meatball sub  is a monster! You have to eat meatballs with a fork for a while before you can even pick it up. So much better than the \"franchise\" shops. It hasn't been updated... ever, but its an excellent sandwich shop for the money."}
{"text":"I make a special time for these subs, i have always just enjoyed the simplistic goodness. The Reuben; on rye, with cheese, oh god. I just had my last meal, and it was worthy!"}
{"text":"Great subs and salads. Staff and owner very attentive. Awesome ice tea."}
{"text":"I too like Sub Station's food... But not when I get it from this particular store. It kinda makes my skin crawl. They also don't seem to have room for the bread toaster any longer like the other stores do, which I would attribute to the horde of personal items they have stacked behind the counter... Hundreds of old VHS tapes!? They don't keep the tables clean, the dining area is in DESPERATE need of some TLC. Broken video games, old dusty house plants, peeling paint. Looks like they just don't care and I have no idea how they've made it past the health inspector this long. GO TO A DIFFERENT SUB STATION, NOT HERE!"}
{"text":"I come here anytime I have a hankering for a real sub. None of that Yoga mat crap. The scrap sandwich is just awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been to a Sub Station II before, but not this one.  I was 5th in line but still ordering within 5 min.  I go the special of the day... #3 ham salami and cheese.  I am a fan of knowing they slice the meat and cheese as they make the sandwich.  I am not a fan of not seeing the other ingrediants and watching them make the sandwich.  I guess Subway and Quiznos has spoiled me a bit.  The sandwich was ready in just a couple of minutes and was very good so the ingrediants must have been fresh.  The small sandwich special with chips and a drink was $7.12 so that was a good thing too.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were perfect, as usual. Service tonight was awesome. The lady behind the counter was very sweet! I was with my elderly mother and it was pouring down rain. She walked her to my car under her umbrella. That is down home southern hospitality!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This location is not closed. Tasty sub and excellent customer service! I will return!"}
{"text":"Right next to VisArt, I've been meaning to try them for awhile now and finally did a few days ago. It's a unassuming place inside but I was pleasantly surprised by their sandwich special. So much so that I went back again the next day for lunch. Definitely worth a try.  Note: They're called \"Sandwich Max\" now... not the \"Sub Station II\"."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! A while back I went in to place an order, I was about 4th in line. The owner/sandwich maker was going back and forth between cashing people out with cards & cash and making sandwiches. When I placed and paid for my order, he was going to make my food, I stopped him and mentioned the gloves he was waring the whole time. I also mentioned where people keep their cash and cards.  I hoped making him aware would help.  I thought I would try again today, while parking my car I noticed he was wiping tables with a rag, he came back behind the counter and started food prep again, The same gloves went from cleaning tables to food prep again. Gloves don't cost that much. I will not be going back.!!!"}
{"text":"Salads and subs always fresh and everyone is very nice when providing services. Great location not far from my house. The quality in my opinion is much better than subway.  Will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"This Substation II used to be my favorite place to grab a quick bite... but this past year I've been really disappointed. Either my tastes have improved or the quality has gone downhill.  The hummus wrap used to be my jam, but lately it's been bland and water-ed down tasting... maybe it's the iceburg lettuce? I do really still like the quality and quantity of the hummus and feta they add, but it seems the other toppings/condiments are lacking in quality.  Recently I placed a take out order. Decided to try the 3-cheese veggie sub instead. They totally botched our order. Half of the toppings I asked for weren't there, and things like tomato that I requested be excluded were in abundance... UGH!  The quality of the sliced cheeses were yummy, but the wheat roll was dry and overwhelmed all the toppings.  What's going on here?"}
{"text":"Alltime favorite sub joint. Plenty of meat and good fixins. Old school subs and been consistent since I first discovered them in the 1970s"}
{"text":"Been going here over 30 years seriously. Never again. When the proprietor walks out of the bathroom with his latex gloves still on after flushing the toilet and obviously doing #1 in done. There is NO justification for that...so I guess it's too much trouble and too expensive to change the gloves and remove them before going to the toilet. I have always questioned this place in my mind but chalked it up to just one of those good 'ol places that was clean and dated. Not any more....#neversubshopmatthewsnc"}
{"text":"I would love to give 5 stars bui just cant,,\"it's a sub shop\" but by far my favorite,,I have eaten at many Sub Station 2 this one I really liked and it was the cheapest combo I have ever gotten at Sun Station 2 I had a #1 $5.90 i usually pay close to 8 at others,,  anyway really good place to eat staff was great."}
{"text":"Sub Station II in Gastonia, NC is well worth stopping by if you're in the mood for a fresh sub, be it hot or cold. But if you don't want a sub, you can always get a delicious sandwich such as their Pastrami on rye (or on an onion roll), or their traditional Reuben w/swiss and sauerkraut, etc.   The menu is quite large but, thankfully, is posted online. This makes it convenient for me to pull the menu up ahead of time so I'm not taking a half hour in trying to figure out what I want to eat once we get down there. (I already spent that time in front of my computer. Lol.)   The meat and cheese are cut only after your order has been taken. This way, the flavors stay strong, and nothing dries out while sitting in a refrigerated case.. Plus, the lettuce, tomatoes, and onions are always fresh...ripe...and delicious!   While I'm not crazy about oil, vinegar, and oregano on my subs/sandwiches, it's available for all of you who absolutely love those things. :)   Oh...and let's not forget the mayo, salt & pepper, and those wonderful jalapenos! THOSE items ALWAYS have a place on my subs! Lol,   Almost forgot: with each sub we've ordered so far, we have always received 3 good-size dill pickle spears that taste HOMEMADE. Now, I doubt they are homemade but they sure TASTE like it...VERY enjoyable!  Someday I might remember to ask them about those pickles! :)   And if you're not in the mood for subs or sandwiches, there's also salads and soup to choose from.   If you find yourself visiting the Charlotte/Gastonia/Kings Mountain/Shelby area of North Carolina, swing by the Sub Station II at 802 E. Franklin Blvd in Gastonia, and treat yourself to something delicious and hot...or cold...and traditional...or YOUR way...and mild...or spicy...and hearty...or light.   The one thing you WON'T have to make a choice about is QUALITY. It WILL be there!"}
{"text":"They have hours online and on their door....if they are actually open during these hours is anyones guess.  It is currently 11:53 on a monday afternoon and they are closed although their hours are 10am to 3pm.  Dont bother coming here."}
{"text":"My sub loving co-worker suggested Sub Station II for lunch today and I was more than pleased with her choice!   We arrived a little after 12:30pm and there were a few people ahead of us which gave me time to check out the menu. There are tons of options here: they are serving up warm and cold subs galore! And move over potato chips they have fries here! Which mind you are dropped hot every order (yep. you read that right, hot fries every time)!   I ended up going with the Turkey and Bacon on wheat almost \"all the way\" with the lettuce, onions, oil and vinegar, oregano just left off the tomatoes and of course added jalape√±os.   The sandwich was excellent! I loved their wheat bread. It reminded me of those devilishly good rolls you get at Outback. They run it through the toaster oven so that adds a nice crunch. The meat and cheese are sliced right in front of you and they are not shy with the toppings.  I didn't try their fries this time, but that will be a must for my next visit. Oh yeah, try not to be dismayed by the building's appearance. It's not a fancy joint my any means but It's totally worth the visit."}
{"text":"Location is OPEN!!!! Stopped in for a late dinner and was greeted by very friendly owner! He was surprised to see that yelpers have said this location was closed. I love their subs and prices very affordable. Please stop in and try a sub you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"What can I say. I have been getting subs here for some time.  Great sub shop and friendly owner.  I prefer these sub shops over the big names as they pay better attention to the quality of the sub."}
{"text":"Sub Station II is an a odd location, located among businesses and in the middle of nowhere.  They have some great sandwich options and daily specials.  The meat is sliced fresh for each sandwich.  I'd recommend getting a whole sandwich, half for there and half to go."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place that is part of my staple diet.  Friendly staff and very affordable. Lots of sub combinations to choose from.    Compared to other sub shops, this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, fresh, economical.  Authentic Charlotte without pretense."}
{"text":"Questionable food, used to be great... not the nicest employees, one is very rude.... better off going to the one on 7th."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have went there since  I was  a child. Always clean and fresh looking. Subs are made to order,they even cut the meat. My favorite us num 19. The sweet tea is also great. The suns are kind of messy. But hey that is what makes them great. If you try and go at lunch time during the week it is hard to find parking and the line is long"}
{"text":"The quality and taste of the food is great as well as sevice, but the store itself in desperate need of redecorating."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs. The proof is in the bread. Meats are fresh. Quick and friendly service. I saw very clean service the entire time. My new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Goodbye forever Subway.  Why would you want to go anywhere else after having a sandwich from here? Love me some Sub Station. Never have I had a bad sandwich here. Meat & breads are always very fresh, meat sliced when ordered. Have some very good hot subs too. It is a little more expensive than other sandwich places, but you get what you pay for. Its worth it to me. Consistency is also a huge plus, you can always count on leaving full without eating crap! Staff is always helpful, and friendly, which is hard to find at \"quick food\" places."}
{"text":"I was surprised not bad for being right there in the same group of building as I am in. I've been here for almost three years and have avoided it because of the location. How can a sub shop be good stuck into an office park? I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Sub Station II, but this location is a little bit ghetto. The food is good and the service is fast, just like at all the other Sub Stations around town, but there's a faint odor of cigarettes in the air, and the wood paneling is a little sad. I'm not sure what's going on with this location...maybe it's that it's in a weird strip mall in Matthews that looks like it's dying. I stop here frequently anyway, as it's on the way to the class I teach at CPCC's Levine campus, and the sandwiches are good. I just wish I didn't leave there smelling like cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"I love this place, #13 is one of the best Italian subs in the Charlotte area*. I grew up in Matthews so I have been eating here for about a quarter of a century back to when it was the K-Mart/Kroger parking lot. The owner and his daughters are incredibly quick on the slicers and can tear through the long lunch lines that they have for obvious reasons. I personally don't smell the smoke anymore but remember when it was a smoking restaurant so that may be a viable complaint. I also remember them having beer but I think that was a long time ago.  *The others were \"Deli Queen\" in Spanish Trace near McAlpine and \"Sub One\" in 4th Ward."}
{"text":"*Great subs!  *Simple place, nothing fancy!  *Bread is amazing and melts in your mouth!  *Yes, the owner has old VHS behind the counter, they have been there all my life-adds charm.  *Hasn't smelled like Cigs since the 90's!  *Large subs are $7.50ish/Smalls are $4.00ish *Chips are $.75 *Tea is $1.00 and is sweet and delicious just like mamma makes it!  *Bottom line: Don't judge a book by its cover is what comes to mind with this little place.   Love, love, love this little Sub Station! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great sub. We got it catered at our commercial shoot yesterday and I was blown away by the flavors. Soft and chewy bread with a nice helping of meats, veggies and cheese. Added some olive oil and vinegar and lunch was all set once I added in some Wavy hickory BBQ Lays.  Also they have amazing pickles.   Nice portions!"}
{"text":"I love the feel of this place. Seems like the business is run by some good people with a knack at making some bomb subs. It's not the most aesthetically pleasing sub shop but the food is what really matters. All meats are sliced on location and they offer almost every meat that you would find in a deli. I'm a rueben fanatic and they just served me the best rueben I have had in Charlotte. To put it in perspective, I just finished my sub and felt so compelled to give this place a good review that I could not even get out of the parking lot. This place blows the doors off of Subway, Quiznos, and Jimmy Johns. The prices are incredibly reasonable. It reminds me of when I was younger and my grandpa would make us sandwiches for lunch. Thanks for the great sandwich and nostalgia! I will definitely be back for more sandwiches."}
{"text":"A neighborhood stalwart and a gem (21 years strong, I am told).  I love this place if no no other reason than meats and cheeses are not sliced until ordered and their staff are not faux \"sandwich artists\" programmed to put exactly 3 tomato slices and 4 pickles on my six-inch sub.    Veggie friends will love the options here (don't skip the hummus!), but carnivores have the appreciate the fact that there are something like 60 different subs to choose from.  I even love their outmoded ticket system where the cashier has to hit a button on their register to print out what extras you want on your sub.  It's like a flash back to the mid 80s.  Though it's at the dead-end of a strip mall that needed an update about 10 years ago, make no mistake that this sub shop is well-loved by the local community.  They have a community board where locals can put up a business card or pictures of their family pets.  If nothing else, this is a perfect distraction while you wait for your sub to be made.    So yeah, it's a sub shop, much like the dozens you've seen before, but here's a local business that's tied into the community and makes a solidly consistent product.  And oh yeah, free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"Truly a different experience when it comes to comparing the quality with other sub places. The freshly sliced meat and the fresh veggies really make a difference! The two gentlemen that work there are great and always remember my usual order when I go!"}
{"text":"Bread is great but not enough meat on the subs. Buts it's also owned by different people then the one near uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love sub station and the #13 is the best you can get.  Great service and quick. If you want a great sub definitely come here."}
{"text":"Sub Station II is a great place to grab a quick bite if you're handling your business in the Dilworth area. It's a huge upgrade from chain sandwich shops like Quizno's and is far healthier \"fast\" option than the Bojangles and Chick-Fil-A you'll find everywhere else around town. As Nick points out, you get a considerably larger portion of meat, cheese, and toppings on your sandwiches here, which means a lot. And indeed, the meat is sliced right in front of you, which makes for a fresher and tastier sandwich. They have lots of their selections, but you're welcome to design your own perfect sandwich, which of course is what I did.   Try yours with Turkey and Swiss on a roll; add lettuce, tomato, onion, oil and vinegar for the perfect, light lunch or snack. So much better than the crap you'll find elsewhere, trust me."}
{"text":"i love sub station! much better than sub way! I like that they slice you meats fresh. its not pre measured out. the quality of the meat is better. they have such an array of sandwich choices. This particular store sells meat by the pound. you can get a 3ft sub with 3 meats and 3 toppings for around $40 and a 6ft same way around $75. that would feed  lot of people!   the place is really clean, serve yourself beverages. and the staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sub sandwich & you're thinking Subway, then try this place instead. It may be in an odd location & tough to find, but it's worth it.  You get some good options for sub choices here & can customize much like at your local Subway. But these subs are filled with so much more meat, cheese, toppings, etc. You get so much more food for your money, not your measly sub that Subway serves up. They also slice the meat right in front of you, meaning a fresher sub.  It may be tough to get to, but this location of Sub Station II (& where is Sub Station I?) is worth it for lunch. You'll get a big sub for a good price."}
{"text":"The Hummus wrap at Sub Station II is by far, hands down, the best hummus wrap in the area. The bread is also fresh. For the life of me, I have no idea why people go to the Subway that is near it. It is a hangover cure. It is cheap. They have Dr Brown's root beer. AND my dogs are happily posted on the wall (the Christmas chihuahuas- one is the devil and one is the angel)."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN favorite place to get a sub! Meat, cheese, and other ingredients always fresh and tasty; I love the sweet tea; and every time I come here the staff is always nice. No complaints!  UPDATE: They're called Sandwich Max now...and I havent had a chance to go back since they've changed the name, so a follow up will come after that!"}
{"text":"I drive past a lot of sandwich shops on my way to Cindy's Sub Station II on Arrowood Road.  The meats and cheeses are sliced fresh in front of you and somehow the sandwiches I get from this location seem to taste better than ones I've gotten from other Sub Station locations.  The store is always clean and the help is always efficient and friendly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I get it, people get annoyed when someone says \" I'm from NY so I know good wings, pizza, subs, italian food, bagels etc\" and why doesn't Charlotte have these things?   but generally I dismiss that because I have found all good versions of the above at some location. Nothing is ever the same as where you grow up- whether you're from NY or from Albuquerque (or insert random hometown)  But that being said Substation II really reminded me of everything a meatball sub should NOT be...  My remembrance of a meatball sub:  Served on a toasted hot garlicky Italian sub roll topped with oooey gooey mozzarella, three large homemade meatballs, and sauce that would put your Italian grandmother to shame.  What I got - Salty McSalterson's sauce and 10 mini meatballs that easily came from the frozen foods section. If that was what I wanted I would head over to HT and pick some up myself. Sadly this sub had little cheese to offer but luckily the bread was at least fresh. Do yourself a favor and for 50 cents extra head to subway and get their foot-long because essentially they are on the same caliber ...actually if I am honest, subways rivaled theirs.   They also have \"scrap\" sandwich on their menu ...I am not sure how this is suppose to sound appealing.  This will probably be my one and only visit here considering we have about 7 subshops within 2 minutes of my office. Yay Jersey Mikes !"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better locations in Charlotte for this sandwich chain.    I don't know that there are bad choices on this menu.  None are 'the best thing I've ever eaten', but all are pretty darn good quality and are recommended.  There is plenty of seating in this location and the area stays very clean.  I think I still prefer the bread from the Independence/485 location, but that location doesn't have wheat and this one has the good dark brown wheat bread.  It's definitely one"}
{"text":"I loveeee sub station, came over today 1/15/18 and there's a sign that says closed for good"}
{"text":"This being the first and only time ive eaten at a sub station it will be the last. Any chain that doesn't care about all there locations equally probally doesn't care about quality of the meat which it tasted like they didn't. The sandwich was not anything like i thought it be when my friend dragged me here."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Sub Station ll (now called sub shop) since I was a child.  Bernie has been whipping up fantastic subs for me and my family the whole time the place has been open.  The decorations have been the same the entire time.  Feels like you step back into the 80's every time.  This will always be my favorite sub shop.  I love this place because of Bernie and all of great employees that work there.  They make you feel like family.  My favorite subs are the #19, the meatball, the steak and cheese and the ultimate!  Love it and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Prices are good, food is good, serving portions are good. These people are not stingy on toppings, and that keeps me coming back. Everyone has a very pleasant attitude, and they seem to really care about you. Highly recommend this place! Plus its been here for over 30 years! Gotta be doing something right...."}
{"text":"One of my secret addictions, especially on road trips, is the veggie patty sub from Subway. I hate hitting the 'way if I don't have to, so I was happy as hell to discover this sub place, right down the road, that has not one, not two, but THREE veg sub options, including a garden burger sub! Dude, no way!  Wait, it's the same price?  Um, I can get hummus as a side, or in a wrap, if I want?  Wait, you have a Eggplant Parm sub too?!   How long have these guys been here? 20 years? I definitely had a moment of realization and embarrasment surrounded by the eclectic group of regulars patiently awaiting their subs when Dude #1 had to tell me what to do with my ticket. But I got it now, and will be back, often. Maybe I'll even think ahead and pick up a to go order next time a long, hungry road trip looms. Yeehaw."}
{"text":"These folks serve up some good food, and they have a very broad menu,  primarily salads and sandwiches. The ingredients are fresh and tasty, and the portions are nice. The crusty sub rolls are so good that I buy them separately for use at home - they freeze very well.   They have daily specials and combos that are a good value. The hot dog is enormous - it is actually served in a small sub roll rather than a hot dog bun. All the sandwiches are very good, and their chef salad is one of my favorites.  This is a little slower than fast food because your order is made from scratch. They have a drive-thru, as well. Nice place, good value, great service."}
{"text":"We got two sub sandwiches that were both fantastic. The meat and cheese are sliced fresh to order and the portions are gigantic. Everything was fresh and really good. Well worth the money spent. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My friend kept bragging about this place and finally took me to try it for myself. I absolutely loved the service and the food. The place had a nice old fashion feel to it. It's not modern and \"fancy\" like other places like subway or Quiznos. It's sort of like in the movies where a person ventures out into the middle of nowhere and finds a diner with good food and service.  The word that comes to mind is definitely NOT the word \"ghetto.\" Ghetto? Joy, girl, do you know what the GHETTOS really looks like? lol"}
{"text":"From the outside appearance, you wouldn't expect much but man oh man... You're in for a treat.   The gentleman making the subs was really pleasant and helped me out with the more popular choices, after I told him that I'd never been there. I settled for the Turkey sub with bacon and on the bread alone, I was sold. Their wheat bread is the real deal... The dark brown, naturally sweet kind (not the tinted bread at other sub places). Once again, I devoured the sandwich before I thought to get a picture.   No worries though...with $8 covering an actual 6 inch sub with chips and a drink... I will definitely be back. Plus, they offer fresh baked cookies (they were putting more cookie dough on a pan so it's legit)."}
