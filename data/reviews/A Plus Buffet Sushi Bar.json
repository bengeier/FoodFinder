{"text":"I got my friend to come here with me after I had read that people were raving about this place. We went on a weekday for lunch and got seated right away. After getting drinks, we set off for their buffet. I was expecting to get my sushi fix but boy was I disappointed. There were only 3 types of sushi available at this one station where someone was making sushi. Not that I mind Chinese food, but at least 95% of the buffet was Chinese food so if you ask me, their name \"Buffet Sushi Bar\" is extremely misleading.

Good thing we came here during their discounted lunch special because I didn't eat as much as I was expecting to. They had the usual stir-fried items you'd find at a Chinese buffet, a cold seafood bar, a section of deep fried things, soups, and desserts. Their stir-fried and deep fried items were ok but the sushi was sub-par. The veggie and shrimp tempura were big and fresh, something that came as a pleasant surprise at a buffet. 

After dining here, I'm not sure I quite understand what the big hype was all about. For starters, all the glorious sushi and sashimi I see in the pictures were non-existent. I'm guessing they downsized drastically to accommodate the promo. For the price we paid, I would say the value was definitely there but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Be aware that the salmon and tuna used on the sushi bar are manufactured and not real.
The salmon pieces are identical from plate to plate and both lack any texture.  To their credit they don't label the dishes as real, the plates are just there for your consumption.  Fake salmon, fake tuna, fake breaded shrimp, fake breaded scallops.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"We came to try out the dinner buffet and it contains a good mix of Chinese dishes and some Japanese style food (sushi, tempura, takoyaki balls). While it's one of the best Asian buffets here in Calgary without having to go to extreme ends of the city to have Asian buffer, I don't think I'll be going back much. On a weeknight, the dinner buffet after the current 20% promo is 26.99 plus tax & tips. If they go back to regular price, that's well over 30 bucks for Asian dinner buffet on a weeknight. Their original price is too EXPENSIVE compared to other similar restaurants in town, which will definitely prevent me from wanting to go back for a second time."}
{"text":"No just no don't go, save yourself the trip and the money. Buffett more like feel the food in ten minutes spend the rest of the night with a food hangover. Shall I say fake sushi if that can even be a thing ? And hot dishes just go buy your own egg rolls, spring rolls, onion rings and fries at your own home. Your paying them to much to keep them cool not warm or hot for you. It's like the restaurant doesn't know what to serve. Here we have an ice bar that has fish sitting there all day but over here is heat lamps with deep fried food but over here is frozen sushi and over there is hot plates and salad bar and further is weird dessert oh but we have a candy bar. Thank you I could have gone to bulk bar myself instead."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet. New place, perfect lighting, The have top quality sushi, and cook many warm options on the spot. A traditional buffet mixed with the fresh options to order certain items. They have chinese and japanese food, dumplings, soup and salad bar, also a desert section with ice cream maker. The buffet trays are small so the food is always fresh and hot. From what I heard this is the new hot spot for having large groups get together for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Had the dinner buffet.  Way too overpriced for the quality you get. 

Let's start with the positives.  The decor is nice, and some of the selections are decently tasty.  The yam tempura and fried bean sprouts were good.

However, that's about all that was good.  First, the Japanese section.  The sushi was mediocre at best.  The sashimi is still half frozen, the nigiri is tiny, and the rolls are stuff with some sort of fried crunchy material (I think it's either panko or tempura skin) that are there just to stuff you up but doesn't add anything to it.  There's a deep-fry/bbq department, but all the tempura (except for yam) was terrible.  Shimp was small and mushy, and scallop was tasteless.  

Next is the Chinese department in the middle.  There's a fair selection, but most of the food are either overcooked or cooked with cheap/terrible ingredients.  Steamed shrimp dumpling was terrible because of how thick the skin and mushy the shrimp is.  Steamed crab legs were also lackluster because of the type of crab they used.  

Dessert department is nice and big but the selection is pretty standard, so nothing stands out - except that the chocolate fountain didn't have enough chocolate flowing through it so it looked weird.  Soft-serve ice cream didn't have a twist option, which was slightly disappointing.  

I didn't have the soups or the raw seafood, but I guess they looked decent.

We went on a discount night, so it ended up to be about 32 dollars before tax, and I think the regular price is almost 40 dollars.  At that price tag, I rather treat myself to something better even if it's not AYCE."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today..the buffet was great not a fun of the sushi though probably my preference. 
The service not great we had to wait for half hour for drinks but oh well...maybe next time it will be better"}
{"text":"Went at 5:10 on a Wednesday evening and ordered my sushi/sashimi within 10 minutes. It was 6:10 when I asked where my order was. They brought out two rolls I had ordered and then nothing else for 30 minutes. I asked again and they brought my sashimi. I asked about the rest of my order because the rest of my party, including two small children were finished their buffet dinner and ready for dessert. At this point I had only received half my order. They then told me I could fill out a new paper with what was missing. I did and they said it was very busy but they would bring it as fast as they could. From that second order I only received double my sashimi order and none of my special rolls. I understand that it was an uncharacteristically busy evening for them, but it was not when I first ordered. By the time we left we had been there for 2 hours and not received half our food. I was really looking forward to their special rolls. The line up at the door was huge, probably because no one was leaving because orders were taking forever. They still get three stars because the sashimi was fantastic and the the people I was with loved the buffet options. I noticed that the buffet was often in need of filling, with about 1/3 of items empty or very close. This restaurant has a great concept and it would be my favorite if the execution was better. I know they are new so I am hoping they can work out their kinks quickly. They boast seating for 300 people, but they need a kitchen that can keep up with the demand of a full dining room. I'm going to give it a couple months before I try again."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the washroom was quite nice. It had a nice atmosphere as the d√©cor was modern. The urinals had ice in it which was a nice touch as I don't see that very often. The sink was very standard with automatic faucets but unfortunately one of them were currently broken. I also liked that they had two options for hand drying with the air blade dryer and automatic paper towel dispenser. I can't give this a complete review as I didn't go number two."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my nephew's last night with me before he had to go back to Ontario,  so I decided to bring him out for dinner.  We arrived at about 810 and put our name down on the waiting list, our number was 51, so around 830 they called up 44,45,46, 47, and from then til about 9:00 everyone was called up, this big table came in and the manager talked to them and they left, about 5 or 10 minutes later they talked to this lady with number 52, and said there was no more sushi left, and she got so pissed off saying \"why did you make us wait 1 hr just to tell us you don't have any sushi left\" I was hoping since we were next maybe we were able to be seated, after she walked back to the hostess stand she came back and asked us why we were waiting,  I said \"because I'm number 51\" she gave us the same talk and u asked if we stayed do we get a discount, she said u get 20% off, 20% of 32 dollars Is not much without sushi and also after making us wait 1 hr.  I dobt understand why they had to make us wait so long until they tell us that, most of u know restaurants in calgary closes so early, and them telling us so late was just unfair, it just really ruined our mood.  They should really plan everything out better, just saying sorry won't fix anything."}
{"text":"Went to grab a late dinner with the boyfriend last night and was amazed by this place! We were seated right away. Good vibes as soon as you walk in with a nice open concept of the restaurant. Very clean and tidy, well organized and set up smartly. Quick with service and polite attitudes. The food here is on a new level!! Their salmon and tuna sashimi was the best I've had in Calgary (giving Sho a run for it's money). Everything we had was just great tasting with flavor and was fresh. Food selection was amazing! Will have to try to not stop by here more than once a month or I may be putting on a few pounds....New fave place!

Definitely recommended, you have to try this!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience, probably the best of all Asian buffet places in Calgary. The food is actually decent if not good. There are a ton of options. The best part is the service: Henry was our server both times for our table or 2 and table of 7. He was super friendly, attentive, efficient, quick, thorough and genuinely caring. He  definitely provided the best service experience in dining that I've ever had. The front host Shelley also greeted us great energy and made sure everyone who came through the door was looked after. I highly recommend giving A+ a try!"}
{"text":"The food was decent and lots of variety. Price is expensive but my big frustration was the plates on the table were dirty and had a film of grease on it. I asked the waitress for a clean plate and he argued with me that this plate was not to eat off of , he told me you put your extra bones and seashells on. I don't care folks! You are a public restaurant all plates and cutlery should be clean!! Do I really need to have that argument with the waitress. What is wrong with this picture??"}
{"text":"Highly recommend making a reservation for peak hours. The food did tend to sit and be lukewarm when i arrived but as the place picked up, food was refreshed promptly and were hot. The standard Chinese buffet food items were available but the sushi items were my go to. The sashimi choice was restricted to salmon and tuna but tasted good and were a generous size. The rice was denser than what i am used to, but makes sense for a buffet. The seafood was great quality! Great service with friendly staff and a modern interior.

BONUS: self-serve soft serve ice cream machine was such a treat!!!"}
{"text":"1. I too was tempted to try this place based on the article from Daily Hive and the accompanying IG photos.

2. So yeah after donating platelets last night for 2 hours, I was hungry AF. Perfect time to try out this new A+ Sushi Buffet with the wife.

3. Got there at 7:30pm, and there was two parties of 3 sitting in the lobby before us. \"Shelley\" was the name of the girl working the front desk. Let's just say Shelley was useless. Didn't acknowledge us, didn't offer to take down our name or anything. My wife approached her and asked if we needed to put our name down. She said yes and gave us a post-it note with #30 on it. Cool. We'll wait.

4. Shelley calls out #29, the party of 3 (2 adults and a kid) stand up and get taken to their table. This is when the other party of 3 come up and are visibly upset as they're #18. WTF?!

5. Lots of people now waiting in the lobby, standing around clueless as to what to do and Shelley is still useless doing nothing. Manager comes out, basically tells Shelley to fuck off elsewhere as she starts taking down names and handing out numbers. She also gets #18 a table ASAP.

6. Looking around, there are lots of empty tables, and lots of tables that need to be cleaned up. Don't see any busboys anywhere to clear tables. Not really appetizing seeing dirty tables just sitting there.

7. We finally get a table. Sit down and our server explains that sushi/sashimi are ordered at the table and everything else is at the buffet line. Great, if only we had a writing instrument to put or sushi/sashimi order down  Wife had to go to a dirty table to steal their pen.

8. We've had two plates each of the cooked buffet food by now. Almost an hour in to dinner. Still no sushi or sashimi. We ask our server for a status update. She comes back and says that there are TWENTY (20) other orders before us. SERIOUSLY!? There are only 4 sushi chefs working and they are working as fast as they can.

9. Waited some more and finally a plate of sashimi comes out. 2 pieces of surf clam, 2 pieces of red snapper and 6 pieces of salmon. All are still in a partial frozen state and very thinly sliced. Sashimi should be cut thick - like in the IG photos on the Daily Hive article. NOPE. This was nowhere close to the same cut. Worst was the salmon sashimi was basically Costco salmon as it again was nowhere close to being sushi grade (as compared to other non-AYCE sushi restaurants in town).

10. As the wait was so long, we needed to get out of there and back to our kid at home. Asked the server to cancel the remainder of our sushi/sashimi order (a couple of rolls and some hand cones were left) and asked for the bill.

11. $37 per person excluding tax and tip (which I only left 5%), and the fact that they ran out of green tea (how?), you're better off going to Zipang or Misato and getting a quality meal instead.

Verdict: A+ is more like an F-

BONUS: The same goes for Fusion Sushi in Kensington too, food was craptacular. Avoid the Tuna sushi/sashimi as it came out pure opaque white and it was served to us. That's not normal. This is two new AYCE joints that have failed the grade in my books."}
{"text":"Great food! They have a huge buffet that you can eat at as well as order sushi rolls of a menu. Everything is included with the lunch or dinner price. They have a great selection for desserts as well. The staff are super nice as well."}
{"text":"Really? Sushi? There is a tiny bar for sushi where the wasabi is always out and there are only a few scattered rolls picked over. The taste of said rolls is awful. After tasting this I didn't touch the sashimi.
I'm not an expert of any sort but I've been to a reasonable number of sushi places. I particularly LOVE Nami in downtown.
This place was a Chinese buffet with some nasty sushi included. 
DEFINITELY don't go here for sushi. 
I can't say I'd recommend the other food either. We ate essentially 1 plate and paid the bill and left. It wasn't particularly cheap either. 
The other food was probably OK tho, I was mostly disgusted by the sushi and couldn't eat too much more. But it really should be labelled a Chinese buffet and not a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best in town.

Kids are really enjoyed. Thats all i want.

The special discount keeps people in and out.

Love it."}
{"text":"First impressions the place is nice. It's quite big inside with lots of seating and good atmosphere. We made reservations for Sunday night and it was busy. 

The service was good. The waitress was polite and friendly. Our sushi order came out within 20 minutes. There's a wide selection of hot food but there's not much variety for sushi. I would consider this more an Asian buffet than a sushi buffet. The food was only okay nothing special. There's a small dessert buffet but there something weird going on with there chocolate fountain...... It looks like black water not really appetizing..... But the Chinese donut is amazing. Overall it's a bit pricy for the food quality but if you go before 6 pm you get 20% off."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this location is called A+ Sushi it's more of a C-. Not much variety nor was there much freshness. Sushi was whatever. The other dishes weren't great and oysters not fresh. Even their lemons looked old. Our server was terrible. I had to keep flagging down someone else for help. Would not come back here"}
{"text":"This place surprised us! It's obviously one of those places that has it's good days and bad days, which is just as bad as having all bad days in terms of food service. BUT, we went on a busy Saturday night and had a great time. There was a short wait and they seated us pretty quick. It's a pretty restaurant - I like the booths and the decor a lot. 

The buffet had a decent assortment of \"asian foods\" - not much for sushi at all though, which was sad for my friends who love sushi. They had a sparce but fresh tasting crab and shrimp selection, too! I tried a little bit of everything and enjoyed pretty much everything I had! The Won Ton and Miso soups tasted weird to myself and my friends so we didn't eat that. 

The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the price. The whole \"discounted\" joke is insulting - there are signs everywhere for 20% off buffet price but the price when \"discounted\" is still really high at over $30 a person. It was nice for a one time thing, but because we're on a budget I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"If you are going for all you can eat sushi, I would not recommend A+. We came here for the first time after hearing good reviews, and were quickly disappointed. It was a bit of a wait for a table - not because the place was packed, but because there were numerous tables sitting empty that had not been cleaned. I used the washroom while we waited and it was dirty and out of toilet paper.

Once we were seated, we ordered some sushi at about 7:45 and went to the buffet to get some hot food. There is a decent selection but nothing I would write home about. Little things missing like no tempura or gyoza dipping sauces. The food didn't have a lot of flavour. I also asked for tea which never arrived, and they were out of low sodium soy sauce (having Chinese soy as a replacement doesn't count) and green tea. We had to ask for soy dipping dishes.  

The sushi is made to order and we waited over an hour and a half for it to arrive. We eventually had to reorder our food. What we did get wasn't what was promised - 6 pieces in most rolls and we only got 3.  We did complain to our server about not receiving our orders - both of them! - and were told that WE had to ask the manager ourselves for a discount! What?!? We were given a discount eventually which somewhat made up for the bad experience - they were very apologetic.

Overall, a cool concept but they seem very disorganized and flustered with the size of the restaurant and limited staff. We will not be back - read my review for Oishii Sushi in Riverbend. Much better food and service for all you can eat! We give A+ a D-"}
{"text":"Great service and spectacular food! Been here twice for lunch on the weekend, will definitely be back again. And again. And again. And again. And you get it."}
{"text":"I think it's important to point out that when I rate a restaurant, I rate it off of \"What I went there expecting and desiring.\" I went to A+ sushi as very hungry STUDENT on a STUDENT BUDGET.

With that being said I think it was great! was it the best sushi I've had? no. But it came quick, was yummy, and there were many options available.

The buffet is one that is so extensive that I was frankly shocked it was included in the price of the bill with the sushi. The selection was vast and when I went to get some rice, the server insisted on the chef making me a new batch because that one had been sitting for more than 20 minutes. She then actually brought it to my table when it was ready after I had forgotten about it."}
{"text":"Are you supper hungry and want sushi? But your friends like Chinese, go here.  This place is good for the people that may be a little indecisive. That's about it. 
I found it a little over priced for what it offered and noting out of the ordinary will found here. The sushi is small selection for someone who can be adventuress or like lots of different kinds of seafood. Then the buffet was just filler food, seemed like it was all store bought frozen for the most part. I know that the cake in the in the dessert bar was right from the store because I bought it to bring for a work party before.
The service was sufficient, did I get feed? Yes. was my table cleared? Yes.  I don't think we had one server to our table we had more than one attending to our group. I don't know if the staffs realize if they are to act as servers or bus boys. We got water for the group at the start and then no one asked if we wanted another drink again.
A- Buffet"}
{"text":"I went to this buffet two separate times for dinner, one on a Tuesday night, one on a Friday night.  The Friday dinner has about the same sashimi and sushi selections but has many more hot food item including roast beef.  I also found that the food is fresher on Friday, probably due to the quicker turnover with more people.  Love the varieties and food quality.  Definitely recommend the BBQ beef short ribs and sashimi."}
{"text":"Decided to go tonight for bday dinner. We were a party of 3 adults and 3 kids. Got lucky and were seated right away. Restaurant was already packed at 5:30. We ordered off the sushi list prior to hitting the hot buffet. We didn't get our full sushi order until 6:30 (maybe 30 minute wait). Not sure if this was strategically done by the restaurant to full you up on the cheap stuff. The sashimi was cut thin and they had short-changed our order so we put another one in. By 7:30, we were done and asked them to cancel the second order which they were able to do since we had ordered only sashimi... Again strategic? Avoid this place if you can. We were brought in due to a blogger's review that made the food look mouthwatering. I gave 2 stars cuz the kids enjoyed some items off the hot buffet."}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the reviews and was disappointed! This place is really nice inside and has potential. I went there for lunch today. The food was just OK. They had shrimp and mussels for the seafood. No crab legs. The sushi was alright but took awhile to get. The buffet wasnt very good. Lots of hot items went cold. No labels really. Very limited selection. The best part was the fruit and dessert. I personally won't be back."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch buffet. Although they are on the pricey side, they currently have 10% discount this month so it's not too expensive. The store is clean and spacious. The kitchen staffs were out and about changing dishes and cleaning the countertop. They have a good selection of sushi and the fish was quite fresh for an all you can eat. They also have a good selection of dessert and hot Chinese food. My fav is the white tapioca cup. I found their miso soup slightly plain and the sweet and sour soup slightly too sweet. Overall, still better than some other buffet places in town. Their ice cream has many flavors. The green tea one was decent but don't come expecting really good quality since it taste artificial. The main thing I dislike is the parking spaces. It fills up very quickly and we had to park a few blocks down. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I'd be back to try some more!"}
{"text":"A+ Buffet Sushi Bar is located on Macleod Trail Calgary, which right across the street from one of the busiest Mall, Chinook mall, in Calgary. My coworker recommended me about this place. A+ Buffet Sushi Bar is all you can eat buffet and it mainly serves Asian food, such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese food. We arrived restaurant on Monday around the lunchtime. Although it was Weekday, It was still super busy. After waiting for few minutes, the server took us inside the restaurant. Inside the restaurant is very big and has lots of tables/seats. After we found a table, we started to go grabbing food from the food section. The food section was very organized and have multiple selections for customers. People could choose Chinese food, Japanese food, dessert, and seafood, all by themselves. Since we had lunch there, crabs, sashimi, and others seafood were not there. The taste of food were OK. Nothing excited. The seafood was fresh. Highly Recommend people to eat more seafood at this place."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi places in the city. 
We took my dad and he is a picky eater, I was highly impressed that even he found a wide selection that he'd eat. 
The only downside is they don't bring out very many types of sushi rolls at a time."}
{"text":"I came here for two lunches in a row, so I think it's fair to say that I've seen enough to be able to write a coherent review. This was in Sept, when they were offering a 30% off promotion for lunch (bringing the adult price to $15 or $16).

A+ is a combination of a Chinese buffet with AYCE sushi ordering. The d√©cor and ambiance is awesome - everything feels so modern, with clean cut lines and open spaces. The staff all have digital name tags, which was also cool. I found my service experience to be mixed - both visits had a very delayed seating / name taking at the entrance. My first visit was with a (white) friend, and I found the table side service to be a bit sparse. My second visit was with my (Chinese) family, and we had a server that was friendly, attentive, and great at clearing plates. Take that how you will, considering the second visit was much busier restaurant wide...

Unlike some of the other reviews, I had no issues getting my sushi order right or on time - they were prompt about it and the sushi was..... well, I think the sushi was what one would expect from a Chinese buffet restaurant - which is to say, not terrible. I've had a lot worse, that's for sure. The buffet options are actually pretty large, and includes a little bit of dim sum as well (pork buns, steamed shrimp dumplings, siu mai, etc.) The shrimp dumplings were hit and miss - some of them were decent and some of them were so mushy they weren't edible. The buffet selection was actually pretty decent, and there was also a seafood bar area which apparently only has shrimp and mussels for lunch (no crab legs, unfortunately). These were.... mediocre, but again as expected for this kind of buffet. 

As far as buffets go, I've had better, but I've also had worse. I would say that there is no reason to visit this place as opposed to somewhere else unless there was a 30% discount - as far as the cost to food ratio, for $15 it was a solid choice. 

Given the dinner prices, I would never ever pay $40 for this place per person. 

If the 30% off discount ever comes back, I may just pay another visit, but until then...."}
{"text":"We were here a couple of weeks ago. After having another disappointing meal out last night, I was reminded about my experience at this place. 

As you can see from previous reviews I don't have negative reviews often so please know I am not a negative person. 

Not going to say much. Over all experience was lacking. From service to food. 

While there is a huge selection of foods to choose from nothing was very good at all. 

But the most disappointing part of the experience was when we went to have some sushi. Though the sushi was sitting on ice it was all at room temperature which was a little disconcerting and we debated whether we should try it. We decided to risk it and were very disappointed. Bland, no flavor and warm. Nothing refreshing or good about it. 

We left this place completely unsatisfied not wanting to pay the $39 per person. 


This is one place I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Went here with party of 6 for a birthday dinner outing.  Made sure we made reservations for around 6 pm so that we were in time when food was fresh and hot.
We enjoyed the pre-cracked hot crab claws.  Don't forget to ask for cracker utensils !  Although the claws are pre-cut, there were parts hard to just pry open with your fork or knife .  The sushi choices were freshly refilled whenever they ran out and the sashimi slabs of salmon was fresh and soooo tasty!  If you love sushi or have a big family, you can fill up on so many choices!
We don't go to many buffet outings, but our family enjoyed the selections of Chinese food and sushi for our dinner out..."}
{"text":"It is a clean place and there are a lot of delicious buffet foods. Sushi and rolls are also better than foods of other sushi restaurants. Awesome and fantastic place in Calgary."}
{"text":"Standard AYCE sushi in Calgary. If this was anywhere else in the world I would give it 2 stars but Calgary doesn't have any good sushi. The good thing about this place is it's self serve so if you want 100 pieces you get 100 pieces."}
{"text":"So,  it has warmed-up in Calgary but I still prefer Vancouver rain and green grass over the winter sun of Calgary.  I have a Cuban friend in Calgary who is perplexed by how the sun can be so cold! Me,  I think that Calgary sun is like love in a 15 year marriage,  the anticipation is warmth but keep a parka at hand. 

In any event, the wife convinced me to leave the house with the promise of limitless  good food for less than $20.  It was not long after arriving at this place that I regretted my hesitation.  

This place has lots of parking,  the decor is modern and clean.   

The food is served buffet style and it is abundant and flavourful.   There are more than 50 dishes to choose from including a variety of sushi, warm dishes and dessert.

The wife was happy and so was I.   This is a place worth visiting when in Calgary."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet isn't AMAZING, but for the price it's decent. 

It's a great place if you have a large group and need to be in and out quickly since you don't need to wait to be served or to get your food."}
{"text":"It was a new place and so I had to come try it out. 

Parking 5/5 lots of parking. Had its own parking lot.

Environment 5/5 place is very spacious , clean but this is because it's new. 

Service 4/5 when we ordered the sushi & sashimi it came out pretty fast. The servers were very friendly made sure to come ask if we needed more water. They could of came around more often to clear the tables of the dirty plates. 

Food 3/5 food was ok more chimes good then anything. Not everything was labeled so wasn't sure what was the dish when walking around. Not a great dessert selection either . Ice cream tubs not labeled which was disappointing especially since I'm allergic to strawberries I didn't know which one was what. Soft serve chocolate ice cream came out weird color so couldn't eat that. Chocolate fountain didn't look like chocolate was very runny and looked like brown coloured water. 

Defiantly wouldn't come back especially when it's almost $40 a person."}
