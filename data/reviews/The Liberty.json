{"text":"I used to come here. Hadn't been in awhile, so I stopped in. That was a mistake. I can see now by other recent reviews that others also haven't been having favorable experiences and thats a shame.  The service was so bad, it was funny.  My party of 2 was told there was a 10 minute wait, although we could see at least 3 empty tables. The hostess disappeared and then was seen again walking past us a couple of times carrying plates. Great. They're short staffed. No actual patrons were seen leaving to \"free up\" tables. After more than 10 minutes, the hostess reappears at her area and seated us.  It then took more than 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us at our table. Finally a very somber looking waiter comes by, rattles off a list of things he has to do and why he can't get to us right now. Wow. I should have taken the hint and left, but my companion and I were patient, in great moods and just trying to enjoy our Saturday off from our own hectic jobs. After we ordered actual lunch and handed Mr. Busy Waiter our menus, he said \"this one has to stay on the table\" and then had to take a moment to arrange and rearrange the drink menu back on the table. Wow, ok. He cared more about the drink menu, that we didn't order off of, than us since he took so much time arranging and rearranging it. I'm sure by this review you can tell how the rest of the meal went. Nothing was offered or explained by Mr. Busy Waiter. We were imconveniencing him by just being there.  Pretzel appetizers were dry and barely warm. Cheese was cold. When said appetizer arrived we had to ask for napkins. We were told they were a \"hot commodity today\" and Mr. Busy Waiter disapperared. Well, gee, I sure hope you can round up napkins and silverware before lunch comes. My drink never saw a proper refill with ice, so I was left drinking a diluted, warm soda. The sandwiches were sloppily assembled and seemed to have been hanging around before they were served as the tomato was warm and mushy. At this point we cut our losses and got outta there. I will make sure to tell others about The Liberty. If you're short staffed, don't take it out on the patrons. This restaurant and staff attitude need a serious reboot. Shame on you The Liberty!"}
{"text":"We came in after a fail mission at Tupelo Cafe because of the 1 1/2 hour wait on a Saturday for brunch. Got seated right away, no waiting! Service and food was great. Nice interior, very clean. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Had an 8:45 reservation on open table.  Arrived at 8:35 and told there would be a 1-1.5 hour wait.  Can't rate it because we couldn't get in.  I guess that means it popular but still made for a crappy first experience."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my daughter and son-in-law and was completely delighted!  It is a very attractive place, and the food presentation is excellent.  The fish and chips were as good as I have ever had, and the coleslaw too was perfect.  The others had a burger and a veggie burger, and those also were well received."}
{"text":"My wife is a landscape designer, and we met friends of ours here at the Liberty to review the landscape design that she had created for them.  We got there early, and settled in the bar.  The Monday special was all NC Micro brews half off. As I am a huge fan of NC Micro Brews, I took advantage of the special.  Overall, it was a Monday night, and the bar was not that busy, but the bartender was very good about coming by, making sure that we were good, and not just refilling my wife's diet Pepsi, but getting her a new one.  When our friends arrived, we had the landscape designs all spread out on the table.  We were in deep discussion, and the bartender respected that, allowing us the time to look and only coming by once to see if we needed anything.    After my wife finished the presentation (and our friends loved it) we decided to get dinner.   As we were rolling up the plans, we saw that the outside patio had a couple of tables, and the weather was perfect.  The bartender was not phased at all as we moved from our table to the patio, and told us that she would get our food to us.   And the food came out quickly and was delicious.   I am a sucker for fish and chips, and had ordered that.  Very good, not greasy, and served with a very unusually tasting Cole slaw (but it was excellent!)  My one friend got the chicken and dumplings, and it was served most interesting.  The dumplings were more like gnocchi than traditional dumplings, but he enjoyed it.  My other friend had the salmon served on a bed of a bean salad.  It looked very good, and she enjoyed it.  To sum up, great service, great food, and a really good selection of beer.   I will be back"}
{"text":"Have been here twice for dinner and three times for lunch now.  Had to wait a bit for dinner both times so I would definitely recommend reservations.  The service has been great with very knowledgeable servers.  The revolving beer and dinner selections make this very enjoyable every time we go."}
{"text":"The interior is a bit unique, but consistent with the theme of the restaurant, so I like it. The walls have backlit beer pics, so you kind of feel like you are inside the beer or floating in beer(been there before). The server was prompt and helpful with our questions about the menu and beer list.     We started with the calamari fries and they were delicious. The calamari was flavorful, just a little bit chewy(perfect in my book) and light. The tangy sauce and curry slaw were perfect accompaniments to the calamari. The breading was light. I was a bit worried that the smoked gouda and sauteed onions would overpower the  delicate flavor of lamb meat on the lamb burger, but No Way Jose! The flavor of the lamb burger was awesome. The delicate gaminess of the lamb was not lost. The only down side was that there was so much going on, it was pretty sloppy and fell apart almost immediately.  Oh, I drank draft Franziskaner Hefewiezen and it was goooood! They have a fun and interesting beverage program."}
{"text":"My work recently relocated to southend and I'm the kind of guy that likes to find a bar and earn \"regular\" status.  If I wasn't three months away from having my second kiddo, I would be a regular here. I really like the bar staff. They aren't obnoxiously cheerful nor glum. They are professional, witty, and can make great meal/drink recommendations."}
{"text":"To start the pickle chips were amazing! Followed by a pub burger that was so so and then mac and cheese lobster that was fantastic. The liberty ale was a great way to wash it all down. Nice atmosphere, good service but overpriced."}
{"text":"10/29/16. Disappointed. Stopped in after the Hornets game so it was a little late. 9:50 pm. My wife and I wanted to sit at the bar, have a beer and watch the Cubs/Indians game. We ordered a burger and chili. Service was definitely off. No greeting when we entered. Bartender was friendly but lacking basic service skills. Ordered the burger medium, came out rare. Should've explained to order it medium well for a warm pink center. Next another couple walked in and before I knew it the game was changed to football. Which is OK except we were there first and we were watching the baseball game and she didn't ask if it was OK. The finale was when she took away my wife's plate while she was still eating the french fries. Plenty of beer taps except too many from the same breweries. One and done."}
{"text":"We were going to be just two this year for Thanksgiving and having had an amazing experience at BLT a few years ago, we thought we'd try eating out again. We reviewed the menus of several restaurants and chose The Liberty - the menu sounded wonderful and we had been before and enjoyed the food and service. The food did not disappoint. Roasted Pumpkin Gnocchi, Turkey with trimmings, and an amazing Salted Caramel budino for dessert.  The issue for me was - this is a special occasion meal. I didn't expect to be in and out in 50 minutes. We had our first course within 5 minutes of arriving, and barely finished when they brought the second. I still had food on my plate when they came to take it away... I held them off. But 2 minutes later, they were back to swap out dinner with dessert.  Their Thanksgiving offering was a fixed price of $32. It was a good deal, and the food was amazing. They didn't offer coffee, and due the high speed of service, there wasn't time to consider different beer or wine pairings in between courses. I think this would be good for foodies with a smaller budget and not a lot of time to spend."}
{"text":"This is an update to the reviews that I have posted....  I'm disappointed by some of the feedback posted about The Liberty. Either my standards are low or I have consistently been lucky. Most recently, I went for Sunday brunch and had an excellent \"full English\" breakfast. My friend had the crab-cake eggs Benedict and was equally impressed.  I have moved homes and sadly can't get to The Liberty more often."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  They have an awesome draft beer selection, with 20 items on tap, with about 17-18 rotating craft beers (PBR and Guiness are staples).  The food is really good.  If you don't try the Devils on Horseback, its your loss!    I am not much on lamb, but I tried the lamburger, and it was amazing.  My new favorite!  The staff are nice (sometimes can be a bit slow when busy) and the owner chit chats with the patrons, getting your feedback, etc.   Great place!  Everytime my dad flies in from San Diego, he insists we stop by for a burger."}
{"text":"I came from out of town and looking for a place to go for dinner this evening. A local guy I worked with mentioned this would be a good place to go after I brought it up as an option for me to check out. Whenever I am out of town I try to go where locals go and avoid the typical business persons area.  Going into the evening I was actually looking forward  to trying what was voted Charlotte's best hamburger. I love hamburgers and have had most of the best around the country. Thankfully my waistline doesn't quite show that.  So onto the review itself.  I started thinking that this was going to be a live and busy restaurant based on the fact that parking was REALLY hard to come by. I like lively and busy.  So far so good. I go inside and there isn't a seat at the bar so I wait a bit for a seat to open up so I didn't have to ask for a table for one...Which wouldn't have even been a problem because as I was standing in front of the host stand, no one behind it even acknowledged that I was there .WHAT? A restaurant uninterested in seating a customer? A restaurant not interested in making an extra $50 in these days is kind of crazy. I kind of got the sense that customers aren't so important and boy was I right. Granted it was a Saturday night and busy, but that is no reason to acknowledge customers and treat them well. For the most part everyone there seemed too busy to be bothered to take an order or take a drink order. IT TOOK FOREVER! And not only that, no sort of care that you were left waiting. I felt like I didn't matter. I mean how do they know that I'm not a restaurant reviewer or someone with restaurant influence. Every good restaurant knows how to keep up appearances and it seems like this restaurant hired the wrong people as the face of the place. OK, so enough about the a little less than mediocre staff.  After waiting and waiting my food order was finally taken. I ordered the \"best hamburger in Charlotte\" of course because how could I not.  It finally came out and it was luke warm. Disappointment #1. The girl behind the bar was apologetic so I started feeling slightly bad. I got another burger and it was completely raw on the inside. I got the sandwich and as I was picking it up the meat was crumbling. This should not happen with a burger this size.  They took it back and again another apology which was nice. I ended up with the chicken dish that was actually pretty good.  After my experience here, I would avoid this place and head for the second best hamburger spot because you know they are going to try a lot harder t be the number one.  Sorry Liberty, you will not be told about to all my other friends who travel for a living. In fact you have a big avoid mark right now."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I stopped here for lunch. We chose this place as they touted having the \"best burger in Charlotte\".  There was only one other table with anyone at it, and there were 3 tables filled on the patio. The aesthetics were nice, but the service and food left much to be desired. The waitress walked by us several times without acknowledging us and when she did, we were smart enough to just order. That didn't change the fact that we waited way too long for our food. Once we got our food, it was just ok. The bacon was wilted, there was no seasoning on the burgers, and the Mac and cheese tasted microwaved. To top it all off, for 2 burgers and a kids meal, it was $50.  We are willing to pay for good food and we tip well. This place just did not deserve it. I completely understand why the waitress never asked how everything was.  As we are driving home, my husband is complaining of a stomach ache, and he NEVER gets sick.   We will NOT be back, and hopefully the leftovers we brought won't kill our dogs."}
{"text":"I was craving The Liberty's lamb burger so my boyfriend and I booked an Open Table reservation and showed up 30 minutes later.  We were quickly shown to our table and given menus.  That's about where the experience started going off course.  As our forefathers said, \"give me Liberty, or give me any other better restaurant in Charlotte!\"  While the beer and wine selection is tremendous, the food options are actually rather sparse; there's only about 10 appetizers, 8 entrees, and 4 sandwiches to choose from.  We ordered a blue cheese wedge salad, grilled cheese sandwich of the day, and the lamb burger (subbing grilled asparagus for fries).  The salad came first, with a large slice of iceburg lettuce, sprinkle of blue cheese, one slice of bacon, and a drizzle of buttermilk across the top; okay, but nothing to get too excited about.  The grilled cheese sandwich tonight was two kinds of cheddar, blue cheese, and some sort of salami meat alongside a cup of creamy tomato bisque.  My always-hungry-for-more boyfriend only ate half of the sandwich and I didn't want more than the first, sour bite I tasted.  My lamb burger was good, but not exactly how I'd remembered it - I think they've swapped the cheese (from goat to cheddar?) int he last 6 months.  My swapped side was the largest asparagus spears I've ever seen, and they tasted like the char from the grill - you can decide if that's a good thing or not.  The surly waitress brought our check, and even with a BOGO entree coupon, our bill still came to $35 (including tax & tip).  We basically spent $35 for one appetizer salad and one entree... that seems a bit excessive, considering The Liberty bills itself as a neighborhood gastropub.  With grumpy service, sub-par food, and obscene pricing, I don't expect we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 stars, not because of the menu, I never tasted the food but more of the rudeness of the hostess. We went here the other week on a Sat night at 6:00. I had been looking forward to trying this place since I had heard good things of it. The minute we walked in there were about 4 tables filled and no one in the bar. The rude hostess looks up, does not bother to smile and says with a snappy tone \"do you have a reservation\"? My wife and I looked around and said no, we did not think we needed one at 6:00. She replied that they were completely booked up, even in the bar. The fact that they were booked did not bother me (even though they were nowhere near full). It was more the attitude of the hostess who offered no solutions explanations as to why we could not even eat at the bar. The service at this place turned me off so much I am really not interested in trying the menu. There are plenty of other burger joints in this town."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Friendly waitress and hostess. Pricey. I ordered the Cobb salad. Good. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Last night, met some friends at The Liberty.  It was my first time there.  There was a good review in the paper so decided to check it out.  Well, I was a little disappointed.  First, they were out of the boiled peanuts.  OK - so that was a major disappointment!!  Then we opted for the special which was peal and eat shrimp.  The shrimp either had been previously frozen (limp shell) or old.  Just about every restaurant carries Fat Tire ale now, except this one.. I was struggling with finding something else to drink.  Their establishment brew was OK.  There was one thing I did like - the soft pretzles.  They were actually pretty good, but hey, I can get a box in the freezer section of my local store and make them myself.  My friends had the chicken thigh kabobs, which they said were \"alright.\"    All in all, I think that the owners need to watch a few episodes of Kitchen Nightmares.  This place will end up like one of those places if they don't start making some improvements soon.  I doubt I'll ever go back...."}
{"text":"whenever i hear an establishment throw around the phrase, \"the best burger in town\", i feel that it is incumbent upon me to take some kind of action:  challenge accepted.  i've had lots of delicious burgers, so i feel as though it gives me an, ahem, \"right\" to ascertain a burger's awesomeness (yes, i do think in-n-out burgers are fanfriggintastic).  hey, i didn't make the rules, but it sure is a fun game to play.  i've been to the liberty twice, and i had two kinds of experiences.  the first time i went, i partook in a meal fit for a (gluttonous) king: warm, fresh baked pretzels; devils on horseback (medjool dates stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon); roasted beet root and goat cheese salad; fish and chips.  don't you dare judge me.  i split it all with my husband.  i walked away very full and with a few minor issues: i thought the pretzels had too much salt on them, the bacon in the devils on horseback could have stood to be cooked more (bit too rubbery instead of chewy), and the fish and chips could have borrowed some of the pretzel's salt.  don't get me wrong, i did enjoy the meal, but i also managed to think of ways it could have been better.  the CANDID cook, remember?  i'm sorry if i'm definitely not the diplomatic, bobby mcferrin kind of reviewer.  okay, i lied.  i'm not sorry.  these issues notwithstanding, i decided i liked the liberty enough to go back.  the second time, i elected to take on the great burger challenge.  as soon as our server brought out the giant pub burger for my husband and the chicken burger for me, i knew this would be interesting.  they were both seasoned perfectly, and the chef knew exactly what medium rare meant when he/she cooked the beefy pub burger.  the house made pickles tickled me to death, and the fries were crispy and coated with parmesan cheese.  now, if they could only have given me ranch dressing to dip them in, i would have been clam happy (note to the chef!).  both my husband and i loved the burgers at the liberty, and, at 8 and 12 dollars respectively, it was a damn good meal for the money.  the service on the night of the burger challenge was amazing.  you could tell that our server really enjoyed working for the liberty, and this told me that management was good to its employees and they were happy to return the favor.  this spoke volumes about the establishment.  all in all, i really like this restaurant.  the ambience is cool without being snooty, and those burgers are pretty amazing.  the ideal meal for me would be the roasted beet root and goat cheese salad (which was, hands down, the best dish from the first dinner) and half of the pub burger and fries.  yes, that burger is THAT big.  i think it's a great place for a date night and a wonderful hang out spot for a group of friends.  as to the best burger challenge?  why don't you head on over to the liberty and decide for yourself!  ;-)"}
{"text":"Had to try it after it won best burger. Gotta say- I LOVED it. I am a burger purist - I don't like to cover up the flavor of the burger with condiments (if you want to taste pickles, ketchup and mustard mixed together - mix 'em up, put them on a bun and eat them - why bother with a burger you can't taste anyway?) So - I was a bit wary of the Liberty Burger - cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato aioli??? Seemed like overkill - until I tasted it. OMG!!  Perfectly cooked (yes even med to med rare as requested), juice running down my hands - and the extras? oh they just made the burger!  I could taste every beefy bite of the burger and the condiments just set it off. Have been back and will go again.  We're taking guests - one of whom ate a burger everyday for lunch on our Tahiti cruise because they were so awesome....but not as awesome as the Liberty! BYW, my husband and I always share one - just too decadent (and big) for one for lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time to experience what I had always heard was a great place in CLT. The food was very good, nice selections of beers, comfy patio and the wait staff friendly on this fall, perfect weather day. I was enjoying being with friends I had not seen in awhile.  However, I had to give 2.5 stars as the dog friendly atmosphere ruined it for me and the two other friends I was with. Two guests each brought their dogs. One lap dog was placed on the table, the petting of the dog sent dog hair flying through the slight breeze into my food and when a loud car, or the fire truck left its station or someone dropped a fork the dogs would go off barking in a high pitch shrill. Almost as shrill as the owners trying to calm their respective dogs.  While I love dogs myself, I simply don't enjoy them when I'm in a restaurant atmosphere and certainly don't want their fur in my food nor their bums sitting on the menus that another guest will touch in the few next minutes."}
{"text":"We ate there several weeks ago for brunch on a Sunday morning and the food was great! The main reason we went was because we were thinking of having a rehearsal dinner there. The nice waitress showed us the private dinning area and gave us some info and who to call.  We decided that it would be a great place for the dinner. Four phone calls and three e-mails later I have not hear a word from them.  So needless to say we will not be having it there. POOR management!!! Won't be going back. Janice T"}
{"text":"I love The Liberty!  I heard about it through friends and checked it out on Yelp.  I've only been there once, but it was amazing!    We started with the Poutine Grown Up Cheese Fries!  Phenomenal!  Short ribs are one of my favorite things on planet Earth and to put that one crispy fries is a work of genius!  After that, I had the Southern Crunch Burger.  Delicious as well!  The pimentos cheese and the jalapeño bacon add a nice amount of spice to the burger.  And the chips!  Wow!  The chips stayed crunchy and didn't get soggy.  It was arguably the best burger I've ever had!  Seriously!  I washed it down with a great beer from Birdsong!  The Honey Pie IPA.   I can't wait to go back to The Liberty!"}
{"text":"We visited The Liberty shortly after it opened and were impressed. I'm really tired of all of the pretentious restaurants in Charlotte...finally, a place that serves good food, good wine, good beer and good cheer! We ordered the sliders and the homemade pickles to start and loved them! We were in a hurry, so we shared the burger for dinner and it was cooked perfectly...the condiments were also in the right proportions so as not to overwhelm the delicious burger. We'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We found The Liberty 2 years ago during restaurant week in Charlotte. Since then, I've gone back with friends, colleagues, and my spouse probably 50 times. Every time The Liberty never fails to delight. The food is consistently good, the service is some of the best in Charlotte. My only critique is that it is not uncommon for them to be out of the particular beer that I want to order. So it's not the best place in Charlotte if you are going for the beer selection. But you really can't beat the food / price combo in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great little place to go experience some good food and good beer. The beer selection is fantastic as they have many different local brews and imports on tap and in bottles.   The food is american cuisine and absolutely delicious. The pairing of the food on the plate is good. You can also order a la carte.   Some of the sides needed a little more flavor, but I will definitely go back and enjoy more great timea at the liberty. The service was great as should be expected from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and great staff.  Our group of six were mostly pleased with their dinners.  Me being a big fan of lamb had to try the lamb burger.  My first bite was like biting into a salt cube (if that exists) and the 'medium' burger was charred black on both sides.  Rarely do I not eat a meal when I'm out but I had to send this one back...just couldn't eat it.  Judging by the reviews and chat with the waitress, I suspect I just got a bad burger (still no idea what the salt cube flavor came from) and so I'll still give it 4 stars as I really liked everything else about the place.  I'll probably give it a try again as I think this place is better than my personal experience.   (yes, I'm an optimist)"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte, NC. I brag about it all the time. I took my family there for father's day and the server was so rude. She acted as though everything we asked her was a hassle. The drinks did not have enough ice and when she brought it (ice) out, she set it down and rolled her eyes. She charged my card 3 times and the other 2 charges were over $150. When I called the manager/owner he was so rude and was yelling at me in the phone . Not once did he offer an apology. He kept saying \"I don't know what happened.\" I LOVE the food here and cannot imagine why an owner would be so rude to a guest. My advice to you is, if you want good food and atmosphere...try THE LIBERY! If you are looking for great service...try SOMEWHERE ELSE. They need a lesson in customer service, especialy if the owner acts this way."}
{"text":"Had lunch last week, food was very good, but the waitress filled my water glass 4 times....each time was after just one sip, and she must of asked me three times how my food tasted. All I could think of was....if you stop talking to me and filling up my dang water, I'll have a chance to eat. Then halfway through lunch she asked if I was ready for the check, WTF. This was the most stressful annoying lunch ever. I just wanted to eat and relax,  Hint: sometimes less service is more.   I would come back but won't sit in her section anymore."}
{"text":"We went to the Liberty for the Dad's Day brunch.  First, the good -- the food was all excellent!  it sas a pecial pre fixe menu, three courses for $21.  Good deal, great tasting food.  We ate steak and eggs with delicious truffled fries, and the always good liberty burger. Desserts were also first rate. The food here is consistently tasty - great versions of pub classics.  Why only three stars?  The service was very spotty.  I think they did not have enough staff for the busy Father's Day, so i do feel badly for our server - she was working really hard, but we never got water we asked for, and the food came out at very erratic rates.  But food was tasty, and our server remained friendly throughout."}
{"text":"Dad's day menu was awesome. I had the heirloom tomato gazpacho with lobster, my daughter had the crab cakes and my husband had the spicy shrimp. Delicious!!!! Our second course was also wonderful. The shrimp and grits were okay, I guess I just don't like shrimp and grits. My daughter had the salmon and she loved it. That's saying alot for a 10 year old. My husband had the burger. It was so juicy and messy, just like a burger should be. The fries are delicious. 3rd course, dessert! I had the bourbon pecan pie, daughter had the chocolate cake with chantilly cream and husband had the berry cobbler. All 3 were wonderful. The server Allie was great. When we received our check, they overcharged us for our daughters food, and she went and handled it right then, no arguments. She said she was happy to do it! We will definetly be going back."}
{"text":"I suppose that it's high time I update my review of The Liberty.  If Yelp would just give us that half-star option, I could display the 4.5 star review that I am now giving.  Since my last review I've noticed that the current bar and wait staff is considerably friendlier than it was at the time of my last review.  I have had some visits where the service is slightly lacking (specifically in the main dining room), but things are definitely looking up.    By far, this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Is it the BEST food in Charlotte?  I would not go so far as to suggest that it's far and away the best, but the menu is creative, seasonal and well priced.  I have been hard pressed to find food in Charlotte that is this creative and well prepared at this price point.    As always, the beer selection here is fantastic and constantly rotating.  Matt certainly knows beer and does a great job getting rare, limited release brews on tap.  I've had many a hazy afternoon and evening enjoying the fruits of all his hard work."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible.  A group of women came into the bar on a Saturday night to grab a drink and we were all charged gratuity at the bar!  I've never heard of this before, I think most bars should expect to have separate tabs as you order your drink separately and the time it took to get a drink was beyond lousy."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we decided to try this place after Helen's write up in the Observer, and the place was packed. Luckily we got there early enough (5:30ish) to get a table in the bar area (the place is divided into the seated restaurant area and the bar section). I kinda had hoped it wasn't so segregated and the bar was used more than just a place to wait on your table, which it mostly was people waiting on a table. I figured that since it was marketed as a gastropub why not experience the meal/service/ambiance from the actual bar area. we were seated and immediately offered drinks, great beer selection, and was excited to see OMB on the list. The service was great especially since our waitress had to haul a bunch of plates, and not just drinks. We started with the pimento cheese and bangers plate. This was awesome and went great with our first beer. My only complaint was it was served with saltine crackers, expected a little more effort on the kitchens part. We then had the angry mussels, which were wonderfully smoky and the size of the mussels were enormous, again expected more than the sliced sysco baguette to sop of the juices (they weren't even warmed). We also got the fries which I would skip, all of the fires were thick cut and soggy, and served in a red plaided cone which just highlighted how big of a miss they were. We finished with the trout and lobster mac, which was very impressive. Overall, the concept is great, atmosphere is lively, and the place is packed. A great addition to the Charlotte scene. We will return again."}
{"text":"The place was nice. The service  was very slow. They only had caffeinated coffee. They didn't have enough glasses in the restaurant. My daughter ordered a burger and asked that it have only cheese and bacon and they  didn't do that. They put everything on it. Ketchup was never brought to the table. I enjoyed my burger and salad. My husband had chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry. I liked the planks the food is served on but the insert made the salad bowl wobble.My father had send his food back as there were peppers in his food which he is allergic to. They were very accommodating with that. Would probably try again if someone else was paying."}
{"text":"Dine at Liberty just the other day and basically confused by the experience.  We had a sampling of the pub food (smaller portions) and were amazed at the flavors, but then got an entree and were shocked it came out of the same kitchen... bland... so very bland as in ZERO flavor. Atmosphere reminded me of being in a beer tasting room... but that of a beer like Budweiser or Miller... just something was wrong.  Didnt feel right or welcoming.  All in all, not bad but doubt we would go back... and they just opened.  Got to be able to wow people in the beginning... right?"}
{"text":"Came on Mother's Day so we didn't get the normal menu but the options were really delicious!!! I would definitely come back to try a burger sometime though"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the Liberty after reading some reviews. I went on Sunday night and my GPS took me to the wrong location. All day Monday I looked forward to trying again on Monday night, and that time my GPS got it right. It all started with the sweet tea and went downhill from there. I am a southern girl and I love a perfect glass of sweet tea. Perfect, for me, is minimally sweet, but The Liberty's tea was borderline unsweet. Add to that, it was watered down with already melting ice and was lukewarm. I ordered fried pickles as an appetizer (playing it safe) but I branched out and ordered the Berkshire pork chop with Bacon Mac 'n' Cheese, green beans and caramelized apples. The price on the entrée was $21, but I thought since it was Berkshire pork (the Lamborghini or pork), it was worth it. The fried pickles were fried pickles, though I didn't understand serving them with hot sauce and blue cheese dressing. Then my entree was delivered. It was a pretty plate of food, though there was a greens salad on top of the pork chop that I didn't understand. Time to dig in. Ugh. So disappointing. The mac 'n' cheese was void of salt. Not a smidge, not even a thought of salt. I looked around and there was no salt or pepper on my table, or any of the tables for that matter. The bacon on top was bitter because it was overcooked. The green beans were crunchy, which I could have handled, but the flavor was that of a tin can. The gravy on top of the pork chop got all the salt meant for the man 'n' cheese and tasted like the turkey gravy you get in a jar at thanksgiving. The apples had never been near a skillet to caramelize them. They were steamed/boiled apples that had some type of pickling spice that was very heavy on the juniper berries. They were refrigerator cold, on top of that hot pork chop. To add insult to injury, I had to pay $40 for that meal. Absolutely ridiculous. I saw the others around me all ordering burgers. Maybe I should have done that too. Very, very disappointing. This was the one time I almost asked for the manager and requested my meal be comped. It was THAT BAD."}
{"text":"We went to The Liberty on a friday night at 6 and did not have to wait.  Great atmosphere!  We ordered a couple of beers and their calamari.....to DIE for!  The server Jessica was VERY friendly and did a great job.  She has a culinary degree and told us that the calamari comes in fresh and is marinated in buttermilk.  It's not the typical \"crispy\", chewy type but comes in a sauce and melts in your mouth.  We had the Liberty burger and the salmon.  Both were excellent!  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what you order at The Liberty. Any menu item will have a thoughtful ingredient combination and presentation that embodies the use of the American version of the term \"gastropub\". The quiet arrogance of the wait staff and the dark, beer infused interior, however, slightly diminish the enjoyment of The Liberty's wares.  If you can see the details in the dim lighting, beer as a concept is an integral part of the venue. Half pint glasses are cleverly fashioned into chandeliers, a booth to ceiling photo wall of a glass of beer separates tables in the dining area, and stacked kegs are used as decorative columns. Wood pallets used as wall and ceiling embellishments elicit visions of a beer distribution warehouse, and memories of McIntosh's have definitely been eradicated.   Herbs grown in the urban garden in the parking lot flavor the enticing seasonal menu choices, and the recent win of the Best \"New School\" Burger of 2011 in Charlotte is a testament to the freshness and quality of their  wares. Lamb Burgers, Fresh Pretzels with Cheese Fondue and Spicy House Mustard, Duroc Pork Belly Sliders with vanilla-apple butter, Crispy Almond Crusted Goat Cheese Salad, \"Angry Mussels\" with a sauce that could stand on its own, and Garlicky Green Beans are standouts of the current options.  On the dessert menu, the Salted Caramel Butterscotch Budino is the solid choice. Crushed Oreo crust, butterscotch pudding and salted caramel layers are married in a match more glorious than that of Wills and Kate. The description of the Budino from the server wasn't particularly riveting until he noted it was one of his favorites. Since he didn't offer many endorsements, it was determined that the Budino sampling was a requirement. Seven women who have shared many a dessert fawned over the surprisingly airy dish, and continued having drooly conversations about it weeks later. Believe the hype. The Budino is that excellent, and along with the rest of the food, makes up for the spotty service and hop-filled atmosphere.  The Liberty is located at 1812 South Boulevard in Charlotte. Reservations are accepted.  Special thanks to the Dinner Group Girls for assistance on this review."}
{"text":"Tried The Liberty on a Friday night at 7pm.  We had a reservation, but probably didn't need one.  There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  It's also in a nice area for sitting outside.   I really liked the decor - very wide open and spacious with kegs and other brewery-like things.  The soft pretzel appetizer is amazing.  I got the chicken sandwich with avocado, etc and it was very good.  My husband got a burger, which was also delicious.  It doesn't say it on the menu, but all sandwiches come with truffle fries, which were very good.  Great beer selection too...we will be returning!"}
{"text":"So this place seems like a great lunch spot. Burgers and truffle fries are a must. However they don't have ranch dressing which makes me wonder what are they doing back there?? How can you not have ranch? Can I really trust this place? What kind of long term relationship can they provide. Until they get it on the menu - It's one night stand time. Dont call me. I'll call you. It's not you.. It's me."}
{"text":"BRUNCH! Yes! Great Bloody Marys endless Mimosas and their food is delish! And best thing about it? NO WAIT!! I am always looking for a good place to brunch."}
{"text":"I visited The Liberty for the first time more than a year ago during Sunday brunch and was...less than impressed. Food was average, service was below average, and it kept me from coming back. Until last night.  Last night's experience has definitely redeemed this gastropub for me. Service was much better, and the food was excellent! Husband and I shared an order of calamari \"fries,\" which were less fried and more like perfectly cooked, with a tangy sauce and curry slaw. He ordered the lamb burger with gouda and roasted red peppers, and I ordered the pecan crusted trout. Both were excellent.   We'll definitely be back, hopefully before the menu changes (every three or four weeks, I think), so we can order that calamari again."}
{"text":"The Liberty is one of my Charlotte staples. I always get the Pub Burger, no cheese, mayo on the side...keep the bacon and it's delicious. The meat of the burger is the real star but it's the freshly made buns that set it apart from other burgers. My favorite place to sit is right at the bar so you can interact with the bartenders and I like feeling a part of the action. I think of them as the Goldilocks of craft beer in that their offerings are not overwhelmingly vast nor inconsequentially small but a perfect balance of quantity and quality."}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Liberty several times for lunch now. The crab cake salad is pretty good, the fish 'n chips are nothing to write home about and the \"Best Burger Of Charlotte\" was average. There is nothing wrong with the food, it just does't stand out at all. I do like the interior design and the fries are very good... but definitely not enough to make me come back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I visited The Liberty with a group of girlfriends for an evening out. The vibe of the restaurant was really cool. Our waitress, Moment, was super sweet and attentive. I would recommend her to anyone!  I got the basic burger. It looked really good, but when I bit into it, the first thing that popped into my mind was \"where is the seasoning?\"  It tasted like they just threw an Angus party on the grill, added it on top of the burger, and brought it out. I don't think I will be getting another burger there anytime soon.  The fries were yummy. Although they lacked salt, the Parmesan cheese give them a nice flavor and crunch.  Overall, this is a good place for groups to hang out. I'll definitely have to try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite restaurant in Charlotte, but it has really gone down hill.  The service has never really been great, to be honest, but the food and beer selection always made up for it.  Lately, though, the food has been sub par.  We wanted to take our issues to the manager, but he could not be found. When an email went unanswered, we decided to write this place off.  It's too bad, really, because it has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"I went here and was the only customer at the bar. The bartender was friendly enough, I ordered a beer and a shot and felt very isolated. Like the staff would rather talk internally then with me. I don't know if this is the typical experience here and I can't complain about the drinks but I felt like the pretentiousness of this establishment was through the roof. If you want to feel welcome this is not your spot  ***Personal response from owner on this so I am updating the review. Everyone has bad days so perhaps it was one of them. Invested management/owners makes a difference."}
{"text":"I cannot understand the label of \"Best Burger in Charlotte\". It is NOT the best. I expected much more for a $14 burger. The burger was hidden among a bunch of nonsense. I mean, if you charge $14 a burger, I expect a lettuce other than iceberg. It's difficult to eat because of the extras on the burger and they just aren't necessary. If you want a fancy burger, you can be a minimalist with it so it's manageable. The fries are for a certain taste bud and not mine. How do you screw up fries? And it's always a bad sign when you have to get up and look for your waitress so you can get utensils. There is better out there, guys."}
{"text":"Of course, the burger is excellent. Fries come out in a wire basket with wax paper and special spices. They are crispy and make the meal altogether worth going out for. They've done an admirable job with the atmosphere. A little pricey for lunch but their lunch box special offers a cheaper alternative to eating off the menu."}
{"text":"Had issues over parking. I went in to discuss them with the owner and found him to be most unfriendly. I will won't be eating here and would encourage others to stay away also."}
{"text":"Everything on the food and beer menu looks fantastic! Attentive friendly service and delish food.  This is not on my regular side of town but I look forward to my next visit.  I got the bacon wrapped dates - I didn't care much for the balsamic glaze, but otherwise a great app.  The bbq pork stuff hush puppies were flavorful, but crumbled a bit too much to share with the table.  I stole a bite of my friend's burger and it was on point!  My entree of the maverick (seafood) grits were sooo worth the drive!  The beer themed decor is heaven to beer nerds like me - check out some of their plaqued news articles on their accolades.  All very well deserved"}
{"text":"Really liked the food here. We went on a weird time between lunch and dinner. No wait- hardly anyone in the place. Service was fast and food was great. Will have to come back next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to check out the The Liberty yesterday and were definitely not disappointed!    We started with the smaller of the two pretzel appetizers and they were very well done.  The mustard dip added a great zing to the ungodly hot pretzels, but the cheese sauce left me unimpressed.    The lamb burgers we ordered were cooked just they way we had hoped.  They had a great char on them, keeping them nice and juicy.  The tomatoes, onions and goat cheese on top made this one mountainous burger, but we eventually took this thing down!    All around a great Saturday afternoon meal, but the only reason I can't give it five stars is because we didn't know they only offered a limited menu before 5pm.  There were no bad choices, it's just that some of the things I would've tried instead were not offered when we went.  The upside is now we have a great excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time this week.  Had an 8pm reservation, hostess staff was rude and didn't seat us until 8:45.  Wait staff was just as bad.  Took 15 minutes for WATER.  Food came out sporadically, most of which was cold.  All the guys at our table enjoyed their burgers, but the rest of us found the food was nothing special.  A waste of a Saturday night.  RUDE STAFF AND POOR SERVICE."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a ton of times.  My favorite desert is the budino which is rich enough to split.  I have had a little of everything on the menu and recommend anything with the goat cheese.  Their salads are very fresh and their burgers are large enough to split.  Their Sunday brunch is also fantastic which I recommend trying a bloody mary with.  I have also come here just to sit on the patio and drink with appetizers."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch with some girls from work.  You walk in and to the right is a bar area,  to the left is the actual restaurant with lots of seating.  The seating is kind of cool. They have wooden pallets stacked against the wall with back lighting shining through to give off a cool vibe.  The waitress we had, Rhonda was really nice and offered lots of suggestions on different menu items we should try. The service was great.   The only issue I had was that the food was a little cold. I had a cheese burger and I specifically ordered the burger because they we're named best burger by the Charlotte Observer in Helen Schwab's contest. The crust on the burger was excellent! I ordered it medium-well and it was perfectly cooked. The only problem is I could tell it had been sitting a little while before it came out to us. I thought it was maybe because they were busy... which is part of the reason. I think it was because they just got this great review today and all of a sudden everyone in Charlotte wanted to show up and eat there for lunch. We arrived at 11:40 got our order put in early before the lunch rush and then waited at least 30min for our food to come out.  I think all the wait staff was busy seating people and placing orders that they didn't have time to get the food out.   When we left there was a long waiting list of people trying to get in to have lunch.    Will go back but try not to go when it's a lunch or dinner rush."}
{"text":"Poutine and salted caramel boudino.  Where have you been all of my life?  Do I take both of you as my lawfully wedded something or other?  Yes, I do."}
{"text":"I wanted to go here because I have heard so much about this place. I actually don't see what the big hype is. If they are voted for the best burger in town, then they need to be a burger restaurant, not just have one burger on your menu. The menu seemed like they dont know what type of food they want to sell. I ordered a salad (full of mostly lettuce) and some mac and cheese dinner. It was ok. I wont go back. They do have a huge beer selection and brew some beer there. That building use to be Macintosh Restaurant, it should have never went out of business. The Liberty is over priced, next time if im trying to spend that much money, Im going to 131 Main."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped here to eat after a day of shopping. I asked the waiter if they closed at 3:00 pm like the other restaurant across the street. She said no, but she failed to tell me about the limited menu. I had the chicken sandwich. I wasn't really able to enjoy my meal because of the foul sewage odor that molested my nose while sitting outside on the patio. I went to the restroom and upon entering the restaurant, I was accosted by the sewage smell again."}
{"text":"Top notch food prep and service when I am in the Carolina's for work. The wait time isn't as bad as I have heard in the past and the pricing is top notch. I was here two weeks ago and plan on going back again. If I had to make any recommendation I would say more selection. They need a location in El Paso or Santa Fe."}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte.  Wow, it takes skill to eat it. Thick juicy and cooked to perfection.  The brioche bun - melt. The fries, to die for.  My only complaint, in the summer, it was consistently uncomfortably cold in the restaurant - take a parka.  At dinner, the prices are high for burgers - beware.    The brunch egg and bacon sandwich, decadent and yummy.   Have never finished my meal or tried dessert."}
{"text":"The pub burger for lunch is very fulfilling, the truffle fries are very tasty. I went there hoping to get the pork belly sliders but they don't serve that during lunch. Other than that,  the experience was good."}
{"text":"3 stars is being generous. The food wasn't bad but really not great. The truffle fries and blue cheese chips are excellent. The fish and chips were soggy and served in a puddle of fryer oil. Worse the interior was mushy - I think they coated the fish with mayo before frying and it wasn't pleasant to bite into. They also went artistic with my son's grilled cheese by adding some kind of herbed aioli. Maybe good for an adult but not for a kid.   Parking is horrible with the light rail station and other businesses there. And to top it off a homeless man came thru begging at every patio table, then entered the main restaurant and hit my husband on his way out. So after returning the fish and returning the grilled cheese and being assaulted the manager apologized but didn't adjust the bill at all. Not what I would have expected."}
{"text":"The burger was amazing. Thick, juicy, covered in oozing melted cheese, crisp bacon, the perfect fried egg and earthy truffle mayo. Quite the treat in trendy Dillworth."}
{"text":"Just okay. My fiancé and I are new to town so we're making our way through some of Charlotte's more well-known/popular restaurants. Last night we went to The Liberty, and I can't say we're planning on going back any time soon. I made a reservation and we were seated immediately but we waited a long time for service at our table -- and equally as long to get our first drinks. The people sitting next to us were seated after us and served before us - never a good sign of things to come. When we were ready to order we felt like we were annoying our waitress with menu questions (I asked what the best thing on the menu was and she said \"everything.\" Really...everything is the best? She was probably just having a bad day, and it didn't help that they were out of a lot of items. I had wanted their \"BLT\" salad - out, and my fiancé wanted his favorite beer - Ballast Point's Sculpin - out. For a beer place that's pretty disappointing. Had the fried pickles, which were decent (a little thin), the lobster mac + cheese, also decent, and my fiancé had the crunchy burger, which he liked and said was good. I think he definitely made the better food choice. I did have the fried candy bar for dessert -- that was good! Not the worst dining experience, but definitely far from the best."}
{"text":"The service at this location is way worse than the other property. The 16 Y/O hostess girls were very rude!! Our meal was nothing to write home about. Will not repeat. Too many options these days."}
{"text":"We decided to just drop by one evening here and we were so glad we did. The food was very, very good and their selection of brews were one of the best in town. We really enjoyed ourselves here and will be back."}
{"text":"The Liberty is good, but it could be so much better. There are few restaurants where I want to order everything on the menu, but this is one of those places. Everything I've had -- with one exception -- has been outstanding. That exception? The pub burger. It's sloppy and the beef barely has any taste, let alone enough to stand up to the caramelized onions and bacon they serve on it. The Angry/Arrogant mussells, chicken and dumplings and farro risotto are all standout dishes.  But the menu suffers from an identity crisis: it says it's a gastropub, focused on upscale bar food and great beer, but it acts like a fine dining establishment with upscale twists on Southern favorites. It needs to stop trying to be all things to all people and focus on one or the other. As it is now, there will always be someone bound to be disappointed or underwhelmed.   Some of their best dishes are sides and appetizers, which should be promoted to entree status, while their worst dish--the pub burger--should be their best. It's suffering from chef-owner syndrome, and hopefully the top brass can put aside their showboating and showcase their evident talent on humbler fare."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the Liberty.  I was excited to go and try this place out. I had heard about the extensive beer list, and that was the only aspect of our visit that did not disappoint.  They serve a good selection of drafts and bottles as well as wines.  I had a great draft cider, 'Original Sin'.  That was the highlight of our meal.  Our server misrepresented at least one dish, the vegetable plate, as it had none of what he described.  They only have one soup per day, and that changes.  All of the food for my table arrived lukewarm, and a lukewarm burger is not good.  Our server forgot our appetizer order, and then when prompted delivered it after our entrees.  The pretzel appetizer was good, but waay overpriced-- $6 for 2 small pretzels with mustard.    Overall, a bad experience.  If I got back, it will only be to the bar."}
{"text":"Slow service, space is cold feeling, been twice and not busy at all both times. Haven't had the food yet, just drinks. Went for their St. Patrick's Day party, I think they forgot to add the party."}
{"text":"I've been the The Liberty in South End a dozen times, so when I saw they were adding this location near me in Blakeney, I was excited, as it's close to the house.  Service was very good, as was the food.  Very happy about these since sometimes when a great place expands, the consistency of the food and service suffers.  It does not here.  However, what surprised me was the environment.  It feels like a drywall/concrete box with very little character, especially considering their other location.  Literally has concrete floors and drywall walls with little on the walls other than paint and a few tv's, providing a loud and echoing environment.  I was disappointed to walk in and find a basic square bar put up against a wall with little/no finishes  The bar top is the material you'd find in solid surface kitchen counters and the chairs are those cheap thin metal chairs which are very uncomfortable (some have backs and some are stools without).  The bartender called it industrial, but it really feels like they cut a bunch of corners and built this location on the cheap.  In the end, I'd love to see them meet the standard of the original location."}
{"text":"Sever Billing errors on credit card charges not resolved. Double charged for meal.  No management present, staff unable to correct their admitted errors and left matter unresolved.  Not sure if this is a repeating event, but this is establishment is no longer recommended.  I ended up filing a claim through the bank's fraud unit for reimbursement on the matter.  Should you decide to try this restaurant be advised to pay cash.  With 53 other restaurants in the South End area I am sure that there a more customer oriented establishment to be found.  Vincent Lenarcic"}
{"text":"Burgers were excellent!!! Cooked perfectly. The Mac and cheese was the best! Service was impeccable, our waitress Tyisha was great and the manager Brad stopped by to check on us. Oh and looks like they will be part of restaurant week."}
{"text":"The fries were cold, like out of the fridge cold and my egg was half raw.  Service was slow. Won't go back."}
{"text":"The price points are reasonable for the area.  The restaurant itself is geared more as an upscaled bar/food venue. There is a large bar area which is group friendly as well as larger tables in the dinning room which can accommodate larger groups. The menu itself is pretty good for every taste but one word of caution, Chicken and Dumplings are not your grandma's version. It has two chicken breast in some type of brown broth and small dumplings, see the attached photo for a better idea. Overall avenge for a \"date night\" place but good for an everyday dinner outing with a group."}
{"text":"Wonderful drinks and food! I am vegan and the waitstaff was so helpful and accommodating. My arugula salad was delicious!!!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"My landlord recommended Liberty to me the other day so I thought I would check it out.  I was definitely impressed!  I had read a little about it - being a gastropub and what not.  The decor was very hip inside.  The walls are backlit and lined with pallet-wood.  there is also some strange structure in the middle made out of this same pallet material with columns of metal kegs.  There is lit up art of macro sized frothy beer.  It looked pretty interesting.  They had a relatively good selection of national beers, including local options.  The food was great as well.  I had the fennel sausage (amazing) and my friend had the pork chops.  One knock would be the pricing - I assumed it would be more in line with upscale pub pricing.  It was more like upper-mid range pricing.  The food was better than expected, however - only slightly over sodiumed.  Service was good, our waitress was very enthusiastic.  Check it out if you have a few extra dollars to spend.  Eat inside, especially if it is dinner - the outdoor area isn't that spectacular."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday a little after the brunch rush to grab a drink and some bites and watch some football.  Grabbed a seat at the bar and were immediately given a shorter menu (they have a limited list during lunch and dinner) and the beer list. The beer list was pretty decent and my husband and I both grabbed a brew.  They didnt have the veggie burger on the limited menu but the bartender said they would make it for us, which was sweet. We split the veggie burg between the two of us (they brought it out on two plates, which was nice!)  Man, you couldnt even tell that burger wasnt actually meat! Easily the best veggie burg I have ever eaten! It had a jam on it and was piled with tomato, goat cheese, and lettuce. So flavorfull! The burg came with parmesan fries which were well cooked and a nice size portion for two! Will definitely return when my vegetarian senses take over again!"}
{"text":"This review only has to do with our experience for Thanksgiving. Man o Man did this place suck! It was $25 per person and was not worth any of it. We made dinner reservations for 6pm and they told us that it was the last open spot. When we walked in the door it looked empty, we looked at each other and in our heads we were trying to figure what the deal was. I ordered the VA Pork Belly and my wife ordered the Lobster, Crab cake. The presentation I give an A as for the food quality and taste I give it a F. I was looking forward to this appetizer since I saw it online a day earlier. As for the main course we both wanted to get the Prime Rib and our server came over to tell us that they were out of it for rest of the night. Strike 2! We ended up getting the Turkey and Pork wrapped in Bacon. Again, when it came looked great and yet again left us with an empty hopes and wishes. Never again will I go or recommend this place to anyone for Turkey day. I will go there again to try there other food and hopefully it will be a lot better."}
{"text":"Truffle fries app was pretty good, all of our sandwiches tasted good but were extremely messy and challenging to eat. Service was a little absent. Prices were fine. It's a decent place but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this eatery for various reasons.   First, despite hvaing reservations, they sat us at a table immediately adjacent to the wait station. That meant that every time, sometimes several times per minute, the waitstaff had to practically climb over me to enter or update an order.   Note to management: This really sucks. I'm sorry your dining room is smaller than you liked, but THERE SHOULD **NOT** BE A TABLE HERE.PERIOD.  Our request to be moved to a different table was flatly denied by the hostess, all the while I eyed the empty, dirty tables just feet away in a much better location.   My beer arrived in a bottle without a glass or offer of one. I guess lack of barware is what makes this a pub, and not a restaurant.   My food was slightly above average to good, with the steak being the highlight of the meal. My wife's entree however- a cornish hen concoction was bland, and dry. She did not enjoy it at all. The manager asked her about it, and quickly disappeared. They still charged us for it. Worst $20 we ever wasted.  Finally our leftovers were unceremoniously plopped into a enviro-friendly cardboard box, no bag, which immediately sogged through, and promptly fell apart. I get the whole 'green' movement, but this was not an appropriate container. I have the stain on my car seat to prove it.   All in all, after spendng ~$100 for dinner for the two of us, we would not go back. At all. I would recommend the much better Tupelo Honey Cafe across the parking lot, or even Fuel Pizza across the street. There are far too many good restaurants in this area to waste time in this unfriendly joint."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to review when I have a really great or really bad experience. Today was really bad one. The bartender with dark shoulder length hair with a tattoo on her left arm just above her wrist was the most ignorant server I've ever had. It was like we were bothering her. She snapped at my husband after he was looking at the drafts \"the list is right in front of you\". It was 4 pm on a Saturday. There were 4 tables in the bar. It's not like she was overwhelmed and busy. Another customer asked her to put the patriots Chiefs playoff game on and she shook her head and rolled her eyes As he walked away. If customers make you that angry you should get out of the service industry. Aside from her the menu was small and limited and we only ordered pretzels. The cheese they served to dip them in was the best part of my experience. The cheese gets 5 stars. Otherwise get your stuff together Liberty. This was bad enough of an experience for me to never return."}
{"text":"Great food, I mean really really great food.  Took my parents here when they were in town (they're big foodies) and we loved everything.  My favorite place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The Liberty is one of mine and the Boyfriend's favorite neighborhood joints.  They have a spectacular beer menu with revolving taps, which Boyfriend majorly digs.  Mostly we've been at lunch time, which prices fit in better with our budget.  Highlights I've tried include the Barbecue sandwich, Colorado Lamb burger, and tomato soup (side).    The Barbecue sandwich is stuffed with big chunks of tender pork in a sweet & tangy sauce - it's not NC-style vinegary Q, but if you can come to terms with that, it's a great sandwich. The melted Gouda seems a bit superfluous though, and gets lost between the pork, the slaw and WAY yummy (brioche?) bun. Next time I'd get it cheeseless.  The Lamb Burger is just about too big to fit in your mouth, so I end up having to eat it sideways.  They are not at all stingy with the goat cheese, which I am majorly appreciative of. The grilled onions and roasted peppers are very flavorful, and again, it's on that superdelicious brioche-y bun.  One thing on the burgers - they do cook to order, but seem to undercook (?). I've had the lamb burger 2x; the first time I ordered medium rare and received something that was quite a bit pinker than expected. The second time I ordered medium, and got something I would have called medium-rare, which suited me fine. Boyfriend ordered medium for his Pub beef burger, and bit into a fairly pink patty.  He didn't send it back or complain, but said that he would have preferred it to be a little more cooked.   Sides: Mac & cheese seemed somewhat bland to me, but I've only tried it once. Maybe hit an off day?  Parmesan fries are always hot, crispy, delicious and plentiful.  Usually Boyfriend orders them as a side, and I help him with them ;)   Tomato soup is creamy but not overly-rich; tangy, with fun little popcorn bits floating on top (which need eating quickly, though, else they get soggy).   Green beans were tender-crisp with a just-right lemon-garlic-buttery sauce.  We've been for dinner once. Boyfriend's Fish & Chips were good, with the afore-mentioned dependable fries and crispy, fresh fish. I had some conconction involving sausage-stuffed bacon-wrapped trout, which was decent but maybe had just a little too much going on? Duck fat potatoes on the side were good, but greasy.   Overall, this is one of our top go-to lunch spots, and we're always eager to fit in another visit."}
{"text":"I've been here way more than my 2 check-ins and the staff and service is always excellent. Food is great, the drinks are great. Parking is easy even during peak hours, and the location is convenient no matter where you are in Charlotte. 5 stars here, it's a regular stop."}
{"text":"I agree with all the other 2 star reviews. Noisy, average at best food and wait staff with attitudes. Recommend getting new staff that cares about customers than their phones."}
{"text":"Warning!!  Don't buy a gift certificate from this restaurant, and if you already have one, use it immediately. Why?  When this restaurant goes out of business, you'll be stuck with a worthless piece of paper with no recourse. This restaurant has the same ownership as The Liberty on South End and Lumiere in Myers Park, both of which have permanently closed in the past few weeks.  Given the terrible Yelp reviews of this Blakeney location, the days are likely numbered for this Blakeney location as well. I had an unused Groupon for The Liberty in South End; that voucher mysterious got marked as \"used\" right when they went out of businesses, leaving me with nothing to show for it.  Worse yet, I had a gift certificate for Lumiere with an unused balance and a reservation already set to use it.  I then received an email from Open Table telling me that the reservation was cancelled because Lumiere had unexpectedly gone out of business.  So I called Lumiere's phone number, leaving a voice message asking about what I could do with this unused gift certificate. No response at all.  There was no email contact address on Lumiere's website, so I emailed The Liberty's main address (since it's the same ownership), asking about what my options were for this gift certificate.  No response.  So I emailed the Liberty Blakeney email address asking about it.  Still no response.  In other words, I'm stuck.  They got the money, pocketed the pure profit, and then left me with a worthless piece of paper.  You expect any better results when the Blakeney location goes belly up?  Don't bet on it.  If they won't at least show some integrity by offering a refund or at least honoring the gift certificate at a sister restaurant, they are unjustly enriched and just don't care.  Is that a business to whom you want to give money?"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The food was good. The poutine is really outstanding."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to The Liberty, advertised as \"Charlotte's First Gastropub\" in the South End of Charlotte. The Liberty's interior is well lit and modern, and their food elevates pub fare to another level.  Dora here. The interior was nice and roomy, but check out their patio. Beautiful! Too bad it was a bit chilly to sit outside.   As a starter, we ordered the house-made pretzels with beer cheese and mustard. These pretzels were great, served warm and buttery with just the right amount of salt. They were soft on the inside and paired well with the beer cheese dipping sauce. Our only regret was we didn't order the larger size.  Dora here. Yeah! We brought Little Man. Why didn't we order the tower? Good thing you can't see the mangled pretzel on the bottom. We dug right in, so excited we forgot to snap a picture! lol. These pretzels were perfect, so soft and fresh. Forget the mustard. Dive right into that cheese. Yummo!  I ordered the Painted Hill's Natural Crunch Burger. Pimento cheese, smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, and house-made chips stacked high. This burger was huge and so juicy I had to wipe my face after every bite. The combination of the pimento cheese and bacon worked great together and the added crunch from the chips added a unique feature to this burger.  Dora here. The Irish Hills Black Angus Pub Burger was heaped with three or four thick slices of meaty bacon, cheese, caramelized onions, herb aioli, lettuce and tomato. Humongous! The aioli and the soft bun makes this burger sing, one of the best burgers I've ever tasted! And the chips? Ohhhhh! Consistently firm, not greasy at all, and seasoned just right.   The Liberty is kid-friendly, if a tad pricey. The cheese spilled over on the grilled ciabatta, a huge portion (sorry I didn't get a pic!), and hubby stole gobs of fries off Little Man's plate. You definitely get your money's worth on a child's plate, and probably some food to take home...er, share.  Parking may be an issue since The Liberty shares a lot with Tupelo Honey Cafe, also a hopping place. (See our review of Tupelo here) But on street parking behind the CATS station (just beyond the parking lot) is FREE on Saturday and Sunday. Trust me on this. After you eat, you'll be glad for the walk. :)  We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies"}
{"text":"Very recently, The Liberty came highly recommended to us, so we thought we'd give it a try.  We reserved a table for 8:30pm on Opentable.com as we were on our way and were quickly seated upon arrival.  We were seated in the main dining area and we were loudly greeted with a screaming child seated behind our table, so we decided to move to the bar part of the restaurant, easy to find a table and a fun environment in the bar! We started off with The Pretzel Tower. It actually comes in a tin bucket with 5 med/large sized SO SO SOFT pretzels with a nice side of cheese sauce and another side of hot mustard sauce.  The hot mustard will definitely clear your sinus's, so beware!!  The waitress didn't tell us what the sauces were, so ONE of us taught the rest of us WHAT NOT TO DO, don't heavy dip with the mustard sauce!  There were four of us, so two of us ordered burgers, another 'The Bangers and Mash' and I ordered The Wedge Salad with shrimp.  The menu is pretty simple, but it isn't very descriptive on what accompanies each menu item, so you have to rely on the server to help.   When it's busy like it was last night, a Saturday night, good luck getting all those questions answered in a timely manner.  The burgers were tall and good eating, the fries were delicious and seasoned,  The Bangers and Mash were good as well.   The Wedge Salad was a bit on the smaller size for a main dish and on the menu itself, doesn't offer adding meats to the salad as an option (had to ask the server), I chose shrimp and the 5/6 shrimp were a good size, yummy and cooked to perfection!   As far as the service, once we were served our meal, the service started to dive.  The additional beers that we ordered still hadn't arrived by the time we were 3/4 done with our meal.  We asked our server the status and then she went back to check and came back saying that they had been hidden.  Really? Once we were done eating, it was a half an hour sipping our late drinks and waiting for the bill, paying, and getting out of there.  So, the food was pretty good, the service started off great, but as the place began clearing out, our service did too. We might return, maybe?"}
{"text":"Stopped into The Liberty for lunch after noticing their sign outside claiming \"Best Burger in Charlotte\" or something of that nature. With a claim like that it was hard to pass up.  In an attempt to try two things in one visit, my cousin and I decided to each order a sandwich and split each. We went with the House-Smoked BBQ Kobe Beef Brisket and the Irish Hills Black Angus Pub Burger. Both were well-priced for lunch and included a side so it seemed like the way to go.  The beef brisket sandwich was great with a substantial portion of meat and a flavorful sauce. The meat itself was well-smoked and perfectly tender.  The burger was also very good. I could tell the meat was ground in-house which certainly set it apart from other burgers in town but something did have me feeling like a little added spice to the meat itself would have really kicked the burger up a notch. As with the brisket, the portion for the burger was great and with the addition of a side resulted in a great value for everything we got.  In the future I'll be exploring more of the menu and likely will venture towards something other than the sandwiches. As for now, I would certainly suggest stopping into The Liberty to try one of their burgers. Although very good I can't say it is the best burger I've ever had. However, for a Charlotte it may certainly be a contender."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I've never been disappointed in the quality of food. Great dinner selection with good deals during happy hour. Their drinks are also delicious. Sometimes they have live music on the patio which is fun!   Their brunch scene isn't usually too crowded (it's typically people who don't want to wait in the 2 hour line across the street). However, brunch is just as good!   Only reason it gets 4 stars is the price.. dinner can quickly jump up in price. Go during restaurant week for a good deal. Or check out Groupon because sometimes gift cards are offered!"}
{"text":"My family stopped in on a Saturday at 6pm. The place was, no exaggeration, half empty. The hostess told us it would be a 2.5 hour wait!! Annoyed, we went to one of the ten restaurants nearby and were seated immediately. We walked by Liberty again after dinner... still had several empty tables.  If they are going to turn away customers... soon people aren't going to bother trying to go there."}
{"text":"The bar area is nice, they have a good selection of local beers on tap and some appealing cocktails. The restaurant side has a nice cozy atmosphere. The food on the other hand is subpar, and overpriced. I had the chicken breast sandwich with fries...it was ok, nothing that blew my mind but nothing else on the menu sounded good. My friend got the chicken and dumplings which was a piece of chicken with gnocchi dumplings and some veggies. She wasn't impressed with it. I would maybe go back for drinks but I wouldn't go back for dinner and I would not recommend it to anyone else to go."}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected, it was better :-). I really like the split in atmospheres from one side of the building to the other. On the left it's more intimate with the amber lighting, relaxed feel and more booth style seating. While the right is more upbeat with the bar, high top tables and open windows. It was a Thursday night and they had a great live musician as well.  They don't have a crazy long list of wines but they have a great selection. They have great drinks in general from cocktails to IPA's. What I love most about the place was their great staff. They are nice, upbeat, helpful and genuinely in good spirits. Although their menu looks very appealing I will have to come back and add to my review for the food portion. I had more of a wine appetite than food that night. I did have a pretzel (which came with a great horseradish sauce). But I wrote a review anyway because the place left such a great impression on me and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great non-sports bar atmosphere in the Southend area."}
{"text":"We went the first time during Queen's Feast- service and food were excellent. All courses were prepared fresh and flavorful; portions and prices appropriate. We went again and had an excellent experience. The seafood was quality and the portions generous. They had 1/2 price bottles of wine- good selection. All courses were excellent. Will return again for sure!"}
{"text":"This is definitely an occassion where I need 3 1/2 stars because I felt like three isn't enough, but I'm not sure this place is 4 worthy quite yet.  We went to The Liberty for my birthday and originally planned to attend the five-course beer dinner being sponsored by Big Boss brewery.  But, when we arrived, the beer dinner patrons were all gathered around the downstairs bar and it appeared to be a \"single and ready to mingle\" crowd that wasn't interesting me or my boyfriend.  So, we decided to go upstairs and eat off the regular menu.  For starters, we had the \"Devils on Horseback\" which are dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with bleu cheese, drizzled with a savory balsamic reduction.  They truly live up to their name because they are quite evil and if eaten in abundance, I'm sure they would be cause for going straight to hell.  In other words, they are rich and decadent, a tiny little explosion of heaven in your mouth.  Yum.  The other app that we tried turned out to be the one really weak spot in the night:  the pork belly sliders with pickles and vanilla apple butter.  Sure, these sound good in theory, but when it came down to it, the combination of vanilla, pork, pickle, and apple didn't work for me at all.  I think the pickle/vanilla combo was really off.  Those flavor profiles don't really work together..  The belly itself was also undercooked and that just makes it.....well, kinda gross.   Moving on to dinner.  I had the scallop special and it was fantastic!  There were two giant hockey puck-sized seared scallops served on a bed of risotto that was spiked with chunks of rock shrimp and fresh asparagus.  Yum, yum, yum!!!  So good!  These were probably the biggest scallops I've ever eaten in my life....it was like cutting into a steak.  A really tender, sweet steak.  :)  My boyfriend had the chicken and dumplings....standard, yet tasty.   The piece de resistance for me, however, was dessert.  Rocky Road Creme Brulee.  Holy crap.  That's all I need to say. We sampled a variety of beers, and I am impressed by the selection and the prices are reasonable.  All in all, I like this place alot and will probably be back.  Thank you for making up for the birthday dinner disaster at Cabo last year, it's appreciated!"}
{"text":"Been to Liberty several times now and the food has always been very good .  The Pub burger is one of the best burgers in town.  Great place!!!"}
{"text":"I am having an affair with the budino.  I'd go to The Liberty just for dessert!  If you have not tried it, I cannot recommend it enough.  I am not a huge dessert person but I could eat about 3 budinos in a row if given the opportunity.  They're near orgasmic.    We first went to the Liberty when they first opened & they hadn't quite gotten their ducks in order yet, the pretzels tasted like the frozen ones at the grocery store & the food was expensive for what you got.  We have since come for restaurant week & a date night and have been much more impressed.   I wish they served the Restaurant week menu all year round, even the salads were out of this world.  I was glad to see the farro risotto & budino were regular menu staples.   Every course was downright amazing & ended with the amazingness of the budino.  I was sold on the Liberty after Restaurant week, so we went back a few weeks later for a late date night.  The food was a notch below Restaurant Week, but still delicious.  and of course I had another budino.    They have really stepped it up with the pretzels, I am not joking when I say I would go for a beer, some pretzels & a budino & not be at all sad that I wasn't eating dinner.    My only gripe is how expensive the beer is, but they do have a good list & ever rotating taps & get in great obscure & rare beers that they notify their twitter followers about."}
{"text":"Probably been here half a dozen times and have always had enjoyable experiences. Highly recommend the American Crunch Burger -- pimento cheese, potato chips (on the burger, you get choice of a side), bacon, lettuce, and tomato -- absolutely delicious, albeit pretty pricey (15.95). The Bangers and Mash entree is also a favorite of mine. The bar has a  great list of craft beer as well, and the selection  goes well beyond Olde Meck and Noda Brewing, which are both fine, but can get old after being featured ubiquitously in Charlotte bars and restaurants.   As mentioned in previous reviews, parking is tight. Must be Tupelo Honey folks because this place is never crowded when I go. Went the Sunday before MLK day to catch an NFL playoff game and I was the only one in the restaurant OR bar area at 8:30pm -- so can't say it is has the most vibrant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cool decor with amazing brunch. Great for families and couples. Spacious and inviting restaurant in South end. Great service. Our server Lindsey was super nice!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  They had a guy playing guitar and singing it was great.  Had the Crunch burger and hush puppies they both were yummy.  Will come here again"}
{"text":"My husband and I both agreed that this was definitely not a do-over. The onion rings were factory made frozen from a box at 1$ a ring. The veggie burger was a bland blend of veggies. We sent the sweet potato fries back and the tater tots were not much better. I hate to give a bad review. However, this was a waste of hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Went to the Liberty once. Stood at the door took forever for me to be acknowledged and then was told to find a seat.. Was not really impressed with the burger either."}
{"text":"tried this place out last weekend and it wasnt bad. I would give it 4 stars for the food. The burgers are good and the fries were great. But it was VERY pricey for what it was. I would have happily paid $8-$10 for the burgers we had, but one was 13 and the other was 16. And by no means were they the best burgers in town. Good food, but WAYYYYY overpriced."}
{"text":"Something always goes wrong whenever we go here.  We started going here because we heard they had poutine.  The first time we went we got poutine and buffalo brussel sprouts.  It was slow.  The Facebook page had said there would be an unlimited poutine special that night. The waitress didn't know what we were talking about so we ordered normal poutine.  It was fantastic.  Their gravy is amazing. They were generous with the cheese curds.  They brought us normal (not buffalo) Brussels sprouts.  We pointed this out and they said they would fix this.  They then brought us more Brussels sprouts. These also were not buffalo and were identical to the first.  We pointed it out again and they took these back and added the buffalo elements but this whole process probably took 45 minutes.  They still charged us for them and didn't offer any discounts or anything.  The next time we went we got poutine again but the cheese curds had Ben replaced by normal cheese.  It was still good though. We figured they were probably out of cheese curds but we wished they had given us a heads up.  The last time we went we ordered poutine and there was no cheese at all.  We asked about it and they said they could bring us some salad bar style shredded yellow cheese.  The waiter forgot that someone in our party ordered Brussel sprouts.  We had to ask him to refill our waters and service was slow despite the restaurant being empty. They also crammed us into a corner right next to the only other people in the restaurant.  They just keep messing up in really stupid ways.  If you have time to kill the food is good."}
{"text":"I used to love the Liberty, back when it first open it was the best burger in Charlotte. I admittedly turned a blind eye to its decline until my last experience.  Bragging about how good the burger was I forced to eat my words (and the food). It was more bun than burger and left a bad taste in my mouth. I am not sure I will be returning.  Read more at: http://eatitcharlotte.com/2016/09/15/the-liberty/"}
{"text":"Yum! Perfect bar food, great beer selection, and fun atmosphere. I ordered the crunch burger, and I'm still dreaming of it.  Our table also ordered the pretzels, poutine, and calamari fries, and they were all gobbled up."}
{"text":"3.5 if you could. Great food, unique menu. Prices inline with the area being more uptown trendy in the south end district. Service was o.k. All burgers and sandwiches come with fries and any other option is an added price upgrade. Most beers around $6 so expect a couple of 2 with drinks and meal each to be around $50 with tip."}
{"text":"I visited the Liberty last week for the first day and was pleased. I wasn't sure as to what to expect from a \"gastropub\" so I went in with an empty stomach and my fingers crossed. We sat outside on the patio, which was perfect weather for a fall day but alot of noise with it being right off South Blvd. I noticed two things right off on the menu 1) Not alot of items (but I guess thats one of the aspects of a gastropub) and 2) Holy high prices batman! I was thinking about a burger but really wasn't feeling the whole $12/$13 for one.   I ended up getting the BBQ Pork Belly Sliders which were succulent and ok---out of this world. I think I was moaning with each bite and didn't want it to ever end. After seeing the french fries at our neighboring table, I got an order as well and they were disappointing. Limp=bad. Service was quick and attentive. All in all, I would head back here but definitely not the place to go if you are looking for huge portions or have something specific in my mind."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner that started with the sinful Poutine, continued with Short Ribs and ended with the Salted Caramel Budino. My husband had the Crunch Burger which he raved about. The food was great and our service was equally great. The only negative was the beers both my husband and I initially ordered were no longer available but this was not communicated to us upfront so there was a delay in being served our beer while the Poutine had already been brought to us.   It seems there is a breakdown in communication between the person who monitors the beer inventory to the server so that would be something to work on improving and why I was not able to give \"5\" stars."}
{"text":"This review is reflective of the service not the food. I went to the library to celebrate two friends birthday and it was a large group. The front end of my experience was good, the problem came in when it was time to pay the bill. I gave the server, Caitlin,  my debit card to close out my $23 bill and when I went to sign the receipt I saw that my card had been charged for $359!! Just as I noticed, the sever came running back and said \"don't worry it did not go through\" and took the billing envelope back (I assumed to correct my bill but she did not say nor did she apologize for the error). Naturally, I pulled up my bank account and sure enough it showed the $359 as \"processing\" which meant that my balance was immediately reduced and I did not have access to the funds. I tried to wait patiently but it had been several minutes and I had not seen Caitlin. I went to look for her and could not find her so I asked for a manger. I was assured by PM supervisor Alicia that the bill was not closed out (whatever that means) and this type of thing happens all the time (what???!) and whenever it does as long as it is not closed out the transaction falls off in the morning. I work in banking and that did not feel right to me. Typically it takes a couple of days for these types of things to fall off and $350 is not chump change. Everyone seemed so cool and calm, I guess because it wasn't their $350!! I asked about the procedure if it doesn't fall off as she said and she gave me the owner Matt's #. Sure enough, I pulled up my account the following day and the $350 charge is still there. I call the # provided for Matt and am told he is not in and that there was no one there that could help me. The best they could do was take down my # and they would be sure he got the message. No one could seem to tell when he would be in because he was \"busy opening another location.\" Nice. The pub burger and fries I had was great but the sloppiness and lax attitude of the staff ruined an otherwise joyous occasion. We will see if Matt returns my call and does anything to make this right.   ***Update: I did not receive a call from Matt BUT I did call back until I got him. He asked questions to understand what happened, apologized and sent me a gift card to use toward my next meal. I am appreciative of the gesture. Updating to 4 stars.\""}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here! Sit outside if it's nice. Had the pretzels for a starter.   CRUNCH BURGER IS A MUST! Wow. Just wow.   MacNCheese is very fancy...not my preferred style but tasty."}
{"text":"Had lunch today for Mother's Day at The Liberty. First of all, when I made the reservation, no one mentioned that there would only be a 3 courses for $30 menu available, so when we got there and found out we were pretty disappointed. Second, the hostess said she would get us a high chair and then never returned, leaving my husband to get it for us. We ordered our 3 course meal around 1:30 and waited over 50 minutes for any food to arrive. Our waiter, Kendall, was very nice and attentive, but the food was ridiculously slow, and a manager never even came out to check on us or apologize. When the food did finally come out, I have to say it was very good, but we were so over it after waiting forever. We had to have the dessert boxed up so we could get out of there under 2 hours. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I just gave this the 3 stars its averaged out to, with the caveat I haven't been there in about 6 months. I've been there about 3-4 times before that as I had a friend who worked there and went there to hang with her. In scanning the reviews on this place, the bad one always have a common element of bad service/surly servers/unknowledgibe servers, and I gotta admit that is my experience exactly...always been a fan of the food, but at best you get decent service; not great, not above & beyond...adequate is the best you can hope for...on the flip side you get the annoyed server, the server who has to go ask someone about every menu ? you have, the server who comes by your table about once an hour, etc......hey LIBERTY owners/managers, do you read these?...they come from a wide swath of people over a large period of time...there ARE good wait people out there, do u make an attempt to find any?...or weed out the bad ones once hired...I'd come back for the food but nothing else right now compels me to visit...."}
{"text":"Ambiance- I sat at the bar and was very comfortable with the setting. The dining room looked above average with a clean simple design  Fare- I had the Chicken Sandwich and was very happy with it. The jalapeno bacon was a welcomed addition to the sandwich. A few of the menu items caught my eye and I will be returning to try them. Also, they have a fantastic beer and wine list.  Overall, if you have a hankering for high quality pub food at an affordable price, I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I first ordered food from uber eats and the order was wrong. I called and the manager apologized and kindly wrote my name down to have my order replaced. I came back ordered my food to go. I Judy got to my destination and opened my food and my burger that was supposed to be medium well was burnt like I asked for WELL. Really reaaly sad cause the place has so many good reviews and I can tell the food is actually good when it's made the right way and not burnt.   People are really nice tho."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family on a whim. My dad noticed they were open so we stopped in. The contemporary decor adds to the experience, we sat underneath the large coin painting, very cool! The bacon popcorn appetizer was interesting, but ultimately all the bacon fell to the bottom of the bowl and eating it with your fingers made a mess all over the table. I would suggest trying to make homemade kettle corn and add the bacon in last second so it sticks to the popcorn! I ordered the short rib poutine for my entree and it was fantastic, very rich and flavorful. Everyone was pleased with their burgers, the grilled cheese, and the fish n chips. Everyone at the table was raving about the Parmesan fries. Our experience was very positive and we will be back! Tip: ask about the Sautéed Baby."}
{"text":"I decided to give The Liberty another try since the first visit didn't go very well.  We went to try their burgers which have made several lists of the top burgers in Charlotte.  We arrived at 12:30 on a Sunday and were told it was a 10 minute wait.  Several tables left and were cleaned but we still waited.  The host came over and told us they were waiting to seat us to allow the wait staff to catch up.  We were then seated within the initial time frame. I ordered the pub burger with Parmesan fries. The fries were ok, nothing special.  My burger was ordered medium but was beyond well done. The tomatoes were red but not flavored like a good ripe tomato.  The burger was $14.  I don't see a reason to go back as there are far better burgers in Charlotte for less than that. Just not special!"}
{"text":"We live nearby The Liberty and do our best to frequent often.  The food is great, with an ever changing menu.  However, it is always a running joke with us about how bad the service is.  It is SLOW.  We've been 8 times or more, and I can't tell you once where we've had good service.  However, we keep going back because the food is that good.  Their \"lunchbox\" special is always a great value.  Their burgers are generally very good, and we love their appetizers.  We will sometimes go to get apps and drinks there before heading out for dinner that night because they are so good.  The beer selection is good and changes as well.  All in all, it is a place worth trying, so long as you aren't in any particular hurry."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, perfect atmosphere.  I love the live music as well!  Always a treat to come here!"}
{"text":"Was there on Mother's Day. Limited menu.  All the items looked great. The appetizer was really good. However 1:05 after being sat with a limited menu and not busy (1:30 post peak) we had no food. We left after paying 1/3 the set price. Drinks ran dry a few times as well. Bummer because the little we got was tasty.   Not sure how many reviews they need on service times to get it right. Hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"Great decor and fun place to go for dinner or lunch. I was in Montreal last fall and discovered poutine and the liberty has this dish and does it well!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the it wasnt crowded at all but it was also sunday evening. I had a there burger with pimento cheese and potatoe chips it was a great burger, i actually wasnt able to finish it which for me is aactually a big deal. the Fried pickles were great as well, the service was excellent which is nice because the time before I visited with my wife it was not the best experience we could have had. i am glad this was a better dining experience as it will add the Liberty to list places to frequent when we are in the south end."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I love a good burger and was excited to try The Liberty, but unfortunately I was underwhelmed and unimpressed.  Took a birthday trip here with a friend and was immediately seated and greeted by our waitress. She was very helpful with beer selection even bringing samples. After settling on our beer choices I ordered a burger (can't remember which one) it was cooked perfectly medium and the fries were nicely salted. It was a nice size burger but lacking in flavor.   The food was good but I've had better burgers and I'm in no rush to get back."}
{"text":"Myself and several friends went to check out liberty and it was sub-par to say the best. Granted it is a new bar/restaraunt but the entire atmosphere feels more 'manufactured' than comfortable. The servers were not familiar with the menu and the food, while adequate, was not anywhere near the 20$ a plate price it commanded. They have a decent beer selection but it was overpriced and in the same breath the first couple choices on the menu we made they happened to 'be out of'. My advice is if you are looking for a fine dinning experience, definitely look elsewhere. If you are looking for a place to spend premium dollars on mediocre food and service then please be sure and stop in for a drink or some food."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch. I ordered the stuffed portobello and it was delicious! The food is always fresh and the wait staff is very attentive. Great place!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  Haven't written a bad one in a very very long time.  The only reason I am now is the manager didn't have the decency to come over to address the obvious issues.  He left our server, who did an amazing job in a tough spot, hanging.  I find that to be the biggest fail of the entire experience.  Limited menu, not Michael's fault, mussels that smelled suspect, not Michael's fault, food not to our liking, not anyone's fault.  Michael,our observant and concerned server, went out of his way to try and make us happy.  No visit from manager.  I will hire Michael in a second.   Now we are sitting in Chili's getting something to eat after dropping $55, $15 of which for the great service.  Had very high hopes for supporting the local restaurant industry."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal of small plates and excellent service by Amanda tonight!  The highlights were the calamari, and the pretzels.  The BBQ shrimp was good but didn't compare to the ones I had in New Orleans, the wedge salad was very good but too many caramelized onions overwhelmed the other flavors.  I liked the grilled sausage but my daughter really didn't.  We loved the service we got from Amanda who made us feel welcome on a very busy night and anticipated our needs without ever having to be flagged down.   We would love to try some of The Liberty's other offerings the next time we come to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Was our first time coming but we will definitely be back. The Texas brisket sandwich was the bomb! I can see what some were saying about the warm beer (I just had a taster) but our experience was great!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The place looks really cool and trendy but they cants even make a good burger. No good local craft beer options which is crazy for a \"trendy burger bar\". Overpriced and poor service. Fail."}
{"text":"We went to The Liberty for the first time this past weekend.  I'd avoided it 'til now because I didn't really know enough about it.  \"The Liberty\" doesn't really tell me anything, and their logo looks like that of an insurance company's.  After the restaurant was recommended to me by several friends and looking at the photos online of the modern decor, we decided to give it a try.   I was impressed with the interior.  From the bland exterior, you wouldn't know that it actually has a modern, hip atmosphere.  The bar area is very roomy, too.  It's an actual room.  You can actually stand around and talk to friends without being squooshed.  The beer selection is pretty extensive, so I got to try a new pumpkin ale and a (sweet) cider I had never before heard of.    After we sat down at our table, our friends ordered the pork rinds appetizer; we ordered the crispy calamari fries.  I tried the pork rinds and they did have some good flavor, but I just can't eat them, knowing what they are and where they come from.  The calamari fries were fantastic, though.  They were so flavorful, and cooked just right.  They were actual strips of calamari instead of rings.  I could have eaten a bucketful.    I had heard such wonderful things about the burgers at The Liberty that, naturally, I had to try one.  I didn't realize, though, that burgers (plural) meant burger (singular).  There's one beef burger option on the menu.  We were a bit surprised.  My partner and I split the famous \"Pub Burger\" and the lamb burger.  The lamb burger was delicious.  It had a lot of flavor, and the toppings really complemented it.  The Pub Burger on the other hand was...just ok.  I'm not exactly sure why it was named \"Best Burger in Charlotte.\"  It had the burger patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and bacon.  Your basic burger.  Good, but not exciting.  I've had much better burgers and better topping combinations at Big Daddy's (now Bad Daddy's), Nix Burgers, and, yes, even Red Robin.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get a Pub Burger.    All in all, I liked the casual atmosphere, the reasonable food prices, the drink options, and the calamari, but I was disappointed in the lack of exciting burger options and the Charlotte Observer's dubious distinction of \"best burger.\""}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We sat at the bar at like 5pm on a Tuesday and the service was horrific. Bartenders extremely disinterested. One came and took our drink and food order and never came back.  Other bartender finally came over after we had finished eating and our drinks were empty for a while and checked us out. We didn't even care to stay for a second drink cause we felt unwanted and a burden.  Food was not impressive at all in my opinion and too expensive. $15.00 for a burger... better be amazing and honestly five guys tastes better. This place has good reviews so might try again and not sit at the bar.   Also maybe should have some type of uniform cause your waitress had on yoga pants, uggs and a cheetah tank on..... employee appearance and service have a huge affect on customer experience.. felt dirty and unpleasant."}
{"text":"Came in from NYC and was thrilled with the food here. The Montana steak and the duck fat potatoes were excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Myself and 4 girlfriends went here for dinner on cinco de mayo. The evening started off on a bad note immediately. There were only 4 chairs at the table and the waitress did not offer to get us another one, we fetched our own. It then took her a good 15 minutes to come and take our drink orders. When she finally got our drinks and took our appetizer order, a good 25 minutes later, I ordered the hummus plate and one of my girlfriends ordered the boiled peanuts. The peanuts eventually found their way to our table but after 30 minutes, still no hummus. When our fleeting waitress finally walked by our table, I flagged her down, inquiring about my hummus. She proceeded to stand there and tell my that I ordered my hummus as my meal. I quickly reminded her that I did not. I put it in with the app order and she even commented \"you can never have too much hummus\" in her deadpan voice. I also reminded her that the arugula salad was my entree. She finally agreed and went to check on my hummus. When it finally did arrive, it was accompanied by my meal...fine, whatever, at least I got it. Now, the description of my dinner salad was this, arugula, shaved pears, goat cheese, beets, pistachios and I added grilled chicken. Sitting in front of me was a bed of arugula with chicken and sliced apples. Nothing more. I flagged our waitress over and told her of the problem. Her response \"whats supposed to be in it?\" when I informed her of what was on her menu, she said \"well I know we ran out of pears and they just throw whatever they have in there.\" NO. JOKE. What if I had been allergic to apples?!?! She took my plate back and returned with the semi-corrected dish, sans pistachios. By this time we were over this establishment and wanted out. Two of my girlfriends ordered margaritas that were straight up sour mix and they brought this to her attention as well. We inquired about speaking with a manager due to the lack of knowledge in the kitchen to the lack of apology from our waitress. She never apologized once. We were told that there were no managers on duty...what?!! We were given the managers business card instead. I have never in my life had a worse restaurant experience and would have given this place zero stars had that been an option. Next time, I'll opt for the three hour wait at Cantina 1511 before I'd ever return here."}
{"text":"Fun, festive atmosphere. Great selection of beer on tap. Interesting appetizers. The pretzels, calamari and sliders were great. The burger and fries were amazing. The Mac n cheese really had zero flavor. The dessert I got for my birthday was the layered pie and it was amazing...."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch twice and enjoyed it both times :) The fries are delicious! and I am a big fan of the Portobello mushroom sandwich (and I'm not even a vegetarian!). Friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Poor service.... Decided to try out this new place and walked in for Sunday brunch...mildly busy... Seated quickly but no one returned with cutlery or ask for drinks for 20 minutes... Walked out and no apology or regret from ladies in front. Live locally in Blakeney area and certainly will not return."}
{"text":"Went to the Liberty last night with my wife and 3 daughters  for my wife's birthday.  Outstanding service and the food was top notch.  Short ribs with gnocchi side was perfect.  My wife and daughter both had the trout and said that it was great.  My other 2 daughters had chicken and dumplings and loved it.  Good craft beer and drink selection.  I highly recommend The Liberty."}
{"text":"Only reason we decided to eat brunch here instead of the Tupelo honey cafe across the street is because of the 2 hour wait at Tupelo. My advice: wait the two hours or simply skip brunch, either option would be better than the liberty. First of all, the service was awful. I would have liked to order a coffee, or an order of the biscuits for the table, but our server never gave us the opportunity. When our food finally arrived it was another disappointment. Half of the food was cold and my \"breakfast sandwich\" was so saturated in grease It was inedible. 10/10 would NOT recommend and will never be returning."}
{"text":"It's hard to choose between the awful service and the terrible food but one has to win the race toward horribleness. Literally nothing was good."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times before, and thought the burgers were pretty good.  After meeting some friends at a nearby restaurant that had an hour wait, we decided to go to The Liberty instead.  I guess I should have stuck with their burgers, but decided to try their fish and chips.  The coating on the fish was nice and crunchy, but the fish itself was awful!  Totally mushy and disgusting.  Normally I would have sent it back, but the server kept disappearing, and I didn't feel like being there any longer.  The place was mostly empty, no wonder....."}
{"text":"I really do not enjoy writing bad reviews for local businesses. I am not a fan of bad mouthing a company and potentially hurt the lively hood of people in my community. However, when those people do not care about your experience at a restaurant, or care about your business, then it makes it a little easier to stomach giving such a bad review.   I have now gave this place a shot on three separate occasions, when they first opened, a few months ago, and then this week. Each time it was not a pleasant experience. The second visit I did have good service. The food was not so good though.   After hearing they might have hopslam some friends and I decided to head over. As soon as we walked through their doors it was a bad experience. The hostess was not friendly, there was an open table by the bar and we asked to sit there. I am not sure why, she seemed to not want us to sit there but allowed us to do so. It took quite some time for anyone to take our drink order. The bartender came over after some time and took our orders. Still not very friendly. Unfortunately, they no longer had any Hopslam, but we new that may happen. So, we all ordered beers off of their awesome beer list and a friend ordered an appetizer. Some time later we got the beers. When we were almost done with the beers I stated that I did not think that he would be getting the food order. The bartender came back and asked if we wanted any food. I asked about the order already put in. The order was forgotten. No apologies or anything. Then without asking if we were done she brought the tab to us.   This was obviously an employee issue and not the restaurant itself. However, with my past experiences at this place it is not surprising. I seriously doubt I will be going there for a fourth time."}
{"text":"I think if you come here expecting a place the caliber of Soul Gastrolounge, you will be disappointed.  It  doesn't necessarily fit into what I would consider a 'gastropub,' (it's relatively standard in my opinion compared to other restaurants these days) but it's still really solid.  I can find no reason not to go here if you've already checked out a bunch of other restaurants in Charlotte.  Just don't expect to be astounded or anything."}
{"text":"I only put 3 stars because the staff was friendly and attentive, and the beer is well chosen. The food, however, was extremely disappointing. The burger was under seasoned, greasy, and way overcooked. There is nothing special about this place in my opinion."}
{"text":"The server was friendly and everything came in a decent amount of time for a party of 6.  They put cheese on 2 burgers that didn't request but other than that every thing came correct. I had the shrimp and lobster scampi and it was delicious!!!!If I lived in the area I would definitely be coming back for that!"}
{"text":"Great beer on draft choices.  Had trout/pea risotto.  Husband had excellent burger."}
{"text":"Came for Charlotte restaurant week. Great menu selection. Great atmosphere. Bazooka guacamole was quite yummy. Attentive service. Glad we came for restaurant week because otherwise we would have spent double. Normal prices were a tad bit high. Great cocktails!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for date night and I must say this place is awesome! Best burger I have found in Charlotte yet!   I got a burger with cheese and bacon on it with the garlic fries. They didn't have any cider for me to partake in, and the beer they had on special was out because they had a keg blow, but I really didn't need anything to take away from my heavenly burger experience. The burger was very well made medium and the fries were hot and awesome! They also have an aioli that is supposed to come on the burger, but I asked for it on the side, and the fries were very good dipped in it.   The ambiance in this place is really cozy and I think very romantic. Parking can be a pain in the rain and in the dark, but just pay attention to signs and you'll be ok.   My new #1 date night destination!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends for dinner a few weeks ago.  I thought this place might have a creative, interesting menu, but nothing caught my eye.  I ordered the burger because I wasn't feeling anything else and the menu said it was voted best in Charlotte.  Wow. Give me a break.  I ordered it medium, but it came out well done.  I was kind of tipsy and didn't notice until I had eaten half of it already.  So I just said **** it, and finished it.  It was hard to eat because it was stacked so tall, kind of annoying.  I don't understand how their burger won any award because it just wasn't that good.  It cost $13 too.  I can get a better burger at Pinky's, Diamond, or Penguin for half the price.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to agree with Amy and some of the other fellow yelpers this place could be 3.5 stars overall but it's definitely closer to 3 than 4 stars.   I'd heard mixed reviews about this place anyway but finally had the opportunity to give them a try for lunch. We arrived a little after 12:30 and the lunch crowd was stead but not overwhelming. We were greeted and seated right away.   Our waitress was nice- but just not as attentive as she could have been. Granted, it was the \"lunch rush\" but it wasn't nearly busy enough to see her so sparingly. That's definitely something that could use some work.   I ordered the Pub burger and fries. It was a standard burger - not the best I've ever had nor the worst. Just decent. But it was an absolute mess to eat. Be sure to get plenty of napkins. The fries were tasty, hand cut and seasoned well. I really enjoyed them.   Overall, I'm glad I went and gave them a try. But I'll continue to search for the best burgers in town."}
{"text":"My girlfriend heard rave reviews about this place. So we decided to go here for lunch. I had the Pub burger and she had the fish sandwich. Both items were great, this location to know for their burgers. The waiter was very nice and even moved the smokers away from the patio. I think she could tell it was bothering us. We plan to visit this place again soon."}
{"text":"I just ate at The Liberty in Blakeney for lunch with my family and had the worst experience I have had at any restaurant. Our food was not delivered to our table until 53 minutes after we ordered. Even when our server let us know that my 2 year old daughters kids meal Mac and cheese was on its way out, it was still an additional 20+ minutes, and it only came out when we asked to have our entire meal boxed up and brought out with the check, because we have 2 young kids and we're way passed nap time. We watched a nearby table with children leave just as frustrated and do the same thing with their meal being boxed up because it had been so long. Again, our servers were no where to be found, no management approached our table apologizing for the long wait, nothing. We dine out very frequently and will NEVER eat at The Liberty in Blakeney again. I can't wait to eat my meal now cold at home, thanks."}
{"text":"I have been to The Liberty several times.  Each time I went I felt like I was going to give it just \"one more try.\"  The food is disappointing.  It always sounds better on the menu than it actually turns out.  I don't know what this \"best burger in town\" business is about, because I tried the lamb burger last time I was there and it was TERRIBLE.  The bun was so soggy it was falling apart, and the meat was bland (hard to do with lamb, I thought).  But perhaps even worse than the food is the service.  The servers are rushed, sometimes rude, or just not present.  I won't be going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago for a business lunch and my impression was just that it was average. I got the crabcake salad and it was okay. It wasn't a very good crab cake and the dressing was very bland. The greens were fresh though and the service was great. I would like to try it again in hopes that I will be more impressed next time. The liberty honestly left me a little bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was A-OK!  Glad we had a reservation for a Saturday afternoon, it was crowded.  Had a hamburger.  It was good.  Very good.  Not sure it was the best burger I ever had good, but it was in fact pretty good.  Good, but not great, beer selection."}
{"text":"Walking in the place has a nice ambience, we sat at the bar, apparently during a shift change because we were warned the kitchen was \"off\" and we got the distinct impression from the bartender that we should wait another 15 minutes before ordering (at 5), which we did.     My other half put his (empty) bar glass on the rail, she promptly dumped the ice out and walked off, about 20 minutes later came back and asked if he'd like another.  That's generally what setting a glass on the rail means, you'd like a refill.   The pork belly sliders were good, I didn't realize they didn't come with fries or any sides, obviously my mistake.    The lobster mac & cheese was okay, nothing to write home about and it's not something we'd order here again.   All in all, it's a cute pub with lots of room, over- priced for what you get & so-so service from seemingly inexperienced bartenders. A good one-time place, but I can say that there's very little chance we'd return."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times...  I have been here several times and the food has been great, while other times it has fallen flat.  To some degree, the service has mirrored my previous statement.  I like the concept of a gastropub, and this one definitely has a consistent stellar beer selection, but my experience has been better with the pub part than the gastro part.  Like Forrest Gump said, \"it's like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get\".  While the above review covers about 6-8 experiences at The Liberty, I will say that the last couple of times there, for drinks only, with the wife, we have had very good service and of course the drinks/beer were great. I may just need to return for brunch, lunch or dinner and give them another try.  They may have turned the corner on their inconsistent food and service issues."}
{"text":"Went for brunch after church. Fun drinks. Good food. Different menu options. Awesome burgers. Fun atmosphere. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try the Liberty forever but since it is outside of our normal \"bubble\"... we have not made it until this weekend.  We stopped in to have a beverage and grab a bite to eat.  The place definitely has a much more casual vibe than it did when it was MacIntosh's.   The bar area is pretty large and has a good mix of hightop bar tables and booths. We decided to grab a hightop and checked out the beer menu.  They do have a nice selection of beers and a decent selection of wines as well.  However, they seemed to be out of several of the items - both beer and wine that folks in our group were interested in ordering. That's always a disappointment.  But in any case, there were enough other choices that everyone was able to find something good to drink.   So, I had heard they have good food, but I wasn't really prepared for their menu or  their interpretation of some old favorites.  Things here are prepared with a little different twist than what you normally expect.  For example, we started with the calamari fries (around $10 or $12,  I believe). This version of calamari is served on a bed of some sort of asian-inspired slaw, and were drenched in some sort of red sauce - with a white sauce also drizzled about.  I couldn't quite put my finger on what the sauces were.   I would have to say this was not my most favorite calamari, but it was ok.   I decided to try the chicken & dumplings ($16) and this is the most unqiue take on C&D that I have ever seen.  It is not what I grew up with, but was tasty.  The chicken was pan roasted to perfection. Crispy on the outside, falling off the bone tender on the inside. The \"gravy\" was nothing like traditional southern chicken & dumpling gravy - this one seemed to have very little flour and was more like a light brown glaze.  It had a nice flavor though. To round out the dish, it was served with a few gnocchi, carrots, peas, mushrooms and a couple of spinach leaves.  I would eat it again for sure...but if you want a more \"traditional\" take on chicken & dumplings, you might want to skip this offering.   My sister ordered a salmon dish ($ unknown) which was served with a side of farro risotto and veggies.  I tasted the salmon & the farro and both were delish.     David and Michael both ordered burgers ($13) which are served with a side of hand-cut fries. They said  the burgers were pretty good, but not the \"best burger in town\" in their opinion.    I probably would not make a special trip to come here... but if I happen to be in the area & looking for a bite to eat, I'd certainly stop in to give them another try."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave bad reviews but this one is needed. Last night was my 3rd attempt at trying the place out and it was a fail at all 3 attempts. I really wanted to like the place. The first time was when they first opened so I gave it the benefit of the doubt on slow service when there were only 3 tables of customers. Second was just for drinks with friends and the drinks kept coming out poorly made. The third and last time was last night. I used open table to make reservations since we were told a few weeks ago that they were only taking reservations only and the place was practically half empty. Last night they ended up cancelling my reservations so I did not get the points for using the app. We waited about 20 mins just to have our drink order taken and then another 20 mins just to receive our drinks. The prosecco came out cloudy, flat and warm so I told the waitress and she said it's because we served you the one on tap, would you like it from the bottle? It sounded like they have had prior complaints of this and that's why they had the bottle option available. Well I waited another 20 mins for that glass of prosecco. As for the food, the wings were super fatty to the point my husband and I wouldn't even eat them and the pretzels tasted like they were microwaved. The husband of the couple next to us ended up going up to the bar for drinks for his family since they were there waiting about a half hour to even receiving any service."}
{"text":"The Liberty is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte because not only are the burgers terrific, but anything you order is quite delicious. The service is always good and the ambience is lovely. It's a very laid back atmosphere with perfectly lit dining rooms and bar. I bring friends here frequently because it's not so noisy that you can't have a conversation  (unless you're in the bar during a crazy game; they do have tvs in the bar area).  I highly recommend the Crunch Burger and the sublime homemade macaroni and cheese! Oh and did I mention they have a great selection of beers?"}
{"text":"A gastropub it seems like this word has been popping up everywhere lately. I've been asked several times what a gastropub is and to be honest I'm not really sure. A gastropub to me is a casual joint that serves good beer and great food more upscale then a neighborhood pub usually has a large selection of small plates and great french fries. Every gastropub I've been to seems to be very hip. The web definitions vary from a public house, a drinking-establishment of British influence, a bar that serves a higher standard of food then a normal pub. You choose what you want it to mean, anyway you should definitely check one out. Like the Liberty.   I met a friend of mine for lunch at The Liberty and I thought the food was quite good. We shared the Ashley Farms Chicken Breast with Avocado, Havarti Cheese, Chipotle Aioli. The chicken was grilled perfectly and the roasted red peppers were a great plus. Did I mention the roll it was served on it was so soft and delicious. We also tried the Grilled Shrimp Salad with Bibb Lettuce, Tomato, & Lemon Vinaigrette, now this was pretty plain I think I could have made something better at home.   I don't want to leave out the crispy french fries though, they were some of the best I've had in town. I would definitely come again for lunch and maybe try dinner they have a great beer selection, and it looks like a fun place to hang out with some friends."}
{"text":"After hearing so many praises of delicious and memorable visits, gargantuan burgers, and overall amazement from The Liberty, we finally made it in for a late lunch last week. I had no idea what I was going to order, and after looking at the lunch menu, it seemed that a burger was choice.   The service was very friendly and appeased my neurotic disdain for the wobbly table on the patio, so we settled for a booth inside. Throughout our meal, our server was very attentive and friendly.   We started with some of the house-cured pickles and potato chips. Chips - ridiculously good. I've come to appreciate thick cut chips that are made in-house more than fries in the past few months. The pickles were great. Reminded me a lot of a NY halfsour from Stage Deli. Definitely would get those again.   My wife ordered a veggie sandwich and I ended up ordering the \"Crunch Burger\" which has won a few awards...from Southern Living I think?  The veggie sandwich was pretty standard and fulfilling. Plenty of veg, flavor and sustainability for a vegetarian. The burger....was just a little blah. I appreciate the approach. Especially with the potato chips on the burger, brioche bun, house-ground meat that was cooked to a nice med rare....it just didn't do anything for me. The tomato slice was close to a quarter of an inch thick, a very odd leaf of lettuce jetting out of the side, a small country's worth of pimento cheese, and so much bun....with so little burger. I think it would have been perfect if all of the other toppings had been just a bit smaller in portion. I guess I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to burgers. I appreciate the complex, but love when I can pick up my burger and get a little of everything in one bite. This burger just didn't deliver on that front.   I can definitely say I'll be back to the Liberty soon. I may venture for something other than a burger, but I look forward to trying more of the menu. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good burger but not great. Service was spotty, at best.  She came across as uninterested and somewhat annoyed we were there. We got the pretzel tower (which was awesome), but didn't get app plates until we were already finished with the app. Two beers were \"out\" with no apology. Probably won't be back anytime soon, though it was a decent meal. They are so close, just needs server training and better management."}
{"text":"So my friend & I missed the cut off for Sunday brunch, so we were presented a limited menu for the time between brunch & dinner. I went with the pork rinds & he had the young mixed greens salad with salmon.  The time between ordering & receiving our food was short. The presentation was top notch & I loved how good my pork rinds looked in the tin bucket, with the red & white checkered tissue paper. The rinds were still popping, as they just came out of the fryer! They were so amazingly good.  Waitress was nice & friendly. Attentive, but not overbearing. She laughed & commented at the fact I was able to finish the entire bucket of pork rinds by myself. :D  The patio seating seemed very nice, as we were seated in a booth next to the patio door.  Prices were reasonable. Parking is tricky!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went in for lunch with my son. Took 10 min to even be greeted. Drinks another 10. Food was not good, and very overpriced.  Had to ask for our server several times and the check took forever. The table next to us experienced the same trouble. Will never be back. Don't waste your time or money going"}
{"text":"Food- moderate.  Environment- TOO LOUD.  I wouldn't come back simply because of the acoustics.  So loud, couldn't even carry on a conversation with the person with me."}
{"text":"I just love this place! We always have a good consistently well prepared meal.  This time we had pork belly sliders, burgers, shrimp and grits, and fish and chips.  All served hot and no overcooked fish. Only caveat was the female bartender server who was not too attentive."}
{"text":"Summary:  Great ambiance, great location, and good food that does suffer just slightly in comparison to other options in Charlotte.  Took the family (wife, 3 teenager-ish kids, and parents), so had the opportunity to taste quite a few things...highlights:  - The pretzel's were very good - slight crunch on the outside, chewy on the inside -  but at $14 a little overpriced.  (Comparison - Flying Saucer)  - Pickle appetizer was well done - contrasting, sharp tastes that worked well in between main bites  - Shrimp and grits were some of the best I've had in Charlotte  - Mac and Cheese was good, not great.  (Comparison - Mert's)  - Pork Belly sliders had all the components of something great, but couldn't quite measure up to the execution of Soul Gastrolounge and their pork belly tacos.  Would like to know who can, though.  - Fantastic beer selection, including some of the locals you don't always see (Birdsong)  All in all, I do recommend hitting this place if you're in South End if you're in the mood for great beer, good food, and don't mind spending a few extra bucks."}
{"text":"Came out for restaurant week on a free meal ticket via Yelp- thanks Yelp!   We booked a reservation during a Friday night, and it was BUSY. While I'm on the topic of busy, my only complaint on our entire outing was that they kept us waiting 40mins past our reservation time. I was told that people who were coming in to dine were just not getting off their fat *****, and I could believe it. We did manage to find a small space open at the bar and had a few good drinks that, although not on special, were not overpriced.   Once we were seated, we got served right away and the waitress was extremely attentive the entire night.   The food we ordered was exceptional. Definitely worth a free meal! Heh. But in all honesty, yeah, we were both very impressed with the unusual dishes and flavor combinations. She would come back for the restaurant week menu, I would come back for their burger. Even at $15, they have me sold!"}
{"text":"Had a layover in the city and was really wanting some good American food. This place delivered! Excellent salad and grilled cheese."}
{"text":"I have zero idea how this restaurant maintains making good burger lists. They're not bad buy not fantastic. I work across the street so I've been here many times. The service is terrible and the food is over priced. I've come here for mediocre food for the last time. Don't waste your time either. Go to Bad Daddy's if you want a good regular priced burger."}
{"text":"We walked over here from my friends apartment because it was such a gorgeous day out. I loved the little patio area - it was very cute and sunny.   The menu had a good range of american cuisine and even mussels - and you know I love those - but everyone kept getting these amazing huge burgers - so I gave it and got one too. They have a big sign up that says they were voted best burger in Charlotte - so that also pushed me to give it a go.  I can't eat fries and those of us going low-carb alternatives appreciate a great salad. They couldn't sub the fries for the salad, but they did do an upgrade for it, so I had a wedge and burger with no bread on it. The burger was awesome - very big though!  My friends had the organic chicken sandwich and the veggie burger - they said both were great!  We enjoyed some cocktails from the bar as well as the over all sunshine of the patio. The chairs could be a little more comfortable out there, I had to use my purse as a back cushion because I kept sliding backwards and the service was a little slow, but over all it was a very relaxing, casual, chill little spot for lunch.  I would return - next time I am going to try the mussels for sure."}
{"text":"Visited for restaurant week and while the trout I decided upon was good that was the highlight of the three courses.   My dinner partners seemed to enjoy the pork chop that they ordered.  The budino was a bit confusing to to the taste buds. However it was my first time having one so that could contribute to my confusion. The menu descriptions were a bit misleading I believe and that might have been a part of the issue. All three of us made statements about what we thought the appetizer, meal or dessert would be based upon the menu. I might give them another try outside of restaurant week seeing that they have such great reviews."}
{"text":"The burger was amazing, it was cooked perfectly. They have a lot of different ones to choose form as well, definitely one of the best burgers I have had in Charlotte. It was crowded but we were able to sit in the bar area no problem. Outside patio area looked nice as well, good for a cool summer evening."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The \"Natural Crunch Burger\" was amazing. The fries are just ok. But overall, it was good and I'll be going back to try some other things on the menu. Can't get much more convenient to the light rail line."}
{"text":"We figured it would be a good idea to take the Light Rail into town and just walk around until we found somewhere to grab lunch that had outside seating. We figured East/West Station would be a good place to start, so we headed out.   We were originally intrigued by Tupelo Honey Cafe, which is right next to The Liberty, but we were told it would be a half hour wait for outdoor seating. Too long for us, so we went back downstairs to the outdoor seating area we had seen when walking over. We walked into The Liberty and were seated immediately, but not before we caught a glimpse of the inside room to the left of the main entrance, but more on that later. There were very few tables that actually had other people, so there was no wait at all.  The food was good. I ordered the brisket sandwich, which was huge but not too spectacular. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't to die for. We all ordered burgers or sandwiches, and they were all pretty big, which is absolutely wonderful - you definitely get your money's worth!   The service was great and the location is convenient, but it is right across the street from a fire station. So your meal may be interrupted by some loud sirens. It didn't bother us at all, but I can see how that could annoy some people.   But back to the interior of the place: The room to the right of the door seemed to be your standard restaurant with a bar and booths/tables. But to the left, there's a yellow glow. There's a very mellow lighting in the room, with high ceilings, complete with towers of kegs, if my memory is correct. It was a very very cool room, and I would love to dine in there at some point. It's something that I'm not sure how to describe, but it was very unique. There's also a basement dining area, and I believe that is used to host events."}
{"text":"I want to like the Liberty. In fact, the first time I ate there it was great. The burgers are really good but it stops there.  Tonight I visited and was going to share the pub burger with my wife. They cut the burgers when you share, which I like. I ordered it and requested Brussels sprouts instead of fries. I clarified that I could have the sprouts in place of the fries and specifically asked that they were included with the burger. The server said yes. I also ordered an extra side of green beans.  When the food arrived all looked okay except the paltry portion of green beans for $5. I'm not a chiseler, I'm really not. And when things are good I am willing to pay for them. But the green beans were barely half of a ramekin. I clarified with the server that this was in fact my side and not part of my son's kids meal. She confirmed it was mine and proceeded to bring him and even ridiculously smaller portion of green beans as if to make her point.  Then, when I got the check, up charge for the sprouts. $2 dollars! Again, not a chiseler and not particularly cheap. It's the point that I wasn't told before. Terrible way to treat your customers. Also, I've had much better Brussels sprouts.  I unfortunately won't be back. I am not a fan of nickel and diming customers, especially when a restaurant isn't forthright about it. Can't wait for Mark and Donnie's burger joint up the street!"}
{"text":"So, The Liberty definitely has my vote after serving as the venue for our rehearsal dinner. \"The Liberty????,\" you may be thinking... and my answer is, I know, a tid bit unconventional but AMAZING! First, The Liberty has one of the most affordable private rooms in the greater-uptown area. Their private room seats up to 60 people comfortably and provides a very intimate setting for private events. Second, they totally understand how to work with a budget. I essentially gave them a dollar amount, a few parameters, and the fabulously talented staff at The Liberty figured out the rest. Our rehearsal dinner guests LOVED the food, especially the shrimp and grits and mac n' cheese (I should have ordered 4 times the amount of mac n'cheese that I ordered because everyone went back for seconds, thirds, and fourths until it ran out). The service was amazing, the bartenders and waiters were very patient with our very thirst and hungry bunch. The cherry on the sundae of the perfect dinner was that the bill actually would up being a bit less, that's right, I said less... than we anticipated -which is always a nice surprise!  I hope to never get married again, and will therefore never need to plan another rehearsal dinner, but I will DEFINITELY suggest The Liberty for corporate events, retirement celebrations, engagement parties, you name it! Chef Matt and his crew truly were a pleasure to work with!"}
{"text":"We won't be back. Reservation was for 6:45 and we were seated quickly.  Our food arrived after 7:45 (more than an hour after arriving) and people who arrived after us were served their dinners before us. We asked the hostess to check on the status of our orders and she ignored us the rest of the night. In the hour and 20 minute ordeal our server came by to ask about our drinks twice. I have no idea where he was for the rest of the 80 minutes.  But how did it taste? The shrimp and pasta was bland and didn't have any garlic or salt and pepper. The barbeque was mild (no bite) or texture. The chicken Caesar salad drowned in the dressing. Too much money for the food quality and \"ambiance.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I had a taste for a burger. We were headed over to Tupelo Honey, but saw the \"best burger in Charlotte\" sign in front and decided to give The Liberty a shot. We walked in, it was quite empty- maybe 3 people inside. There was no one to greet us, so we began to walk to the bar. There were two employees behind the bar, a male and a female. The female employee looked up from what she was doing, and looked back down. I began to ask, \"do we seat ourselves?\" The male employee looked back our way and then turned back to what he was doing. Needless to say, we made an about-face and walked right out and over to Tupelo. Clearly, the staff believes business is going so well at The Liberty that they can be rude and dismissive to customers.  If you're looking for a tasty bite to eat, walk on across to Tupelo Honey. They were friendly, and the food was super good!"}
{"text":"I like upscale gastropub food and decor and ambiance. That is why The Liberty is my favorite place in Charlotte, or at least the most visited. Lots of good beer to choose from and I have not been disappointed with any of my food choices. Usually I get the lamb burger, the pepper jam / relish is great. It is loud but not too loud and the service and prices are good but not next level. Plan ahead bc it gets crowded and parking is tough, but I am rating the inside of the restaurant and not the madness outside."}
{"text":"Arrived here for brunch and immediately loved the amount of patio space. We had to wait a few minutes before receiving our waters, but our waitress was pretty friendly so we brushed it off.   We ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer. They came out with no candied bacon (which was described as having it on the menu) so we had to send them back. They came back with \"regular\" bacon and it tasted like regular deviled eggs. Nothing I need to have again. The mimosas were really good. Also, on Sunday's they are $4 so that's a plus.  The entree was amazing! I had the Croquet Madame and it was really good. It came with a green salad that was also pretty tasty.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Burrrr it's really cold in here. Make sure you bring a jacket or a snowsuit. Ok, maybe not a snow suit hahhahaaa. So, we started off with a $3 mimosa. Sounds good right? We'll, they either used cheap champagne or watered down oj. It was not good.   They only had a few items on the brunch list. About 7 to be exact. I thought I knew what I wanted until I ordered and the waitress said \"sorry we are out of biscuits, would you like toast?\" Um no. So I got the big breakfast sandwich instead.   My sandwich was AMAZING. The potatoes that came with it were ok but more like dinner potatoes. I will definitely come back because I really want to try their biscuits. Oh how I love a good biscuit.  Be careful and look at your receipt. On the receipt it has subtotal, donation, tip and then total. I had never seen that before so I added the tip on the donation line and the total on the tip line smh. I was able to fix it before our waitress came back to get it."}
{"text":"Meh  The calamari fritters did not have the curry flavor I was expecting; the sauce on them was more of a tangy barbecue - which frankly, is not really what I want on calamari. The waitress also advertised to me that the burger was voted the best burger in Charlotte so I had high expectations. The burger was pretty meh, really nothing special or memorable. In fact, I needed mayonnaise just to put some flavor in it. The decor is really cute, but other than that - meh!"}
{"text":"The food here is generally good and I would generally have recommended it if you were in the area and wanted a burger, but we had a terrible experience there and I reflected on it for a few days before I took about 20 minutes to send an email to them hoping that they would make things right.  I neverd hear back (it has been over a month).  I was really disappointed.    This is what I wrote:  The Liberty has always been one of our casual favorites and I'm genuinely sad that I'm not sure we'll be back.  We had 3 adults and 2 kids (1 was a non eating baby) and tried to order a burger, 2 chicken and dumplings, and kids chicken tenders.  We were informed that you were out of chicken tenders.  I looked around and at 6:45 there was only 1 other table in the dining room so I was confused.  My three year old daughter flipped out, which you will understand if you have kids.  After 10 minutes I was able to convince her to get the grilled cheese and fries. The waitress went away and came back five minutes later to inform me that you were out of grilled cheese. At this point I could not believe that a restaurant would be out of bread and cheese, especially considering my husband's burger had cheese on it.  The restaurant was nearly empty and why would a restaurant open for dinner without something like bread. There are so many Harris Teeter's around to buy bread if need be.  At this point it was an hour after we sat down, my daughter was hungry and melting down, and I asked the waitress if should could quickly bring us just a few fries or something since we still had no food so we could figure things out. Ten minutes later we got an entire order of fries (that we were charged for) that she described as VERY VERY HOT. I could barely touch them - completely defeating the purpose of them.  It was another 10 minutes before they cooled down enough for my daughter to actually eat a few. I found a Nutri-Grain bar in my purse and that ended up being what she ate as you were out of all kids meals.  Another 20 minutes later, the chicken and dumplings came out- the chicken was super dry looking/tasting and I had a total of three gnocchi in my order and my friend had four.  Were those sold out as well!?!  By the time we left over two hours later (again, terrible with 2 small kids) there were 4 seated tables.  There was no reason for this meal to take this long!  Three of the four people at our $100+ dinner went home and ate.  I would really appreciate some insight as to what was going on and hope you are able to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"I have been to Liberty a few times now. And I'm still not sure if I should give it a 3 or 4. The food wasn't memorable to me. But the biggest problem I have is that I can't keep up with the menu. Chef changes it all the time. I went 2 days ago and got a small plate of meatballs. When I looked up the menu online, the meatballs wasn't listed on there so I don't know the proper name to my dish. I guess I'm the type that if I really like something from a place. I will continue to go back and get the same thing. I had the pork skin and the boiled peanuts that I loved but is no longer on the dinner menu.  I also order the small plate of the mussels. By all means its NOT small. It was really good. But just couldn't finish it.  Their customer service was good on someday and excellent on other days. My recent visit, she was good. Our table didn't have any salt or pepper so I was stuck w.a slightly bland meatballs.  Overall I will come back. Hopefully they will bring back the boiled peanuts. And I will find something I like. They do have a lot things on the menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"Not trying to bash this place, but we had the worst experience here from top to bottom. APPALING service and food and it wasn't even busy. No manager was on duty. The bacon burger didn't come with bacon. It came with raw onions that resembled slugs instead. Salad consisted of lettuce and little else. Like I said I don't mean to bash this place but this was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant in my life and I've worked in service for 10+ years."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a few weeks ago.  I really dug the decor.  This is first and foremost a pub, but they've switched up the traditional pub look with a modernist beer theme (lots of casks and gold liquid used throughout the space).    As an appetizer, my lunch-mates and I ordered the pretzels, which were fine--nothing different than you would find anywhere, and I thought the sauces weren't especially tasty. For our entrees, the waitress steered me away from the bland (her words) veggie plate and to the chicken & dumplings.  When it arrived, I was disappointed to learn that the chicken was all dark meat--possibly my least fave thing to eat!  I went back to the menu to see if it had stated that chicken was actually dark meat but such info was conspicuously absent.  And, yes, I know that it is fashionable to eat dark chicken meat these days, but I just cannot get with that.  I loathe sending food back--LOATHE IT!!--but dark chicken meat is too much for me to bear, so I finally flagged down our waitress and asked if the uneaten dish could be returned.  She was highly reluctant to send it back, which rubbed me the wrong way, and I actually had to push her to send it back.  I get the feeling that she was new, but, given that this is probably the third time in my life I've ever sent food back to a kitchen, I was pretty shocked by her attitude. When she finally took my food back to the kitchen and permitted me to reorder, upon the advice of my lunch-mates, I chose the fish and chips.  This dish was quite good, and I would highly recommend. Unfortunately, my meal arrived long after everyone else's, so I had to do that awkward eating-after-others-have-already-eaten-and-want-to-leave thing.  Not so cool.  We considered dessert, but they only had two options, and our waitress didn't do a very good job of selling either one.   Rereading the above, I'm not exactly sure why I'm giving the Liberty 3 stars.  I actually started with 4 stars, but after reflecting on my experience, quickly dropped it to 3 and now I'm even questioning that high of a score.  I guess my gut tells me that most of the issues I had were a direct result of having a yuck waitress and a poorly described menu, and, despite everything, I am willing to come back and give this place another shot.  So, I would suggest that the Liberty keep their interesting decor and fish and chips but update and refine their menu descriptions, train their waitresses better, have more desserts and a dessert menu."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the Liberty, I had the fish and chips, which were very good. Then they revamped the menu... On another trip my beer was served with a broken burger stake in it which caused shards of wood to become stuck in my throat. Really ruined my experience. Don't plan to return."}
{"text":"This place is no joke....food it just good...all of it. I have been several times and when I want a burger this is where I go. If you wanna go all out get the Crunch Burger, if you want just a good ole burger get the pub burger. The fries are soooooo good. The service at lunch is fast and consistant. I have never had a bad meal here. When i take people to lunch and they say they have never been this ias where we go and I always gigle at the folks piling in at Tupelo across the street cause I know that I am getting the better meal!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Had the crackling pork rinds and steak and eggs for brunch. Had to stop myself from ordering another round of everything. Service is super friendly and quick. Just one thing - eggs cannot me made to order. Would love the steak and eggs with poached eggs instead of fried."}
{"text":"Walked in and half the tables were open. They were all being held for reservations. The first available reservation was 2 hours later. We walked out, no attempt to stop us. It's a shame they lost out on a table with half of their tables empty."}
{"text":"The Liberty had a little bit of a wait around 8 PM on a Friday night, but not too bad and service was very quick. We ordered the macho nachos, and two burgers and asked for the food to come out quickly, since we had to be out within the hour.   Our waitress confused part of the order - one salad didn't have dressing on the side, the two salads were different even though we ordered the same one, and one burger had cheddar instead of pimento on it.   Once the orders were right, the food was absolutely great and very filling.   ... and then our check was wrong and they overcharged us by 8+ dollars. They corrected it when we raised it, but why should we have to?"}
{"text":"Alright so people seem to like this place so my boyfriend and I decided to have lunch before the Panther's game on Saturday. We each got a different burger to share, fried pickles to start and then fries and mac and cheese as sides. We basically order everything with the intentions of sharing lol. The fried pickles were horrendous... seriously the breading was thick and weird and the sauces were hot sauce and a buttermilk blue cheese. I asked for ranch (which is listed on the menu as them having it) but the waitress said they only have the blue cheese or like honey mustard. We could have done without ordering that for sure.  The burgers were burgers and the fries were fries, and the mac and cheese tasted like the homemade kind my mom makes. I love my mom and her mac and cheese reminds me of my childhood but it's nothing special if I'm honest. That is pretty much how we would describe all of their food. It's not bad but it'd definitely not special and it tastes like what you would have at a family cookout. We just weren't impressed for the pricing. Service was lackadaisical but not awful... so I mean essentially our whole experience was meh okay. I feel like the menu could be amazing but it was so lacking in flavor. Pretty much not somewhere we'll be going back to."}
{"text":"First of all, this would be a solid 5 except that I have yet to have anyone who had not perfected the dismissive, pouty eye roll of a 13 year old girl at the greeter station. It really does cast an initial pall over the evening. Service is not the best, in general.  The food, however, is fabulous! I have yet to try something that is not wonderfully crafted with a delightful flavor profile to delight the taste buds from start to finish!  The appetizers are different than the standard fare and I surely appreciate that! Pork 'popcorn' that are fresh, mouth sizzling pork rinds!  Seasonal pickle plates and Devils on Horseback (dates, blue cheese, almonds and bacon) are spectacular!    Entrees are on a well edited menu. There is no so much that you are overwhelmed, but regardless of what you are in the mood for, you'll likely find a good option.   Short ribs that are delightfully tender and moist, but not at all mushy. Normally served on a bed of rib sticking mashed potatoes, but I substitute with the sauteed mushrooms. Fish and chips that any Englishman would write home about. Savory bangers and mash. Scottish salmon and, on the word of many dining companions I hear the trout is fabulous, the one thing I won't eat there...or anywhere.   My husband considers himself a burger aficionado, he's eaten them around the world...he counts the Pub Burger among the top 10 burgers out there. Brioche bun is grilled, cheese is melted but not too dripping and gooey. Herb aioli is delightfully seasoned and perfectly flavored.  Fries are always crisp and perfectly done.  BE SURE TO SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  And I really advise you look at nothing on the dessert menu and just have them bring a budino for the table.  It is easily enough for 4 people, usually 6.  The trick is to take your spoon and go straight down, all the way to the cookie base, and then pull it back up making sure you have each layer on your spoon. Then sit back and E N J O Y!  It is creamy, salty, sweet, crunchy, smooth...fantastic! Oh yes, oh YES!"}
{"text":"Great food. Service needs attention - it can be hit or miss.   Admittedly, I've spent a number of lunches, holidays, and Restaurant Weeks here and I couldn't wait each time! The food is very, very good. For holidays, they have offered a dessert bar...start there. Always start with dessert.   Solid stop to fill you up and make your belly full and your tastebuds happy."}
{"text":"One of the worst run restaurants I have ever been to. Went with a group of friends, will never return.  This was not the first time we have encountered problems here, thought we'd give it one last shot...nope, never again!  Service is awful, food over cooked....actually had to go out for dinner after our three hour \"dinner\" too bad, great location.  Simply don't understand why the owners seem to not care...."}
{"text":"As a Ballantyne area resident and huge enthusiast, (because traffic is ew) I was so excited to see a new place open up, but I feel like they need to better work on customer service. Our visit started when we walked in and waited for the hostess who came right away and proceeded to seat us inside - there were a lot of tables outside and no one was sitting inside because it was a gorgeous day. She didn't bother asking, I mean maybe just maybe we would rather wait for an outdoor table than sit inside....alone. So I asked and she said she's pretty sure it's full, but went to check. One table was empty and being cleaned and she placed us outside - the seating experience was just a big turnoff. Our waitress was much better than this hostess, she kept our drinks full and food took long but she kept us updated. Food: I ordered their grilled wings with the sriracha maple sauce, and I requested for flats only. My mom had their French dip burger with a side salad. The food took too long considering it was not a busy time (after 2 pm), but everything came out well and they only included wings that are flat for my order, and my mom enjoyed her burger and salad. I really liked my wings - perfectly sauced and crispy with great grill marks! Our waitress, Kendall and food quality definitely elevated our experience after how we felt about seating."}
{"text":"If possible I would give The Liberty a 3 1/2, but it's definitely closer to a 3 than a 4.   This was my first trip to The Liberty.  I went early evening (just before 5) with 2 girlfriends for after work TGIF drinks, apps, meals, desserts.  It was easy to spot right off of South Blvd.  Parking was plentiful, as we were quite early.  It's a well-paved, well-lit lot.  As we left around 7:30 or so, the lot was quite full, but this is right next to Pewter Rose and a gay bar (?) that I seem to remember reading about on the local paper online edition, and they share the large-ish lot.   We sat at a booth in the bar area.  It's a large bar with high chairs and 2 big flat screen TVs.  It has several high-top tables to accommodate large groups or smaller 4-top tables, and had 4 booths against the windows so you can view the traffic/walkers on South Blvd and the people coming in and out of Fuel Pizza.  If you like men in uniform, the fire station is directly across the street, so that is nice, but the sirens may also cause some beer spillage.  Once it is time for ambiance, they dim the lights, so make sure you have an app installed on your smart-phone that serves as a flashlight.  You will also need this if you have to go to the restroom directly behind the hostess stand, it's a dark hallway and hard to see exactly where you are going.  It's also a one-person restroom, so if you like to have meetings in the ladies room, you will be disappointed.  Comfy seating in the booths.  The drinks... wide selection of beer and wine.  My dinner dates had some kind of seasonal pumpkin ale.  They said it was good.  I had a Diet Pepsi.  (y u no serve Coke?).  The food.... we ordered fried pickles and pretzels with spicy mustard and/or cheese fondue for dipping as appetizers.  The fried pickles were very crispy and served with a ranch sauce and a tobasco/hot wing sauce, they tasted very good - I liked the crispness of the pickles and the pickles themselves tasted good.  I tried the wing sauce, wasn't a fan and stuck with the ranch.  The pretzels were VERY good.  Served warm with a sprinkling of salt with a cheese fondue that was creamy and delicious.  I am not a fan of spicy mustard, but I did try it.  It was mildly spicy.  And it was mustard.  (go for the cheese!)  For entrees, two of us got the pub burger which was a nice-sized burger that was flavored well and juicy, served with bacon, cheddar, grilled balsamic onions, lettuce, maters and aioli with a pickle stabbed on top of it on a brioche bun.  This will be a knife and fork burger after the first bite - it goes everywhere - I felt like I was covered in beef juice and mayo (that's what she said).  Typically served with french fries with rosemary, parmesan and chives, I asked them to skip all of that crap and just put salt on my fries.  The fries were hand cut and tasted very good - crispy without being hard with a nice fresh flavor (think Five Guys with a flair).  Our other dining companion had the BBQ sammich, again served with fries, and she said it was quite good as well.  It looked good and was a large sandwich.  Dessert.... we split a chocolate walnut torte served with chocolate sauce and vanilla bean ice cream.  Very good!  It tasted like a light chocolate cake with walnuts in it, served warm.    Service was... well... mediocre at best.  The waitress was friendly without being annoying when we saw her.  When we first arrived, we were one of maybe 3 tables there and it seemed that they were staffed well enough to handle 3 tables.  Empty glasses stayed empty for a while, and from appetizers to ordering dinner was an eternity.  While the service wasn't bad, it was inattentive for the number of people that were seated.  They would have sold quite a bit more beer to our table had she been a little more attentive.  However she was pleasant and did seem to know the menu relatively well even though from other reviews and what she said, the menu changes quite often.    The food was good, but because the service was slightly lacking, The Liberty would not be my first choice for a meal, but if someone wanted to go, I would not say no.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"This is one of those times that I wish they would let you give half star ratings, as I would like to give the Liberty 3.5 stars.  Nice warm feel to the place, some of the decor seemed a bit cheesy but comfortable overall. I would also get rid of the exposed keg cooler with windows. The rest of the place has nice warm colors, but this keg cooler has windows and the lighting inside is a harsh bright light, and has all of the tap lines visible. Kind of an eye sore.  The beer menu is fairly extensive, and has some great beers both on tap and in bottles. The only issue that I have with the beer menu is that there is very little description of  each beer, and there are no food/beer pairing suggestions. I would also like to see a place like this have a few more taps, I think they have around 20 beers on tap now; 30-40 would be better (IMHO)  The food is outstanding, my wife had the braized short ribs and I had the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were terrific. A little pricey, but definately worth it. We went for dinner each had two beers, a main course, and an appitizer to split and after tip our bill was around $70.  The service was really good, our waitress was attentive, not overly pushy, and helpful with the menu. Overall the experience was very enjoyable.   I would definately suggest the Liberty to anyone looking for a good beer-centric restaurant with better than pub fare food. I will still stick with Duckworths if I just want to stop and have a pint or two, but this is a great choice for great food paired with good beer."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE The Liberty.   Hands down my favorite place in Charlotte for good food and a good drink. The menu is awesome- love the mussels with the grilled bread. Best burger in Charlotte, by far. My boyfriend is a huge fan of the lamb burger. Lobster mac & cheese, sauteed mushrooms, southern crunch burger...just a few of my favorites. Fried pickles come with a side of creamy hot sauce...genius. Homemade pretzels are amazing as well.   Great ambiance, most of the time we go we sit in the bar area. Great service. Love this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on our last day on Charlotte. The parking lot was jam packed, but we were able to find street packing near by. We were surprised that the restaurant was empty, so I guess everyone was going to the place next door. Service was prompt and the waitress was friendly. We had some soft pretzels, a pulled pork sandwich and a beef brisket. Everything was good, but nothing out of this world. For lunch it was nice, but nothing special."}
{"text":"What a show.  Stacked beer kegs, brewing rooms and a wall of beer (Yes...truly).  Ok.  It will be OK as they do have beer.  Took the grand kids for lunch and later got really skeptical looks from wife and daughter-in-law about just what was I doing there with the kids.  It was OK as the kids loved it.  The menu is southern in so many ways, like BBQ pork and sausage and mac & cheese and lots and lots of gourmet burgers.  At least 15 or more on the lunch menu.  And beer, but not for the kids, to their dismay.  Anyway, going on a date here or just with a bunch of guys &/or gals there are lots to munch on and the flavors are terrific.  Service is great and the beer is cold and good.  And I discovered that they have over 30 wines by the glass.  Amazing.  A little pricey, but there are kid portions.  It is called a gastropub and now I know what one looks like.  You will, also."}
{"text":"Burgers!!!!!  Roasted red pepper and goat cheese is crazy good.    The bar area is the only area I eat at and it is really spacious.  I love the long high top table since people can stand around or sit and socialize."}
{"text":"Lunch was o.k.,  but not worth the $50 cost for the 3 of us. We started with the Truffle oil cheese fries which my daughter enjoyed but were too cheesy for me. My wife ordered the fish sandwich with a side of baked beans. Both were good, and the fish was very fresh. I ordered the crunchy burger with a side of cole slaw. The size of the portion was great, but even with the chips and pimento cheese on top, the flavor didn't blow me away. My daughter's plain burger was just that, plain. A burger should taste like something even if it's naked. The dog disagreed with me, we took the leftover home to her and she gave it 2 paws up. For $50 including tip (the waitress was nice ) but without drinks (we drank water) , I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"The Liberty is growing, and perhaps this location in South End is in a state of transition.   A recent experience that we had this past Sunday was not good: Long (45 minute) wait for beer & food, unhappy service staff, semi-raw bacon served with a rather small, sad pancake that was missing the apples... and they were out of the duck poutine. :(      It's a shame when a place doesn't meet your expectations - especially on a holiday weekend outing with the whole family in tow. We have been coming to this restaurant since it opened, and typically leave with the feeling it was time and money well spent. But everyone has bad days - and this includes restaurants.     Though I must say that Matt, the owner/manager, is a good guy who stands behind his employees. He has always made us feel important and been accommodating. Their fries & burgers are hard to beat and the poutine is a real treat. Scottish Salmon with Farro is super solid. Let's hope that the Liberty continues to provide chef-driven, top quality cuisine - with integrity - for many more years to come and keeps the right to call itself a \"Gastro-Pub.\"     Go ahead and give The Liberty a try... we'll be back for some duck poutine, let's hope that they are ready for us."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place and see no reason to return...even though I wanted to for the burger.  We went for restaurant week and this was a place I'd wanted to try. Perfect!  Parking was pretty busy for a 6:00 reservation, but I don't hold that against the restaurant, just a warning for the next chick.  First course was the Brew Master's Plate - hand-cranked sausage, house pickles, spicy mustard, fresh-baked pretzel, Tillamook pimento cheese fondue - Sounds great! - THE SAUSAGE WAS RAW, PINK, MUSHY AND RAW. So, when I asked the server if it was supposed to be pink, she said yes. NO- It isn't.  When she took the plate with the raw sausage still on it - I told her, that it was raw.  No apologies.  She did have another whole plate sent out - I DIDN'T WANT ANYMORE and kindly told the other server who brought it out that I didn't want it.  My stomach was already turning because of the raw bite of sausage that I ate.    Then the second course - I got the 'steak and potato'.  Steak was fine - kind of hard to mess that up.  Potatoes were overfried/burnt fries...gag.  My husband got the \"Chicken & Dumplings\"  They shouldn't call it that.  It is 2 pieces of dried out, roasted chicken pieces dark & white over a roux, veggies and few gnocchi.  Dessert was good. Salted Caramel Budino - chocolate cookie crust & fresh whipped cream.  Beer had a really good selection, but that wasn't our focus.  Throughout the entire meal not one apology for serving raw sausage - because of this - they get one star and I will never be back.  There is bad lighting, but make sure you check your food going forward."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, wasn't able to actually try the food as there was too many people in line tonight we came. Good news they are able to accommodate large parties so if you have a large group this is a great place to bring your people.   The location is convenient as it is close to everything downtown. The ambiance was great and it smelled really good. Too bad we weren't actually able to try anything. The staff was nice and the hope hopefully next time for the large party that I came with.    **Please pardon my mistakes as I'm using Siri to dictate"}
{"text":"Time for a delicious burger!  Fried pickles, a bloody Mary, a burger and fries?!?!! There was not a crumb left on my plate! If you are in the mood for a burger, you can't go wrong at The Liberty!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn tasty place for brunch. Great ambience inside, you feel cool just being there.  We had the poutine fries to start and I ordered the brisket Benedict. Brisket was a little tough but overall the flavors were yummy.   Parking at this place is scarce and you may be stalking people in the parking lot on a busy day.. I've had to park across the street and walk over for this little area of shops and restaurants before. I'll definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night with my husband and brother. I am a vegetarian and felt a little disappointed they didn't have more options to choose from. Even the main dish of macaroni and cheese said it was topped with bread crumbs that had been cooked in duck fat.  My brother got the burger and was super happy with it and I tried his fries which were delicious. My husband got their fish and chips and he was fairly pleased with his. The fries were the best part of both they agreed.  We ordered an appetizer of fried pickles and while they were ok they had a lot of breading and a whole lot of grease. I don't mind a little but I felt like this was a lot in my opinion."}
{"text":"Location, atmosphere and menu were terrific.  Execution (mainly the service) left something to be desired.  The restaurant was practically empty.  There seemed to be plenty of employees, but our food was cold."}
{"text":"I've had poutine made by Canadians. This is not it. Lots of cheese and gravy but so not the right cheeses. Plus we are the only people at the bar and the BT is no where to be found."}
{"text":"the lobster cheese fries were so delish! the drinks were good, the prices were just fine, and the burger was too juicy to pick up. knife and fork it, baby!"}
{"text":"The Liberty is a nice balance of great place to eat AND easy place to drop in and grab a drink and snack.  They have a large number of rotating drafts and a decent selection of wines by the glass (including a $6 house wine - thank you!).    On Tuesdays, all drafts are only $4 and you can order ENDLESS POUTINE.  That's right, endless.  While I did not go down the endless poutine road, this seems to be an awesome option for a filling snack while enjoying $4 beers - just don't plan on ordering any dinner!    I love the burgers at The Liberty - they are large, cooked to specification and oh so tasty.  The burgers come with fries (with or without truffle oil), though I prefer to sub an order of their delicious brussel sprouts.  You can also get a number of salads with any type of protein they have on hand - burgers, shrimp, salmon, scallops, steak, etc.    The service is exceptional and the decor is beer-chic, if that makes any sense at all.  This is a consistently good choice for brunch, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Less than impressed with Queen's Feast Week.. Sadly, our second courses were not worth our time or money. The wait staff seemed nice however, our specific server needed an attitude adjustment. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Love the food here. As of now this is my favorite chef in town. Great use of flavors and local cuisine. Not super pricey and a lot of bang for your buck. I eat red meat, but I'm a red meat snob. I won't eat a pub burger out anywhere but here. The duck fat fries are amazing. If you are afraid of gravies ask for it on the side.I recommend everything on the menu. If you would eat it somewhere else, try it here. The food is like something you would dream came from a french countryside home, butchered out back and cooked in a big old black iron skillet. I just ate, but know I'm hungry again. ;)"}
{"text":"For a place that touts itself as having the best burger in Charlotte, I was disappointed.  The first time I went I had the Liberty Burger with fries.  I asked for my burger medium and it came out well done and the fries were soggy.  The second time I went, I ordered the same thing.  This time the fries were well cooked, but again, the burger was well done (my dad also asked for medium and got well done).    The food was fine, but I expected more.  Also, it takes a while for your food to come out after you order, so be mindful of that if you go during work. My office is just a couple of minutes away and I was gone exactly one hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  I ordered the chicken and dumpings.  Not exactly what I was expecting... but soooo much better.  The chicken was perfectly roasted  and seasoned.  Tasty gnocchi and vegetables. Great service, but not overbearing.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The location is in a good place on South Blvd.  The bar area is warm and has a good feel.  The service was good.  They could have a few more local beers that they cary.  The chicken sandwich was good too.  Nothing bad to say here, nothing great to say either."}
{"text":"Food - 2/2 *I got the South Crunch burger and it was amazing.  A 1/2 burger with pimento cheese, jjalapeno bacon, onions, and hand-cut chips on the burger!  Wow.  Portions are very generous.  Service - 1/1 *No complaints  Price - 1/1 *$10-15, what you'd expect  Atmosphere - 1/1 *Sat out on the patio for Sunday brunch and it was really nice.  Have to be honest, went to the area trying to go the Tupelo Honey Cafe and the wait was too long for 2 little kids and so we ended up at The Liberty.  We were pleasantly surprised.  This is a really good place that we really enjoyed.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I must say I was pretty disappointed in my visit to The Liberty in Blakeney. I had been to the one off South Blvd a few times and recalled a nice restaurant with really good pretzels and fries and decent sandwiches.  To start, the place is super loud (the restaurant wasn't even full)....I felt like I was yelling just to read my child (who was sitting in my lap) a book; talking to my husband across the table was almost impossible.  Our food was mediocre at best..... If it wasn't for the toppings on my chicken sandwich, my sandwich would have had no taste at all. The French fries tasted like freezer fries with a little parmesan cheese sprinkled on them.  My husband ordered the lamb burger and was also disappointed in it's taste.  Drinks were finally refilled at the end of the meal.  I feel like the chefs are more worried about presentation of food than it's taste. Meals are served on wooden boards that don't provide a whole lot of room for anything but picking up your burger and placing it in your mouth.       On a positive, they have created a book corner in the restaurant with children's books for kids to look at while enjoying their meals. (I did feel that at almost $7 , kids meals were on the pricey side).     I don't think we will be returning to the Liberty anytime soon."}
{"text":"Their sign boasting \"Charlotte's Best Burgers\" got me to come back to this place and see for myself!  Skeptical about this claim, even though they probably did win some kind of contest, I rarely trust contest results!   Menu : It is kinda cool when a place offers more than one item that peaks my interest and if they are Bold to say they have the \"Best\" it is a bonus when you can order one fairly plain!  The Burger with Bacon sounded good yet for my first Burger here I want it the way I would get a Burger at a friends (you know what I mean) backyard cookout!  Simple : : Burger, Bun... Tomato (if available if not no problem) and If I am confident and if they have any, a little Red Onion is nice, maybe some ketchup, though I'm very happy with a GREAT Tasting Burger by itself with No bun or any toppings!  Five yelp stars for the Burger! Perfectly Cooked! Simple Seasoning (nothing fancy) GREAT Tasting Ground Beef Burger! Very good Bun! Perfect Thin Sliced Red Onion!  Is this the Best Burger in Charlotte?  So far I will say it is a Very good contender and I will be eating more Burgers, including more Burgers here!  Five yelp stars for the Fries!!!  Glad to have another entry to my Lonely Fries list on yelp!  These Fries are [wait a minute]  Hold on, I forgot to ask you... YOU reading my review, I do not want to embarrass you so instead of asking I'll approach this with the assumption that YOU already know how to order Fries! !! !!!  Yes that is a BIG assumption, though I would rather me be the one who is embarrassed NOT you!  My waitress assured me they could cook they how I requested them... Still that does not insure the flavor will be good, it could help though!  These Fries were great even though they had NO Salt, No Seasoning (I ordered them without the Parmesan cheese they are usually prepared with) they were barely warm and still had EXCELLENT Flavor!!!  Here is the EXTRA, the Plus on these fries are I only ate a few in the Restaurant, I ate the rest at home, at room temperature and they still beat most hot fries!  You could ASK if they would cook your serving of Fries \"to Order\", then tell them what you would like (unless they say no or just stare at you like you have only been reading Rod0 on yelp).  What do you want???  I order mine \"light\" meaning not real crisp and not brown.  These Fries reminded me of the Fries at Mezza (Lebanese Restaurant in Columbia, SC).  If you think it is cheating to Fry Potato Strips in Goat Fat (I really do not know what they use to cook these).   It is easy to make my so called Pretzel list entitled \"&Twisted&\" (I think).  Only the Best Fries make my Lonely Fries list yet for a Pretzel it is an automatic addition!  These are made fresh, mine tasted like it just came out of a real oven (not microwave).  A little Salt!  Nice and soft yet not doughy. I ordered the tower of them (5) and took photos!  These Pretzels were good or a little better than good, maybe 3.5 yelp stars.  Service gets five yelp stars, because they were good, treated me like a KING and were honest about the fact that the Chips are NOT Made-to-order (made earlier and reheated) which only means I do not want them on this visit!  Next time I may check them out because they still might be good!  Today I sat outside.  This is a comfortable and nice looking Patio, end facing South Blvd.  The Decor of the inside is better looking than many places especially if you do not study it too closely!  I was surprised to get the extra attention (usually I get none, taking photos of food at my table)!  Two extra staff members stopped by to ask \"does everything LOOK Good\"... I almost laughed, yet was glad for the attention to detail.  Does anyone want dessert?  Great thing about \"The Liberty\" is they are still changing the desserts...  My suggestion is keep working on it!  We want Dessert if it is something that is Great and somewhat unique, even if we have eaten enough for two days in one meal!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner strictly based on the fact they're the only restaurant I could find in Charlotte that serves poutine! I tried the kind with short ribs and it was delicious! For dinner I ordered the Crunch burger and my husband ordered the bangers and mash. My burger was delicious (still craving it!) and my husband really enjoyed his food as well. We willd definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After thinking about things review, I have decided overall The Liberty should receive between a 3.5-4.0 review. Upon entering, I was luckily seated immediately without reservations. I was waiting on a friend who unfortunately was stuck in traffic, so I ordered some coffee and let my server know. Unfortunately, the server took that as she could leave me alone until my friend showed up sans coffee. I reminded her about the coffee and she seemed a little put off. Once my friend arrived, the server was on top of it and knowledgable about the food menu. I had the marinated chicken sandwich while my friend ordered one of the signature burgers. Both arrived fast and were definitely worth recommending. However, once the food arrived, my server was gone again for 20 minutes. Our waters and coffee were empty for at least 15 minutes while servers walked past and said nothing. The food was great, the server was nice, but service overall could be worked on."}
{"text":"The girlfriend took me here to celebrate my 30th birthday on a Monday night.  We had a beer, a cocktail, a burger, a beet salad, and the calamari fries appetizer.  The fries were probably the most interesting - strips of chewy calamari fried and served looking like French fries.  The burger was good, as were the fries (though they could have used more rosemary).  The beet salad was disappointing - arugula was bitter, and beets were not plentiful.  Pumpkin beer was nice, and my girlfriend thought the cocktail was great (fruity but not too sweet).  Would recommend this place for the food and drinks!  Would have gotten five stars if not for the beet salad... ;-/  Service was fine on a Monday night, but there was only one other couple in the restaurant so hard to definitively say how service would be on a busy night."}
{"text":"I'm doling out a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews lately.  What can I say, tis the season.  Just kidding.  the Liberty is a solid 4.5.  I never rate a restaurant as perfect based on one visit.  We went their recently for lunch.  It.was.fabulous.  First I appreciate a good, fresh iced tea (unsweet).  Theirs was the bomb. I had three glasses.  Freshly brewed.  Yum.  My dining partner had the brunch poutine.  It was good, though I only had a taste - she raved.  I was too busy with my fish and chips.  It was greasy, but in a crispy greasy way.  Not a bad greasy way.  The fries were delicious as was the beer battered fish.  The coleslaw, men, not my fav.  But you literally only get a thimble full so who cares.  The fish was the star.  I'll be back.  There's so many good things on the menu I wanna try."}
{"text":"I give them a 5 Star rating because of the Pub Berger and the service.  The atmosphere is very nice as well, perfect for a good business lunch or relaxed diner.  I can highly recommend to both locals and visitors."}
{"text":"I had come through Charlotte in Jan 2012 and had eaten their brunch here. I thought it was fantastic and they put a lot of thought in there menu. It was fried oysters that I remember. They were very good. You pay like 16 to 20 dollars and they bring out a variety of items for you. Very nice! A wide variety of beer on tap too!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. The only good thing was the Poutine Fries and our server. Everything else was terrible. I ordered the Nashville Hot chicken sandwich with Mac and Cheese and it was AWFUL! I expected the chicken to be coated in a dry rub of spices and maybe a little hot sauce but my sandwich was COVERED in hot sauce. Both buns were saturated! It was wayyyyy too much. The Mac and cheese was terrible. It tasted like watered down noodles with some cheese sauce for coloring. I sent back the Mac and cheese (before I tried the sandwich) and felt bad about sending back the sandwich, but I wish I would have because I ended up spending $25 and left hungry. Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Liberty many times for lunch and have always been happy with my meal.  Everything from the salads to the burgers to the sides are top notch and unique!  The ambience is very cool -- one wall looks like a giant beer.  It makes me thirsty everytime.  The seats in the main dining room are comfy and I like the high-tops in the bar area.  The wait staff is always helpful and friendly.  There have been a few times that I have received slow service, but not enough to avoid going back.  Parking behind the building is easy -- It can get full fast, though.    They recently revamped their menu with new burgers and sandwiches.  I personally prefer the other menu which had a few non-burger/sandwiches options.  On my most recent visit, I asked the waitress what the most popular item on the new menu was.  She said that their burger was listed as the best burger in Charlotte.  So, I ordered that with macaroni and cheese, of course.  It was a delicious burger but I'm not sure I'd be so bold as to say it was the best burger in Charlotte.  I think it's comparable to a Big Daddy's or even Kick Stand.  I mean, they definitely serve their burgers on a big, fresh bun which is better but the actual burger wasn't spectacular.  I'd order it again, though.    I have also been happy with their dinners and desserts.  But, I've noticed that the dinner portions can (not always) be a little small.  So, if you have a BIG appetite, I recommend an appetizer (and then dessert!).  I've had the salted carmel dessert and it was delicious.  It's a cold dessert but every bite is heaven.  And, they had a cobbler at one point that was the best I've had, but I didn't see it on the menu last time.  It might be worth asking for!!"}
{"text":"You come to this place for the \"Crunch Burger!\" I just wanted to start off with that, so that no one missed it. The Liberty serves an incredible burger, with a good draft beer selection, good service, and a great pub atmosphere. The only downfall to this place is it is a little pricey (as many gastropubs are in Charlotte). If the burgers were a little more reasonably priced, this place would be worthy of five stars.   For those who have trouble finding this place, it is in the same parking lot as Tupelo Honey. It's literally right across the lot. For some reason, I had driven up and down South Boulevard dozens of times without noticing it.   The atmosphere is nice and is fairly typical for a more upscale gastropub. It is somewhat dark and dimly lit giving it kind of an old tavern feel. The wood is dark, exposed and simple. The columns in the main dining area are made of empty kegs, which I thought was kind of a cool touch. They also had live acoustic music in the bar area on the Thursday night that I went.   The Draft beer selection here is very good. They have some selections that you would have trouble finding at other gastropubs. I ordered a Lukcy Basartd by Stone, which is a seasonal by them. I only paid $6, which is not a bad price for a high gravity with upwards of 8% ABV. They also have some hard to find options such as the Enjoy By, but you're probably better off having this at home; it is rather expensive here. It's also worth noting that they were out of several options that they had listed on the menu, but our waitress handled it like a champ and even gave us a free beer. Points for that.   Now to the food. I literally don't see any reason why you should come here and not get the Crunch Burger. It was seriously incredible. Top of the pops of the gourmet burger. We had 6 people at our table and we all ordered the burger, and literally no on walked away disappointed. That's impressive. You can tell that the burger is made with high quality beef. It is so tender and juicy. The Crunch Burger is topped with pimento cheese, jalapeño bacon, onions, and hand cut chips. Check, check, and check. The pimento cheese had a nice moderate spice to it and was extra creamy. The jalapeño bacon added some more spice and along with the chips gave it a nice crunch. This burger is exceptional.   Along with the burger we got the hand cut fries which were exceptional as well. I would definitely ask for their house ranch to dip the fries in. It is a mixture between buttermilk ranch and bleu cheese. Very good with the fries. We also got the poutine as an appetizer for the table. I'm not a huge fan of poutine and had never been that impressed, but this was probably the best I've had.   The Liberty has great food and it is definitely worth a trip just to check out the Crunch Burger. The only downfall is the price. The Crunch Burger is $15 at dinner. If you want to save a couple of bucks, you can go and get the same burger at lunch for $12.50. Either way, it is worth a try. Just fair warning: It's not a cheap place."}
{"text":"If you know me well, you know that I take my burgers seriously. This place has a banner outside naming it as the spot for Charlotte's best burger. And you know what? They're pretty darn good.   I keep it simple as I always do and simply get a good ole fashioned cheeseburger with pepper-jack (I don't like my burgers fussy). I've been here three times and the burgers are consistently good, melt in my mouth, every time. The fries are also quite good....garlic or parmesan....something like that. Can't recall which but nonetheless they are quite tasty.  The last time I went, I opted to get the garlic mashed potatoes in lieu of my beloved fries. Well, they brought me the fries in error. Once I mentioned that I ordered mashed potatoes, they quickly brought them to me, let me keep the fries on the house. Boy am I glad they gave accidentally brought me the fries because the potatoes we bland and boring. Needless to say, those delicious fries didn't stand a chance once I turned away from the potatoes.   As for the vibe, somehow I always catch it when only a handful of people are there. It's relaxed and laid back and I like that it's not a major production. Just chill. Servers are cool too. They're not over the top in that none of them ever try to blow me away, but they are solid when it comes to service.  Good spot. I might just become a regular."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Just another bar with bar food and bar service. Don't expect more than a high bill for food that's not worth the price.  Seems like a good place to drink and watch a game. But that's about it."}
{"text":"Bragged about the food to friends, took boyfriend here with party of 8 for his bday, service was incredibly slow. Our waitress, who was apparently also the bartender, acted like she literally could not care less about us whatsoever, stopping just short of being actively rude. Boyfriend's burger came out raw and cold, and as people who enjoy medium rare, this was still way too much - it practically walked off the plate and was dripping with blood still. They replaced it but still tried to charge us for it. I went to ask to speak to a manager to get it removed and let him know about my disappointment in our overall experience, but I was told he was too busy to talk to me. The hostess directed me back to our waitress/bartender who then said \"all you had to do was ask me and I would have removed the burger from the tab\"... In what world do I need to ask not to have to pay for a mooing burger after a crappy dining experience overall?? Why doesn't that just happen if you actually want people to come back to your restaurant? I completely understand that there are bad days, but if you don't make an effort to make up for it without my pushing, then I'm not coming back and will be telling everyone else I know not to go to The Liberty. The food may be pretty good, but The minimum wage kids at McDonalds offer better service, and service level is a major part of the dining experience."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave reviews for restaurants that were just okay...but I'm really disappointed with this restaurant.  The food was mediocre, and the prices were ridiculous!  I went with my family for my birthday, and was excited to eat here.  I heard great things about the South End location that recently closed.  What a disappointment this place was!  The food is way overpriced for what it is.  I asked for their house chips instead of the fries that came with my meal (Fish and Chips), and there was a $2.00 upcharge!  Ridiculous!  I understand paying a little more when you ask for a different side...if the ingredients cost more.  But I was asking to swap a potato for a potato.  And they were horrible!  The fish was overbreaded and bland.  My husband had the Sunday Chicken dinner, also bland. The staff was nice enough, but incredibly slow..especially considering there were about a dozen customers total inside the restaurant. I do not recommend this restaurant. Hickory Tavern is much better, and cheaper."}
{"text":"The \"All American\" breakfast was such a disappointment. The potatoes were covered in a gravy that I'm sure came from a jar, the sausage was undercooked and the grits as well. My kid had a hamburger that was delicious and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars, but service dropped it to 3 stars.   The menu is creative, executed well, and quality is top notch! Service, however, is lacking. We sat at the bar on a Saturday at lunch, and the bartender had 9 tables in the bar area besides us. While the bartender had a great attitude and was friendly, she just couldn't keep up with the needs of her customers. The manager should have recognized this and helped, but just chose to pour the occasional draft beer instead. The food arrived in a timely manner, but the burgers were cold as if they sat in the kitchen for 10 minutes after they were plated.   The Liberty just won best burger in Charlotte and reading the menu is a good indication of why. I like the option of a beef, lamb, or turkey burger paired with creative local ingredients. The house cut parmesan truffle fries were worth the 2 1/2 hr drive alone! The beer selection was very impressive and the decor was pretty cool.   I would like to give them another chance, but it seems that the management needs to polish their skills first."}
{"text":"My family went there on Sunday Mother's Day. We had reservations for 6 people at 7:00 PM.  It was fairly busy, but not jam packed. The server took our order quickly (although she wasn't prepared to tell us what the specials were). 2 side salads and 1 appetizer of pretzels were brought out within 10 minutes. The main dishes, however, weren't served until an over hour later. The server didn't tell us what the problem was, but annoyingly apologized many times. We noticed that several tables were waiting a long time as well. Finally, we demanded to see the manager, who also apologized profusely and told us the food would arrive shortly and he would take care of the bill (which he did). Some of the dishes arrived without the sides ordered and a steak was over cooked, but we ate it because we were extremely hungry.  I may give The Liberty another chance in the future because of prior good experiences, but I hope they can resolve their issues. No one should have to wait 1 hour for a meal once the the order goes in."}
{"text":"My wife Terri and I ate here for the first time on a late Summer evening. We LOVED it. Started out with the house olives. Brine cured and very good. Terri had the pan seared trout. Of course I got to sample hers. It was on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Excellent dish. I had the fish and chips. Light and perfect. The sage fries that came with it were the best fries I have ever had, and that's saying a lot. We will definitely be coming back to this hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Third time at the Liberty and in my experience it's just an average restaurant. The service is okay, nothing to rave about. The decor and design in the dining room is amazing and the atmosphere is very inviting. On the other hand the food is just okay at best. My last visit I had the pickle chips app and the fish and chips. I thought the fried pickles were decent but I've definitely had better fish and chips. Had I known they used Tilapia and not Cod or Haddock I probably would've skipped on this entree. I think the fish may have been frozen or overcooked due to it's texture but the batter was decent however it was very greasy. The fries were solid but I've had better. Nice bar and decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Decor is good. My date got a bottle beer that was a year past it's expiration and my chicken and dumplings came out Luke warm. Not impressed what so ever."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the croque monsieur. Sandwich was warm to cool on arrival. Béchamel was close to tasteless. Wouldn't order again. Side salad was blah. Fries were ok, but nothing special. My friend liked her beef brisket sandwich. Other friend found fried chicken dry and over cooked."}
{"text":"I have read some of the negative reviews and I don't quite get it. I have been here a few times (my wife's mosaic art gallery is just a couple blocks away) and my experiences have all been excellent.   The food has always been excellent - from burgers to fish. My college son said the bacon cheeseburger was the best he has ever had. And there is a great choice of beers.   I have also found the wait staff to be very friendly and helpful (great dessert recommendation last night).   Only issues - seating outside has a lot of street noise and it can be a bit pricy out the door."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time to eat at the Liberty.  What a disappointment!! I had the fish and chips-all bread, soggy, no flavor!  I would not even bring it home to my chickens who love fish.  The slaw was soggy and only tasted it as it was so bad.  My husband had a burger-did not eat it but brought it home to the dogs!.  Beautiful place and the wait staff was great!  Not gonna be in business long!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to the new Liberty. I had seen some reviews that were not too flattering. So we were a bit apprehensive going in. We love the South Blvd one. The new Liberty  has a concrete and steel look, but thought it was tastefully done. Now the real truth. Started with a beer and cocktail. So far so good.  French dip burger and Scottish salmon entree were excellent. My wife liked the Blakeney's salmon over South Blvd. My burger was perfect and one of the most flavorful I've ever had.  Admittedly it's a bit noisy, but we'll be back. Glad to see Liberty at Blakeney."}
{"text":"We had lunch around 2 pm this Saturday. Ate outside with a couple of other brave souls. Ordered the Kobe brisket with lettuce, tomato and onions on the side. When it was finally delivered, even the Kobe beef and provolone was on the side. Nothing at all on the bun. Strange, but very tasty. My wife had the fried chicken salad that was ok. Had to wait quite a while for our food. A so so overall experience."}
{"text":"The service was AWESOME, they manage a party of 30+ with ease and politeness, all smiles from the management to waitress, if they made mistake with your order or if it was delayed, they took care of it asap and with a smile. My glass was never empty, I never had to ask for refills, our waitress was on the ball from taking the orders, checking on her guest, You name it; she had it under control. Very knowledgeable of the food selections and she provided her personal opinion of the selections made!!! Hands down the best service I've had in a while, i will go back.  Thank you  12/29/17 party of 30"}
{"text":"Yum yum gimme some!  Delicious cocktails,  tasty food.... I'm all over it!  I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The service was a bit odd at first(the server wasn't really sure if she had our table or not and wasn't interested in serving us until she was sure but once she figured it out it was all good).  Thing to know:  if you are meeting people there and want to be on time GET THERE EARLY.... THE PARKING SITUATION SUCKS!  The lot is shared with a few other businesses and it gets pretty packed during brunch and dinner hours. Back to the food and drink: I had the brisket Benedict which was delicious!!  The brisket was a bit fatty but delicious all the same.  The cocktails were tasty and well priced which is always a plus in my book.  I enjoyed the warehouse pub vibe Liberty was serving.  It was welcoming and I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Went here again on an incredibly rainy day with my wife - we had a rare \"kid free\" day and wanted a place in the South End to eat.   We came in around noon and literally the place was almost empty - ended up sitting on the bar side because I wanted the fireplace nearby. Strangely the bar side has a really \"cold\" vibe because of the metal chairs and hard floor. Took us a while to warm up but the tasty beers helped. :)  I ordered the tomato soup with popcorn and the fish and chips - yes, it's a stereotype, but I love fish and chips and had heard good things. My wife ordered the turkey burger with mushrooms and onions with a side of their legendary mac and cheese.   Soup: No problems at all. Warm, full-flavored, and with good tomoato chunks.  Fish and Chips: The chips rock - natural cut, delicately fried and salted well. The fish was really crispy (probably a beer batter) Turkey Burger: Here was the surprise - it was huge!! Very tasty burger and enormous, both in width and height. This thing was big enough to feed two AND it was very juicy (especially for a turkey burger).  Mac and Cheese: G-R-E-A-T as usual.   Service was solid. Overall I really like the Liberty and hope it continues to thrive."}
{"text":"I love the liberty. Its only a few blocks away from me, and my boyfriend and I almost always default to this restaurant for date night. The menu changes seasonally, but has yet to disappoint. The calamari fries are absolutely killer, and the slaw on the side is almost as good. I dream, read it, dream about the salted caramel budino. It's this decandent creamy cookie dessert on a mason jar and it tastes like a little pillow of heaven. Service is hit or miss, but the bartenders are always attentive and friendly.   Also they have poutine. What."}
{"text":"I tried The Liberty for the first time Labor Day weekend. My friend and I arrived for our reservation and were immediately seated. It was a Saturday evening at 6:00 p.m. and the place was pretty sparse.  Our waitress (Andrea - I believe was her name) was friendly and very willing to explain menu and beer options. She even brought out a mini sampler of beer so I could better make my decision. I ordered the liberty burger (medium) and fries. The first thought I had when my burger came out was how photogenic it looked. The bread was lightly buttered and it seemed somewhat larger than your typical burger-joint burger. The burger came with a pickle on the side and the fries were nicely seasoned.  We decided to go for dessert, I ordered the berry cobbler which came with vanilla ice cream. It was a delicious summer treat. In all, the meal was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but The Liberty is losing (has lost?) its touch. This used to be our go-to place for rare and hard-to-get beers, and we even attended an awesome, exclusive Goose Island beer dinner in their private dining room a couple of years ago, but after our last few visits, we've been seriously underwhelmed. Our most recent visit was on a Saturday evening at 6 pm, and we were literally the only people in the bar. The visit before that, they were releasing the 2015 Goose Island Bourbon County Stout on tap the same night as a South End bar crawl and marketing to both crowds - it doesn't gel. Either be a place for beer geeks and have a strong beer list (and do more of those awesome beer dinners) or market to the people who just wanna get drunk, and sell cheap beer.  I feel like The Liberty doesn't know its audience anymore and it's getting trumped by the numerous breweries and new restaurants in South End. Their burgers are still the best in town, but it's time for The Liberty to step up its game and figure out what it wants to be."}
{"text":"Super unimpressed!  I decided to drop in with a friend for a bite to eat after we were done shopping in the area. I had always wanted to try the location in Southend and never got a chance to do so before it closed down.  I ordered a burger and a house salad and my friend ordered wings and fries. Food was mediocre at best. Nothing special.  The service was poor and inattentive.   The issue presented itself when my burger came out. I looked and saw what was obviously a blonde curly hair. I grabbed it and placed it in top of the burger. I was REALLY hoping that it wasn't a hair because I was starving but indeed it was. I informed the food runner that I would like to have a new burger made due to me finding a hair in my current one (which he seemed to be surprised by). He took it back to the kitchen and then made a point to come out and let me know that the chef wanted me informed that it was not hair that I had seen but that it was cheese.  I informed the food runner that I was in no way interested in debating on if there was hair or not in the food that I (and no one else) was expected to eat. I had seen and inspected it with my own eyes 60 seconds beforehand!! My \"new\" burger came out about 10 minutes later accompanied by the food runner and a separate plate where the chef had taken it upon himself to construct a \"cheese string demo\" in an attempt to further demonstrate his narrative that I had not had hair in my food but a cheese string.  Are you serious???  As far as I'm concerned, cheese doesn't have a distinct curl pattern or blow wispily in the wind when picked up. I was really taken aback that the chef was STILL pressing the issue. At no point did a  manager EVER come over and address the issue nor did the chef ever come out and address me directly.  The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 Star rating, was because my server (Jack) did take it upon himself to take 50% off of the price of my burger at the end of service even though all of interactions surrounding the matter had been with the food runner and not my server.  I definitely won't be back....there is entirely TOO much competition in town for a mediocre burger joint with poor service to last long. No thanks."}
{"text":"I would give this a 2 but the service was decent and my gripe is.more about the menu. Their menu boils down to a few overpriced burgers or about 5 other entrees that don't exactly scream I want you. To me the menu was too limited and I could find better selection and value elsewhere like Bad Daddy's if I want a burger.   Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"We've established that I love burgers.  Therefore, it is to be expected that the Liberty, which routinely claims to have the best burger in Charlotte award (from whom, I don't quite know), has been on my to-try list for quite a while.  We were in the area for dinner last night, and so we popped in.  The inside of the restaurant is a relatively cool space.  There's a spacious bar room, which would be a good place to have a few drinks without feeling packed in.  The dining room is comfortable as well, and is decorated with beer kegs, beer quotes, etc.  However neat the decor was, we came for the food.  And we weren't disappointed.  I was excited to see poutine on the appetizer menu, since I've wanted to try this Canadian specialty from the moment I first became aware of its existence.  I wasn't disappointed.  The porcini gravy on the fries was especially delicious.  The burger was pretty dang good, too.  Was in the best in Charlotte?  Well, maybe.  I reserve my full commitment because, while the meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the toppings were thoughtfully selected, the bun was a little on the minimalistic side.  I actually had to finish it with a knife and fork.  Now, a burger with too much bread is a sad thing, but the Liberty has gone too far in the other direction.  Mind you, this is a minor quibble.  iIf you go here, get the burger.  It's dang tasty.  Just be prepared for messiness.  I see some people have complained about the service, but our waitress was fine.  She wasn't super bubbly, but she was polite and kept our drinks filled.  What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"My husband says 5 stars and I say 2 stars, so we compromised at 3.  My husband really liked the food.  It was interesting and tasty.  I thought it was way too pretentious and the food was okay.  I don't like going to places where I feel like the hostesses (and there appeared to be three) look down on you.  If it wasn't for the overall \"feel\" of the place, I'd give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I sampled many things at the Liberty and felt like I could finally add my review. I like the oddly paired sausage plate with chutney, warm pimento cheese, and crackers. I honestly just want the pimento cheese and crackers, but that's not an option. It's just so creamy and cheesy. Their burgers are definitely the best thing on the menu. They're huge and flavorful. I've had the pig burger, the crunch burger, and the lamb burger. Enjoyed all of them. The pork chops are thick and cooked well, but a tad under seasoned. The side of bacon mac n cheese is too die for! And we always finish with a dessert. They're all excellent, but I could kill for the creme brulee cheesecake.  I wish the patio was bigger because I find the lighting inside to be weird. Otherwise the decor is pretty cool. Lots of unique beer advertisements. The bartenders are always nice, and the servers are pleasant enough."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place and really enjoyed it.  We both had burgers and they were quite good.  Nice beer selection."}
{"text":"First time there no complaints... blue cheese house made potato chips burger + parm fries all great! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Service was great this time.  Burgers were good, w a decent amount of quality toppings.  They actually had the beer on tap that was on the menu (often not so on other visits).   Acoustics are still terrible here!  Got to do something about that."}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time and was glad I chose NOT listen to a few of the negative reviews.  Cool atmosphere and our service was great.  If you have a taste for an excellent burger, I HIGHLY recommend The Liberty.  By far, one of the best burgers in town!  Fresh-cut fries and slaw are also over the top."}
{"text":"We visited The Liberty for Sunday brunch. We had wanted to try it out for some time, but the regular lunch & dinner menu didn't seem to have many vegetarian options. So, visiting for brunch was a great way to go. Although the brunch menu was somewhat small, there were many creative options. The service was good - three out of four of us asked for alterations/substitutions & our server & the kitchen were very accommodating, which was greatly appreciated. The coffee was excellent. Our only real concern was that three of us received our food at the same time & it took over five minutes for the fourth dish to come out of the kitchen. We had to ask for someone to check on it. Each of us enjoyed our meals (3 omelette orders & one southern gentleman order). It can be tough to get a Sunday brunch reservation in Charlotte. The Liberty is a good option (really nice atmosphere, cool lighting & decor) when the most popular brunch spots are all booked up!"}
{"text":"If I was rating on ambience alone this would easily be a five star. However, I have to take into account the food too.  I had been hearing for months how good The Liberty was and that its burger and fries had won local awards so I went in with high expectations.  The menu looked really good but I am a big fan of first ordering what a place is known for so I got that burger and fries. We also ordered a pretzel tower to get us started. The pretzels were delicious and well worth it for some pre-dinner chomping or if you want to just get a few beers and something cheaper to munch on. They also have a great beer selection with a few things I had never even heard of and their own beer brewed specifically for them.  The burger was huge in that it was stacked high with toppings. I am not sure how they feasibly expect someone to fit that thing in their mouth but they do. And I did. It was actually very very good. I don't think it is the best burger I've ever had and perhaps not even the best in Charlotte but it was delicious. It was a little expensive for what it was though.  The fries were another story. I like my fries crispy especially when seasoned unless they are thick cut. These were thin cut and soggy. Then they were crammed into a cup. I only had a few but I know I've had better in Charlotte and think they somehow must have stacked the voting deck on their award or our table just got a bad batch. They also give far too many (just below Five Guys proportions).  I think they could come down on price by giving less fries and a slightly smaller burger which would allow me to budget more for a few of their tasty brews.  As it is, I wouldn't say no to going back, especially to try a few more items and soak up the atmosphere and great beers. But, I think the food (based on my experience) was given too much hype."}
{"text":"About a year ago, after a few visits with exceptionally bad service, I said I would never go back to The Liberty after being offered a dirty to-go box for my leftovers. When I requested an unused box, the waitress informed me that she couldn't find any boxes and that, yes, there had been food in the box that was offered to me, but that was the best she could do. I was appalled. I myself work in the industry and would be fired on the spot if I had the audacity to do such a thing.   The other night, I decided to give The Liberty another shot when my friends suggested meeting there for dinner. The dinner was poorly prepared and sloppy. The service was mediocre, but none of these things would prompt me to write a bad review. I checked my bank account a few days after the dinner, and noticed I had been double charged.  To me, this is not a big deal... I understand accidents are made. I called and requested a manager twice, but he was never in. (apparently, he is only there 3 hours a day) I was asked to leave a message the second time, but the girl on the phone informed me that \"there was probably nothing they could do if i didn't have my ticket number.\" Tactless. I told her I'm sure they could find a way to refund my money and to please have the manager return my call. After a day or so, the manager did return my call. The server had accidentally swiped my card for my bill and the bill of my friend. I understand that this happens, but wanted the part of the bill that was not mine to be refunded. He asked me to have my friend call in with a credit card payment for her part of the bill. After being in the restaurant industry for 6 years, I have never heard of such a thing. A week after we had dinner there, the manager wanted me to correct a mistake of one of his employees after I was double charged? I was infuriated at how tasteless and unprofessional his request was. He obviously wanted to get off the phone and had no interest in apologizing or compensating for the bad experiences I have had in his restaurant. I looked online for someone else to speak to but unfortunately he IS the higher-up. I was disappointed with the employees that I spoke to and the managers lack of tact. It was extremely unprofessional. If I could give this restaurant a rating lesser than one star, I would.  *** I just received a credit in my account from The Liberty, but instead of refunding my full $39, he decided to return $33. I think it may be worth the $6 to never have to deal with the manager again."}
{"text":"Burgers are to die for! Love the vibe."}
{"text":"Five of us went to The Liberty tonight for dinner.  We had a salmon burger, a couple of chicken sandwiches, a lamb burger and a French fry/salad.  We started our meals with a couple of pretzels.  Everything was very good.  Service was good."}
{"text":"We took a small group from the office as a farewell to a exiting co-worker.   The food from the appetizer to main  luncheon course was awesome.  All of our group were more than satisfied.   I will have to bring my family here sometime soon!  Yummy."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! My wife and I found this gem while running errands. I ordered the Turkey Burger with a side salad.  My wife went for a huge cheeseburger and fries. It was superb.  A great match of quality and uncanny seasoning. The staff was friendly and very attentive.  Am counting the days until we can do this all over again. (If you are going for dinner and can't get there before 7 pm, call ahead for a table.)"}
{"text":"Wide selection of good beers. Lukewarm coffee. Mac n cheese came out watery, but crunch burger was amazeballs! Replacement side (baked beans) also very tasty & well spiced. Stick with their strengths and it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Been here three times already and love the food.  The duck on the appetizer menu is unreal and the BEST burger in the city.  Atmosphere is cool and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Their calamari fries and cocktails were simply mouthwatering. Casual vibe. Great place to pregame a night out or just destress after a busy workday/week!"}
{"text":"Saturday night and it was dead in this place. Our giant bar crawl group managed to fill the space, but the wait staff wasn't very helpful. Nothing special here, definitely a one shot place."}
{"text":"I have only had the burgers here and they are great!  They brag that they are the best burger in Charlotte and I have to say I am having trouble finding a better one.    Liberty is located right on South Blvd in Southend right near Pewter Rose.  Parking is a little tight depending on the night.  The Carolina burger is my favorite here!  Everything from the bun to the toppings to the size of the whole thing is totally up my alley!  I had to smoosh mine a bit and cut it in half to eat it because it was so big.  All of the ingredients were super fresh and made a great combination.    The only downside I have to the place is the fries.  Everyone likes different kinds of fries - I like the traditional type, sorry to say like McDonalds-ish.  Not too big and just the right amount of salty.  The fries at Liberty are gourmet or something - seasoned to the hilt and mucho pungent.  It isn't my preference but I know some folks love this kind.  We have never had a bad experience with service here - everyone is super friendly and accommodating.  The bar area has booths and high tops but there is also a proper restaurant.  The decor is very warm and cozy with great art work and gorgeous chandeliers.  Check out the one above you when you first walk in!  You will be craving some suds!  :-D"}
{"text":"I really love this menu because it's all very natural, much of it locally sourced- very clean, scratch, comfort food. We got the shoo mercy pancake and it was delicious! Our server William was very nice and helpful. We will certainly be back"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since they opened.  always thought it was so so until the other night when i had the pub burger.  definitely one of the best burgers in town.  burger was perfectly cooked, had great grilled flavor, fantastic brioche bun..simply the best.  fries were also very good with the parm cheese i like sitting the bar area much better than the dinning room- tons of tables in the bar.  solid beer menu- lots of local brews"}
{"text":"If I could give The Liberty 4.5 stars, I would.    This is a great concept with excellent follow through.  The Gastropub concept is an interesting one...upscale \"pub food\" with extensive beer offerings.  The Liberty delivers on both.  Even though it's a casual restaurant and pub, you can make reservations.  We did and my friends and I sat in the dining room portion of the joint.  Good choice for having conversations.  The menu is simple and doesn't have too many options.  I ordered the Lucky Gastro-Pig...just to say the name really...but, I was so glad I did. It is \"Slow-Roasted Black Berkshire Pork Shoulder with Crepes, Pickled Pineapple, Spicy Peanuts, Jalapenos, Lettuce Cups.\"  No joke, that's what you get.  The pork is in a little Le Creuset pot.  It did need a little salt and pepper, but maybe that's my taste.  It was delicious and I ate every bite.  My friends ordered the burger and fries and the wings.  The fries had Parmesan on them and were amazing.  They were both very pleased with their entrees.  Our server was great...Josh...ask for him.  He was even funny and responsive when my friend pointed out the misspelled menu items which are written all over the walls (example: Chedder for Cheddar, etc...)    My only beef with this place was a couple of things with the decor.  The dull posters with a photo shop picture of beers and a cute poem need to go (see the photos).  They should bring in local art.  It would look great on the walls made of reclaimed wood.  And, they need to take down the cheesy, and misspelled, menu item graphics from the walls.  It makes it look like a \"Disney-pub,\" where you have to explain who you are the customer right away.  This place can (keg) stand on it's own without gimmicks!  The bar was PACKED when we left at 11 pm on a Friday...quite the scene.  I'll be back when I visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have more positive reviews - I love The Liberty! I live nearby and so it's an easy go-to with a variety of choices ranging in price. I love the field green salad with beets and apples, the salmon with farro, the short rib, and, of course, the burgers. The Liberty claims to have the \"Best Burger in Charlotte\" (even though when the burger has changed since claiming this title), and they do make a pretty dank burger. I love the Lamb Burger. Yes, the burgers and big and messy, but I mean, come on - they're delish.   The waitstaff has always been friendly and helpful. I often split the salad and a burger with a fellow diner, and they bring the burger out already cut in half and the salad split onto two plates for no extra charge. Great beer list, VERY cool atmosphere - this place is great."}
{"text":"I won't go back to The Liberty even if the meal was free.  We had guests in from out of town and wanted to try The Liberty for dinner.  When we walked in, the restaurant side was almost completely empty.  We asked for a table for 6 and was told that they didn't have any openings but we could sit at the bar.  We asked why the restaurant was completely empty and they said they had reservations.  I find it hard to believe that they don't allow for walk ins.  I asked to talk to the manager and the Owner/Manager came out (who was a complete jerk to us) and said I'm not sure what else I can tell you.  If I could give a rating of 0 Stars I would."}
{"text":"Still here, one hour in. Have had one drink, not busy, missing two of the 3 apps we ordered. Service is absolutely dreadful! Just got the bacon popcorn and 2 pretzels that somehow took 25 minutes longer to make than the pig chips and both of them are cold and the popcorn is largely unpopped. Server had no idea what the menu was (pork scratchins in particular). No cocktail menu and beers are taking at least 20-30 min to come out and we have ordered 3 different taps that they are out of. I have been to the southend location many times and was excited to try this location by the house but this is awful. The tiny metal chairs are also bad. We were here for my youngest son and i's birthday and should have given this more time, opening before Christmas seems to have been a HUGE mistake!   I saved this to wait for our mains and the food was fine....if you get the burgers. I ordered the chicken and dumplings and they are really chicken and gnocchi and had an off putting taste. Not to pile onto the server but I never got our Brussel sprouts I ordered, but having tasted my wife's it's just as well, they were soft and mushy.   Someone came and spoke to us as we've now been here for nearly 2 hours and comped our drinks and apps, but the overall experience was a huge letdown. I hope they get it together quickly."}
{"text":"The Liberty is a great place to go for American fare. The Calamari steak fries are awesome (chilies, scallions and curried slaw included). The Pretzel Tower is a must have if you order a beer from their micro brewery. I love the angus burger with cheddar and carmelized onions. They have outdoor seating, which is a plus too."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to grab a quick bite on lunch since we were taking a break from our tattoo session across the street. We got there and we were told only the bar was open (no big deal) apparently the dinning room is only open between certain hours. But this also means they have a select menu to pick from. My wife and I both got the burgers with fries. It didn't take long for the food to get there. When it came out it looked pretty damn good. I took a big bite and realized that they didn't have mustard on it. To keep from eating a fry burger I asked for some and apparently they don't carry any. WHAT BURGER JOINT DOESN'T CARRY MUSTARD???? I mean come on that's a basic hamburger condiment. Sadly I had to get over it and continue eating it. It was a decent burger, I truly don't see what all the hype is about. The burger in my opinion was a bit over cooked and to top it off the burger is juicy which is a good thing but they don't let them sit when they take them off the grill so as you're eating it you're ending up with a soggy bun and that just sucks. Now the fries, the fries were bomb! I def recommend getting them!  Next time I'm around the area I may eat here again but I'll make sure I'll bring my own mustard. Just crazy! All in all its decent but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"The Liberty seems like one of those places that can be my \"safe\" place to go when I don't know where else to eat.  The food was decent.  I had a chicken sandwich that was so huge, I couldn't even eat it because it was falling apart.  Flavors were good, but the chicken sandwich was a complete mess.  Fries were good!  The server was nice and helpful, but wasn't around much.  So has anyone ever heard of Blue Cheese Ranch?  Now ranch is more than just a dressing to me...it's a condiment.  I could put it in just about anything.  The Blue Cheese Ranch I had the other day was a little weird.  I definitely wasn't a fan of the flavor combo.  I'm sure there are people would could mix the flavors, but this was the first time I ever asked for a side of ranch and couldn't eat it.  Another first for me was the fact that the restaurant was louder than the bar area!  No problem getting a seat and it was quieter.  They had some live music from a guy that was decent.  Overall, I would say this place is ok.  It's almost like everything was good with the potential to be better, but it just missed the mark.  You're not going to come out saying \"OMG that was the best meal ever\".  It's a large space, so if you're hungry and you don't know where else to go, you can count on The Liberty.  I've heard good things about their brunch, so I'll have to check that out sometime to see if I have a different experience."}
{"text":"Hostess said we could be seated at the high top table.  We didn't want that.  She said we could sit st the bar.  We didn't want that.  I asked her if we could sit at one of the empty tables outside.  She agreed and sat us.  We looked at the menu and realized it was a fixed menu for Easter.  Why didn't the hostess mention that to us?  And then we waited and waited for s server to come.  Nobody came to wait on us after a long wait.  I saw the sanitation score and it was s 91.5!  Nothing was hitting on any cylinder. So, we got up and removed ourselves from this restaurant.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Okay Liberty - my name is Michael and I can be shy around new people. When I first saw you, I was peering out the window at Tupelo's. I must admit, you did look kind of snazzy. The next time, I thought we might have a drink together. Your Birdsong Lazybird Brown hair made me sigh. When last we met, I think you sensed my hesitation, there are so many restaurants in Charlotte, and I've been hurt before. Well, let's just say your Crunch Burger has me climbing on tables and dancing in the streets. Woot woot! Throw caution to the wind and run your truffle fry fingers through my hair!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food with a great vibe but they absolutely HAVE to figure out a way to deal with the noise level. You just can't hear the person in front of you. They're aware and working on it though!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here for brunch. First time at this location however. Though the staff is really nice; from the hostess, to the server, to the food runners, everything is really slow. I ordered the deviled eggs as a starter and it was supposed to include candied bacon. There was no bacon on top and when I told my server she was happy to top it off however they put regular bacon on top instead of candied bacon. That oversight a side they were pretty good.  For my meal I got the omelette. It's served with breakfast potatoes as a side and generally I substitute because for some reason Charlotte restaurants just cannot get breakfast potatoes right. I'm so glad I was wrong in this case they were amazing! Don't miss them if you come here for brunch! The Omelette was also pretty good. So I wasn't blown away with the food and the service I would certainly come back again and get the same thing."}
{"text":"So we just ate at the The Liberty in Ballantyne and we decided to come to this one due to convenience but SHOCKER they are the same restaurant with 2 totally different menus. WTH!?  The breakfast potatoes I had at The Liberty in Ballantyne where are arguably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had in Charlotte. Everywhere else just seems to be a hit-or-miss even if the food is great. When I asked the waitress to say we're the same she couldn't tell me. I took a gamble but since the entire menu was different it was safe to assume that the potatoes are different also. I was right. Not only were they not good but they were not even close to the ones that the other location. Nonetheless that was just a side and the main course is actually pretty good.  They offer an omelet of the day and a lobster omelette for $11 was just too good to pass on even though I was torn between this and the Liberty breakfast which comes with both bacon and sausage, eggs potatoes and a biscuit only $12. It's unheard up to get to me for such a low price. Guess I'll get that next time because it does look delicious. This time it was an easy choice because they were out of biscuits and there is no way I'm going to take toast over a biscuit.  Though the food is just average they have a couple other entrees that looks really good and I will come back and try them. Pretty average restaurant overall but worth it for the price."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Resturant in town. Some reviews on here have complaints about service and they couldn't be more incorrect. I come here all the time and have never met a employee that wasn't kind, careful, and hardworking. Great people and even better food. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Burger in Charlotte? Talk about false advertising. Food was mediocre at best. Service was terrible & basically nonexistent. Bathroom was an absolute mess. Place where entire staff merely going through the motions but not actually doing their jobs."}
{"text":"Have always loved The Liberty on South Blvd . Very excited when this one opened up in Blakeney. Got a reservation through Open Table. Excited to see Blackened Shishito Peppers on the Appetizer menu. Huge Serving of them in a great Asian sauce. Also got a plate of Pig Skin Nachos with Pulled Pork, very tasty !       I ordered the Grilled Caesar Salad with Salmon, Two others had the Fish and Chips and My daughter had the Crunch Burger. Even the child's Mac and Cheese was served perfectly with fresh green beans, fries and apples chunks ! Service was good and the food right up to par with South Blvd . Had a couple of Craft Beers and it was a great Friday night ! Glad to have it down in South Charlotte !"}
{"text":"Stopped by the other night for a quick dinner for the opening of Restaurant Week, It was great...First you got a mason jar of Boiled Peanuts for the table. Then I had the Bazooka Guac..it was Guacamole with Goat Cheese and Pistachios..Wonderful . Then I had the Hanger Steak with Jalapeno Hollandaise..who ever thought of that ought to win a Prize - it was beyond delicious!~! And how could we go and not get the Salted Caramel Budino!! It is something I dream about ...alot!!   Go now during restaurant week or anytime, their food is consistently good! One of the Best Burgers in all of Charlotte too!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always thought it was \"OK\"... The burger is delicious I will say.  But I have never been impressed with the staff.  This past weekend my husband and I went with another couple and it was awful.  The hostess was rude, short, not friendly at all.  The restaurant was freezing and when we mentioned that we were told 'oh don't say that it was hot earlier and i feel just fine.'  We had to sit through dinner with our heavy coats on.  Our waitress was constantly rushing us, not helpful or friendly one bit.  At the end my friend (who is pregnant) had to go to the bathroom. She want and they were out of toilet paper so she told the hostess. The hostess sighed and said \"well i'll have to go downstairs to find some so you'll have to wait\"  Then when she returned she didn't even put the toilet paper on the roll, she just sat it down.  My meal was just ok, I ended up feeling sick afterwards actually I think from the grease.  I am in no hurry to go back. But my husband does love the burger there."}
{"text":"Finally got my turn to try this place out and it was everything I had hoped for.  I loved the interiors of the place as soon as I walked in.  It's literally beer themed with a beer like chandelier and beer glass dividers in the main dining room.  My girlfriend and I sat in the bar and the window seating was great.  For the record I like natural daylight.    I had the Southern Crunch Burger.  Ground beef burger with lettuce, tomato, pimento cheese and house chips on top.  It came to the table with a knife becuase there was no way to fit it all in your mouth.  It was HUGE and delicious.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Looking forward to going back. I'm puzzled by the negative reviews.  Our visit was so good!"}
{"text":"Was here with group of friends, and I ordered the crunch burger with fries. The service is nice and we had a great time here chill and relax. The burger is kinda big and the fries are good! The taste is good, and I would recommend people try it out. Unique experience!"}
{"text":"My favorite burgers in Charlotte, great pub atmosphere and great food!  They change their menu every few months and always have some great burgers on the menu.  Fries and sweet potato fries are also great!  They always have local beers on tap and have a good wine selection as well.  Go with some friends and sit in the bar!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and definitely 5s they have a few kinks to work out with staff; but it was some of the best food I've had...it's new to blakney but will give the other restaurants in the area a run for their money. It seemed pretty family friendly and reasonably priced for the excellent food. The wine list was fairly extensive and the cab we had was very good.... I would recommend making a reservation though. It is worth checking out may be a new favorite."}
{"text":"I keep trying The Liberty in hopes of boosting my opinion of it..... With the same result.  It's just \"eh....\".  I've been here on pub crawls, beer tastings, business lunches and dinners..... I've had their famous truffle chips, their even more famous burgers, a few appetizers...... And I remain overall un-impressed.  It's not that I don't understand the appeal of the restaurant.  It's in a good location, wide amount of parking, good beer selection, decent service, and ok food.  I just can't overcome my feeling that there isn't anything that special about it.  So I hang on to my \"so-so\" status on The Liberty, but on the flip side, I do keep trying."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the south end area. It's a brewery but they offer cocktail drinks and wine. We came on a weekend night and surprisingly it wasn't crowded. The staff were friendly and attentive. As soon as we came in we were greeted and seated. Since I'm new here I wanted to try several different things. I ordered the pretzels as an app. It probably pairs well with beer. It's very filling made fresh but noting fabulous or different from average freezer pretzel. I got the salmon burger which was tasty but a small portion of meat. It came with iceberg lettuce.... it didn't pair well with the meat. I asked for another option if arugula and it tasted much better, but again it was more in then meat. My sister got the lamb burger and loved it. I tasted it and it was pleasant for my tastebuds. We tried a variety of drinks. The signature drink libertini is a no go. The dragon berry lemonade is sweet and tasted good but if you want strong and good taste the Budino last one on the menu and the Paloma. Literally the Budino is all alcohol. So to wrap this review up it's good to come for drinks. Try the recommended food maybe the other options aren't listed for a reason on peoples reviews or they had a few cocktails so things taste different. Hope this helps in your decision."}
{"text":"This review is 100% reflective of the service, not the food. The food was fine, though not anything to write home about. We got passed around between servers when we were sat until we finally wound up seated with Hannah. Our son ordered macaroni and cheese (his favorite!) and it came out and was disgusting and borderline inedible. I called Hannah over and politely asked to send the uneaten food back and get a hamburger for my child instead, and I was greeted with a rude look and silence as she snatched away the plate. She was rude and nasty to us the rest of the night, and even worse, she left the macaroni and cheese on the check. We spent a good amount of money tonight and I'm really disappointed in the way Hannah treated us. Absolutely will not be returning, and I'll let my friends and family know not to as well."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time burger was well done even though ordered medium and the people I came with said that McDonald's has better chicken sandwiches and fries then this place. The fries were not bad just soggy. Overall they need to learn how to make burgers from Cowbell or Chilis. Yes Chilis even they have much better tasting food."}
{"text":"This was one of them eat brunches we've had in Charlotte. The Farmers market omelet was fresh and cooked to perfection!  The mimosa and bloody Mary's were great as well. Service was friendly and attentive. No wait and so much better than where we originally planned to go!  This is now on our top go to list!"}
{"text":"I heard on the local news today(5-10-18), that The Liberty closed unexpectedly. Something to do with the owners business partner passing away recently!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting The Liberty and it was even better the second time. I ordered the Duck Confit Poutine, Steak Frites and Peaches and Cream Cheesecake as well as a Queen City Whiskey Cocktail. I don't know what to say other than great, excellent, exceptional. The only trouble I had was deciding on what to order. I would still like to try the Dagwood Burger, Chicken and Waffles, Southern Fried Trout and their Pretzels, so Ill probably be going back a few times at least."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for Sunday brunch for the first time! They have $3 mimosas, which are pretty big pours. We were eating closer to lunchtime and I was craving something healthy, so I ordered one of their salads with salmon on top. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the toppings on the salad were unique and well balanced. It was a super good salad! I also ordered a side of biscuits because I was also craving carbs. They were fine, but nothing special. Everyone loved their food tho, so we will definitely be back and probably also check out dinner."}
{"text":"Irish pub(ish)/American food.  Great burgers (people RAVE about them), constantly changing menu.  Definitely try the devils on horseback & angry mussels!  Do not miss the SALTED CARAMEL BUDINO.  Menu changes often, but if they have pulled pork stuffed hushpuppies, GET THEM."}
{"text":"They get my vote for best burger in Charlotte!  The Pig Burger was incredible.  It is giant though so come hungry.  The Lobster Mac and Cheese was fantastic too.  They had a lot of great wine options also which is always a big plus for us.  The ambiance was great but we did move tables because it was a bit bright for us.  They were super accommodating and moved us to a corner table that allowed us a better spot to cuddle up and enjoy our date.  I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"My visit to Liberty was brought on by the Charlotte Craft Beer festivities. Liberty was hosting a Founder's tasting event in their basement bar. My dad and I ordered a flight and took our platter of beer to the bar upstairs to order dinner.   He ordered the basic burger that a HUGE with rosemary, parmesan fries. I got the goat cheese, arugula salad which was so fresh.  I also had the bbq hand-ground sausage with pimiento cheese. It was really good but I was a little bewildered as to why my sausage was sauced. In my experience, a good sausage can stand on it's own in most instances.   Overall, a great dining experience and an interesting food selection. I will only mention that I was confused by the set up of the menu, but I will go ahead and attribute that to my simplistic expectations for a menu."}
{"text":"We have wanted to try this place for awhile and have heard they had good burgers, so we gave them a try at lunch this past week. We got there around 1pm and it was crowded said give them 5 min and they would get us sitted. We waited for around 15 min looking at plenty of empty sits, once we got sitted they came right over but took about 10min to gte us a drink. The cheese that comes with the pretzels is really good and good selection of beers. We both ordered the burgers...one with fries and one with mac & cheese. Burgers finally come out and was more like well then the med. we had ordered them out , figured they had set waiting to be picked up. Burgers taste was alright but nothing over the top and dont see where they one of the best burgers in Charlotte. Lunch took 1hr 45min, so dont expect to get in and out quick here."}
{"text":"A huge mistake in changing the menu. No more short rib option, so the poutine suffers a immensely. A hugely \"dumbed down\" menu, probably cost driven, leads to some crucial deletions. They said they could add brisket to the poutine. It was super salty and the brisket was amateurish. Don't do barbecue poorly. Just stop. The beers are still great. They keep a vey diverse tap list here always. We are twice a month patrons. The kid's grilled cheese had gouda...which is probably cool for kids in the know, but stop trying to be impressive. A kid knows what they like and when I order that change needs to be known. The beautifully prepared chicken and dumplings are gone. The mac and cheese is okay. The blackened green beans are kind of fun. They still have the famous crunch burger and some great fish and chips. I had the the sloppy cheese joe and a side salad for entree. It was super good. Overall, though, you have to be more competitive in South End now with places like O-ku popping up. The bar has been raised. I am still disappointed in the menu changes and most likely will not return. Unless I just crave a crunch burger and am far from Cowbell."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate. I really want to love this place!! The first time I went, great food & service. The second time, we arrived 10-15 before they switched over to the limited menu (which I didn't even know it was told about). Instead of taking my order, they waited those 15 min, then told me we could only get off the limited menu now and seemed angry that I was frustrated by it. Had I known that, I wouldn't have waited around 15 minutes (inside the time they SHOULD have served the regular menu) and as I did anyway, go elsewhere! And lastly, I ordered takeout which they did not get right and then offered me a whopping 10% off my total - or drive back for my missing items. Just too many errors and problems with service to want to go back often."}
{"text":"This terrific South End gastropub is renowned for having some of the best burgers and pretzels in Charlotte, and its reputation is well deserved. The pub burgers range from the simple to the outrageous (try the massive 'Crunch' burger, and you won't need to eat again for a week). The beer selection is also excellent, with more than a dozen brews on tap that range from local favorites to obscure labels from across America. The menu also boasts some healthier fare, but why bother when you can order a burger the size of your head?  The family-friendly atmosphere and ample selection of kiddie grub makes this a great spot to bring the family for lunch or dinner, but on the day we visited, the service was disappointingly slow. Nonetheless, The Liberty is a Charlotte institution for a reason, and well worth a visit if you're looking for a good meal in South End."}
{"text":"The first time we went to The Liberty was during Queens Feast in summer 2017 and had a great experience. Got a pork chop dinner and some trout dish, and both were bomb!  We decided to go back recently and was expecting the same type of experience. I guess the menu has changed because the pork chop or trout dishes were not on the menu anymore. In fact, with the exception of 4-5 dishes, all the menu consists of now are mostly burgers and sandwiches. The menu on their website has not been updated to reflect this so it is a bit misleading. This was the first disappointment.   We decided on the late night burger and the famous crunch burger. I don't think it was worth $14 and $15 that we paid for it. The burger was cooked past our liking (medium) and the fries were cold.  I don't think I'll be back to The Liberty unless they are participating in the Queens Feast."}
{"text":"I Came here to celebrate the Queen's Feast, for the first and last time.   The Liberty was picked by my new co-workers, whom I went with. I was the first person to get there, and the rest of my group arrived within 15 minutes.  My biggest issue is that our Waitress wasn't super-attentive. She wasn't rude but when I flagged my issue with her, I wasn't satisfied 100% with the resolution. I specifically asked her to pointed out if I order something contains pork. \"The menu is strightforward.\" She said.  I ordered \"Ashley Farm's \"Chicken & Waffles\" - with roasted drunken peaches, arugula, duck-fat waffle and smoked-maple-bourbon-siracha honey.\" Thirty minute later, I got my bland waffles topped with bacon!!! Seriously, Liberty ?!! I was hungry, and I had to raised my complaint since I don't eat pork (religious restrictions.) The waitress took my plate and promised to replace it with a new order. Funny enough, she brought out my freshly made chicken & waffles in two minutes. They fried the chicken and baked the waffle in two minutes?! I ended up not eating the chicken, and she said the manager took my drink off the check because the bacon was not mentioned on the menu and it  mistake on their side ( which was nice- I admit!) However, I didn't want a freebie, I want to eat.   And to be fair, the Salted Caramel Budino and Chocolate Scotch were DELICIOUS. Very very V.E.R.Y DELICIOUS!  Two and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Food is ok.  Sat in bar area at table and even tho not crowded waitress disappeared 3  separate times for no reason.  Then spent time showing another table photos from her phone rather than serving our drinks.  Third time we've had bad service.  Different servers."}
{"text":"Went with the family for dinner and have written reviews before, had to write again since the food and service were much better than in the past few visits. The burgers, wings and chicken Buffalo sandwich were very good. The server was very attentive. It was not very crowded for a Saturday night., so the noise level was not too heavy. I had the mussels which were good, not great and would probably not order them again. Our friends came in and had the shrimp pasta which they really liked and said the portions were a very good size. Our other friend had the trout and he did it was very good ."}
{"text":"I would just like to start off by saying that for context of this particular review, my family made reservations through Open Table for Mother's Day about a month in advance in order to ensure we had a place to eat for lunch.  This, in the end, did not matter at all.   Without going into great elaborate detail, I'll just give you the issues we encountered: ·        We were forced to order from an abbreviated menu that required you to spend $30 for an Appetizer, Entrée and a Desert.  This resulted in members of our family that didn't want to order anything at all because there wasn't anything on the menu that they found appetizing or would fit into their dietary requirements.  I will give praise to our server though.  After asking the Chef if he would make anything special for our family member, he refused.  So she asked her friend that happened to be working in the back that day to just make her a simple salad, which he graciously did. ·        Because of the abbreviated menu and cost per person, we all decided to split our meals.  Our server ensured us that splitting our meals would be a fine way to handle the situation and that there would be plenty of food for each of us if we chose to do that.  This would turn out to be completely incorrect. ·        After we ordered our food, we waited for about 35 minutes.  Finally, the kid's meals for our kids came out along with a couple salads.  The salads were not enough to split between two people and so, as a result, only the ladies in our party were able to eat the salads. ·        We waited for another hour for our entrée's.  After repeated apologies from our server, we finally told her that if we didn't receive our food within 2 minutes, we would be forced to leave.  And so, with the snap of a finger, all of our food begins coming out.  The portions we received are barely enough for one person to eat from.  My wife and I along with others that ordered the Salmon, basically had 3 - 4 bites of food each from our entrées and that was it.  The deserts were good, however. ·        After all of this, all that we received for our trouble was an \"I'm so very sorry\" from our server.  The manager never came out to apologize, the Chef never came out to apologize.  They basically threw the server under the bus and said \"handle it\" from what we could gather.  I felt very sorry and embarrassed for our server.   No one offered to at least comp some of our meals or try to do something to make it right.  Besides the fact that this was Mother's Day and we had a party of 14 people patronizing this establishment, it was by far the most horrendous dining experience I can ever recall having.  I simply cannot believe it, even a day later.  Just a completely unacceptable outcome that we were dealt.   I've learned today that this owners' other location closed down and this location is the only other one that remains.  I'm not sure why the other closed but if this owner, chef and staff do not get their act together, this location will be closing down very quickly as well.  I can assure you with all the other fine establishments that provide quality food and service in the area, people simply will not put up with a pile of crap like this."}
{"text":"I went to The Liberty in Blakeney on a Friday night.  Two of us tried to order a draught beer. The waitress first presented us with a hand written note card with a list of choices. HAND WRITTEN note card- very unprofessional!   Oh,no, that was the incorrect card.  She then presented a second hand written note card and explained that this was the updated list.  I asked about two beer choices on the list and they were no longer available.  So much for the updated note card!  I ordered an iced tea. My chicken sandwich was fair.  My friends ordered the fish and chips - very skimpy!  One of them asked if she could eat half of my bun that I had placed on the side of my plate after she finished her fish.  A customer is still hungry after the fish and chips platter so she requests to eat a left over half bun on another plate?  Come on people!   Would someone please require the millineal wait staff to reenter training? I left cash to pay my bill.  The waitress took the money, didn't ask if I wanted change back ( I didn't, but one should ALWAYS ask).  Of course she never returned and just assumed the extra money was hers to keep.  Where does this attitude of entitlement come from.  Some one please tell these young waiters/waitresses that this is just not the way it goes.  No, I will no be back.  Don't even consider going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to the Liberty a couple of times now.  This place has such a FABULOUS selection of beers, and I feel like I'm in beer heaven here.  They have a wonderful selection of both local beers and some great imports, many of which are on tap.  I've had great service both times too.    Their food is fairly good, but I find it a bit overpriced.  It's probably related to the area, since its prices are in line with many of the surrounding restaurants.  The first time here, I had fish and chips.  The portions were large, but the fish was just ok.  The second time I had a shrimp and grits special.  It was pretty good, being more tomato-based, which surprised me.  However, the price was a little steep for the portion size, and it wasn't because of the high number of shrimp (the whole dish had five medium-to-large sized shrimp.  Overall, I love this place and plan to keep going back."}
{"text":"The food was overall pretty good, neat brewery decor, casual atmosphere. Service was pretty poor.  We stumbled in here for brunch because Tupelo Honey across the street had a 2 hour wait (ain't nobody got time for that)  The burgers: all incredible  The brunch food: pretty good, french toast is amazing (egg sandwich comes on a massive greasy bun, if you are into that, thats cool...I like toast)  The service: hostess was more attentive than our server was... the group I was with was really laid back so we didn't mind that all of our orders were mixed up."}
{"text":"We'll be back! My family and I dined here at 10pm after a long day of activities and we were famished. We actually intended to go for Tupelo Honey Cafe right next door but their late night menu was limited. The Liberty was still offering a full menu and they had a lot of different options for everyone in our party, including the kids. We tried a BUNCH of things on the menu but our favorites were the mussels (the spicy tomato broth was so yummy), the salmon (crispy and cooked to perfection), the short ribs (super tender) and the star of the show was the chocolate cake (deliciously decadent). The kids also liked the cheesy poutine with short rib gravy and also the creme brûlée cheesecake. The server was super friendly and attentive, despite the fact that we were the last party of the night.  This place exceeded  our expectations for a last-minute late night family meal!"}
{"text":"I recently went there on a business lunch and my colleague and I ordered the fish and chips.  The place got  busy during the time we were there. The fish came with several dipping sauces and was very good.  The french fries were delicious and the cole slaw was also good.  I had dinner at Liberty about a year ago and it was very good then too. The food at Liberty has a distinctive style. It is not the \"run of the mill\" variety and I will definitely return there.  The service was good but not great. I had to flag the waitress down to get a couple re-fills.  It is a nice  place to enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"I had a couple friends that live down the road from here so we ended up dropping in for dinner and drinks.  The atmosphere is... comfortable. We were in the bar room and it was a Wednesday which means $5 wine night. The staff were okay- good about service but not too friendly.  I ordered the pear and mixed greens salad and paired it with the Malbec they had. Food was fresh, it looked nice, and I could tell the wine had been opened that day which was good.  Their menu seemed rather put together and their plating for the cheese and meat plate my friend got was nice.  For what you get, I feel like this place is a pinch pricier than it should be but overall I had a nice time."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last week when a girlfriend suggested we meet for drinks one night, I had a yummy wine, a vibrant cab suggested by one of the staff, my friend had champagne.   Due to how late we stopped in on a weeknight; we weren't expecting the place to be as busy as it was, but we still grabbed two seats at the bar.  We had a yummy charcuterie plate and Mara, the bartender was attentive and let us roam between sitting outside on a rare warm night in March and at the bar.  I'm back tonight drinking the wine that Mara remembered I like, the matchstick in case you were wondering.  I was greeted by name and they didn't say a word that I am on a deadline bringing my laptop to the bar:  the Brussel sprouts are served in two different ways, but I stuck with the traditional preparation and wasn't Disappointed, I'd love to try the lobster Mac and cheese but it was such a cold night I wanted some hot soup.  I got a bowl of perfectly seasoned tomato soup which feels more like a bisque, and a yummy croquette with cheese.  The ladies beside me were making out with their burger and poutine, but didn't seem embarrassed. Seriously, this place is yum.   My pics are of half eaten food because I knew nothing of self-control when I sat down tonight. But this will be one of my spots, for sure.  PS, the small cast iron pot that the brussel sprouts were served in is adorable, and I need some for my house."}
{"text":"All around underwhelming.   I visited with a party of 6 on a Thursday night. I originally had a reservation for 12 but half my group flaked out a couple days before. I couldn't change our reservation on Open Table... I had to call to request the change. A bit of an inconvenience.   The restaurant was pretty dead when we arrived at 6:30. There were a few more tables full when we left around 8:30. Service the entire night was sufficient but lacked any personality. Our waiter was soft spoken and didn't seem interested in any small talk.   The food was the most disappointing point of the evening. I ordered the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich, which came with a cup of chili. The sandwich was not cooked well -- there were grill marks on the top but the bottom slice of bread was untouched/uncooked. The pork was piled into the middle of the sandwich, so in one bite, I unintentionally ate about 3/4 of all the pork there was. Gravest sin of all though, was that the cheese was not even close to melted. It was barely even warm. So, essentially, I had a half-cooked cheese sandwich. Bleh. The chili wasn't much better. Flaming hot as if it has been microwaved and bland.   The Liberty salvages a few stars for their decent beer selection and the basket of pretzels we started with. They were pretty tasty and the mustard that accompanied them was really good!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town, period.    It's expensive-ish, parking is a bit of a hassle, but the burger is worth it.  The lamb burger is amazing but I usually go with the pimento cheese one.  I have always felt the wait staff was quick and friendly too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and cool decorations. The food was incredible and the service was spot on. I ordered a beer that I didn't really enjoy and the bar tender tossed it and gave me something else. Fish and chips are money! So many different things I want to try, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came for a lunch while out furniture buying and came here because Tupelo Honey Cafe was a 1 hour wait. Appetizer: hand cut parmesan truffle fries Hubby lunch: bacon cheeseburger with tomato soup  My lunch: grilled chicken cobb salad Desserts: Pecan Bread Pudding (me)                  Butterscotch Pudding (him)  Fries were delish, bacon cheeseburger was good but just a bacon cheeseburger with a really really good bun, tomato soup above average (his opinion not mine as I didn't like it at all) Chicken Cobb was above average/ delish - thank goodness I ordered dressing on the side and I suggest you do the same as they put a lemon vinaigrette and a buttermilk ranch on it and it would've been too much for me, hubby got the caramel pudding which was good but super sweet and I got the pecan bread pudding which was perfect!  Overall I'd say that if you want a burger- sandwich or salad this is pretty good but I only gave it 3.5 stars because the food wasn't exceptional and the service was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time at The Liberty and definitely left us wanting to come back!   The beer menu is very inviting and I sat there wondering if there was a way to work my way down the list to try every beer...this might be a fun new goal of mine.   My date ordered the Braised Short Rib and it was awesome...I definitely found myself wishing I had made the same selection. I ordered the blue cheese ribeye, which was just ok...the meat was pretty chewy and tough, but the flavor was ok. Not bad, just not what I was hoping for. On another good note our server at dinner was extremely sweet and really did a wonderful job, which is important to us because we have definitely not returned to restaurants in the past no matter how good the food is if the service sucks.   After dinner we moved to the bar area where we were excited to find live music...apparently they do it every Thursday night, which we had no idea about! The guitarist was REALLY good and definitely made us want to come back just to listen to him!   All around our first visit went well and we are definitely looking forward to returning and enjoying more live music on Thursday nights in the future!"}
{"text":"we drove over specifically to go to Liberty. It was close to 2pm. So the lunch rush was gone, but the floors were so filthy and there was so much trash under the outside tables, that we ate across the street. The dirt was a huge turn off..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere: sitting outside where there's fantastic live music, got a great beer from Appalachian, and the pretzels and beer cheese are good eats, and the service staff is super friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OK. I think the Liberty was a lot better a few years ago. I'm unsure what happened. The BBQ is dry now. It just isn't the same.   HOWEVER, the poutine is amazing (can we please go back to the duck poutine?) They have a solidly good brunch. Their hamburgers are rated the best consistently.  I have had some truly awful service here. Of course, I'm a sucker and I come back. They do need to work on that.   They have the whole never ending mimosa thing. Skip it."}
{"text":"Well designed gastro.  Prompt, courteous service.  Unique, quality dishes at a reasonable price. Diverse tap selection for the geek and novice alike."}
{"text":"I went here after work for a drive no and some food. I sat at the bar and the waitress who took care of me was very nice. She left halfway through my stay and was replaced by a male bartender. He was very rude to me and other patrons. He seemed almost aggravated to be there. At one point I asked him a question and he gave me a dirty look and just turned away. The food I had was good and the other employees seemed nice but this guy was so awful he ruined the experience for me and some other customers. It's a shame, I really liked their other location."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and our waitress was fantastic! We were pretty hung over when we came here, and I have to admit it definitely helped. I got the mini chicken biscuits and my husband got a burger and we got poutine for an appetizer, everything was seasoned and perfectly cooked! The only complaint I have is that it didn't seem very clean, our table was a bit sticky and this pesky fly would not leave us alone. We came in at a weird time, 3:00pm, so there was no reason why our table shouldn't be clean. Other than that, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Come by a few times and haven't been disappointed.  Beer, pretzel and burger.....what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"The Liberty is always a great place to go. I prefer it as a dinner spot. The ambience is semi-casual to laid back. They are known for their burgers. I prefer the pimento cheese and bacon burger! Mind you, these are HUGE burgers, prepare to be stuffed afterwards! Staff is also very friendly and helpful with the menu. Good beers on tap as well. They received four stars because I diverted away from the burger the last time I went and got the Butcher's steak. I was disappointed in the steak itself and the way my fries, salad, and steak were piled on top of each other in an oblong bowl. It made my fries soggy and I was expecting more salad."}
{"text":"If you are thinking about a private dinner party, look elsewhere.  We had a rehearsal dinner here and were far from satisfied.  Be sure you understand what you're getting.  Staff is somewhat unable to communicate the same information.  We were never told to give them an exact number of diners, but were charged for the number our kids gave when asked for an estimate of how many there would be.  Tip, tax and entire meal plus appetizers for 4 that didn't show.  Poor business practice.  They had one server to take our order.  That took 20 minutes.  The highlight of the evening was a video of our kids and the server decides that's a good time to clear the table.  Poor judgement.  Too late for us, but not for you. Shop around."}
{"text":"I had heard some good and bad things about The Liberty, so we finally decided to drop in and try it out for ourselves to see what all the noise was about. The décor was very cool and I like the fact that the menu constantly changes so they can use fresh ingredients. A short overview of our visit on a Saturday evening:   The good: definitely get the house-made fresh pretzel. It was delicious and the cheddar fondue amazing. The chicken and dumplings were also very good.   The bad: the service and parking. The restaurant wasn't busy (there was no wait), but our service was abysmal. I'd read that on multiple reviews and now know it to be true. The parking was also quite difficult on a Saturday.    That said, we might be back for drinks and the fresh pretzel in the bar area, but will probably skip the full dinner due to the service."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of ordering the BBQ platter. A scoop of cheap pulled pork, a quarter slab of ribs, and some chewy brisket... All of it smothered in the worst BBQ sauce I've ever had. Very thick, very tangy, heavily poured over every inch of the trio of meats. $11 for this travesty on a plate. Pretty unattentive server who made us wait 15 minutes for the check. Fairly small menu to begin with, mostly burgers. Not a huge deal, but I would have expected more options overall. Maybe I just made a terrible choice and should've just chosen a burger, which I think perhaps the place is known for."}
{"text":"The Liberty is a great place for a gourmet burger. We walked up from our house a few weeks ago after hearing about this burger's fame. The funny thing is that The Liberty did not set out to have the greatest burger but after being recognized for their burgers by The Charlotte Observer, the self-described gastropub has embraced the public's love of their burger. We tried both the traditional pub burger and the Kobe beef burger on our visit. Both were fantastic. So were the fried pickles - definitely the best fried pickles I have had. I also adored the salted caramel budino - like pudding but even better. I look forward to returning to The Liberty soon, both for more burgers and to try some of the other enticing offerings. I've heard great things about the house made soft pretzels and there is a new summer menu."}
{"text":"We are always excited at the prospect of eating at Liberty, but the last few times have been disappointing. This time was no exception and it will be our last visit. From the apathetic servers to the bar that doesn't know how to make basic  mixed drinks and the inconsistent results on food, it's just not up to par. Our calamari fries were good tonight but our \"adult\" grilled cheese had unmelted slices of cheese and missing cheeses and ingredients promised by our server. It's a shame that a great looking place with some talent in the kitchen can't pull it all together better than this."}
{"text":"I've been to the Liberty a total of three times:  The first was during restaurant week- the highlight of my meal was a dessert that was a gooey chocolatey cake with a chocolate stout shooter...but its not on their regular menu and that makes me sad.   The second I went for the Mac N Cheese - which was meh to say the least. I ended up exchanging it because I didn't care for it, dry, over-herbed which was strange because it almost was bland.   Today I went with some coworkers and had the lunch special. For about $8.50 you get the chicken burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle herbed aioli- more mayo textured, pimento cheese served on a delicious bun. This is served with fries, \"dessert\", and soda/Iced Tea. Great deal!    The  burger itself was pretty good although I'm not sure I would be back based on that alone. The fries were really good (fresh cut and herby) but when I asked for a side of ranch (don't judge) it was watery blue cheese- ick, and since I'm not a ketchup girl I wished there was a thinner aioli or something just for those...then they would be perfection!   The dessert was a mean joke- basically they were like a Little Debbie-esque snack pecan pie with wrapping left on. I was really disappointed and wish they just made a fresh cookie or just left it out all together.   This would have earned 3 stars but our service was terrible.   Aloof describes our waiter perfectly well. Drinks were left unfilled, he couldn't bother to crack a smile, and he put our checks in the middle of the table (hey we all got the same thing you could have just passed it around to us politely). We had one to-go order which was the special and a salad - this took longer than all of the other meals, even though that was ordered at the same time- she was leaving early so that was definitely a problem...he also failed to mention that he added 20% gratuity- which at $1.70 a piece wasn't a big deal but it's always a bit sketch when they don't say it outright. It seemed like he knew he was getting gratuity added so he didn't bother to be friendly....so -1 star based on service alone."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for a late breakfast/brunch. Food was fresh- avocado toast and fried green tomatoes were to die for. My boyfriend had the chicken blt and said it was one of the best he's had and we're from jersey!! - I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place had a sign out front advertizing the best burger in Charlotte.  I would not go there, but it was very good.  Only problem was that the brioche was falling apart so it was hard to eat.  I also ordered the peas and carrots, which were excellent.  Overall very good, and they had live music the night I was there.  Literally at the end of their parking lot is the East/West train station, so it's very convenient to commuters from north and south."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch since I had passed it many times and finally decided to try something new. The reviews weren't bad and after standing in the parking lot deciding between this place and the place across the way I decided on The Liberty. The lunch menu is pretty small, but preferable to sprawling menus that guarantee they specialize in nothing. I decided to order a bacon cheeseburger (their Pub Burger) with fries and their tomato bisque as an appetizer. After sitting for a while my burger shows up without having ever gotten the soup. I asked the waitress to remove the soup from my order since it never came. She was very apologetic and offered the soup for free if I still wanted it. I declined since my food was already here and there just wasn't really a point in still wanting an appetizer. As I looked at the food I immediately noticed this is one of those places that serves those tall impossible to eat burgers. I really have no idea how most people feel about this, but personally I kind of hate when I'm served food that's overly and unnecessarily difficult to eat. I've never met a human that can open their mouth wide enough to take a decent bite of a burger this tall. I couldn't fit the burger in my mouth and after taking a few bites of nothing but bun or lettuce I frustratingly scraped off much of the toppings just so I could actually take a bite. I had ordered my burger medium and after my first bite saw that it was cooked all the way through. No pink at all, not medium. This is nit-picking, but for a place that proudly hangs a giant banner stating \"best burgers in Charlotte\" you'd expect them to have mastered the art of correctly cooking a burger, at least. After the waitress apologizing for the soup so strongly I decided not to even mention that my burger was cooked incorrectly. Another reason I didn't complain about it being cooked incorrectly is that the flavors were there. The food WAS tasty and I enjoyed my burger despite it being deconstructed since it didn't fit in my mouth. The burger was juicy and covered in condiment and soft grilled onions that spilled/squirted from the back of the burger as I took a bite, flooding my hands with mayo and grease and bits of grilled onion. I'm just not big on eating food that makes me feel like I need to take a shower when I'm done eating.   While the food did taste good and the service was good I removed stars for the forgotten appetizer, unwieldy and difficult to eat construction of the food, and not cooking the food to order (why even ask me how I want it, then?). Even though this place has good things going for it I kind of regret coming here and won't return. Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"We received a Groupon as a gift so we decided to stop by for lunch to redeem it. We made a reservation on OpenTable and were promptly seated upon arrival. Then we sat for about 10 minutes before anyone came over to bring us water or ask if we'd like anything to drink. The bartender and came over and apologized for the delay in service. Maybe they were understaffed? I ordered a Dr. Pepper and it took longer to get that than a beer. You'd think they'd be able to pour it in the bar area - instead the bartender had to go to the opposite side of the restaurant. Despite the slow service, everyone we encountered was friendly!  If you're dining with picky eaters, this place has a lot of variety - burgers, sandwiches and salads. Overall, I thought the food was average. The poutine was the best part of our meal. I ordered a burger and a side salad and my boyfriend ordered the hot chicken and sweet potato fries. The burger was fine - no issues. My boyfriend said the hot chicken was good but for those of you who have had Nashville hot chicken - it's not the same. It looked like there was some sort of sauce on it rather than the typical hot breading."}
{"text":"The Liberty is a great spot to hang out for some good food and a decent beer selection. I've been here a number of times and never had a bad meal. On Tuesdays they have unlimited poutine - it's fantastic. In the bar area buy an order and get unlimited refills as long as you're there - worth coming in for."}
{"text":"I've never really been driven to want to visit Liberty but I finally made it in on the beckoning of a friend. It's not a bad place at all and I would absolutely go back to try a few more menu items.  The menu is lengthy but not overwhelming in quantity of choices. Rather, the choices are all very unique. Don't stop on the front as there's twice as much once you flip it over including all the entrees. There are lots of burgers and sandwiches. Also plenty of starters and small plates. We ordered the pretzels with beer cheese as our starter. We weren't especially impressed with it. If you want pretzels and beer cheese go to Heist. I was disappointed with the low number of salad options too. Would've been nice to see some obvious protein options to go with them.  My girlfriend ordered the pecan crusted trout - a mainstay around here it seems. But they do it right. On a pile of mashed potatoes with green beans that were delicious. The unusual item included in this dish was a peach chutney that didn't actually come out on the plate - it had been forgotten. I got the fish tacos and the amount of fish in them was too small. Still, the flavor was on-point! Would've been nice to have three instead of two and a smaller portion of fries. Which, by the way, was a huge portion of parmesan dusted fries with herbs. I actually didn't realize it came with fries. I'm not sure if that was on the menu. And I wasn't in the fry mood so I paid the extra $2 for a different side - smoked tomato grits. Exceptional! They look like mac and cheese but aren't that cheesy. Lastly, my friend got the fish and chips (another pile of parmesan fries) and said it was fantastic.  Our service was very nice and attentive. It was mostly empty inside though - Wednesday evening isn't apparently a popping time for them. Prices are a bit on the high side - $15 for fish and chips, $19 for the pecan crusted trout, and $10 for my fish tacos which I felt to be lacking for that. The walls and booths are all lined with repurposed pallets and supports made of repurposed beer kegs with lights inside to set the ambiance. All in all though in many ways it feels like a chain restaurant/bar. I hope to make it back in some day to try out some more stuff. Otherwise, I would recommend them to anyone in the meantime."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the South End neighborhood and are going to visit The Liberty often!  They have a fantastic bar and some great food.  We initially went to sample \"Charlotte's Best Burger\".  I vow to update this review but based on this visit, it's a 3 star.  The burger was a great burger but was honestly far from the best.  I still would stand by the Charlotte classics at Diamond, Meullers... even newer spots like Jack Beagle's in NoDa.  A big beefy messy burger doesn't always equate to a great burger.  We will definitely return though and will update with new finds.  Update:  I have been back twice now and I have to switch to a 4 star.  The quality is just so good that I can't help it!  I had the Pub burger again and it was great, but still not the greatest in my opinion.  I have since had their Poutine Fries, more Pretzels, and tried the Caramel Salted Boudine and all was fantastic.  The fries were incredible because the gravy was not heavy, yet extremely flavorful... and the cheese was great quality and was nice and gooey through the whole dish.  The fries didn't get soggy in the dish either.  Highly recommend it!   On the menu it sounds quite unhealthy but it's just fancy cheese fries and it's a must try!  Will agree with the crowd that the service is a little bit lacking."}
{"text":"I just do not know if there are words to describe the love I have for the \"Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich\" at The Liberty. Couldn't decide between breakfast or lunch on Sunday at noon, but the country ham won out. The Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich has 2 eggs, bacon, country ham, cheddar cheese, tomato jam, tomato, arugula, and aioli. I think. But since thats not a long enough list of ingredients, I added a side of pimento cheese. I'm wild. I wish it didn't come with breakfast potatoes because there were a couple of sides I wanted to try, I bet I can swap out next time. As in next weekend because ill be back for that sandwich. For $10 including the side it was a hell of a deal.  Boyfriend got the famous \"Crunch Burger\" He really enjoyed it. How could you not love a giant burger with homemade chips, pimento cheese and bacon though? His mac and cheese was really creamy, but overall pretty bland. Have to try the fries next time!   We also started with the fried pickles, which were breaded and cooked perfectly. Love that they come with hot sauce. Because I love to drench anything and everything in hot sauce.   They have a great little patio area. Perfect for brunching.   4 stars because our service was lacking. Had to ask for silverware when our meals came out -- didnt have for the appetizer and could have used some more water refills. Not a huge deal, but would have made the experience perfect."}
{"text":"The Liberty has an amazing atmosphere. Unfortunately it is at that point you should turn around and leave, because the experience will often only get worse.  On our latest visit, several opted for a high-top table in the bar, where we watched one server clean a table - three times - and multiple servers pile dirty plates onto another table. Maybe the kitchen had no room for dirty plates. Yet for some reason they didn't want to speak to us, as clearing tables seemed to take a priority. It could have been us, and that is okay, but it doesn't speak highly about their service.  After we were asked about drinks - and we did place an appetizer order - we eventually received the drinks, which ran dry before we ever saw someone again, and the food never did come out. Since the appetizer order was ignored and the drinks were never refilled, we opted to ask for the check and leave.  Just another disappointment at The Liberty."}
{"text":"The quality of the burgers and fries were really poor. The burger was small and overcooked and pricy. Sorry, will not be back."}
{"text":"Service was really great but the food and atmosphere ... not so much. My husband and I went to eat there for dinner Saturday night. My first disappointment came when they told me it was restaurant week and my only option was to order a 3 course meal. I just wanted a normal entree but they didn't allow that. So I ordered the calamari fries, pimento crusted filet, and cheesecake. The calamari fries were heavily breaded which is fine but then drenched in sauce so it was served soggy YUCK! Then the one ounce filet tasted like old meat and the pimento cheese was just poured on top, not \"crusted.\" Then the cheesecake had a strange consistency and tasted like filling from inside a donut. They promote the place as a gastropub but I felt like I was stuck in a big open warehouse with bright lights and no decor."}
{"text":"Cool place, great food (best turkey burger I've ever had), and reasonable prices.  I'll definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Just went here for my birthday with some friends.  The food was pretty good! The vibe is really good, too! The poutine was good though a little cold when we got it. The pretzels were amazing, and the cheddar grits were okay.  Everyone liked their entrees at the very least, some loved theirs.  We had a lot of problems with the drinks, no drink menu, weak drinks, gross drinks. Ultimately most of us ended up going with beer and wine. They were really good about swapping things out, so I think they were still ironing out some kinks.  We will try it again though and see if there is an improvement.  One thing we did think was odd is that the waitress was asked to bring out cake for everyone to sing. Not that I'm a big fan, as I get embarrassed, but such is tradition. The waitress came out and put the cake down in front of me saying \"sorry we don't have any candles or we would have sang\", and walked away. Maybe she was shy, AND I'm sure there was a way to get someone to come over and start the table singing.  We did it on our own though, thankfully, since we have such fun friends!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've found so far in Charlotte and the place just looks cool.  I ordered the Southern Prime Crunch Burger.  There are homemade chips on the burger thus the \"crunch\". I'll definitely be back there to try some more burgers and have that one again."}
{"text":"Everyone has a bad night and Saturday nights can be unpredictable. As a result, I thought of not writing anything because maybe it was just an off night. Unfortunately, one or two bad missteps turned into a catastrophic fall down a flight of stairs and the Life Alert was out of reach.    45 minutes late to be seated for a reservation was a poor start.  Reservation: noun: an arrangement whereby something, especially a seat or room, is booked or reserved for a particular person.  plural noun: reservations  \"do you have a reservation?\"  synonyms: booking, ordering, securing  \"the reservation of the room\"  I think there was a Seinfeld episode involving a reservation???  We were sat at 3 separate tables instead of one which made conversation non-existent. Other tables opened BUT we weren't sat there for some reason). Another 30 minutes to get our order taken (drinks arrived sporadically). Dinner showed about 15 minutes later, which was good. Nothing like being hangry for a late dinner turned even later.   Again - everyone has a bad night so 1 star above the worst rating and a shot a redemption in the future.  There's no way this place could be this terrible all the time...or can it?"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I'd been to the Liberty. Years, in fact - back when they were co-awarded \"best burger in Charlotte.\" I never had a bad experience, but this place just fell out of my regular rotation of lunch spots.  Once I heard about their poutine, which is a new addition to the menu since I'd last been, I had to check it out again. I ordered the Carnitas Papas Fritas Poutine and it blew my mind. Plenty of fries, curds, and gravy, but topped with a mound of tender pulled pork, fresh and creamy goat cheese dollops, scallions, and cilantro. It was absolutely delicious...so much so that I vocalized an obscenity describing how good it was while sitting by myself at the bar eating lunch. The bartender thought maybe something was wrong, but it was actually just that good that I had to say a four-letter word aloud. The Carnitas Poutine  is a meal in itself, and at only $9, it's a good deal too.  I haven't had their traditional poutine yet, but they offer it bottomless after 5:00 on Tuesdays and I'm sure it's delicious as well. The rest of the menu looks even better than when I'd been there before, including a French Dip Burger that I'm excited to give a try to in the near future. So, the Liberty will be making its way back into my SouthEnd lunch lineup after this experience. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"An absolutely adequate food and beverage venue. They deliver what they advertise-- bar food. They have fantastic drinks and craft beer. A solid place to go with an impromptu party of 9. They were courteous and kind. Definitely a great place to visit. Consistency is key--and they've got it. (However, always order your meat one temperature above your actual wishes.)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here-I would have returned before we left town but there wasn't time. The calamari fries were really, really good. I have never had a preparation like that before and I really enjoyed them. The cheese plate was good. They should give you more bread because there really is not enough with the generous portions of cheese. The waitress brought us more but it took awhile to come.   I then had a salad and my friend the fish and chips. I am not so into beer so I had a cider-if you are into beer I would definitely check out the selection. I think we had dessert but I was so full I cannot remember what we had.  Our server was pretty on it until the end."}
{"text":"I've been curious about The Liberty for some time now, and I finally made it in to try some tasty lunch!  I went into this meal with no expectations - I just wanted to give it a try. Hubs and I grabbed a seat on the patio, which was just lovely for half of the time, the other half I was covering my ears due to the fire engines leaving the station across the street. No matter though - that's not Liberty's fault!  Liberty is pretty neat inside - a great bar area with plenty of high tops and a main dining room with lots of low, amber-colored lighting and a big kitchen in the rear. I also meandered downstairs where there is a really cool private dining area. Super sweet.   Anywho, back to my experience. Our server was really sweet and efficient, especially considering we were the only people eating on the patio. I ordered the chicken & dumplings and was quite happy with the bird - crispy skin, plump bird and a small smattering of carrots, mushrooms and a few greens. While I was expecting large dumpling (considering the dumplings part in the description) it came with seven or eight ricotta gnocchi. Now, I love me a gnocchi, and these were indeed delicious, it just wasn't what I was expecting.   The star of the meal though was my husband's mac 'n cheese - I totally took over that little skillet. It's the baked mac with more cheesy goodness than I ever though possible. Delicious, creamy and topped with a light coating of breadcrumbs. I don't know what types of magical cheese were in this tasty skillet, but I couldn't help myself.   Overall, a really solid dining experience at The Liberty. I look forward to coming back, especially since it's in my 'hood!"}
{"text":"This place has the best veggie burger in town. Best I've ever had frankly!   The sauces are so delicious & the fries it comes with are crispy and yummy. Halfway thru eating my burger I found myself wishing I had another one (I'm that fat). But in actuality, the burger will definitely having coming back for more."}
{"text":"Good food, good staff, nice atmosphere. There is some awesome parking in the back. A big space downstairs for groups. They have a nice beer selection. Absolutely worth checking out for a solid dining experience."}
{"text":"We came for a dinner with great friends and had a wonderful time.   First make a reservation if Thursday-Sunday. They book quick and the wait can be daunting if you don't. The bar is cool to wait at though if you need to. You can eat there too."}
{"text":"The food came out fast but some could have stayed in the kitchen and saved me some disappointment.  The onions on the wedge salad did not work.  Also the fried calamari was soggy.  I went for lunch one and it was way better.  I will not be doing dinner here again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Charlotte Restaurant Week! It is one of my favorite times a year. I mean who doesn't love to dine at some of Charlotte's best places for $30? My prior experiences at The Liberty made me decide to make this my Restaurant Week stop and to invite some friends to join. Two of my friends had never been to the establishment so I was excited for them to try it.  Now, I understand that restaurants can be a little more hectic during Restaurant Week and it seems the goal is to seat as many guests as possible. I completely understand this from a business point of view. However, I have eaten at other Charlotte establishments during Restaurant Week and had a very nice meal and not felt rushed. My friends and myself have enjoyed two hour long dinners with 4-5 courses during previous Restaurant Weeks and that has led to it being one of the things I look forward to.  I have never had a problem at The Liberty but I was very disappointed in the service we received during our last visit. My main problem with the service was our courses came too close together. So close that while we were enjoying our second course the third course was brought out while we all still had about half of the entree on the plate. We had a reservation, we were on time for our reservation and when we left we were the last table on our half of the restaurant. Why such a rush? I hate that such poor service has tarnished my opinion of The Liberty. I love to support local establishments and I believe that The Liberty is a positive asset to South End.   I can't write a review and not mention the food. The food was quite delicious. We were all in agreement on that. I had the pig ear pad Thai, chicken and waffles and the apple bacon pie. The pad Thai was amazing! I could have had that for two courses. The \"chicken\" and waffles was an interesting take on the dish. The chicken was described as \"nuggets\" but I would classify it closer to a croquette. The gastrique was devine. The apple bacon pie was great, but was disappointed that you couldn't taste the bacon. Three out of four of us got that for dessert and we all agreed it could have had more of a bacon flavor. The fourth member of our party ordered the fried Mars bar - that should be a menu staple! Amazing!  While our overall experience was good, the most disappointing thing of all is that two new patrons to the establishment had this experience and I am doubtful they will return. Charlotte Restaurant Week is a great way to try a new establishment and I am disappointed that my friends were not able to experience The Liberty like I have in the past."}
{"text":"Confidence (n): full trust; belief in the powers, trustworthiness, or reliability of a person or thing.  Best burger in Charlotte - that's a pretty confident statement right there. Being a burger aficionado, and seeing a self-proclaimed \"best of statement\", just meant I had to check it out.  My first encounter was during Queen's Feast 2011, so it was a prix fixe menu (and was incredible, I might add.  Quail and waffles? Heck yes!). But my second visit was for the holy grail: the burger.  First impressions are key, and the layout and mood established by the Liberty was iffy for me at first, but it grew on me.  After I adjusted to the back-lit walls of beer images (and the golden amber glow they exuded), I was okay.  I do enjoy the beer theme they have going (and the visibly well-used tap room with many great choices on draft).  I've never had a bad server at The Liberty, which is another plus.  On this bovine feeding frenzy, we started with poutine for an appetizer.  I'd never had this Canadian staple before, so I have no idea how The Liberty's stacks up, but it was pretty amazing.  Fries and gravy - what could be better.  Adam got the beef burger and I got the lamb burger (so we could swap bites, naturally).  They arrived with just the right amount of pink in the center and both were rich in flavor and melted in your mouth.  I have a really hard time trying to decide which burger was better...might have to return for a tie breaker. The fries that accompany do the burger justice.  My only complaint with my lamb burger would be the bun.  I know that the meat should be the showcase of the burger, but if the bun is too frail (and gets soggy and disintegrates),  it makes for very messy eating. Beef up the bun a bit and we'll be in business; I don't mind doing it, but eating a burger with a fork just feels wrong.  Final analysis: go to The Liberty and order a burger.  Don't ask questions, just do it. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Waitress was hustling,  Waited 1 hour to get food.  Excuse was they were not expecting this many people at lunch.  Will never go back again.  Management at Liberty needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Not so good. Cold pretzels, that they forgot to bring. I liked the green beans but they are buttered not blackened. Turkey burger was raw."}
{"text":"What The Liberty lacks in service, it makes up for in food.  You must go to this restaurant with that in mind.  I have dined at The Liberty I would say around 10 times for both lunch and dinner.  I am dying to try brunch---duck confit omelette, are you JOKING??  The devils on horseback appetizer are phenomenal.  The crispy bacon wrapped around sugary sweet dates stuffed with salty blue cheese are a match made in heaven.    I also enjoy their take on mussels, Angry Mussels if you will.  The broth is guzzle-worthy, but if you need extra bread for dipping (which I have never NOT required) it will be an extra $1 for 3 pieces.    The lamb burger, which I snagged a couple bites of, is good enough to convert any non-lamb lover into a lamb loving lunatic.    On the downside, the service is slow, and not charmingly so.  Go for the food, but maybe eat a snack first!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place since it is close to home.. however the food was terrible.  We just went for a quick dinner, sat at the bar and order the Pig Chips and something they tried to pass off as Poutine.  The chips were ok - my husband ate them, however the poutine was disgusting.  Not sure why they wanted to put an egg on it and never saw anything that resembled cheese curds.    I hope they improve, but it will be a while before we're back."}
{"text":"I made it! I have been driving past and heard so much about the Liberty for two years now, and I finally made it in for lunch the other day.  This place strictly sells burgers - so you had to be in the mood to eat one.  But they have quite a variety of burgers to eat which is nice, from vegetarian to egg to meat on meat.  The atmosphere is very laid back, chill and fun to be in.  Great beer selection as well."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! We have lived in Charlotte for 4 years and just now discovering this gem! We ordered something that wasn't on the menu anymore and they accommodated and made it for us!! Great food and great service!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch after hiking. It wasn't very busy, and because we were dressed so casually we chose to sit at the bar.  My friend and I ordered mimosas and the Cobb salad - I asked for no bacon and dressing on the side and the order came out right.  It was okay. Nothing was wrong, it was just a functional meal and non-remarkable. Our bartender was a our server and he did an okay job too.  The ladies room was not very clean which is an issue for me. It was after the lunch rush so should have had some attention.  I probably wouldn't make this a destination, but it's close to home for me and sometimes you need a place to pop into that's predictable."}
{"text":"Our experience was not what you would call great.  I believe the server forgot our table existed.  Our food came out really fast and the fries and mac and cheese were warm like they were sitting in the back.  We did not get any silverware and had to go find someone to ask for it.  When our meal was finished , we had to ask someone to clear our table and get the check.  If the food was great , it might have been worth it.   The burger was average and because of the service, I can think of a dozen better burger pubs in Charlotte ."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Charlotte. $78 for three people at lunch on Memorial Day (3 burgers and 3 beers). We waited an hour for our food, had to get our own drinks from the bar, and although our friends sitting behind us arrived shortly after we did, they still didn't receive their order when we left. Truly a lack of managerial decisiveness and poor employee training (our server didn't know that Stella is a beer). This second visit will be be the last for us."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 5***** review for one reason:  Poutine.  If you're French Canadian, Liberty is the spot for one of the best comfort foods ever.  Cheese curds, braised beef cheek and porcini gravy."}
{"text":"This place is all things great!! Went there for brunch on Sunday no wait staff was very pleasant and knowledgable of the menu. The salmon over mushrooms and peas was awesome! The steak and eggs cooked to perfection!! We will be back for more"}
{"text":"My mom and dad were in town on Sunday afternoon. After great internal debate of what Charlotte-area restaurant would best suit them for lunch, I decided on The Liberty. It was a solid choice.  We got there around 12:30, and I figured we'd end up having to sit in the bar area since the dining room was full-up. But the pint-sized Asian hostess was able to immediately fit us into a booth/seat along the central amber-glowing beer wall.  Our waitress, Kristin may have been her name, a proud and tall curly-haired brunette with a slight caramel tint to her pale skin, greeted us forthright with brunch menus, and welcomed us with a sincere smile. In my opinion, The Liberty and Brazwell's Pub on Montford are in stiff competition for maintaining the most attractive wait staffs in Charlotte. As I glanced around the dining room, I struggled to identify which of the tight-black-clad waitresses exceeded the others in form and virtue. I couldn't rank them; they're all just flawless.  My mother, admiring the pallet-wood walls, barrel-keg columns, and frothy-yellow suds inlaid the back-lit wall behind her, turned to me and said, \"So... this is basically a bar? A pub?\"  I laughed. \"Yes, um... it's a restaurant. And a bar. All restaurants are bars these days. Charlotte has evolved into a drinking city of late. We have like nine breweries and a hundred new restaurants. It's a foodie town now.\"  I checked out the brunch menu. I didn't even realize The Liberty had brunch. Apparently that's a new ubiquitous Charlotte dining offering as well. I browsed the options under the brunch heading - typical fair: omelettes, shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, etc. But for me, The Liberty is a burger joint. It'd be silly to deviate from what they do best. I was, however, particularly moved by the listing in the bottom left corner of the menu - Bottomless Mimosas for $12. Not something I could really do with the folks, but I'd be back for those.  \"I'm getting a beer,\" I said. \"You guys want beer?\"  My mother declined, but my dad was into it. \"I want something dark,\" he said.  I scanned the beer list - lagers, pale ales, double IPAs, Guinness (eh, maybe), a couple ambers, some of the traditional OMB and Triple C options, but nothing particularly dark. I wanted to order a local beer, but none was quite fitting. Kristin returned, \"You guys know what you're drinking?\"  \"We need something dark-ish. How dark is this Imperial Stout?\"  She kind of wavered. \"It's... good,\" she said. \"Maybe not that dark, though.\"  My dad was easily sold. I went for a Triple C Light Rail Pale Ale, which I stuttered out in awkward tongue-twister form. Eh, she knew what I meant.  The beers came quickly. I sampled my father's Imperial Stout; it was, indeed, good - kind of rich and earthy with a sharp after-taste. I'm never disappointed by a pale ale, so I found my Light Rail satisfying - just enough hop to give it a flinch, but easy enough to match most any meal. I tried to get my mother to order a beer or a glass of wine, but she declined. She explained that beer had never suited her. She also later explained that marijuana didn't suit her either; it would cause her to get light-headed and faint. I found that hilarious and adorable; it's amazing the things you learn about your parents in adulthood that you would never be privy to as a child.  We ordered: my dad went with the brisket burger; mom got the signature Liberty Pub Burger. I decided to go rogue and try the fish n' chips. Kristin scribbled it all down, nodded, smiled, fetched our menus, and spun away.  My mom cleared her throat. \"So, honey...\" she began, \"I was reading your Yelp reviews...\" \"Oh, dear...\"  \"Those ones from Philadelphia... I was reading them with your sister...\" \"Oh, dear...\" She paused to choose her next words. \"We were trying to decide if you're embellishing these things, or if you really drink that much...\" I laughed. \"Everything that happened is one-hundred percent true. I only embellish the language; everything situational is real.\"  She nodded. \"Well, if that's the case... I don't think we like this Huxley very much.\"  I laughed again. \"Well, ya know, we've had a weird relationship. I don't really understand why she is the way she is, but I try to give people the benefit of the doubt.\"  \"I don't think you should see her anymore,\" my mother asserted.  I nodded. \"Yeah, that's probably not even really up to me...\" From there, the conversation steered elsewhere. Kristin returned in short time with our entrees. My folks were impressed; I was too. My dad methodically destroyed his brisket burger; my mother only managed half of her Pub burger, but that was a lot for her. I melted over my fish and chips, so much beer batter... so much malt vinegar. And we all salivated mindlessly over the crispy, seasony fries.  At the end, my dad and I argued briefly over the check, before I relented. He is, after all, my elder.  \"Are you going to Yelp about this one?\" my mom asked me.  \"Yes, mother. I am.\""}
{"text":"Love it-lots of fun IPA's and a cool  arty decor consisting of beer kegs, beer art, and delivery skids. Lots of seating, booths too-however make reservations.   We had the poutine- excellent, the famous Southern Living 2012 pick-the Crunch burger- delicious- shout out for the cole slaw-yummo and the truffle fries.   Unfortunately they share the parking lot with Tupelo Honey and it was brunch time so parking was a pain. Dress is casual and they have outdoor tables too."}
{"text":"OMG,  stay away.  I've anticipated their opening for weeks now.  And actually waited a few weeks so they could work out the kinks.         To start. The service was non existent and the weren't even busy.    Once the manager was made aware of our lack of service and care.  He was less than concerned and not even apologetic.   To top it all off,  I got the Fish & Chips and was sick from food poison I presume alll night.   Such a bad evening and following day"}
{"text":"I was very skeptical when I saw that The Liberty's burger was voted best in Charlotte for 2011. I mean, how can you get better than Big Daddy's? Well, I totally agree with their selection!  The Liberty's burger is amazing - cooked just the way you like it (medium rare for me), served on a soft, brioche bun, generously topped with cheddar cheese, thick, crispy bacon, condiments, and a fantastic aioli sauce. I have to tell you, I hate mayo on my burgers. But this aioli is dynamite!  The burger is served with their signature fries. They were ok, but I should have swapped them for their pimento mac 'n cheese, since I am such a mac 'n cheese nut.  So, why only three stars? The service could have been more attentive, and two of our three the appetizers (blue cheese chips, devils on horseback) were not very exciting. My husband enjoyed the chicken and dumplings, but the dish was too salty and I was not impressed that their \"dumplings\" are actually gnocchi. Ho hum - have had it better elsewhere!  Even so, I will return to The Liberty for the burger!"}
{"text":"I love home made soft pretzels, had them at southend location so tonite we decide to order it at new location . Taste still amazing with cheese sauce .  New drinks menu have been improve  Don't forget to try Pear martini !!!"}
{"text":"Here is another gem... my first visit to Charlotte did not disappoint, I was a little unsure at first but all was great !  Arugula salad was delicious, but for 9 bucks should have more beets! Mussels were outstanding - soooo good.  I had a nice flight of 4 beers- great selection of local brews.  Thanks to another review - I am having dessert- Salted Caramel Budino - wow!"}
{"text":"The burger and beer reputation this place has lived up to the hype.  One of the best burgers I've ever had and discovered dogfishhead hellhound double ipa that I've never heard of."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. The food was 4.5/5 stars. The angus short ribs were great. And the sliders with kimchi were sublime. And I'd also like to add that the nice person who waited on our table was super. I didn't get her name but I'm sure people think she's great. She had her nose pierced btw.   That said, the reason this place only gets a \"A-OK\" from me is because one lady who was there left a really bad impression on all of us. Yes, we did say it was a party of 6 but ended up being 8. Luckily, it wasn't like the place was so full they couldn't do anything about it. But one employee, who wasn't wearing all black so she might have even been the hall manager, decided to give us a little pep talk with a stern tone. \"Next time, make sure you guys tell us how many because...\" Probably said something like 'difficult' or something. Anyway, what's the big deal? I'd completely understand if it were totally packed and we were rubbing against one another... with other groups. It wasn't. And maybe it was her way of not meeting eyes or none existent smile. Bottom line, we loved the food and our waitress, but had one negative factor bring down the overall evaluation. I'd still go back later though.   The food was good. Oh, yeah, their tequila shots were good too. That should get a couple of you guys heading over this weekend. Haha."}
{"text":"Great Short Ribs!  Will definitely go back to try other entres.  Plan to drink beer, the wine list is weak."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to begin this review.  Everything from the food to the private dinning room was really good.  So I'm just going to list out everything that was awesome.  1. Shrimp n Grits.  Best I've tasted since moving to Charlotte.  Man, folks really do love their shrimp n grits in the Carolinas!!  It's like BBQ in Tx.  On almost every menu!!    2.  Fried Pickles.  Read my review from Fran's filling station http://www.yelp.com/biz/frans-filling-station-charlotte#hrid:RrnwPLvSWBC5ZW4_mhHPEw and you will see how much I heart fried pickles.  These were just as delicious.  yum  3. Service was awesome.  Everyone was so nice!  4.  Mac n cheese?  Yes please....  5.  Private dinning room is spacious and will accomodate a well sized wedding party.   Great experience.  I want to try their brunch because I hear that's just as good if not better.  I'll be back, Liberty....just you wait.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Like others I saw the sign outside about the \"best burgers in Charlotte\". But when I saw the house smoked brisket sandwich I could only imagine how much better that would be.  In reality it was the worst brisket I have ever had.  It was as tough as beef jerky.  I didn't want to complain in front of my guest so I just called and asked to speak to a manager and explained the situation. I got a simple apology and no offer for a refund. After I had to ask about it she took my info so someone could call back.   Note to owners Matt and Tom. If there isn't anyone working the joint with that kind of authority or customer service then how in the world would you expect consistent quality food or service."}
{"text":"The next time I'm craving a burger...give me The Liberty or give me nothing. Well, they do have great burgers. I went here with my daughter and grandson for lunch after hearing great things from friends. We started with the soft pretzels. Let me say right now, I have been eating soft pretzels for a big portion of my life and these salty, soft beauties with cups of sharp cheddar cheese dipping sauce have set a new standard with me. The pretzels alone are probably worth making the trip. My daughter got the \"famous\" crunch burger and after eating a quarter of it myself, I have to say that it is maybe the best burger in Charlotte. I had the BBQ sandwich which came with a huge mound of sweet smokey pulled pork and cole slaw on a soft brioche bun. French fries were OK but nothing to write home about. My Grandson's french toast was a masterpiece of flavors and textures, sweet syrup over crispy and soft french toast , salty bacon with whipped cream on top. Service was good, parking can be a hassle during busy times, but for a burger this good....I'll wait for a parking place."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning here in December, probably from a salad with bacon (like strips, not pieces) that was bizarrely ice cold, with beef on it that was, somehow, also ice cold. My husband, who ordered a hamburger (that was fine, according to him), did not get food poisoning, and we shared a plate of poutine (that was somehow ALSO cold). Tables are insubstantial and service was slow, but polite.   I had been waiting for this location to open for what seemed like forever, and was happy to finally go there. Will never go back, and was sure to warn everyone at the urgent care and in subsequent doctor visits that they should stay away as well. Really unfortunate."}
{"text":"Great first visit! Service was friendly and attentive. The food is delicious. Great selection and can't beat the price. Started with the smoked wings and had the pulled Posey sandwich. Not over sauced and big chunks of meat. Glad this place is so close to our house we will be coming back. Have family visiting from out of town and will definitely bring them here."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon for a quick bite and a drink.  The service was good and the food/drinks came out quickly.  I was seated and greeted right away.  I like the restaurant and it's atmosphere.    I was pleased with my food, I only had an appetizer and a drink, so nothing big.  The drink was tasty and well made.  I have not been here for an actual meal, so will definitely update when that happens, but overall I was satisfied with my visit and didn't encounter any issues."}
{"text":"Based on my earlier review you'd be right to question my sanity in going back to The Liberty.  I don't really know what prompted the second visit, but I've now been back to try the famous burger...  And, to my surprise, it was really good.  So, my second visit to The Liberty was on a Sunday night.  I met my mom there, and the place was nearly empty.  This led to our getting good service from a young woman who was not only attentive but pleasant.  Having remembered that the wedge salad was the one redeeming part of the first meal I had at The Liberty, I ordered a wedge salad for us to split.  It was good - though we weren't offered small plates on which to split the salad.  Not a big deal, but it would have made the process of sharing the salad much easier.    We both ordered the pub burgers for our entrees.  Our burgers were cooked to the requested temperatures, and the fries were fresh and really tasty.  This was a total departure from my last visit when the fries were inedible.  The brioche bun does have a bit of difficulty holding up to the size of the burger and the quantity of the toppings (veggies) that come on it.  Nonetheless, the bun is tasty and it breaking apart at the end wasn't really a problem for me.  (I expect burgers to be a bit messy.)    While I enjoyed the meal, I'd certainly argue that the food is overpriced.  The burgers are $13, and pints of beer are $5 and up.  We had two burgers, the salad, two glasses of house wine and two pints of beer and the bill was $64 plus tip.  That's just too much for what we got, but, then again, that's Charlotte if you are close to Uptown.    I enjoyed the burger enough to go back, but I think Big Daddy's (er... \"Bad Daddy's\") is not only a better deal with food of comparable quality but also a place with more \"burger\" options."}
{"text":"Knew it'd be rough cobbling a vegetarian meal together here, but it turned out to be even more challenging that I expected. Ancient Farro, a side, was the most satisfying part of my meal - colorful, forest-floor-y, earthy. I also dipped everything I could get my hands on in the spicy mustard served with the (super buttery) pretzel, although I don't think it was house-made. Because we had to order tons of sides to get everyone full, we ended up spending twice as much as our meat-eating pals, which was great.   Beer selection was good, with most of the exotics on the bottled list. I always tend towards tap drawn cervezas so I gave a couple of newbies a try. The high grav beer flight was terrific, and a steal at 6 bucks. Service ranged from spacey (door girls) to efficient (our waiter). If the Cheesecake Factory was masquerading as a Gastropub, decor-wise, it would look like this.  A piece of advice for the Liberty's Chef de Cuisine and anyone else out there building menus, yet scared to put options for us \"hippies\" on there: We like good food and beer too. All it takes is a couple of options to get us in the door. A lot of vegetarian peeps are food-saavy - we're going to spend money at your place, if you make us feel welcome. And I'm not talking about a roast vegetable sandwich, a la 1982. I'm talking about real, well designed, prep-heavy Entrees, on par with the rest of the menu. Tofu isn't just for stir-fry. Tempeh isn't hard to find. There are umpteen-million veg food bloggers out there you can rip off, if you're lacking inspiration. It ain't hard. Once you've taken the plunge to vegetarian-ville, veganifying an option or two is even easier - just keep margarine around to prep with, make cheese optional, and you're set.   Shit, I'll consult for free. Call me."}
{"text":"The liberty has the potential to be great but it is marred by inconsistent food and service. First time I went - lamb burger was fantastic, so juicy and well arranged w other flavors. Service on point. Second time for brunch- service awful; could not get waitress' attention. Short rib entree solid but not spectacular. Third time - service good but burger and fries cold; fries tasted old like they had been sitting somewhere for a while and Pub Burger lacked oomph of similar burgers I've had elsewhere. In sum, go w low expectations and you might be delighted."}
{"text":"Perfection! Thursday night dinner here was so nice. I had the pecan crusted trout, which was cooked to perfection and had various fruit toppings that added moisture as well as flavor. It came with mashed potatoes and green beans. There weren't many pecans, so don't count on the influence of the texture or sweetness of pecans. My date had the shrimp appetizer and mac & cheese big bite. The appetizer portions are not large enough for a meal, which our lovely waitress, Angela, forewarned. Based on how quickly he ate, these appetizers were good.     The service was excellent. While it wasn't a busy night, we were seated right away. The food took about 10 minutes to come out, if that long. Angela was informative and personable. The bonus was the live music, which we were directly in front if. This can go terribly wrong when the music is too loud. However, the volume was appropriate for the venue and crowd. Overall, this was an excellent experience and I recommend The Liberty for a low key dinner date."}
{"text":"Was starving, originally wanted Tupelo Honey but after getting there the wait was an hour and we were absolutely famished.  Popped across the parking lot, no wait, fast friendly service, good food. Had the poutine - yummy, fattening, good.  Biscuits were very good, as were the truffle fries.  Would return."}
{"text":"I was happy to book a thanksgiving reservation for my friends and I when I saw the three course dinner that they were offering. That third course, was a dessert bar!    First of all, I've been to The Liberty on numerous occasions and they have an awesome lamb burger. The location is in the lovely South End are of Charlotte and the interior decor is nice and chic, with a lovely dining area and separate bar area.  Ok, now, let's get to the food!  First Course: My guests and I enjoyed delicious pumpkin gnocchi, rock shrimp salad, and lobster and crab cakes. I particularly loved the sauce on the pumpkin gnocchi (my first time having pumpkin!) and the vinaigrette on the crispy rock shrimp salad.  Second Course: Prime rib with creamed spinach casserole and mashed potatoes with a mushroom gravy...yum! The pork was also delicious with smoked Gouda mac and cheese, bacon wrapped ham and sweet apple compote. Wow! It was the only dish that really looked like typical Thanksgiving fare, but it was definitely superb.  Third Course: Dessert!!! I was wary, since I am allergic to eggs, and it's rare that a restaurant has a dessert that I can actually eat. To my surprise, they had plenty for me to enjoy! I had the berry cobbler and apple crisp...amazing! They also had an assortment of chocolate cake, cookies, bread pudding with marshmallows, cheese cake with strawberry sauce, lemon meringue tarts, and a few other things that I can't quite name, since I've never tried them. Just know, there was a smorgasbord of sweets on that table!  It was an overall delightful experience and completely stress free, with no clean up! Yay! The service was wonderful and the owner even stopped by. He was very friendly and personable. I'd recommend The Liberty to anyone. If you're ever in Charlotte, please stop by. They have amazing burgers, salads, and a yummy, popular, fresh pretzel appetizer. Thanks The Liberty!"}
{"text":"Apparently the Liberty is the place to be...who knew?! The ambiance is great and casual. Sat at the bar for a late lunch on Saturday. I had the blackberyy, whiskey cocktail, thing...i cant remember the exact name because it was good and strong. :) i had a cobb salad that was delicious and fries on the side. They were good too. All around. Great location with delicious cocktails and yummy food."}
{"text":"The pecan crusted trout with peach relish was everything. And the sweet tea was close to perfect. Like that perfect space that is just sweet enough and not too sweet.  The fish was to die for and I could eat the relish out of a jar. (Wait, do y'all sell that? If so, I'll pick some up on my next visit the Charlotte). A girlfriend ordered the Mac and cheese, which was a little too cheesy for my taste, but overall we enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"We went here on a recent date night because my fella loves burgers and they advertise that they were voted the best burger in Charlotte. We were seated quickly at a table that had booth seating on one side and chairs on the other. The chairs were so uncomfortable that we both sat on the booth side, which is something we never (and I mean NEVER) do.   We ordered drinks, which were overpriced (I think $5 for a blue moon bottle) but good. As I scanned the menu, I thought about different options. I first thought about the BBQ shrimp appetizer (listed as a \"big bite\") but the server informed me that it was one slice of toast with a few shrimp on it (for $13). Nope. Next I considered the fish and chips but the server told me it was not the traditional cod. Nope. I did not want fried tilapia. Feeling like I had no other choice, I went with the crunch burger. My boyfriend ordered the same and we both had Parmesan fries   Our food came out very fast. We both agreed that it was a decent burger, but definitely not the best in Charlotte. There wasn't anything terrible about it but there also wasn't anything super great. I wanted to like the fries but found them to be less flavorful than I had hoped. My boyfriend, however, really liked the fries.   We both agree that this place isn't terrible. It also isn't somewhere we will be running back to go."}
{"text":"We ate here because my husband saw the best burger in Charlotte sign. Service was a little slow but our waitress was friendly. Food was good but my husband said the burger was just ok. My fish and chips were good albeit a bit greasy. Love the Cole slaw the best. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"Solid American pub. Good bar selection, great little patio. Got the crispy burger, which was average-to-good in taste, but twice as large as any human mouth. The pub burger is also large but good. Servers are very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Good food. Good drink. Good friends. So fun! I had one of the salads (Staff Salad I think?) which was yummy. My husband had the chicken and dumplings - the portion was semi small, but it was good and not the traditional chicken and dumplings. It was a nice atmosphere with a good server - Bailey - we'd go back!"}
{"text":"The Liberty is located in the heart of South End Charlotte. This is a casual place so you can usually dine here without a reservation even on a Friday or Saturday night.   We started with the bacon wrapped dates and they were so yummy! Then we both ordered burgers, and these did not disappoint. The burgers are big and the side portions are large too! My favorite side is the sweet potato fries.... crispy and delicious.  This is a good place for a low key dinner out, a big group, or a family dinner. It is not a trendy spot and the ambiance isn't stellar, so if your looking for a cool night out I'd try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been twice.  Food has been great.  Service sub-par (not very friendly and slow both times)"}
{"text":"The Liberty is a bar/ restaurant located in the old McIntosh's Steaks & Seafood building on South Blvd.  The restaurant appears to have a theme that focuses on beer while their food and beverage selection which includes a fairly extensive wine list that may have you thinking differently.    Atmosphere - Modern, clean, barley, amber, kegs, aluminum, concrete, dim lighting  Food - When I sat and started perusing the menu I had some difficulty in identifying what I wanted as the layout was confusing to me.  As an example, the menu listed a line with a seafood item, then listed a beef item and then back to a seafood item.  There did not seem to be any rhyme or reason for it; at least one that I could decipher.  While deciding on what to eat, I went with a quick order of a beer.  The place is not a microbrewery, so based on a recommendation I went with the Dogfish Shelter Pale Ale from their tap selection.  It was served in an official Dogfish glass.  The beer had a nice strong flavor without being heavy.  After more struggling with the menu and the food descriptions (see photo), I ended up going with the safe route, a burger & fries.  With my order, I asked that they sans the cheese but did not think to inquire about the mayo situation.  The burger & fries arrived hot and nicely presented on a ceramic dish with the fries in a metal can/ sleeve.  With burgers, it has been my experience in a brew pub setting that normally the mayo is an item that is provided on the side.  Unfortunately for me this was not the case, as mayo was slathered on both sides of the bun.  So I ended up just eating the beef patty w/ a knife and fork.  I must say that the beef was good because it tasted like a cut of a steak which to me signaled it was of good quality.  The side of fries was crisp but had a green, and I assume, dill seasoning that I did not prefer.  Service - The service I had was okay...nothing above and beyond.  She did ask if everything was okay, but based on my obvious confusion with the menu it would have been nice if she had mention that the burger comes w/ mayo on it...oh well.  Price - The menu is pretty varied in price, from a $10 hamburger & fries to dishes costing around the $20 price point.  With my $5.50 draft, my meal came in just over $20 w/tip.  Overall - It was a so-so experience.  Would I go again...probably not?  But the beer selection is worthy of a beer lover to at least check out."}
{"text":"I spent New Year's Eve here with a private party and really enjoyed the experience. The downstairs private room was lovely and the small bar was convenient even if they didn't offer the entire menu from upstairs. We had a set menu to choose from and I asked the bartender what she recommended. I selected the pecan crusted trout topped with peach chutney on green beans and mashed potatoes. It was so delicious! The spinach salad with feta, almonds and one slice of blanched pear was a bit disappointing but still nice. Others ordered short rib which took a bit longer to arrive which was awkward but we were a very large party so I understand. The chicken and dumplings others ordered was a piece of chicken on top of gnocchi so it wasn't quite expected for some people. The service was great and overall a very nice event."}
{"text":"Super solid meal! Solid service (our waitress had a sweet eyeball tat on her forearm which was boss!) We had gone out to eat with the kids (aged  16 and 12) to try the new KBBQ place. Such a long line! SO we tracked on over to see about Pikes, closed! I remembered that there was a cool burger/beer joint close by so we made our way to the Liberty and we were majorly impressed! My wife got the Crispy Filet with pimento cheese and smothered fingerling taters which was amazing! I got the short ribs on mash with caramelized onions and an onion ring with winter greens which was equally amazing. My youngens both got burgers with fries and were so happy they stopped annoying each other for a while! The Korean Wings were so good and the pretzels were warm and delightful. There was an enormous amount of horseradish in the mustard so prepare your nostrils!!!! The prices were most definitely fair for the quality of the food and portions size. Will absolutely be back to try the Crunch Burger!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious brunch today.  Service was excellent and food was wonderful.  I had the short ribs w/potatoes.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent eats and drinks. Cocktail list is awesome and food is just as awesome.  Good for brunch too. Hipster free zone as they all go to Tupelo Honey.  Give Liberty a try!"}
{"text":"This place is cool for a date but I'll never go back. They screwed my sister on her wedding reception here so i hate them by default but beers are seasonal which is nice but they don't know shit about beer. Just advertise that they do towards the even more uniformed patrons. The \"bartenders\" and the management knows everything about everything. Or at least they think they do. If only they had a clue they could do a lot more. Think of this place as a high end Hops that doesn't brew their own beer."}
{"text":"Another on the burger  bracket list from the Observer.  I didn't start out intending to visit The Liberty, but my first choice was only serving a brunch buffet til 2:30 pm so they lost out.  I got there a little before noon on a Sunday.  The restaurant was not busy at all and I sat in a booth in the bar so I could watch a little March Insanity while I ate my burger.  There was only 1 other couple in the bar area so not busy at all.  The bartender came over to get my drink order and drop off a menu.  I ordered the burger and a Olde Hickory Piedmont Pilsner.   When the bartender asked how I wanted my burger cooked I asked for \"as close to illegal\" as possible.  She said that since they grind their own hamburger in house they could cook it less than medium.  I ordered medium rare.  Not sure if that's true or not, but I can't find anything in NC State law regarding cooking of hamburger.   The bar area as well as the rest of the restaurant has a lot of wood, which give it a nice pub like atmosphere.  There are plenty of windows so even with all the dark wood it wasn't too dark.  My food came out quickly.  The burger was enormous.  It was held together with a wooden skewer and there was only about an inch of the skewer left at the top.   The burger was juicy but not too greasy.  It was way beyond medium rare, closer to medium well, but since it wasn't dry I was OK with that.  It had a nice char flavor as well, like it had been grilled over a flame rather than on a flat top grill.  This was something some of the other burger places I have tried have been missing.   The burger comes with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Its size makes it difficult, even for my big mouth, to eat, but it was the best burger I've had so far.  The fries were a little bit under cooked for my taste.  I like a crispy fry and these could have been left in the fryer about a minute more and they would have been perfect.  The service at the start of my visit was good, but as more and more people came into the bar I started to feel neglected.  I did order another beer after my meal, but after that the bar tender kind of forgot about me until she brought over my check.    I could have used a refill on my water, but my glass sat empty at the edge of the table.  The price was reasonable too, $9.50 for burger and 1 side.    I would have given 5 stars, but the undercooked fries and drop in service at the end of my visit drops them down to 4."}
{"text":"We've been waiting and it didn't disappoint! Very cozy, comfortable atmosphere. And the burgers....YUM! Incredible Arugula Salad too. Service was great...thank you Peter! Has a nice outdoor space with a garage door that can open up onto the patio. Nice large bar area too.  Great addition to Blakeney!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to get burgers. We got the Colorado Lamb Burger and the French Dip Burger and both were fantastic. I also tried the Crunch Burger that my friend got and it was very good. It's hard to pick a favorite, but I think I liked the French Dip Burger the best. We got the chips and mac and cheese as sides. Both were good, but the fries were better. They were Parmesan fries which the menu didn't specify. They changed the menu from the previous time I was there and I think the burgers were even better than they were when I was there last. They may just be my favorite burgers in Charlotte. I'd highly recommend checking it out! Plus as an added perk you get 7% cash back with Yelp cash back."}
{"text":"The pub burger was delicious and cooked to perfection, and the herbs and Parmesan on the fries were fabulous. Our server, Jason, was definitely on point as well. However, a beer there is $6, which is a bit overpriced (though I definitely appreciate that they had Black Mocha Stout on tap--that's unusual) and the portions were a bit dinky for the price. For $15 for a burger and fries, I should be questioning whether or not I can finish it, not being surprised to realize that half the space in the fry container is filled with paper rather than fries.  If it were a  $10 plate, it would be an excellent  $10 meal, plus drinks, but it's just not special enough to merit the price. And the cocktail menu and the decor just look like they are trying too hard."}
{"text":"Did y'all know that The Liberty did brunch? And if you *did* know, why didn't you tell me? To be honest, this was actually my first time coming to The Liberty, so now I have to come back for their other meals to get a rounded experience, but their brunch impressed me. We had a group of 6 come in for a late brunch (1pm) and the place was pretty empty - great for groups and relatively quiet! $3 pretty strong mimosas started off the table, which I think is a good deal!  Our table ordered a smattering of items, but I got the English Breakfast on a Bun, which is not the same as Breakfast on an English Muffin. My mistake. BUT it came and it was delicious. I don't like runny yolks if my dish is not an eggs benedict, so I ordered it with eggs over hard, and man it was so good! Our server was attentive, which was good because there weren't that many other people there ha.  The Lady actually ordered a salad and added salmon, which she said was absolutely excellent. The good brunch experience will definitely drive me to come back for a burger, which all looked AWESOME. I'll be back, probably with a group."}
{"text":"Terrible service. No one was even in the restaurant so the hostess sat me right away but apparently did not let anyone know they had a table. So I sat and sat. Then a waitress noticed me as she waited on the only other table in the restaurant and promptly ran off. I left after waiting 15 to even be greeted. Should have closed this location, not the South End one."}
{"text":"The food is okay and edible here if you don't mind having barely any seasoning on it. We ordered a chicken wrap, chicken sandwich, chili, and a beef burger. I'll give 3 stars for the food though. The service is not good here. Our waitress had an attitude that was shown on her face, and a sarcastic tone out of her. We waited awhile for her to take our orders and to come back to grab our check. Maybe retrain your employees.   If she doesn't like her job then try to find something that's more appealing. I would give no stars for service if I could. Thought of not leaving a tip, but realized that the cooks in the back get a share of it."}
{"text":"I came here 2 weeks ago with a friend and the food was great. Tried to come back today for a much-planned date and was greeted with locked doors at 9:15, though your listing claims proudly to be open until 1:00am. Hire a marketing person to keep your listings current, please. #frustratedandhungry"}
{"text":"Love this place!    I come back to The Liberty time and time again.  I really enjoy the chilled out vibe of the place and, of course, the great beer selection.  The beer selection isn't as huge as some other places.  But the liberty does seem to have a constantly changing mix of interesting and hard to find beer options.  The service has consistently been fast and friendly.    I really should branch out more, but I seem to order the mussels and the pub burger every time I dine here.  There are reasons for this.  Because both are outstanding and the best that you will find in Charlotte, IMO.  I have had many of the other appetizers and have consistently been very happy with everything that I have ordered."}
{"text":"My in laws decided to visit us from Lenoir in what had to be over 10 years.  So, we decided to take them to Tupelo Honey for brunch, thinking that it might make the drive worth it.  However, TH had a wait that was over an hour.   We walked next door to The Liberty, which had absolutely no line.  That concerned me a little at first. But, no need to worry.  We were greeted by an extremely nice, upbeat server.  He took our drink orders, water for them, unsweetened ice tea with lemon for me.   The menu was meat heavy for a vegetarian.  However, there were doable options.  My husband got the black bean burger with a side of Mac and cheese.  I sneaked a taste of the macaroni's sauce.  Velvety creaminess. I ordered the chef salad with no chicken or bacon.  It feature quacamole, cucumbers, hard boiled eggs and blue cheese with a tangy dressing.  Very fresh.  Just what I wanted. My father in law got the fish and chips.  Presentation was spectacular, complete with decorative metal containers and red checked napkins.  My mother in law got a salad with chicken. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  My father in law complained about the price tag, but he is used to eating in Lenoir, which is a smaller city and features a lot of fast food. So, hats off to The Liberty!  You came through when I needed you.  Happy meal with the in laws.  And, I am not talking McDonald's."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. Lackluster in every way. Uninteresting menu. Overpriced burgers. Cold atmosphere. Service was ok but nobody really acted like they cared if we were there or not. 3 burgers, 2 glasses wine, and tip $72. Next time I'll go to five guys."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Met a friend at 2:30 and the restaurant was pretty empty. It has a huge bar area which was great. I had the pretzels and Nashville hot chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken was amazing! It was so juicy I almost didn't need the sauces I asked to get on the side. The service was great as well. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"3.5 Woooow....such a variety of reviews for this restaurant.  It seems to have quite a polarizing effect on people!!  I haven't seen such a \"mix\" of reviews on very many establishments so I was definitely interested to see what was happening over at good ole' Liberty!  I had to give this place 3.5 because my husband and I had two different experiences even though we were together.  So, my review represents both the people who love this place and the people who could take it or leave it.  However, take my review with a grain of salt for the following reasons:  1.  It was restaurant week and I tend to find the quality lacks for most places during this week...just my opinion 2.  It was restaurant week so they had a limited menu...I didn't see quite a few of the mentioned items on this version of their menu so I wasn't given a fair chance 3.  We aren't big drinkers and beer is not my thing so I am sure I was a disgrace to the waitress staff and the restaurant overall.  I am sure you are wondering why the heck I was at a gastropub but that's irrelevant.  That's like people who get mad at me when I wear heels even though I am almost 5'11 barefoot...why shouldn't I get to enjoy a nice pair of shoes because I am tall?  Don't hate.  I was there for the food, not the beer.   With all that said...we tried the pretzels...very good.  They were what a big fat pretzel should have been though.  They were thicker than other places but not quite as buttery...they had a good flavor though.  The cheese fondue was a little bland and the spicy mustard cleared up my congestion so that was cool with me.  I was advised to try the hanger steak (meat of the day).  I was told they grind their own meat in-house so that was an impressive sell that forced me to go with some type of meat.  The hanger steak was medium rare but it was truly mooing at me.  It was chewy, fatty and just flat out not that great.  It wasn't awful but it just wasn't great.  The fries were pretty yummy, crispy and thick cut so I enjoyed those!  My husband tried the only burger being offered for the night.  I think it was just called the pub burger.  He said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had.  And he is actually a burger snob.  He said it was full of flavor, it was super juicy (it was dripping so that I could tell) and just cooked to absolute perfection!  Great!!  The service was so-so.  It took our waitress a cool 30 minutes before she cracked a smile but she was pretty efficient.  The food came out super quick which was actually a little concerning.  It made me wonder if they nuked the whole dish but whatever.  There were other menu items I would like to try but I am not racing back this weekend or anything.  I think they have a really cool environment and would obviously be heaven for beer lovers....  I would certainly return but it may be a little while."}
{"text":"I want to love the Liberty, I really do. I want to be able to appreciate the beer selection (which is pretty amazing at times), I want to enjoy the food, but ugh, I just can't. Between lunch hours, dinner parties, and just a few nights at the bar... it's a mess. (and if it wasn't less than a mile from my house, I probably wouldn't have gone back after the second run)  On the off chance I have decent table service, I get uninteresting food (or they're \"out\" of my first two choices and I have to opt for a random choice) - if I want an awesome beer they've posted they have on tap, I get an uninterested bartender. Why, oh why? The specials always sound amazing but something always falls short. Now, the bar has become so depressing (even on the weekend) that the bartenders have given up and would rather finish texting a few friends than greet you as you're sitting down and settling in.   I get it, I've done it, maybe you've given up because you think people just stop in for a bite or a good drink before they join the masses at another bar that doesn't have half the beer selection, or anything close to the food potential - but if you make my experience worth sticking around for, I probably will. Unfortunately it seems likes no one cares. I can't get my bartender to check in on me until my pint glass has sat empty, or my server to come by the table during a dead lunch hour. Seriously, even if your food is phenomenal and you've got the \"best burger\" in town - why even bother?"}
{"text":"After two recent visits to The Liberty, everything is just okay. I guess I expected more, based on the reviews and menu, but haven't been too impressed so far.  My most recent visit, I was alone and was seated in the bar at a booth.  Maybe because I was alone and only ordered a soda, my waitress decided to ignore me. After ordering a bowl of soup, Butternut Squash, and the Pub Burger, cooked medium, the evening went down hill.  Less than 10 minutes after ordering my burger and fries were delivered, no soup.  Took one bite and the burger was rare, and when I mean rare, it was still mooing'. I was able to flag my waitress down and show her my burger, of which she wasn't too nice that I was sending it back. I expressed \"medium\", pink in the middle.  Needless to say, still no soup. After another 10 minutes a new burger came out, well done.  Horrible.  Was so disappointed and basically didn't say anything. Ate what I could and asked for my check. I also asked my waitress to make sure the soup was not included, since I never received it. And, she said, oh, yeah, I will.  Really?  At this point I have too many other places I like their burgers and definitely have received better service at. Not sure I would return back anytime soon, which I hate because it is so close to home."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food's great and the patio atmosphere is awesome. Loved the live music! Totally coming pack."}
{"text":"I loved the Liberty until they changed the menu last week. I went with some co-workers looking forward to the fried chicken salad in all of its glory and came to discover it replaced by poutine, a weird meat and potatoes thing and an over bearing burger menu. The simple and easy menu has been replaced by a nightmare! My food was not good either - I immediately regretted eating and my stomach hurt for the rest of the day. Liberty, I beg you - go back to your old menu?!! The new one is terrible, long, exhausting, confusing and makes me want to cry."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here expecting a similar experience to the one in South End - don't make the same mistake.  Expectations or not, this place was not worth it.    The place is new - so it's clean, and looks upscale.  The bar area looked nice and welcoming, the tables set on a beautiful stained concrete floor, the lighting was dark - too dark really - and the bathrooms looked fancy.  The waitress was friendly - not super fast, but fine.    That's where the positives end.  The ambiance is really bad once you try to have any sort of conversation - it is WAY TOO LOUD!  You have to yell to have any hope of communication with the person next to you.  Even speaking to the waitress was difficult.  I ordered a lamb burger, my wife a grilled chicken sandwich - both with parmesan cheese fries.  Sounded tasty.  When the food arrived - the burger came on the gimmick board with a cutout for a small cup of fries.    The fries tasted fine, but they weren't anything special - the same as baking some frozen bagged fries from the store and sprinkling garlic and parmesan seasoning on them.  My burger was very boring - seeing how it was seasoned lamb with feta cheese and some weird sauce - it was boring.  I was very let down.  My wife's chicken sandwich was dry, flat, and tasteless.  Ketchup was the best part of the meal.    To top it off - the fancy automatic sinks in the bathrooms would not come on - after smacking them, one started working - but then wouldn't shut-off.   My wife said she had the same issue in the women's bathroom too.  So much for handwashing taking place here.  Even the beer prices are ridiculous, so even heading back there to visit the bar seems unlikely.    Don't waste your time or money - Chili's has the same quality food."}
{"text":"By far one of my stand by go-to's for the Queen City.  Always good - never disappointed!  Great burgers.  Love the salmon entree.  Fries are amazing.  But if you are anywhere near this place with a sweet tooth, do yourself a favor and get a Salted Caramel Budino.  It will change your life."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  Both times have been really nice.   The first was when I went here for a late drink one evening with friends.  They got appetizers and I didn't feel the need at that hour to see if they had gluten free food so I just got a drink.  It was delicious with St. Germain and pear vodka.  Our waitress was attentive even though it was near closing (but not so attentive that we felt pushed out).  The second time was with out of town visitors.  There was a long line at Tupelo Honey (no surprise there) so we checked out the Liberty and it turns out they can make tons of things gluten free.  They were so on top of it.  I got a delicious London burger and had the pimento cheese appetizer.  I asked for the crackers to be on a separate plate so that my family could eat them after I scooped out how much I wanted-they did that.  They prepped my burger perfectly and I did not have to be worried that they had just pulled off the bun and called it \"gluten free\" (a celiac's nightmare).  The food was delectable, the environment was pretty nice, though we sat inside on a beautiful day and it was a bit dark in there, and our waitress was great.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Back to the Liberty after two years, we sat outside on the patio that has a great view of the parking lot and South Boulevard, occasionally punctuated by the fire department across the street. But that's not really their fault.  I opted for the pub burger, which arrived medium rare as ordered. Dripping, messy and delicious. A nice sized patty, plenty of cheese and bacon and grilled onions on a large toasted bun. Yummy.  The mac and cheese with it (I seem to be on a mac & cheese tear lately) was tangy and delicious and still bubbling hot when it arrived at the table.  Good selection of beers including an IPA that I've never had before that was very tasty. Service was decent and friendly."}
{"text":"Some of my co-workers and I headed over to The Liberty for lunch yesterday.  We arrived around 12:15 and the parking lot was fairly packed, but upon entering the building, seating still seemed plentiful.  We were seated on the right side in the bar area.  Our waitress greeted us and took our drink orders.  Kudos to any wait staff who are good enough to ask whether or not you want a lemon in your water or tea.  As one who doesn't like lemon, I appreciate people who ask (our waitress asked).  We decided on the blue cheese potato chips and the pickles as appetizers.  There were only four pickles in the serving and they were served raw.  They're house-made and the general consensus was that they were tasty.  A far bigger hit was the chips which were served warm with blue cheese melted over them.  They were quite tasty.  And that's coming from someone who doesn't like blue cheese.  Our entrees arrived fairly quickly.  I ordered the chicken sandwich, which came with avocado, pepper jack cheese, fried onions, and a chipotle aioli.  I had the Parmesan-herb fries.  The sandwich was big and it was a pretty good sandwich.  Lots of nice flavor coming through, particularly with the pepperjack and the aioli.  The fries were plentiful and were served in a metal cup.  However, they were a little too salty for my taste.  Perhaps because they season them with salt as well as with the Parmesan?  The service was great and I will consider coming back again to try the lamb burger or perhaps their chicken and dumplings.  I probably won't order the fries, but I'm open to trying the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Burgers and beer galore!  This place has quite the selection of both, plus a full cocktail list and other great dishes that aren't burgers.  Including Bangers and Mash... Mmmmmm!    I have dined both on the restaurant side and the pub self seating side, and haven't been disappointed in either!  Been sat as a two-top, and also as a large birthday dinner group, and still great service!  A minor downside is the parking situation.  As with all South End restaurants in the area, there is a private lot but it fills up soo quickly.  As an alternative, take the Lynx Blue Line to the East/West Blvd station and you are less than a block walk!  If you are a burger fan, this place is the self proclaimed \"Best Burger in Town.\"  I haven't found a reason to disagree with their claim.  Though I will keep trying around burger places to see if they can be de-throned! :)"}
{"text":"2.5  If you left Rock Bottom wishing you had paid more money for your food, then The Liberty can fill that void.  Paid $7 for two soft pretzels and a thimble full of beer cheese.  For the main course: $18 for a bowl of fries with some steak mixed in.  Also, I usually like a $6 dessert to be larger than the credit card I am paying for it with.  Service isn't bad. Value isn't there."}
{"text":"I really like the food here.  Why the one star you say? Because the parking situation makes me so aggravated that I will never come back.  One little lot & the valet parking is only for Tupelo Honey?  Ugh.  I'm sorry, but getting into the restaurant is part of the experience for me so again, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The Liberty is a great place with a nice beer and cocktail list. I've been here a number of times and have had a few different menu items, including burgers and special event menus. The special menus (Restaurant Week, Easter brunch, etc) are nice - you get a lot for the money and the menu items are different from the standard menu.   I 100% always recommend ordering the Salted Caramel Budino - its rich and delicious!   Atmosphere is very warm, cozy and beer-centric (its a gastro pub after all!) - good for a romantic meal or a group dinner (8-12 people).  I'd say the service can be lacking, depending on who you get - but nothing glaring, in my opinion."}
{"text":"The most boring atmosphere ever. Didn't even have music playing in the background which is very noticeable when you don't.  Staff much more interested in looking at their phones.  I asked our server how many oz the burgers were, she had no idea.  We had one beer and  half-way thru our our burgers, our glasses were empty.  She checked on us when we were done eating. The burgers were very good, I'm disappointed in everything else.  Better go now cuz this place won't be open for long."}
{"text":"Getting seated as soon as you walk in sure makes me feel special. Sitting around for 15 minutes before the waitress even acknowledges you though, quickly negates all positive impressions.  While I really like the decor; Modern Americana you can say, I am not very fond of the service one bit. That lack of fondness doesn't just draw from one visit, but several and all have been far from spectacular.   When we get to the food, plating is pretty nice. Prep though leaves me at a crossroad. No 1. Everything is over sauced. Calamari came drenched, not drizzled, but drenched in their curry dipping sauce, thus making the strips soggy and chewy. The Steak was soaked in a red wine reduction. While tasty it was, I prefer my steak landlocked not swimming for it's life.   Secondly, the pork chop was medium rare when we asked for well. I know some folks eat their pork medium, but surely not this guy. Forgive my ignorance, but well and medium rare are a few degrees apart I thought? To give them a little credit it was a very fat and generous cut. Buuuuut with that size of cut, you'd think they have it right by now?  Needless to say, I think I'll give it another few months before I come back."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to chill.  We went for St Patty's day and they actually had an Irish bagpipe troupe playin songs.  I didn't know Irish had bagpipes, so that was a learning experience for me. They have an outside patio but I've never been out there.  The inside is pretty spacious and you can easily get a long table for a decent sized group.  The few times we've been there we've had at least 8 or more. Their drink selection is good. and so is their food.  Everything on the menu looks good, and I believe they just changed it so we will be back soon.  It is more of a bar than a restaurant, however they have a good selection of meals to round out the night.  It does get loud, but that's expected.  Plenty of parking in the lot behind too."}
{"text":"I had Southern crunch burger, it was a mess, but good. The best burger I had in Charlotte so far. The beer selection looked good on the menu, but appeared that they didn't have 3 kinds that we wanted, so it was frustrating. Overall, I think it's a cool pub to hang out, interesting design."}
{"text":"Always love the beer and food.  Last time, we had the Pretzels, Chicken tenders for my daughter, Pub Burger and Short ribs.  Everything was great."}
{"text":"The bartender was way more interested in trying to entertain or pick up the women at the bar. Couldn't take his time to refill my water let alone my drink. Way too loud"}
{"text":"My latest visit to The Liberty was quite different than the last two.  There were 5 of us at on of the pub tables in the bar area.  This area is under the bartender's watch.    The bartender eventually came to get a drink order but it took forever for the drinks to arrive.  One person ordered food but she missed that and didn't seem to care if the rest of us wanted to order.  When one person asked for the check, she put everyone's drinks on it, assuming all of us were leaving.  Talk about clueless!  This was a different bartender than my last visit. The experiences between that visit and this visit was quite different.  I also noticed the menu has changed and I am not sure it really appeals to me.  Lamb Pho?  If i wanted Pho, I'd go to one of the Vietnamese places down the street.    The one plus about this place is the beer selection.  But what good is a beer selection when the bartender has no clue?"}
{"text":"Good food, okay atmosphere. Ordered takeout for two, had a local beer at the bar while I waited. Has an older crowd feel. Bar looks outdated and a little messy."}
{"text":"Burger was fabulous!   The side salad with the lemon dressing very good, too!  The outdoor patio very nice for being in the Blakeney shopping area.  The issues with this restaurant are more organization and staffing issue.  The waiter was friendly and attentive but forgot a number of items.  My husbands burger has the wrong toppings.  I think all of this was due to the waiter being rushed.  The menus were dirty and stained.  Definitely need to re-print."}
{"text":"To be honest, I always thought the Liberty was okay.  The service is okay; and I find the dining areas a bit uncomfortable  and awkward.   I know they're known as the place of great beef burgers. However, I recently disccovered a delicious pimento cheese ground chicken burger that they have.  It was delicious and juicy and more imaginative than the typical chicken filet sandwich, so with that dish alone that place scored some points with me."}
{"text":"I LOVE the \"Famous Crunch Burger\"!  It is a bit expensive but it is well worth it.  The Chips inside the Burger hit the nail on the head!  If you wash it down with an OMB Copper your taste buds will be saying \"Thank you sir!  May I have another!\""}
{"text":"Been twice. Both times sitting at the bar for lunch and a beer (or two). First trip I had their version of fish and chips. It was properly beer-battered and crispy with malt vinegar and a good tartar sauce available. Well executed at least by Charlotte standards.   This trip had a blue cheese wedge salad and a \"plain burger\". Not sure how I was able to order a medium rare burger in this repressive (by burger temp) state but I was ecstatic about it. Came out as ordered, well charred on the outside and MR on the inside.  Salad was good and fresh with good BC dressing and crumbles on the side.   All and all two trips and two good meals. Certainly four star worthy."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is jumping mid day afternoon. We had to circle a few times just to find somewhere to park. In the past I just so happened to eat here when the lunch crowd cleared out for the afternoon, so I never noticed.  I started off with the Libertini- it was smooth, a little sweet and definitely dangerous if you drink too many. I don't like to have endless cocktails while eating, so I only had one. I definitely recommend.  Usually I don't have burgers with pimento cheese, but I was feeling adventurous and the house made chips on the burger made it a must try. I'm glad my lunch companion is someone I've know for a while, because this isn't a burger to eat on a date! It's big and juicy and crunchy. I had to wipe my mouth after each bite. It was glorious! Back and forth between a burger and their creamy Mac and cheese....this meal was just what I needed today. There's nothing as sad as beautiful Mac in a hot cast iron skillet that tastes bland. Yuck! Certainly not the case here.   Great burger place"}
