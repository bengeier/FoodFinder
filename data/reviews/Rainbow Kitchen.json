{"text":"I have to admit, I came in for Filipino food coz this used to be one ...but I went ahead anyway and delighted to know its Cantonese chinese food. The wonton is the best tasting and freshness I've ever had in vegas in 18+years! For real ! Hope it stay this way :)  I had mine with rice noodles and for a huge bowl at this freshness below $7 is a REAL STEAL to me !! Tofu super crispy outside and soft inside and not even greasy ! 
...lastly to see all the chinese people walking in one after another at early noon hours just go to show this is a real Authentic chinese cooked food similar to those in Chinatown but right in your neighborhood 
Think they need to do a cart Dim Sum here !"}
{"text":"I don't take the time to make reviews very often, being on the road a lot, I don't have the time to rate everywhere I eat. I happened upon this place accidentally, it was open, VERY clean, appealing, so I stopped and ate. Upon sitting thy serve you complimentary tea. It was a nice touch but also a great tea. I decided to order the beef chow fun. The beef was tender, flavorful and could cut with a fork. Noodles were perfect! My son had the Pork Shoulder with pickled vegetables, tender, melt in your mouth kind of dish.. the light broth that it was served in.. incredible.. !! Never had either dish before and we would order it again. I recommend this place omg if you want flavorful, robust flavors that are not drowned in soy sauce."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. A bit pricey. I ordered one entree; it was $13.99, after tip and tax it almost cost me $20. My friend told me it was good so I took his advice. Next time I will go the extra mile to China Town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese food restaurant! I always get the seafood pa fried noodle, young chow fried rice, pork chop Peking style. Great food and glad it's close to home."}
{"text":"My wife is from Beijing. She approved this restaurant very authentic Chinese food! The best Chinese food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tasty! I tried scallops with cashews. Veggies were fresh, scallops were like butter. I was going to take a pic but I gobbled it down.
I saw they have several tanks for live lobsters & fishes.  I will go back to try out something new next time."}
{"text":"Traditional chinese food in the SW part of town.  About time!  Sits in a prime area off Rainbow and Robindale amongst lots of competition of asian fare.  

They have live fish and BBQ which in my almost dozen times I've been here have been always fresh and not day over left overs or frozen."}
{"text":"Tried this new place and overall, the whole experience was inadequate!  Had the Beef with Black Bean Sauce - too salty!  Onchoy with Shrimp paste - too salty!  Seafood claypot garnished with rotten/yellowish cilantro!  Wrong order of noodles served as well! No water refill that's too chlorinated- tap water for sure!  The older lady 3 times was gonna serve the wrong dishes!  Finally, given the wrong check as well! Mind you, keep expectations low when in Chinese eateries coz oftentimes, they're underwhelming in service department more so than your Kung Pao Chicken!  5 stars reviews on this place is just appalling and seriously inexperienced!  Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Yes! A Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas that doesn't suck. We got the beef chow fun ?????), the salted fish, chicken, and tofu clay pot (????????, and  some bright red sweet meat dish - maybe sweet and sour? Mom claims the chow fun is her test of a restaurant, since it is hard to make well. The noodles were the right chewiness, didn't stick in clumps, and and the flavor met our smoky wok expectations. The clay pot was great - the right level of saltiness and very nicely presented. The sweet pork dish was very sweet. Not my cup of tea, but Dad enjoyed it. 

Pros: 
- Large, clean restaurant 
- Well-executed dishes 
- Unexpectedly good service for a Chinese restaurant - our tea was constantly refilled, the guy stopped to ask how the food was 

Cons:
- The menu is dominated by Americanized Chinese dishes, so dining options are a bit scarce if you're looking for authentic Chinese food 
- The guy was a bit dour. Cracking a smile wouldn't hurt. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place.. English is not very good, but the food is fabulous. The first time I ordered, the lady didn't understand me. Whatever I ended up with was delicious. I have gone back since, as has my family. Highly recommend,,,,,"}
{"text":"All seafood dishes are awesome in here! My family and I really love this place! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I was glad to find out that there's an authentic Chinese Restaurant close by my house! Our waitress was very kind and attentive. I ordered the salt and pepper crab which was so delicious! The clams with Aberdeen sauce was a little spicy, but it was still pretty good. The golden roasted chicken was amazing; it was very juicy and flavorful. Also I was surprised that the food arrived to our table so quick. Overall this was truly a pleasant experience and I'll most likely be coming back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I was very hopeful that it would be a great authentic Cantonese restaurant with all good Yelp reviews but it just isn't.  I was not very impress with the four dishes that we ordered ( kung pao chicken, soy sauce chicken, clam with black bean sauce and snow leaf with garlic). Very mediocre. They do give house soup and red bean dessert for free, but that's not enough for me to return."}
{"text":"This place is bland. I ordered to go because the place was empty. I never had a Chinese restaurant be so slow to prepare my food. When I got home the sauces leaked out of the containers into the bag making it a mess to handle . I couldn't be more disappointed in the taste of the food. I don't think I will be going back. If you gave me a choice between Rainbow Kitchen and Panda Express, I'll take Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Haven't found a go to spot yet for Chinese here in Las Vegas which is off the LV strip. This place is pretty good. Customer service is good. When I was first seated the table tops of some
Of the booths had big cracks to point where the table tops were coming apart. I just simply asked them to move us. Food was really good. We had Salted Fish and Chicken Fried rice. I am a fan of the salted fish, but it maybe a little overbearing for some. We also had the honey walnut shrimp which was really good and also the Salted Pepper Pork Chops! Delicious! I would definitely go back again. Prices where about in line, but I would suggest they add lunch specials. I believe it would drive more traffic to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very delicious Chinese cuisine, not your typical quick Chinese panda express food made on the fly! You will pay a little more but it is worth every penny considering everything is made to order and you can taste the quality of their dishes. You will not be disappointed for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good service. Went on Wednesday night, had 3 other families eating.  Both kids wanted juice but they only have soda, which they don't drink. We weren't expecting to have the server walk to next door store to buy juices. Food was pretty good. It's southwest version of joyful house Chinatown, but without the far drive. Authentic Asian food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends on a COLD Wednesday evening. My friend has been wanting to come here since this one opened. I and another friend had came here previously and had pretty good experience. 

She wanted a specific style of cooked crab which is directly translated to \"typhoon shelter crab\" but in Cantonese, its \"bei fung tong\" style. Its a style where the crab is lightly battered and fried, topped and quickly tossed in a mountain of chopped garlic and chili. Their style had a slightly sweet sauce tossed with the crab (similar to something like the thai style sweet chili sauce) with the garlic and chili. Technically this item isn't on the menu but still critiquing their version of it anyway. Crab itself was a decent size. The meat texture was a bit soft, usually meaning its not so fresh. The first time I came here, the meat texture was perfectly fresh. Super good. This time was a bit disappointing. Flavor wise, it was pretty good. Tho the sweet chili sauce was kind of different because I believe the normal version is more of a dry style seasoned with salt n pepper. The garlic was still yummy but the chilis were not spicy at all.

Aside from the crab, we had ordered fermented bean curd chili on choy, soy sauce chicken (because a review said it was good), and sweet and sour pork chop. 

Fermented bean curd with sliced chili On choy is a favorite of my friends and we typically order it almost every time we go to a Chinese restaurant. Good amount and flavored well. Same about the chilis not being spicy but at least overall it was good. 

Sweet and sour pork chop... is sweet n sour pork chop... XD our uh not Chinese friend (but still Asian... tryin not to name names here...) still enjoyed it. 

Soy sauce chicken was probably the most disappointing one. Amount was small even for a half order. Meat was tough. Not sure what kind of chicken they use. I'd assume its the frozen type but judging by size, it may be a range-free one. The flavor of the soy sauce they use was a little less sweet than from what I'm used to (great to mix with plain white rice.. XD). 

Aside from the 4 dishes we ordered, we were served with their house soup which I believe was a winter melon soup and a red bean soup dessert at the end of our meal. The soup was good though they didn't ask if we wanted more of the soup. (it was a cold evening and i was super hungry after work as i had not eating since before work like 11 hours prior) The red bean soup was a bit thin and the red bean were all completely masserated"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food!! Have been there a couple times, stir fried pork neck, glazed pork belly n poached chicken in soy sauce are really good!! Worth the price n friend staff. Excelltente:)"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly down to earth with all their dishes. I've come here with my family on several occasions already and the food and service was excellent each time.

You really can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Space:
There were a lot of tables for parties that are big or small. They are not limited in space!

Service:
They had a friendly staff who were very tentative! 

Price:
$38 for 2 lobsters (worth it!) instead of charging by pound. 

Food: 
They gave free red bean soup at the end which was delicious. Also, they give bowls of rice (so filling!) we couldn't finish all of it. They are very much family styled."}
{"text":"It's a good Chinese restaurant away from Chinatown and the best one in Southwest. Better the 3rd time around. First time I ordered a beef and chicken dish and they were pink. This time I made sure to tell Amy our server everything well done. I ordered the Hong Kong pan fried noodles- perfect. The salt and pepper pork could use some jalapeño slices for kick, the orange chicken was not breaded that's good and fish filet in black bean sauce. Nothing was overly salted which I hate when I leave a Chinese restaurant with swollen hands. Good taste. Need a better tea. Can be more tidy on the menu and tables felt sticky. Amy was a good server- fast and busy for one person to handle the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood. Ordered the duck here for takeout over the phone and service was great. Porridge was not as thick as I liked, I think they needed to let it slow cook for longer to get the flavor in. I like how they have live lobster in the tank even if it's a little pricey so will definitely order that next time when I get a craving. It was packed when we went on a Wednesday night around 7pm.

If they had good dimsum on the weekends, I would be so happy!"}
{"text":"The food is good... but the organization and customer service is terrible and proportion size of food is inconsistent. Mind you...we are regulars and it's after the 3rd time the same thing happened that I'm sitting here with my elders complaining and disastisfied the entire meal that I am writing this. Not a pleasant dining experience if you ask me. 

We are the first party to arrive and our waitress sees more parties rolling in she advises us to hurry with our order so we can get our ticket in first.... after she puts it in more parties continue to arrive and sit down. Then both chefs took turns walking out to greet the table next to us (they walked in way after us)... and soon as the food is coming out... about 4 tables (all who came after us) got their food... some of which was also on our list. The waitress  helps us ask and she said they thought they already made everything on our list.... well okay then but when our stuff comes out its made half assedly compared to other tables and wasnt even enough to give each adult 1 piece. We had 7 adults and the dish only had 5 pieces of \"fresh yam\" (not even a premium ingredient). Also 2 of the dishes we ordered was distinctively less than the last time we ordered it... and for the price it really didnt seem worth it. All the waitress could do for us was apologize and say she can't say anything to the chefs or she will get yelled at. 

What's worse is that there is no management on staff and no one could address our issue. And some other waitress who isn't even servicing us butts in to say we can't help you we only deliver the food as it comes out. Not like we can give you their food.... (but like i mentioned a few of those things were the same ones we ordered.) 

I really hope someone takes the time to read this. Its the third time the same thing happened where everyone after us gets their food and our table is forgotten... all we hear are excuses and no compensation for our wasted time. We brought our kids to dine too... we were lucky they had more patience tonight than most nights. We really like the food and flavors you make but we will not be coming back for a while. Good luck."}
{"text":"Service is terrible!!! Had to ask for water, napkins and refills! Food is mediocre for being away from China town. Do yourself a favor and drive 10 extra mins for half the price!"}
{"text":"So excited to have a Chinese restaurant open in this area that is not fast food! The place is right next to Lee's, spacious and clean. Good for large parties. 

Tea was brought out as soon as we sat, but the tea was very bland, tasted nothing. Our waitress was very nice, answered questions and made recommendations, thumbs up for the fact that they have staff that speaks English unlike other Chinese restaurants around town. 

We ordered egg drop soup which was pretty good,, very light and healthy. We got soy sauce chicken which was really flavorful but the half chicken was pretty small for the price. Stir fried green beans and snow peas were both very good, great flavors and the veggies tasted very fresh. 

The pork shoulder with veggies looked good was tasted ok, too sweet for my taste. Clams with black bean sauce was good but lots of shells and very little actual clams (like most places)! 

The stand out item was hands down the Walnut shrimp. The shrimps were crispy, sauce was delicious, nuts wee sweet and crunchy and nicely played with very fresh broccoli (these broccoli were probably the greenest broccoli I have ever seen)! 

The only complaint is that typical of a Chinese place, the food did not all come out at the same time. We were Amati finished with our meal when the pork shoulder was brought out. 

Overall we ordered 8 dishes and the check came out under $100! Really good prices! Impressed with the place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a Chinese restaurant that's close to home and not deal with Spring Mtn road. I usually come here with my parents a few times a month for dinner. We've ordered various dishes including pork with Peking sauce, clams with black bean sauce, various vegetables such as sautéed green beans, and ong choy with fermented beans. We've also tried lobster cooked different styles. My favorite has to be the clams cooked in black bean sauce. I think the flavor is on point every time we get it. The restaurant is clean and I like the service here better than some of the other Chinese restaurants. Overall, I will continue to come back here because I do like the food and it's nice that it's close to where I live :)"}
{"text":"Totally a random stop - was craving some soup and seafood. Great service and flavours. Portions were better than expected. They do have fresh fish - live fish tank. Thought: Owners could spend on upgrading the fish tank! The server was very helpful."}
{"text":"It was my brother in laws birthday celebration I'm so sick to my stomach we found a roach in our food! My 1st dining in and I've gotten take out once before... was thinking food was good but I will not ever return again...the employee said they will give us 1 dish for free but WTF they shall Comp our whole meal for that! I'm in shock right now... I know things happen... but when you say one meal for free it's like NO!!! You shouldn't charge a customer when roach is in the food!!! I pray that health district reads this and also hope that the will get an exterminator to spray their restaurant! I still think that they should have comped the whole bill for this incident but instead 5 needs was taken off the bill per my sister ask for that instead of 1 free dish!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to spot for when we can't decide what Asian cuisine we want. Food is very flavorful (so is MSG, ha ha ha) but that's commonplace in many Asian dishes. I'm kind of disappointed though, because their XO string beans turned out differently the last time I ordered it. It was so gingery and didn't have any minced meat in it. Usually, it's very garlicky and comes with minced meat (pork, maybe). So since the last time, I've been afraid to order it again. Not sure if they changed it or it was the case of a different cook. Other than that, it doesn't stop me from frequenting their place. We usually order the honey walnut shrimp and salt & pepper fish."}
{"text":"Food did not disappoint!  Friendly staff.  Typically, I have to drive to or near China Town to get this type of authentic food preparation.  So glad to have found this place close to home.  Will definitely add to my rotation"}
{"text":"I really liked 2 lobsters for $32 deal. Used to get it with other dishes for 2go because I have a 18months old boy. And it's much easier eating at home since my kid likes to run around. Called today they said lobster is now $38. I. Said ok. Then the worker goes my boss just said you have to order 2 additional dishes. If it's a set rule, I understand. But it seem like they were just coming up with this. Like making my food was like a hassle for them. So I said no thank you."}
{"text":"Delicious Delicious Delicious
Another great place to grab some bomb bomb bomb authentic Chinese food! 
Service was super quick, Tuesday night- the tea came out about 5 min after we sat down and full round of water for 5 people. 
Mom was dying to try this place because of the lobster deal- 2 large lobster for $38. 

1) 2 garlic ginger lobsters- $38
2) pan fried noodle with shrimp and vegetables $8
3) salt and pepper pork chops $8.99
4) schetwan eggplant
5) hot and soup soup 8.99$

I think they use Ajinamoto/MSG here because wow, I've been here twice and wow I drank 3 glasses of water each time. And I'm writing this 1 hour after eating and wow, am I parched and craving water.
But still food is delicious, environment is clean, service is fast."}
{"text":"I would not recommend going here. My dad took me here and the first thing that was disturbing I saw here was the environment.It was dirty. The next thing that was gross here was the water. It was foggy and had a dead maggot in it. The worst thing was the roaches! Yes, about 5 roaches were in the same place. I think this was the worst restaurant I've ever been to. If you think this sounds good you try. Now my stomach hurts!! It's most likely food poisoning"}
{"text":"Food was delicious , clean and fresh! Environment is warm welcoming and super clean. Good for family and friends to get together, enjoy the real Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I come here occasionally with my family and what I LOVE most about this place is that the food quality remains consistent. When this place first opened the food was very inconsistent and the workers were all scrambled and confused not knowing what to do. Now there is a whole new set of workers. Also, the prices are pretty low considering the dishes are huge. Much like most Chinese restaurants, every order comes with complimentary soup, complimentary dessert, white rice, and tea. Just like every Chinese restaurant, if you don't see an item on the menu, you can request it and they'll make it. I've ordered Chow Fun with scrambled eggs and shrimp (which isn't on the menu, but if you request it, they'll make it). My two favorite dishes would probably be the clams with black bean sauce and the salt and pepper pork chops. If you've never tried authentic Chinese food I would definitely give this restaurant a try. Some popular dishes I would recommend for first timers that have never tried Chinese food would be: Dry Beef Chow Fun, salt and pepper pork chops, or clams with black bean sauce. The menu has lots of items to choose from and the popular dishes have pictures of the item on the menu. Overall, this is a really good restaurant that isn't located in Chinatown. Only reason for the 4 star rating is that the workers can be inattentive sometimes and sometimes leave dirty tables out and the garbage tray out. 

Pros:

+Food is consistent in quality and portion size is big

+Price of the food is low for the portion size

+Very spacious 


Cons:

-Workers can be inattentive sometimes"}

{"text":"i've been craving salted fish and chicken fried rice. which is in their menu. i asked our server three times and confirm our order. yet. she gave us chicken fried rice and salted fish fillet.  her reasoning was cuz she's just new and she does not know if they serve it.told her it's in their menu.. i like the food. but disappointed with the customer service. will order from someone who understands english fluently. sorry to be an asshole. but i asked 3 times and confirm. she kept saying yes. i didn't giver her a hard time. i was hungry. i'll give this place a chance. if i feel like it. but for now. kinda not happy. cuz i called on the phone. they confirmed and said yes. our server i asked 3 times. said yes. smh."}
{"text":"Only Chinese place in town that does  not give me or my husband a headache it us having to  slam water after , they do not use msg. The place is really clean and food is so authentic. Waitress are extremely nice and attentive  she was changing our plates for the lobster shell. We go here once a week now."}
{"text":"The best Chinese Szechuan fusion in town. Price is affordable too. You will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food definitely doesn't disappoint!  

My husband has been waiting to try this place ever since he saw their sign go up so as soon as we noticed it was open, we headed over.  Their menu was so big we couldn't decide what to order because everything sounded delicious!  It wasn't your typical Americanized Chinese Restaurant do we were excited with all the choices.

We finally decided on the egg drop soup, snow pea leaves, salt and pepper fish and the pan fried chow mein.  The food did not disappoint.  To anyone who knows Chinese food, it was definitely on the pricier side, but the portions are huge which made it worth it.

I've since been back a second time and we ordered their hot and sour soup, salt and pepper tofu, salt and pepper pork chop, beef chow fun, house special steamed chicken and the snow pea leaves (again).

We left with stuffed bellies and bags of yummy leftovers.  

The service is also great so far.  They're attentive without being rude or overbearing and are quick to assist when you need something.

We will probably be frequenting this place quite often."}
{"text":"I've been here many time. Their foods was great. Not plain like others Chinese restaurant I have ever ate. My favorite dish is fish fillet with salt and pepper and Crispy skin roasted duck."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at this restaurant last night, so here's my personal review. We ordered the sweet and sour chicken, a special type of rice, won ton soup and a few other things and it all tasted great, service was fast and the staff was courteous. The reason for the 1 star review is because towards the end of our meal, my girlfriend says \"is that an ant on the table\"? It sure was. Between crawling on the table and the wall connected to our table, I counted a total of 6 ants. Completely disgusted by that and the fact that when I brought it up to the staff, he kills an ant on site by squishing it with his finger and then just walks away like it's normal. This is all it takes to keep us from ever coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Love love this place!!! Great authentic Cantonese food!! Server AMY is best. Will come back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Great Cantonese food in Las Vegas. And it's not even in the chinatown area. Good quality food. Their soups and steamed fish are good. The BBQ and porridge looks good, have to try next time. Lots of seating too."}
{"text":"We came to this place for the first time ever today. We ordered Chicken Chow Fun, that was a first for sure. We also got some Orange Chicken. It all tasted great. Will try it again soon, I hope. Four stars because the lunch time crowd is a little short staffed."}
{"text":"No need to go to china town or Gold Coast for cantonese style Chinese food, if you live on the south west side of town (the new China town). The food is very clean and tasty, doesn't seem they use MSG and if they do, they don't use a lot of it. I got the beef stew noodles and it was pretty good. The service was excellent along with the tea!!!! Don't drive to china town and check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is garbage. I ordered seafood noodles yesterday as it appeared in the picture. It's June 19th and hot as sh't out. I got a scorching hot soup that had 1 shrimp and some chicken with maybe a couple other sea meats. A side of burned noodles on another box that had a hole from the heat. Waste of $14"}
{"text":"Old school Chinese food. Service is typical Asian style. They don't say much. They don't always check on you. But the food is great!!!  You want good food and service is not an issue. Come here!"}
{"text":"This place is very good Chinese restaurant. I recommend who ever love Chinese food go there and try it. I was there with my family it was my first time there. The service was very good everyone was friendly. I place was nice and clean. The food was very good. I recommend this place to anyone. It's so close to me cause I live in the southwest. This was the first Chinese restaurant that is around me."}
{"text":"First time eating here, as take out. Orange chicken and chow fun are both delicious. Can't wait to try more items from here! I recommend it even though I've only tried two items."}
{"text":"Yes! It is a real Chinese restaurant in the Southwest area. 
No offense to the other Chinese places that serve Americanized dishes, but it's about time a more authentic Chinese restaurant is represented. 

Yes, they do have Americanized items on their menu but if you have a favorite Chinese dish, ask them if they can make it. I asked for a scrambled egg shrimp noodle dish, not on the menu, and they made it deliciously! Could be the best version in Las Vegas. 

You should also try their version of Walnut Prawn because they actually use prawns and not the smaller shrimp. Other favorites include Singapore Noodle, Peking Pork (sauce on the side), and any of the scallops dishes. Part of dinner, they offer you house soup and house dessert!"}
{"text":"Been dying to have a Cantonese style restaurant on this side so I don't have to drive to spring Mountain. This place is excellent."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for authentic Chinese food, reasonable prices, and good serving portions. When you see lots of Asians dining or ordering take out, that's a good sign! :)"}
{"text":"Decent food. Nothing I would rave over. Soy sauce chicken was exactly what it says. It was a good piece of chicken. Big portions. Roasted duck not bad. Big portion sizes typical price for half a duck. The service was actually really good. She server was very friendly, willing to answer all questions and even packed our leftovers."}
{"text":"Owner was very rude. She added extra charge to the bill. Service wad bad , wish can give zero stars."}
{"text":"I did not like this place at all. If you're looking for Chinese food go to KJ Kitchen at China Town. The dishes we ordered were ALL too salty. I did not try the noodles or congee. However, for traditional Chinese the dishes were too salty and not consistent."}
{"text":"So glad there's an authentic Chinese food place on the southwest side of town. Food is so good and I usually don't like Chinese food (being Chinese and eating nothing but Chinese food). Gotta try it and the owner and everyone else is super nice! (And usually if you go to other Chinese food places they aren't so friendly.... lol)"}
{"text":"After searching Yelp for Chinese food to satisfy the hubs craving last night, I decided on this place based on a few 'best Chinese food in Vegas off strip' reviews, and because it was nearby our house.

We arrived around 7p & were immediately seated in a booth. There were several large Chinese families enjoying dinner - I interpreted that as a good sign.

With help from our server (our eyes were maybe bigger than our stomach as we really hadn't eaten a true meal all day), we settled on wonton soup (it was quite cold & windy outside), bbq pork fried rice, beef & scrambled eggs (hubs choice) & honey walnut prawns (my choice).

The honey walnut prawns were perfect to me: the shrimp was large & slightly crisp with the sweet sauce, yet not drowning in it like other Chinese food restaurants. It was served with fresh, perfectly-cooked & crunchy American broccoli, & my favorite crunchy cooked walnuts. The fried rice & soup were a bit lacking in flavor, I thought. Hubs wasn't impressed with the beef scrambled eggs & opted not to take the rest home (which surprised our waiter).

Service was fine & food was delivered to our table fast. Everything was clean (extremely important to this germaphobe). I would definitely try this place again but the hubs may or may not (he's not one to give 2nd chances but he also didn't order our usual favorites).

Side note: our favorite Chinese restaurant near our primary home in CA closed a while back & we have yet to find a comparable replacement.  This one came the closest thus far"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is located in the southwest area, near lee's sandwiches. It's great that they're open so late! 

I was so excited to try this place and really thought I would love it, but unfortunately, it fell short. I can't speak for dine in experience because we took our food to go. Anyways, I ordered the wonton noodle soup & my bf got the chicken & vegetables. The chicken entree came with rice. 

So took our food home & it smelled so good. I was so hungry & couldn't wait to see how delicious this food was! Tried the soup first & holy moly... it was so salty?? I was so confused lol I thought I could bare the taste cos I was really hungry but just a couple of bites & I really couldn't take anymore. Too bad cos the wonton was pretty good! Tried the chicken entree afterwards & that one was the opposite of the soup, really bland. 

Idk if I'll come back cos I was really disappointed but maybe, I'm not sure. The workers were nice though!"}
{"text":"Just passed by to eat Wonton Noodles and Salt and Pepper Tofu it will fill you up and good for the cold weather right now, make you fell warm after."}

{"text":"Randomly stopped in for lunch with the family. We walked in and it was very clean! The waitress was very welcoming and we were seated immediately. We ordered. Didn't take too long for the food to come. The food was awesome! In my experiences with Chinese restaurants, the food is either too salty or too bland. They were awesome all around over here! We ordered half roasted duck, the house pan fried noodles and sweet & sour chicken. All were great!"}

Their complimentary soup was great and every single dish I tried was delicious.

Also extra props for thanksgiving evening Chinese meals"}

Most of the time I order a seafood Hot Pot, salt and pepper shrimp, beef chow fun, and salt and pepper pork chop. The prices are very reasonable and most importantly the food tastes very good. I recommend this place if any crave for some Chinese food without going to Chinatown. The place inside the restaurant is very big. and the service is great compared to other Chinese restaurants I've been to. Overall my experience with this place is great!!"}
{"text":"Love!  Pretty great authentic Chinese food!!  We stumble here because The Noodle Man closed early the day before Chinese New Year.  We're happy they were closed so we got a chance to try the food here. 

The atmosphere is the typical Chinese restaurant.  We tried to order the roasted pork, they were out of it.  Next time.  =D  I ordered the Wonton Egg Noodle Soup.  The broth was super clean and tasty.  It's exactly how I would want it.  My husband had the Braised Beef Noodle Soup, gosh the broth for that one is really good too!  I tend to like clearer broth these days.  We also ordered the Clams in Spicy Wine Sauce Hot Pot too.  It's way too much food for 2 people.  Everything was really good, that we ended up finishing everything.  We were over stuffed when we got home for sure.  

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment! The menu had lots of options (traditional Chinese and westernized dishes) and was organized. The hostess, servers, and bussers were all professional. The food was great and arrived in a timely manner. We went for honey glazed BBQ pork, house special steamed chicken, and Mongolian beef all which were phenomenal. If you've ever been to Rice Republic (no dim sum here) at Down Town Summerlin or Hong Kong cafe at The Palazzo and are looking for something more authentic definitely check this place out. Super convenient location, plenty of parking, not a thing to complain about."}
{"text":"Try this place on a Friday lunch time , just a few tables, place is roomy and bright, they have bbq items and live seafood too, order the seafood and tofu clay pot, house special half steam chicken, Pork cheek with assorted mushroom, and deep fried oysters....all are quite good and delicious, consider you can get these kind of cantonese food at this end of town, and the price is on par with Chinatown in Spring Mountain, I am feeling pretty lucky, so if you want authentic  Cantonese food, not American style Chinese food, this is the place..."}
{"text":"It ain't cheap and the Chinese waiters are a little gruff but damn if that's not some of the best tasting Chinese food I've found this side of the Pacific."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese Food. At first glance, the restaurant reminds me of a nice and spacious Chinese spot in New York. The place is clean and smells good. Chinese News Channel and Chinese conversations remind me of home.

The server Gu was very nice and welcoming. I ordered my favorite vegetable, water spinach (which is hard to find), 1/2 soy sauce chicken, and an order of Chilean sea bass steamed in a black bean sauce. While the sea bass did not taste as rich as I like it, the vegetable was phenomenal. There is a complimentary soup and dessert soup at the end. This place brings me back to my younger childhood days. Since I moved a few years ago, I haven't had this authentic experience since then.

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love love love there sweet corn soup very authentic! Must try the Mongolian beef and sautéed shrimp bomb diggity fresh!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is delishous! The best place in Vegas for authentic Chinese food! The salt and pepper shrimp with the shell on (trust me on this, it's amazing), the crispy pork, the green beans, the bok choy. The quality of the food is great as well. Have been there about 5 times since they opened and it's always consistent."}
{"text":"Food was good , great location in Southwest area . Service was efficient and they're different than typical Chinese restaurants in Chinatown . I love the sticky rice with whole crab and roasted squab."}
{"text":"I'm very happy that we finally have a Chinese restaurant that is in the Southwest that compares to one in Chinatown. So I came here earlier this morning and Yes!! They are open on Thanksgiving! Trying to find something open is hard enough. The food here is very reasonable prices and quality is on point. I had a lot of dishes here and I love every single thing I have eaten here. No complaints and the place is very clean and new. Also they serve Roast Duck, crispy roast pork that alone will save me the trip of going to Chinatown from now on."}
{"text":"A Cantonese restaurant on the southwest side of town - what a treat! Rainbow Kitchen is a no-frills, non-trendy traditional Chinese restaurant. The staff was pleasant and helpful. I can see myself becoming a regular here.

Post-election day comfort food:
-Beef Pan-Fried Noodles
-Salted Fish, Chicken & Tofu Clay Pot
-Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce

I called in the order and picked it up 15 minutes later. Looks like deli items sell out fast - they ran out of crispy roast pork by 12:30PM. Everything was delicious and on par with Cantonese restaurants on Spring Mountain. The beef with black bean sauce is especially good - tender chunks of cubed beef stir fried with peppers & onions. I will definitely be back to try the ong choy, steamed fish, & sea bass clay pot."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Chinese restaurant you can find in Las Vegas area. I don't know how they got average 4 star review, but both service and taste of food are trashy level. AVOID this restaurant, there are hundreds of Chinese restaurant you can find that's way better than this one. The Chinese food are not authentic at all."}
{"text":"Located in the Southwest, which is quicker than going all the way to China Town when we live this side of town.

Prices are reasonable, around the same as eating  in Chinatown.

Food tastes good.
We really liked the Salt & Pepper Tofu, it wasn't too salty, compared to most other places.
Walnut Shrimp was made just perfect. Not too much Mayo sauce and the shrimp was crunchy and light.

Service was good, the servers were attentive and came by frequently to clear the table of empty dishes. They checked our tea and water for refills.

This will be a place we will come back again when we want some Cantonese Chinese food and don't want to drive out too far."}
{"text":"Cantonese style cuisine? New restaurant? AND it's on the Southwest side of town?! We have got to try this! 

Two of my friends had already tried Rainbow Kitchen and one of them told me that it was pretty decent. Therefore, grabbed them and my boyfriend and we tried it one night. 

We ended up getting four different dishes: Cantonese styled garlic chili crab, ong choy cooked with preserved bean curd, sweet and sour pork chops, and half a soy sauce chicken. 

The Cantonese styled garlic chili crab is my favorite style of crab from a restaurant. It's essentially a crab that's lightly battered and fried with a mixture of garlic and chili. It's delicious and you can definitely just get that garlic/chili and mix it with rice. I must say that Rainbow Kitchen does a great job making this dish. It was delicious and aromatic. The only problem with it though is the crab. The crab itself didn't have a whole lot of meat and the meat was a little on the mushy side. What does that mean? it wasn't fresh. So the crab was probably half dead when they took it from the tank. The crabs here are also sold $40 per versus by the pound, which is a good and bad thing. Good cause if the crabs are big. Bad if the crabs are small. 

Ong choy with preserved bean curd is awesome. One of my favorite veggie dishes. Rainbow Kitchen does it well and gives you a very good sized portion. 

Sweet and sour pork is pretty normal. Nothing bad about it but nothing spectacular. It's usually one of those dishes that kids love to eat so it's become a customary dish that gets ordered no matter what. And in this case, this dish is for my boyfriend. Cantonese styled dishes aren't his thing :P

The soy sauce chicken wasn't that great. The flavor was good, like with most of their dishes. The chicken itself? No. It was rough and tough. I ate one piece and I couldn't bring myself to eat more because of how tough the meat was. The soy sauce is great to mix rice with though!

Aside from that, rice is included with your dinner. I don't believe there is a charge for rice like some Chinese places. There is also soup included with your meal. They typically serve it in the beginning. If you want more soup, be sure to let them know. They don't ask you if you want more .. they just take the bowl away :( Dessert is also included. Its typically what we call \"sugar water\" .. or you can just call it soup. They gave us red bean soup at the end of our meal and it was a bit watery. I personally don't like red bean soup so I pawned mine off to my friend. 

Overall. Decent. Hit and miss on the crab. Prices were average for a Chinese place. Service was so-so. Wish they would refill the rice without having to ask. My friends were starving so I don't think they got to eat enough rice. Not really sure if I would want to return because KJ may be a tad better."}
{"text":"Rainbow Kitchen has become our go-to place for authentic Chinese food.  Every dish we've ordered tastes delicious, but our favorites have to be the salt and pepper pork chops, braised tofu, sweet pea leaves, and chow fun."}
{"text":"This place is freaking amazing and consistently puts out quality food with generous portions. I've been here over 10 times and some of my favorite dishes are the eggplant hot pot, Singapore noodles, (best I've ever had) pork cheek and mushrooms, string beans with x.o. sauce, and the pork chops with putting sauce. Hot items come out piping hot which is awesome because that's how it should be! Service is prompt, the restaurant is spacious and clean and best of all, I don't have to go to Chinatown to get authentic Chinese food.

I hope more people try this place, leave reviews and keep it going because this is a tremendous restaurant that needs to stick around!"}
{"text":"The food is so good every time we come here. If not the best, it's one of the best Chinese Restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great authentic Chinese food without having to drive to China Town. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food! They are so nice and kind they give you tea as soon as you sit down everything was hot and delicious! We will return"}
{"text":"Yummy Chinese food!  

The waiter recommended the Tilapia, steamed with green onions and ginger.  It was caught live and then steamed.  We also ordered the Ong Choy with Preserved Bean Curd (Foo Yi), 8 Jewel Hot Pot & Soya Chicken.  

Delicious lunch was had by all!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Ordered the orange beef to-go. Got home and found a box of battered fried beef and a container of orange sauce. If I wanted to make my own food I wouldn't have bothered here.  Orange sauce was very thick, likely because it's supposed to be sautéed with with beef. Spring rolls were obviously from a box and sweet and sour sauce was watery at best and tiny considering they gave you 4 springs rolls. Maybe try this place for dine in but don't try take-out or delivery."}
{"text":"Dirty!
I have been craving for congee so I came here. First thing I have noticed was the filthy glass door and windows. 
Older lady sweeping with a dash fan on her other hand served a customer with out washing her hands. 
Filthy windows should have stopped me from coming in."}
{"text":"BEST Chinese food in Vegas!!! And the service was just as great! The shoyu Chicken was pretty damn GOOD!"}
