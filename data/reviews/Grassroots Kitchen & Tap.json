{"text":"Great food and fun vibe. But the service wasn't the best. The waitress could have been a little more attentive... I would have understand had she had a ton of tables but she had one other and much of the time she was sitting in a booth doing nothing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  Brussel Sprouts are a great app as you are taking your time deciding on which of delicious entrees you want.  Keep up the great work.  Will return over and over.  Yummo"}
{"text":"Absolutely great! I am usually wary of ordering seafood more than 100 miles from the ocean but I tried the Ahi and it was fresh and done to perfection, perfectly cooked to medium rare. The slaw that came with was equally scrumptious! I'll be back for dinner next time I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"I have worked for the Collins family in the past, and I have a passion for fresh, local food.  I live in Tempe but was in the area this evening and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to visit Grassroots. My 9 year old son was with me. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay  ($7 on Happy Hour - GOOD wine). My son had their delicious green iced tea. Andrea was our server and I did see Chris making the rounds with the tables (The Collins boys are great at making people feel welcome-great sense of humor). I had the blackened fish sandwich, but asked for it on the flaxseed bun as opposed to the artisan bun (no problem), my son had a big caesar salad (he loves caesar salad). Everything was delicious as always. We sat on the patio and the weather and service were perfect. Good job Chris! Can't wait to try Twisted Grove next door."}
{"text":"Dined here during Restaurant Week, Spring 2017.  Starters Burrata - toast points too salty and rough Tuna Poke - nicely put together  Entrees Shrimp+Grits - grits were very flavorful and focaccia was nicely seasoned Short ribs - very, very tender, but the glaze and au jus were nothing stellar.  Dessert Key lime pie and chocolate brownie met expectations.   Solid service."}
{"text":"Stopped here today for lunch.  Greeted and Seated promptly.  Server was immediately at our table offering water and taking drink orders. Draft beers were reasonably priced with a fair selection   I ordered the Southern Shrimp & Grits - (Gulf White Shrimp over jalapeno-cheddar grits with Tasso ham relish & toasted baquette).  Service was PROMPT! I think we waited maybe 15 minutes for food.  This dish was delicious! - great tastes, the grits were smooth and flavorful with the shrimp having a nice spiciness.  We had a side order of  the shoestring potatoes- one of their side item choices - They were fabulous! Lite, crispy, seasoned just right.  We ate way too many of them!"}
{"text":"Everything on the plate for piggly wigly was very good and flavorful! Perfect portion for appetizer."}
{"text":"Could not have been more disappointed in this restaurant.  My soup was awful (sweet with no spice) and my wife's trout was fishy (not very fresh).  I am rarely one to complain but I was surprised enough by the low quality to say something.  The server responded by being rude and the manager was dismissive.  I frequent Town and Country often so I hope this place fails and something better replaces it."}
{"text":"Great place and food is good as well. The salads, salmon, and pork were all very good. The wine list is ok, but what made it better was that the bartender (female) let us try a few to see what they were like. Above and beyond. Thank you."}
{"text":"I've been to Grassroots twice now. The first time was not a great experience. The food I ordered was just okay. It was lunchtime and the service was rushed. The waitress seemed a little too busy for me and my client. What I ordered was just okay. With that being said, I visited once again with my girlfriend on Easter evening. The waitor we had was amazing. Very personable, easy to talk to, and definitely attentive. The food I ordered (short-tip ribs) was phenomenal. My girlfriend also absolutely loved her meal, so I guess we made the right choices this time around. Cool spot to hang out in as well!  In true Scottsdale fashion, two drinks and two meals was about $80 not including tip. Definitely pricey, but we did not leave unhappy. Check it out, and if didn't like the food the first time, go back and try something else. You may be surprised like we were!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I highly recommend the spare ribs w/polenta, and if you have room, get the brownie sundae for dessert...or take it to go. :) The service is always super friendly and helpful, as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in the other day for the first time and had a great experience. We went in thinking it would be a health restaurant (from the name - lack of research on our part) but we were still pleasantly surprised. The entire staff from the bartenders to our waiter Kirby were very knowledgeable about healthy/gluten free options. The ahi and the pumpkin pie was amazing! We are new to the area and will be sure to make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great customer service and the abeyance was amazing! Highly recommend and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food that is not overly expensive. Great place for lunch! Every time I come here I try something different and its good each time."}
{"text":"Asked my high school daughters where they wanted to go for a special dinner yesterday and they suggested Grassroots Kitchen.  I had never been there but heard good things, boy have we been missing out!  What a fabulous dinner, service, food, ambiuance....it was perfect!  I highly recommend this place, best pork chop I have ever had.  I consider myself a foodie having been a longtime food industry person, these guys know what they are doing!  Don't wait to make a reservation, its killer!  Oh by the way, you will pay for quality at this place but its better than restaurants that are 50% more expensive....portions are very large, great value in my opinion!  Incredible job guys keep it up we will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Very festive - cozy and warm on the outside patio even when chilly.  Nice choice of items on the menu - wide variety including healthy, tasty salads.  I had a champagne vinaigrette that keeps me going back.  My husband had a blackened fish sandwich - so very tasty. When you go home and you can't stop thinking about the great food, that's great food!"}
{"text":"My sister and I stumbled upon this place and It was amazing! Being from the Midwest, I'm a huge bbq girl and the tri tip sandwich was Life! The service was amazing and I enjoyed the experience! Can't wait to come back to Phoenix and dine here!"}
{"text":"Second visit this evening and they rocked again!  Fresh and amazing shrimp Louie salad with a twist and Blackened Mahi with \"Nola\" remoulade which had to be explained to me but I loved!  This is after the first visit when we had the shrimp and jalapeño grits and a scallop special which were both TO DIE FOR!  I've had shrimp and grits in the low country and this surpassed both in presentation and innovation. We are pretty fussy and love the food, the ambiance and the service which all exceeded expectations again. It's a central Phoenix sleeper and we hope they thrive!"}
{"text":"Visited this place yesterday Saturday night and the food was really good. The atmosphere was great, too. Oh, and good customer service."}
{"text":"Order the Blackened Fish Sandwich. Just do it, you won't regret it. I'm always leery of ordering sea food in the desert after many negative experiences (and regrets), but this sandwich is consistently magnificent. The Sashimi Ahi Salad is also excellent, their asparagus is delightful, and though unfortunately the menu didn't offer many options to suit my husband's tastes, he enjoyed the braised short ribs on several occasions. Reasonably priced, convenient location and charming atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the short ribs at Grassroots about a year ago. It was the first time I had ever tried them. I have been ordering short ribs at other restaurants ( like Flemings) and they don't even come close! Grassroots has ruined me and I will only order short ribs here! Tender, delicious, ribs."}
{"text":"Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.    We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone.  My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default.  I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone.  We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious.  The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows.  * I didn't know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata"}
{"text":"Just. Good. Food. I'm writing slow because I'm stuffed. Everything was great. Shrimp jalapeño grits = hell yeah!! (Yes I'm from Texas and I love grits... And jalapeños... And shrimp...). Get the NO Dirty rice. You'll thank me. And then, right when you're about to burst, order the Heath Bar Brownie a la Mode thingy.  And a coffee.  Then go to the gym tomorrow but be satisfied tonight."}
{"text":"Honestly, my favorite restaurant ever. The first time I went there I was graduating from high school and they were the nicest people ever. Not only did they give my family and I free dessert, but they were kind enough to write me a card thanking me for choosing their restaurant to come to on such a special day. I have continued to go there since and am always pleased by their great service. Oh and the piggly wiggly appetizer is to die for!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!  All of the appetizers we ordered were really good. Our meals which included the chicken, short ribs, and brisket were all delicious.  Our favorite was the key lime pie which they gave to us on the house since it was our first time there. Our waitress Marina was also very accommodating and fantastic. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The new Grassroots at 20th St & Camelback Rd is fantastic.  I give it my highest recommendation.  The food, service and atmosphere should be experienced by all.  When you do check it out I suggest ordering the brisket...not to mention the grits that come along with it...you're welcome!"}
{"text":"Went to grassroots last night with friends. Food was delicious! Some of the best we've had in PHX. We each tried something different--shrimp po'boy..lobster bisque..ahi tuna..and blackened fish. All had unique flavor--so good! Price point was reasonable. Vibe of the restaurant was comfortable. We really enjoy ourselves! We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and delicious food. A fun neighborhood eatery good for families and singles alike. The salads are served on chilled plates and presentation is beautiful. The burgers are nice and juicy... Love the crispy fries on the side. I plan to go back very soon."}
{"text":"This is really 4.5 stars...but Yelp won't allow halfsies, so...  I've been here a few times now, and I'm a fan. They train their servers well. Not flawless, but pretty much on top of it. Waters are refilled without having to ask. The service staff knows quite a bit about the menu. Good stuff. The WATER is perfectly chilled without even using ice and their glasses are cold, too. This simple tactic alone almost wins me over. Especially being in the hottest city on Earth.   The food: on my first visit I had a fairly standard, basic salad. The kind of salad that across the way at Bianco's would be mixed green lettuce with olives and parmesan cheese (gross, I can make that at home). But at Grassroots, the basic salad is loaded with fresh vegetables, comes with a very good dressing, and the portion is huge, more than 1 can eat. Major respect for quality salad design, Grassroots!  Second visit the girl had a cocktail that she liked. Forget which one, but it wasn't too sweet but the right amount of sweet. Bartender did a good job. I tried the shrimp Po' Boy since I was told it was the most popular thing on the menu. Smallish in size but BIG in flavor. And I would MUCH rather have a smaller portion that is impeccable than a large portion of slop. Good grilled asparagus side.  The one drawback of this meal with the appetizer, the smoked salmon itself was GREAT - perfect texture, flavor, and didn't taste 1000% salty. However the toasted white bread that came with was WAY too toasted; cut the roof of your mouth toasted. Granted, they were going for a bruschetta texture and style...however with a proper bruschetta you would use baguette bread and add olive oil to not over-crisp it. The white bread actually used for our app was 1) over-toasted and 2) no oil was added. It was unfortunate, but attention to every detail is what makes a restaurant 5 stars.  The coconut creme pie we sampled for dessert was delicious in taste but pretty sloppily topped. I myself - don't care about dessert presentation. I thought the taste was perfect - filling was sweet but not overly-sugared, the graham cracker crust was perfect. The girl noticed that the whipped cream topping was messily slathered on, and a truly fine establishment would give more attention to detail. Again, I agree, but it still didn't prevent me from enjoying the dessert thoroughly.  In short: a very delicious place with solid service that has the potential to be great if they tie up loose ends such as the above mentioned. :)"}
{"text":"Good server and greeter, pleasant atmosphere, but so-so food. I ordered the miso salmon medium well. It came cooked correctly, but they forgot the miso. Asparagus were like tough, thick trees, but tasted good if one ate only the tips. My plate looked as if it was made by Denny's.  My husband had the day's special, French dip. He said it was good, but unremarkable. With no beverage, no dessert, our bill was $45.  Better food elsewhere, for same or less. We are not budget foodies, but do expect quality ingredients and good presentation when we dine out, which is often."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and Grassroots is as consistent as it gets. Love the space and set up of the entire restaurant. The food is always tasty and service is great. Their short-ribs are some of the best I've ever had. I've had a chance to sit at the bar (which is huge and great) and have drinks. It's a great way to have drinks with your friends."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. The Shrimp with Cheesy Grits was excellent."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch.  Very friendly staff, greeted as I walked in, food was amazing.  The only negative was the price. It's expensive for lunch. Plan to spend $20 for lunch, not something most can do every day."}
{"text":"I'm trying to remember the last time I ate somewhere where I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the experience. None of them compare to this hidden gem! All food courses were delish! The patio is one of the most quaint outdoor areas I've found here. And the atmosphere... It's hard to put in words but let's see if this country farm girl can do it: it is like a comfortable evening at a barn raising dinner gathering crossed with a romantic candlelit dinner with your beau at a posh downtown eatery.... unique and very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Really surprised by this place, I'd never heard of it but I stopped in with my family for the holidays. It was our first time so our waiter Kirby gave us a free Key Lime Pie! Definitely want to check out the one in the Biltmore"}
{"text":"Love the food!! It's so fresh and reasonably priced.  Able to accommodate a larger group and strollers."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, but pricey.  I had the braised shortribs and grits. Both were outstanding.  My son and father-in-law raved about the baby back ribs.  However, my daughter was really disappointed with the chicken salad croissant.    For dessert we tried the key lime pie, butterscotch pecan pie and brownie ala mode.  All were delicious, and portions are sized for sharing.  What disappointed us was the slow, inattentive service.  Our tea and water glasses were empty more than they were full, and the waitress disappeared more than once.  I would expect better service and ambience at these prices.   Great food, need to work on the service."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I loved the ribs and the brisket, and the cheddar grits (duh).  Definitely adding this to the rotation."}
{"text":"This place is the shit!!! Especially when you can walk across the street! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Omg .... the food was amazing!!!!  We had the yummy baby back ribs and the string fries were the best I have ever had .... got to try their pumpkin pie .... to die for!  Our server Lesta was fantastic .  You must try this restaurant as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  My family is from New Orleans so it's good to see some of those types on a menu in Phoenix.  Everything is real good but I'd recommend starting with Dad's Grocery Bag then getting the Shrimp Po Boy."}
{"text":"YUM!  Just enjoyed a fabulous casual dinner at Grassroots and I am looking forward to my next visit.  Great neighborhood atmosphere, the food was fresh and prepared to perfection and the service was spot on.  The proprietor stopped by the table a couple of times to check on things.  For a restaurant that has been open only a month - the place nailed it!  Better get in now to enjoy dinner, before you're unable to get in without a wait."}
{"text":"Visiting from Atl, my husband and I chose grassroots from yelp reviews.  When asking our server what her favorite salad was she stated veg chop with avocado.  It wasn't the most expensive salad(so I knew she was truthful). By far best salad I have eve had. What a treat and so fresh and healthy! Husband had bbq chicken and he loved it. He is a very picky eater.  Our service was timely pleAsant and didn't overstay their welcome.  The owner Chris , was extremely nice and gave us a heartfelt welcome.  We may be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Tried it out for lunch... Service was great, fast, and very attentive. I had the shrimp Po' Boy, it was very filling and delicious! The baked potato soup was awesome, not to thick with just the right amount of bacon and cheese. Definitely be heading back here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a couple of times now. Great selection on menu. While I have only tasted small plates, all delicious. Great atmosphere,  ran into several friends each visit. While located in a mall, feels like a neighborhood spot. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for our second visit, and was yet again won over by this little neighborhood jewel. Our first visit was for dinner, I ordered the grilled miso salmon - it was AWESOME. Hubs ordered the 'Roti & Rib' and thankfully he let me take a bite. I'm not a big fan of ribs, but these were just delicious! We then enjoyed some wine, good conversation, and good atmosphere.   Today we stopped by for lunch, and were lucky to snag a seat on the patio. Again, the service was great. I ordered the veggie chop salad w /roasted chicken. It was so delicious! Chop salads can be tough to get right, and Grassroots did a smashing good job if I do say so myself. No wine today, as I had to go back to work after, but it would have been a perfect day for it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience place tucked away in the Hayden/Via de ventura corner ....  It has multiple seating options as mentioned by fellow yelper ... But regardless where you sit, this place is wonderful, it has a modern southern vibe to it ... very warm and cozy ... and certainly has the southern hospitality.    Service is top notch and totally 5 starts ... sometime you can just tell when people are truly sincere and concern about you as a customer ... this is one of the few places make me feel that way.    As for the food, ordered the tuna poke which was very refreshing especially for the summer, the miso glazed salmon which has the perfect favor but just slightly overcook. But this could be just a one time miss .... as for the ribs ... the favor is awesome and serving is plentiful ... but I love the grits come with it the most (I never liked grits but oh  boy, they gave me a brand new definition of grits now)  A wonderful place to hang out too :)"}
{"text":"Grassroots is just this really perfect little restaurant that my wife and I love to go visit. All the food is well prepared hot and fresh. The Carolina ribs are \"fall off the bone\" delicious and the thin fries that accompany them are just a delight.   Drinks are well crafted and wine is a \"long pour \".  Have any of the cream pies or if lucky get the seasonal pumpkin pie. It's always packed but the bar service is excellent and we always make new friends. Just visit you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and have enjoyed each visit.  There are plenty of fresh and healthy options, and they all taste great.  I love the patio.  The ahi salad is great, but I found the lobster bisque totally underwhelming.  My wife had the fish sandwich and was a big fan.  It's a hopping place at lunch and dinner, but you can use open table to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch after a long morning of stressful doctor appointments. Not being from the area it was so nice to find such a great restaurant. The service was great and was delighted to get a complimentary appetizer. The Brussel sprout appetizer with balsamic glaze and bacon was amazing! My husband had the brisket sandwich and it was delicious. The flavors were perfect and brisket was cooked to perfection. Will definitely go back again when visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is amazing  I had the roti and rib combo which was rotisserie chicken and ribs..I actually commented to my wife while eating it that the meat just wouldn't stay on the bones. It was delicious, cooked to perfection  and the cole slaw and beans as a side were also delicious and complimented it perfectly. Everything was quick and flawless. From one server to another, service from Austin was perfect. He was just the right amount of attentive and had knowledge of the menu for all the questions we asked. Can't wait to have another meal here. The outside patio was great."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! The NM hatch chile soup was wonderful, and the Shrimp Po' boy was one of the best I have ever had. This is a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"OK food - Terrible Service. I took a party of six business guests....ten minutes after being seated we had yet to see a server - not a good start to the evening. After finding the hostess and requesting a visit from our server, we ordered drinks and appetizers...the drinks arrived, didn't see the server again until our entrees arrived - minus the appetizers. The server's response when asked about the issue - \"The appetizers didn't get made\". Very dismissive, no apology, totally unprofessional. Bottom line - spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"In the old Baby Kays space at Town & Counrty. Great variety of of high quality dishes and craft beers. Had the Ahi sandwich and lobster bisque excellent. Looks a good happy hour spot. Will back soon for lunch, happy hour or both."}
{"text":"What's the adage--with food, you can get it good, cheap, or in large quantities (pick two)? Grassroots isn't cheap, certainly, but given the quantity and quality of the food you are more than getting your money's worth. My wife and I came here for her birthday for lunch and ordered the smoked salmon, the chicken entree, and the veggie platter. We also got a pitcher of the white sangria. The portion of salmon was impressive, and it was quite tasty (especially with the dressing). The half chicken with orzo was well cooked and filling. The veggie platter was huge, and the chef's veggie was roasted broccoli with champagne vinaigrette and feta cheese--absolutely delicious, every part of it. We were too full for dessert. For two full glasses of sangria apiece, a big app and two full dinner entrees with sides, a total of $70 was completely worth it. I highly recommend trying this place out. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food not so much. Smoked brisket was not smokey and drowned out by other ingredients. Ono was dry and also disguised. The white cheddar jalapeño grits(side) and asparagus(appetizer) were the only good food."}
{"text":"I am not a person who likes Banana's, but my mother in law ordered a banana dessert for us to share.  I thought I was going to go for that polite one and done bite.  Nope.  It was amazing.  I may go back during lunch hour by myself just to eat the dessert."}
{"text":"Horrid! We ordered a Salad to share for a starter and the kitchen refused to divide it as well as the waitress. I have a palsy and drop stuff frequently. Then, the bus-person picked up our salad plates and set down the dirty forks. We asked for clean ones for our entrees and were told that wasn't usually done. Poor service with an attitude! Never again. And, mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place to have a good salad. And this is the place for that, fresh and just plan the best. Great service and very nice atmosphere, we highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive service. A very enjoyable dining experience. I recommend the salmon and Burrata appetizers. The brisket entree was delicious. We had the apple pie this evening, and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale on vacation a week ago to see Taliesin West (FLW's house) and to visit family.  My husband found this restaurant on Yelp and other apps looking for a place to eat close by our hotel.  This place did not disappoint.  The bartenders were great.  Didn't really care for their margarita as it had too much lime juice but my husband enjoyed his beer!  Our dinner was very delicious.  I had the smoked brisket sandwich (with the coleslaw on the side and not on it) with the shoestring fries.  My husband had the chicken Waldorf salad.  We had the key lime pie for dessert.  The piece of pie was just right for sharing.  I don't think we could have both had one.  Our waitress, Janelle, was awesome--very friendly and provided great service.  We would definitely recommend this place.  It has an outside patio and the inside is very casual but nice.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is really good. It seemed sort of New Orleans(ish) to me. It was really fresh and delcious. I got the shrim po' boy sandwich. The bread was fresh and the side of asparagus was perfecto. Go here :)"}
{"text":"First time at this place and the food was good. I had the roti and ribs, came with beans and slaw. Enjoyed the beans and chicken more than ribs and slaw. My girl ordered the garden salad with chicken, which she really enjoyed. I had a bit and the bacon in the salad was great. Lastly we ordered the brownie for dessert. It was huge, however it was not warm when we received it. It was still decent and our bartender Danny ended up comping it for us and even offered to make us one to go. Great first experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Grassroots and it was just okay.  I had the short ribs and I would give it 4 stars and they were extremely tender. The server also was very knowledgeable and friendly. I would lean more towards 4 stars over 3 stars for this restaurant and I think had we sat out on the patio, it might have been a concrete 4 star experience... The Ambiance and decor was a bit lackluster inside....Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is clean, and there is some artistic flair, but I just wasn't wow'd by the experience.  Patio did look very inviting.      The only thing locally sourced on the menu was broccoli by McClelland Farms. I personally would like to see more locally sourced vegetables and potentially chicken/pork at the very least.   Other than, that as charming as this restaurant happens to be--- not sure if I will be able to go back, simply because I live in Chandler. If this was a neighborhood spot, I would definitely go back. But, not sure it's worth a second trip given the long drive.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Short ribs excellent. Service satisfactory. Biggest issue was deciding whether to sit inside or outside, as servers admitted the AC in the building was not enough. He stated the owner's are working on getting another unit. It was actually cooler outside (108 degrees) with misters then inside. No apology, just is what it is.  I'll go back with client's again AFTER they resolve the AC issue."}
{"text":"Yum! The menu is unique & the food is delicious. Highly recommend this place. I suggest having the blackened fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, atmosphere, service, I had the Trout with Swiss Chard it was yummy.  The Coconut and Key Lime Pies were fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good bbq brisket and beans here. Nice place.  Good atmosphere for visiting with friends."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, decent menu and good location . However. .. Nothing exceptional for me. That is why not 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and the food has never disappointed.  The pork belly appetizer is heaven on a plate and the salads are fresh and delicious.  My husband gets the shrimp and grits and is always satisfied.  Their pomegranate green tea is really good, I am usually a water drinker but when we go to Grassroots I HAVE to order the tea, it's just not an option to not!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We were recommended by a friend and we were not disappointed. We went for dinner and the food was excellent! My husband had the miso salmon and I had the shrimp po boy, both were awesome! I loved the ambiance of the restaurant including the patio! It was a great date night spot!"}
{"text":"All of our food was delicious and the service was fantastic. The ahi they serve is super fresh! I will say the ahi dinner portion seemed small for the price. I would highly recommend the poke appetizer and the redfish (you can't ever get redfish in AZ!) We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of weeks ago and the food was good, I got the special and it was delicious. The produce was locally sourced and I always appreciate restaurants that differentiate that way .  We dined with a large group of friends before going out to a show. The meat and cheese board was well appointed and had a great selection of 3 different cheeses and 4 different meats. The prices were reasonable. The food was a little slow coming out but I understand that- it was a busy Friday night. By the time the food arrived we had to be aware of the time in order to meet our showtime. It wasn't a very big deal, we made it and we plan on returning when we have a little more time to spend and try their desserts."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots during the week.  Normally in and out fairly quick.  If you go definitely try the farmers chop salad and add chicken, one of the best and filling salads I have had."}
{"text":"The Good: -very nice interior -overall friendly hostess/staff/management -good menu design -certain dishes executed very well -plenty of parking in shopping center/easy to access  The Bad/The Needs Improvement: -many dishes, including the salads, are SEASONED TO DEATH! way heavy on the salt/pepper/secret spices/etc. i've had the garden salad for lunch, and the small portion was HUGE and mixed and flavored well. i had the SAME salad at dinner but this time the salad was swimming in dressing (inconsistent food). at that same dinner, the grilled salmon was so OVER-seasoned i surgically removed the top layer so as to bypass the salt mine. it's so sad to have such a good piece of fish wasted by an overzealous line cook who's just POUNDING the food to death with sodium. this place is called \"Grassroots\" which conjures images of fresh and healthy, right? -some of the wait staff are A-1 professional; some are too green though, and don't care enough about what they're doing: like the quality you'd find at a Sam Fox restaurant (which is to say, young/inexperienced). the management definitely tries hard to stay on top of this...but i think maybe the problem is in the training. so rather than running around trying to correct problems during service, nip it in the bud by properly training everyone, including the line cook who killed my salmon. :( -some of the execution from the head chef needs improvement. for example, their appetizer, which we've had several times, of smoked salmon and bread wedges...the salmon is on-point! but the bread wedges are over-toasted, slice the roof of your mouth hard. bad. further, they tend to sit in the window too long before being brought to your table, so while the edges are dangerous, the middle is almost limp.  overall, the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming...good lighting and a positive energy throughout. but the training and basic cooking skills does the creative and admirable menu a disservice. more talent is needed to complement and support what has the makings of a solid go-to local spot. right now i'd say this place is running on 50% efficiency. 3 stars. good, not great."}
{"text":"This place has delicious fries & shrimp & grits! Happy hour delivers! Try the brisket sliders! Simply fantastic! This is a casual spot with great food perfect for lunch, Hapy hour specials or dinner. If you live in Scottsdale and haven't been here you Must go. If your visiting for just a weekend I would recommend this as top 10 in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wonder Sunday lunch of salad and tri tip sandwich. Really hit the spot. Sandwich was a special for the day and did not disappoint. Salad was fresh and we got the dressings on the side which worked out well. Parton size a large and can easily be shared"}
{"text":"Food is SO good, different, creatively refreshing!  What a great place to have a power lunch.  We had prosciutto wrapped asparagus and burrata with spicy tomato jam and even jalapeño cheese grits.  And even though short ribs are over done for at least ten plus years, these were amazing!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Its small, but stylish.  Service has been very good so far, and  myself and my guests have enjoyed the food very much.  I ADORE the tuna steak sandwich, which is cooked to perfection (along with the fresh asparagus.) both times I have ordered it.  I HOPE THAT QUALITY CONTROL IN THE KITCHEN CONTINUES.  OH, and the key lime pie - AMAZING! Seriously, worth having for lunch, by itself.   My only small suggestion is dropping the prices of the normal beverages.  Paying $4 for an ice tea is a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance and feel of Grassroots - however, the cook has a bit of an attitude.  When I explained this was the second time I had come in and they were out of what I  wanted to order he said because everything is fresh. Ok-I can appreciate and love that! However, I was asking for a baked potato. How can you be out of baked potatoes? That seems pretty standard. He then went on to say they are doing pretty well.....what?? How about just apologizing for not being able to accommodate your customer. Lose the attitude.  Food is par - I would recommend this place for drinks only."}
{"text":"This was our first food stop when getting into town. The food was outstanding.  The service was outstanding.   I'm going back before I head out of town."}
{"text":"My friend and I went  here today for lunch and ended up leaving in the middle of the meal because of a horrifically rude, nasty, disrespectful encounter I had with the OWNER of this establishment. We ordered the vegetable chopped salad and about 4 bites in I noticed a curly blonde hair laying on a red beet. Obviously I lost my appetite and kindly called over the server. I completely understand that once in a horrible while a 'hair' can happen. My appetite was lost but I was not mad. My horrific experience ensued when I asked to speak to a manager and the owner came over. He immediately greeted me with a cocky and rude demeanor. He didn't apologize at all;  instead took the defense stating that it was a 'corn husk' not a hair. He then disrespectfully accused me of giving him mixed signals about whether or not I wanted more food or had lost my appetite. I was mortified and disgusted to be spoken to and treated this way by the OWNER of Grass Roots. I immediately got up to excuse myself from this hideous situation and in doing so he continued to follow me out shouting \"Thank You, Thank You\" in his obviously comfortable sarcastic tone. Instead of taking the HIGH Road and potentially creating a customer for life by doing damage control; apologizing and acknowledging Grass Roots' error, (which is truly all I ever wanted him to do) he continued in a verbal sparring session with me. I will NEVER step foot back in Grass Roots. The food was mediocre but the service was hideous! As a customer who is well versed in dining all over the Valley I was excited to try a new place close to home, I left feeling appalled and dismayed."}
{"text":"Read the reveiws and decided to give it a chance. We were warmly greeted at the door, the atmosphere would be equivalent to an upscale sports bar/tavern. Our server Brian was phenomenal with great customer service! He was very knowledgeable about the food. Which is great if this is first time being at a new place.  We went during happy hour and Omg the entire happy hour menu was amazing. The prices were surprisingly fairly low.  #ournewfavspot"}
{"text":"Oh my I cannot even describe how fresh and amazing my farm chopped salad and salmon were. And the coconut cream pie was so homemade and authentic tasting it was the best I have ever had in my life. Great food!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. There were 10 of us and everyone was happy! Shrimp & grits, Pork chop & greens, Chicken & orzo, Salmon & asparagus, Banana split, Key lime pie, Root beer float, Martinis, Wine, Beer, Sangria. Yum! Great service & atmosphere!! Thanks for making our birthday dinners great!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  The service is always excellent and every dish we've had is off the hook.  I love the shrimp and grits and the shrimp poboy.  The poboy is the best I've had outside of New Orleans when I lived there.  My wife loves the scallops which is an occasional special.  Great for kids, too, and our 6-year-old daughter loves it.    Last time we were there, our daughter wanted to walk around and talk to the hostess and they became bff's and then she met the chef.  He was super friendly as well.  Everybody is very accommodating and tolerated a talkative, charming 6-year-old. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on our last day in Scottsdale. Found a great gastropub with a menu full of farm fresh selections and excellent variety. We had the blackened fish sandwich and shrimp po boy. Both sandwiches were very tasty and seasoned perfectly. My only critique would be the bread. It felt a bit big and too thick. We both had the shoestrings that were obviously fresh made. I really loved the setting and could see it being a great happy hour and dinner date restaurant."}
{"text":"We'd heard good things about this place, but our visit was a mixed bag.  The Shrimp Po Boy and string fries were excellent.  The baked potato soup not so much.  It was thick (like hummus), grainy and didn't taste like potato.  Service was the same mixed bag - no one at the door to greet and seat.  No waitstaff on duty.  There were two people bussing tables and one of them left while we were there.  The kitchen was fully staffed.  The bartender was waiting tables (very few) and taking care of a bar full of people (now that I think about it - this must be normal and if you want decent service - sit at the bar).  We were brought water and our food order - never was asked if we wanted anything to drink.  She did comp the soup that my friend didn't eat.  The manager appears to be clueless.  He wandered around the kitchen area, sliced some limes, nibbled food, and drank something.  He should have been working the front of the house, seating people and making sure they had drinks etc.  If he isn't going to have waitstaff on duty - then it's his job to do it.  I think if I want the Po Boy again, I'll order it to go and bypass the restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I find their food is generally above average, but some items are definitely better than others.  We've eaten here a dozen  plus times.  The shrimp and grits are excellent, as are all of the side dishes, we especially like the Swiss Chard, the Buratta with tomato jam, and the chicken Waldorf salad, all extra yummy.  The sandwiches are okay. They prefer to use a thick heavy bread, we deconstruct and remove the top layer of bread and try and eat as open face. The fillings are adequate, however, without the dense bread, you may still be hungry, so order a substantial side dish.  For entries, we have enjoyed the salmon, trout and brisket entries, all were good and were adequate serving sizes.  You won't be leaving with a doggy bag but you probably won't be hungry.    Our servers have always been very attentive and in good humor.  My disappointments (beside the sandwich Bread) are the desserts and the non alcoholic beverages.   The two pies we have tried, Key Lime and Coconut are like pies made with Eagle Brand sweetened condensed  milk, not a bad thing, but then an overly sweet sugared whipped topping is plopped on the top.  A real whipped cream unsweetened, to offset the very sweet condensed milk would work so better, IMO.  It's too bad, as their serving sizes do leave a space that's just screaming out for a yummy, adult dessert.  As a juxtaposition, the lemonade/Arnold Palmer drinks are completely unsweetened, lemon juice that makes you pucker.  We asked for simple syrup from the bar, but told they don't have any ??  Server said yes, it's way too bitter but you can add your own sugar...ok...ever try to dissolve sugar in a cold beverage...that's the purpose is simple syrup.  So, all in all, it just depends what order.  Order the shrimp with grits and an extra side of Swiss Chard , a beer to drink and you'll be a happy diner...oh, and go elsewhere for dessert and don't order anything from the bar that require simple syrup!"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with a few friends. Love the place! It's has a very nice atmosphere. I only got dessert and it was very good! My other friends got salads and said that it was delicious as well. Definitely a fan, glad I drove by!"}
{"text":"Me: BBQ brisket with Orzo and mashed potatoes... Brisket was super tender and BBQ sauce was great. Big side portions and both were tasty.  Wife: Spit fire chicken with cole slaw. Chicken was better than Doughbird's chicken, great flavor. Didnt try the cole slaw.  She got a $10 drink and I got a $6 beer, total was around $60."}
{"text":"I went to Grassroots Kitchen and Tap today for lunch and it was FANTASTIC.  We sat out on the patio and the weather was perfect, but the Roasted Chicken Waldorf Salad was absolutely the best I have ever had. The service was great too and would highly recommend this restaurant to others. It's a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Food and service was very good. My picky six year old loved the ribs and ate all his food without any bribing."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Scottsdale. Started with the Waldorf Salad which was perfectly not over-creamy. Excellently sweet and crunchy. The Short Rib was phenomenal. Meat was tender, not fatty, and the hoisin sauce was fantastic. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Grassroots is amazing, from the ambiance to the bartender Colton! He made great food suggestions and for a delightful dinner experience. I highly suggest grassroots!"}
{"text":"My name is Phil, and I'm an addict! full disclosure, I'm very fortunate enough to live across the street from grassroots!  I have been a customer of there's since they opened! I am taking this occasion , as I have just signed up on Yelp, to tell all that are interested that this restaurant rocks!  I will cut to the chase.............. my friends and I usually to the bar because the bartenders are always attentive and friendly! the service is spot on and they are always eager to go out of their way to make sure your experience is optimum! On top of that, Ryan McCarthy and crew have been rockin the kitchen by accommodating some simple requests! I tell everyone about this place! and you really need to check it out! :-)"}
{"text":"Grassroots is one of the best restaurants in the valley. Perfect for dinner with family or date night. Great service, reasonable prices, and fantastic food.  The chopped salad with salmon added in is absolutely delicious.  Picking between their Key Lime Pie and Coconut Cream Pie for dessert is impossible, so make sure you order one of each. The atmosphere on their outdoor patio can't be beat."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood spot!  Still can't decide my favorite thing on the menu, looks like I need to go back soon."}
{"text":"The ribs are perfection and pair well with an ice cold beer and pecan pie!"}
{"text":"Don't eat the chicken!! 3 times now I've spit out gristle,  and when I privately let them know, they said their chicken was fine. Not the case."}
{"text":"I was traveling and stumbled upon Grassroots.  The food and service was so good that I ate dinner there three straight evenings in a row.  I had the brisket sandwich - excellent!  I had the Portobello sandwich - outstanding!  Finally, I had the braised short ribs - very good but slightly dry.  Danielle and Charity made me feel like a king.  For an old fart like me, calling me \"hon,\" was very welcomed.  However, don't overuse it with customers as it may play as disingenuous.  Also thank you to the hostess who told me to head to Old Town Scottsdale for Southwestern jewelry!!  I am now going to find a way to travel back to Phoenix just for Grassroots.  PS - the jalapeño cheddar grits were very tasty!  And so was the coconut cream pie!!"}
{"text":"Grassroots was awesome. I'd highly recommend the brisket, very tender and well marinated. The soup and sides that we ordered were excellent as well. Really nice trendy atmosphere too and staff were great and accommodating."}
{"text":"Time and time again I keep returning to Grassroots. For starters...I LOVE LOVE THE BARATTA CHEESE AND TOMATO JAM!  The flavors are totally in sink with my taste buds. I wish I could make that tomato jam myself but I don't think I could come close! Service is always consistent, but I would recommend a reservation if you want a table. There always seems to be a place at the counter if you are the \"drop in at the last minute type\"! Enjoy you first timers cuz this one is a must!"}
{"text":"Great find...I've been several times with a small group and large group....each time the food was excellent.  The food is fresh and portions are large.... Never had key lime pie like this ever.....Enjoy!  The staff was so polite and accommodated us which took some work to make the large party happy....Thank for bring great food to the valley!"}
{"text":"We took my dad here for Father's Day dinner, and I walked away stuffed with no room for dessert!  The restaurant is owned by the family that has Wally's, but it the food is much more refined and it is a nicer ambiance.  We had the prosciutto wrapped asparagus and pork belly for appetizers.  I am not usually a fan of asparagus, but when wrapped in prosciutto and drizzled with a honey sauce, I was able to enjoy it.  The pork belly was something I have always heard about on cooking shows, but never tried.  It was about three inches thick and served with caramelized pancetta (pork on pork, love it) a spicy tomato jam and toasted bread.  We weren't quite sure how to eat it, but once we dove in it was pure bliss. The pork was so tender and had a nice smoky flavor to it; paired with the spicy tomato jam it was a culinary experience I will not soon forget.  While I enjoyed the appetizers a lot, my main dish was even better!  I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, and having just been to New Orleans about six months ago, this dish rivaled those that I had down in the South.  The grits were doctored up with cheddar cheese and jalapenos, and were just heavenly, plus the portion was very generous, so there were plenty to share.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly (although a bit on the small side) in a sauce with andouille sausage; the dish got better and better with each bite!  My dad thoroughly enjoyed his rib-eye with blue cheese butter and my mom and sister both loved the seared ahi salad.  My dad told me he has previously tried the short ribs, and they were phenomenal, plus they are also served with the drool worthy grits.  The service was excellent, and the food was divine, I love finding a locally owned restaurant in my neighborhood that is actually good!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Arizona from New Jersey and this restaurant is definitely a thumbs up. the food is great and the service is good. They will be seeing me more often."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. I think it is cute that they serve their water and iced teas with mason jars. I tried their Sashimi Ahi Tuna Salad. It was very good, but the seasoning seemed busy. The rub on the tuna, the wasabi peas, and the salad dressing seem to compete with each other. Overall I had a good experience, and plan to return and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Pork belly melted in my mouth! Delish. Drinks were tasty. Sliders and wings were not good at all.   Cute place but It's not as good as I expected."}
{"text":"We read reviews and decided to try this place. It was perfect weather for the patio.  I loved the plants everywhere.  We were just going to have a beer and appetizers off the social hour menu.  After Wings,  sliders, salmon dip, a hamburger  w slaw,and a salad with everything possible in it,  and beers...we were fat n happy. The menu seemed to be extensive and the food coming out of the kitchen looked good. The wine and beer list good too...something for everyone.  Very tasty food.  Excellent service. Great atmosphere. I even liked the silverware. .. heavy. We will go back and take friends!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic local spot! The feeling is very warm and welcoming as soon as you walk in. Everyone on staff seems to be genuinely friendly and happy to be there. The food is fantastic! I've tried probably half the menu and haven't eaten anything I didn't LOVE. The scallops are absolutely awesome, but my go to favorites are the Ahi Tuna sandwich and the Tuna Salad. Also, save room for dessert the Brownie with ice cream and caramel is just stupid good. Oh one last thing, did I mention the Happy Hours? 3-6 EVERY DAY. Pretty fabulous."}
{"text":"Fantastic service waitress was efficient and not over baring. Very friendly.  Given a free appetizer that was delightful because of another persons misorder. Food came out timely and hot.  Would definitely recommend.  Brisket sandwich was quite wonderful."}
{"text":"I always have a really good experience when I come here. While the other location is good too, this one seems to have a bit of a better atmosphere and a better overall staff with decent longevity (I recognize many of the wait staff from previous visits). Their happy hour is really solid, good food and drinks as opposed to less enticing happy hour choices and smaller portions that other restaurants have available for their happy hour."}
{"text":"Oh, heck Ya! What a great place for good draft beer and tasty food. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with another couple and as per usual it was great. The Waldorf salad is the best in town.  It's one of those things you will end up craving.  Recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best gumbo I have had outside New Orleans.   Great Po Boy sandwiches and slaw.   Casual, but upscale atmosphere and a nice patio.  Well worth finding as it is tucked away in a shopping plaza."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Grassroots. The short ribs were delicious as well as the shrimp and grits. Our server Matt was very stiff which made it a little formal. Service was good, just was doing a job..... not enjoying it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. My iced tea never ran dry.  Food was fresh and tasty, presented well and we were fully satisfied."}
{"text":"Grassroots is my family's go to restaurant. The food is always perfect. Service is efficient and pleasant. I take everyone there because there is something there for everyone and every experience I leave stuffed and happy which is exactly how you should leave a meal."}
{"text":"Yummy! My first visit has ensure me a second visit, (when in that neighborhood)!   Drink: My friend and I shared a pitcher of sangria, which was light and refreshing. We both agreed it was on the light side which we much prefer over sweet. 1 star  Food: I had the free range chicken. It was very flavorful and juicy. We shared the brownie desert. It put us over our belt buckles but was well worth it! 2 stars   Atmosphere: Considering, it was a 100 degree evening, eating outside was comfortable. Lighting was great and misters help cool the area off. 3 stars  Price: To be predicted for that area of Scottsdale. I will say the portions are generous!!  4 stars   And now we are at 5 stars for service! Friendly, timely, and clean!"}
{"text":"This was a great first restaurant to stop by for lunch during my Arizona road trip. My boyfriend and I shared the prosciutto wrapped asparagus with maple syrup and an Angus burger with shoestring fries. Both items were delicious!! We were really impressed with the asparagus because it was nicely roasted and all of the flavors complemented each other well. Their service was great and the restaurant was clean. We came during a non-busy time and were seated right away."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  The service, the ambience, the food, the drinks...yum!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting at this restaurant with my mother completely appalled.  Right when we walked through the doors, we immediately wanted to leave. Not because of the food here or the atmosphere but because of how INDECENT the hostess was dressed.  This older, bigger woman is currently wearing a strapless gold metallic dress, something I'm positive I had in my closet when I was 12 years old.  Just so my disgust is clear to everyone, it's Mother's Day, a day to treat your mother like the saint she is- How this hostess is dressed is far from saint like.  This dress is strapless, incredibly short and too small for a wonderful restaurant like Grassroots.  Side note: she is also wearing flip flops around an open kitchen. Red flag for health code.  I won't be coming back until a manager addresses how tasteless this is."}
{"text":"The asparagus wrapped in prosciutto fell a little shirt. Not enough prosciutto for how big the asparagus was. The almost famous pork chop was excellent, the candied prosciutto on it was brilliant. The chicken was good but the rice could have been better. The brownie with ice cream was superb. Overall it was a good experience but for the amount of money the food could have been a little better."}
{"text":"Very good neighborhood rest! Very attentive server and mgr walked around and checked in on the customers. Loved the ambiance. If we were there sans kids, would have sit at bar and ate. Tv's and patio. I had the fish-delicious, French fries and side salad yum. My Hubbie said ribs ok but he thinks he makes the best ribs. The beans that came with the ribs, everyone enjoyed! Would go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I have been to this new restaurant a dozen times for lunch and a couple of times for dinner. Friendly staff, good food. Nice to have a restaurant like this in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. The food is fresh and local and elegantly presented. The patio is beautiful. You will not regret a trip here."}
{"text":"We came in here for Thanksgiving week and the bartender, Emily, took care of us and we had an amazing time! She was very friendly, personable, fun and attentive! A month later we came back here from Texas and looked for her and requested her as our server while they were on a wait! As before she was smiling, attentive and remembered us from a month ago! Emily is an amazing person and every time we come back to Arizona we will look for her! She is always smiling and positive and attentive to the people she interacts with at Grassroots!!!"}
{"text":"Caught the tail end of the social hour and ordered the \"Piggly Wiggly\" appetizer, and was treated to some of the best baby back ribs I've had in a long time, and pork belly with a spicy jam and delectable garlic toast oozing with buttery goodness - all on one plate!  Granted, those items are much more expensive when ordered separately, so the social hour is the way to go for the best value!  (...the social hour is the call for easy seating too - we sat right down at 5:00pm, and by the time we left at 6:30, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.)  Make a reservation if you don't want to wait, the place is not very big.  I give Grassroots Kitchen and Tap 5 stars, because everything we had was delicious, and the value, quality, and portion size was exactly as expected for this type of establishment.  Locally grown produce and organics are more expensive than conventionally grown ingredients, so one would expect that to be reflected on the right side of the menu.  One of the other reviews asks:  What is the one thing on the menu that will keep people coming back again and again?  ...I have an answer to that question; according to my taste-buds it's: ...The baby-back ribs ...The vegetable salad ...The pork belly ...The tuna poke (despite the fact that it has shrimp in it, which could be considered sacrilegious to die-hard poke aficionados) ...And the BEST jalapeno grits we've ever had!  (Note about the jalapeno grits - if you are the kind of person that enjoys the overly-spicy, heavy-handed chili and cheese grits such as are served at places like The Mission, you won't like these.  The jalapeno grits at Grassroots are delicately spiced and mild, with just a touch of kick for flavor - muy delicioso!)  We are really looking forward to going back and trying more, though it is going to be hard to not repeat the items we already know we love."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the white sangria! Came back second night for a repeat. Really appreciate Richard, the General Manager for making it RIGHT!After sending back our first pitcher that wasn't well made, he became adamant about having the bartender recreate the sangria we had the previous night. This is giving our girls weekend life!"}
{"text":"Okay, let's talk about how darn good the appetizers are here...plenty for two...we had both the Poke and the Barratta...both excellent, unique flavorings please the palate.  The steak was seriously some of the best we've had in years.  Our server, Tara, had a fabulous smile and was pleasant and attentive.  Only negative for the night was the Cadillac marguerita...horrible.  We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"First time to dine at Grassroots, based on recommendation from a friend. So glad we did, it's definitely been added to our favorites. Started with appetizer of balsamic coated fried Brussel Sprouts - so delicious, such a unique preparation! Entrees included blackened redfish with jalapeño rice (not hot or spicy, just flavorful) , the redfish was so FRESH, a rarity in Arizona and perfectly prepared: husband had prime rib with creamy mashed potatoes, a good compliment to the prime rib which in itself had a good flavor but only rates a 4. Everything else, food & service definitely a 5!"}
{"text":"Great service, best meal after four days in town. Don't miss the pumpkin pie. Jalapeno grits and roasted broccoli were incredibly good."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try Grassroots on 4/20/12. We arrived about 5:45 and got 2 stools at the bar. The bartender came over and gave us a menu and took our drink order a couple minutes later. After about 10 minutes I noticed that it was getting hot in the restaurant - the patron next to me said she heard the A/C was broken. One of the 3 female bartenders confirmed that the A/C was only working in a small portion of the restaurant.   We decided to brave the heat and ordered the shrimp po boy and the grilled fish with fries and Asian coleslaw as the sides so that we could split them and try both items. The food was fabulous - the service was another story. First of all, I like when the server introduces themselves to the customer - not one of the three ladies did this. My friend and I observed them and they were very unengaged with the customers - maybe it was the heat - maybe it was the less than flattering uniforms they were wearing. You could tell they weren't happy - not too many smiles.  I will try the restaurant again but I wouldn't choose to sit at the bar. I think that whomever was in charge that night should have done something as a gesture of goodwill due to the hot conditions in the restaurant. I'm not saying the meal should have been comped but maybe a drink or dessert and a percentage off the bill would have made the customer want to try it again."}
{"text":"Our second trip to the restaurant but the final at this location.  I'd come every week if I lived here. Vegetable platter is a feast whether you are a vegetarian or not. The salmon patty in the omega burger was tender and full of flavor.  Marina our waitress was friendly, efficient and right there when we needed her. Do not miss the key lime pie.  Super pleasant out on the patio."}
{"text":"Grassroots is an excellent place to go eat and hang out.  The food is excellent, the staff is very friendly, and the dining room is inviting and decorated well.  I have tried something new each time I have gone and I have not been disappointed yet.  If you have a chance to go, do it. You will not be let down."}
{"text":"One of the best seared ahi salads I've ever had. Lots of outdoor seating. Ambiance is refined, but casual and service is great and professional. They also have a full bar with craft beer. The best seafood and BBQ spot in the area."}
{"text":"One of best American restaurants I went. Nice ambient and fresh delicious food. Great service- especially soup is my favorite along w draft beers. Best happy hour - best wings ever I tasted for $5 . Amazing. $9 piggly wiggly. We are going back tomorrow for lopster bisque for $5 for cup and big bowl for $8. The thing I love this place is service. The server is very friendly but doesn't interrupt your conversation or eating. They know exactly when we need something then bring them. Very comfortable- we can enjoy really delicious food. Not for lopster bisque- it was too watery-no taste. However everything else's was perfect. We especially like portobello mushrooms sandwiches- even second day it had the same taste. Awesome."}
{"text":"Menu has something for everyone. Tender brisket. Fresh, poached shrimp salad. Beautiful prosciutto wrapped asparagus.   Delicious miso salmon, perfectly cooked. (I hate dry overcooked salmon.) The highlight were the grits -- so airy and delicious. As a Pacific Northwesterner I admittedly know very little about grits. But for the first time I wanted to eat more of them. Loved the atmosphere. Clean, spacious but with a hint of comfy farmhouse. Server got everything right but I don't think she really enjoys her job."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Fun atmosphere.  Loved the menu with so many terrific selections to choose from.  When we were in doubt about something (the grits? which pie?) the server just brought a dish of each to try as lagniappe, as he said: a no cost extra.  Both were outstanding, by the way.  I had the best brisket ever and the filet of beef was superb.  What ever you do don't miss the Key Lime pie!  The drinks were ample, not stingy served in small glasses over a lot of ice as so many Valley restaurants have begun to do.  Since the menu is broad, we will come back often whether for lunch or dinner.  This place is a real WINNER!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time tonight and were very impressed by it. It has a nice atmosphere, the service was good, and the food was amazing! I had the portabella sandwich on ciabatta bread. It was delicious and I loved that it was cut in four smaller pieces. There were a number of sides I could have chosen but I went with the french fries, which were thin, crispy and well seasoned with a slight kick to them. The pork chop was thick but well cooked and juicy. It comes with a fairly tasty spinach salad. For dessert, I highly recommend the Key Lime pie. Our waiter said it is something they are known for and I can see why. Some of the best Key Lime pie I have ever had! The slice was a good size and just the right amount of sour, tangy and sweet! Overall a great new find!"}
{"text":"I'll eat here if all the lights go out in Africa, Paris, Rome or Phoenix...these people will cater my wedding, my funeral, my granddaughters graduations, my 50th birthday bash, my 60th birthday bash, my new hairdo, my bad hair day, my new lottery winnings, my church anniversary....what am I saying? This restaurant is #1 - hands down!"}
{"text":"The food was good, I would give it 4 stars. However, the food takes FOREVER to come out of the kitchen (or was my waitress just bad?) either way, plan on waiting 45 mins for dinner and at least 30 for dessert (and that's only if you remind them). The place has a nice atmosphere though. I'll come back when I have 3 hours to kill on a meal."}
{"text":"Great ahi tuna sandwich. Nice beer selection and decor. Get a slice of Key Lime pie for dessert. One order is more than enough for two. That didn't stop me from finishing mine all by myself. Grandma would be proud."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food, atmosphere and service. It is near where I work so I visit frequently. I've yet to have a bad experience."}
{"text":"I've been here 4-5 times for lunch, happy hour and dinner...love it.  The team is great/cheerful, the food is interesting and the prices are right.  Happy hour is livelier than I would guess for a new restaurant and Dad's Grocery Bag and Tuna Poke are delicious.  They have some different beers that I don't see too often and the wines on tap are interesting.  They did a great job on the decor and can't wait til it warms up to sit outside.  Until then, I like the over-sized bar and the community table."}
{"text":"What an amazing place finally came to the McCormick Ranch area of Scottsdale. Grassroots has an excellent menu of great dishes at reasonable prices. Great friendly atmosphere and terrific Happy Hour seven days a week. You can't go wrong with this choice."}
{"text":"We tried Grassroots for the first time tonight and loved it! My wife went all vegetarian with a portobello sandwich and a side farmers vegetable chop.  I didn't think I'd like either, but now I want to come back and get those for myself. I had the shrimp po boy. It to was delicious.  We sat out on the patio which had nice ambiance.  Can't wait to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I had the smoked brisket sandwich and it was delicious. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious! We dropped by for lunch and started with the burrata- the flavors of the tomato jam, arugula and burrata mixed perfectly. My husband had the ahi salad and I had the farmer's chop salad- both were really refreshing, full of flavor and filling. The brownie with ice cream dessert was perfect- the gooey warmth of the brownie with the cold ice cream made the perfect bite! The best part, though, was our waitress Melody, who was so attentive and genuinely sweet! I wish we lived in the city so we could come here more often!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer pitchers, huge kids meals, fantastic adult entrées.  Ive been dreaming of that fish sandwich since my visit.    Fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this quite gem of a place for several months now.  Grassroots is also owned by the same folks as Twisted Grove which is about 100 feet away.  What Grassroots lacks is snobbery and attitude, which is refreshing and often found in abundance in Old Town.  Such a welcome change.   The atmosphere can be described as a refined casual.  You will not be blown away by flash and glitz and tuxedo clad servers where some self-entitled customer is attempting to impress his date or friends.  What you will find is setting of warmth that is conducive to building a closeness, friendliness and intimacy that we all tend to seek when we share a meal with.    The menu may appear to be on the smaller side.  However, there is enough breath in the selections to satisfy anyone's desire.  Additionally, what seems to be a staple item within restaurants, Grassroots adds their own special flair to create something unique and make it their own.  For example, their \"boat load of wings\" is balanced very well between the chicken and wing sauce.  Whereas many restaurants tend to smoother the chicken with the sauce.  The ahi tuna salad is as delicious as it looks.  Furthermore, there is a consistency if the quality that will keep you returning  The glue that holds this establishment together is the staff.  They truly set the tone her from the moment you walk through the door.  Mangers Brittney and Shane will always greet you with a smile and humble enough to pitch in to help the servers.  Behind the bar, you might find Tatum who is true gentleman.  Also behind the bar you might find, Megan always attentive to the customer with a sparkling smile.  Joe who is warm and engaging and be your best friend by the time you leave.  On the floor, you might be lucky enough to meet Sarah who will keep you smiling throughout your meal.    Grassroots is very focused on the local market, catering to the locals cultivating repeat business, as opposed to the tourist and hipster crowds of Old Town.  Owner Chris, has done an exceptional job of staff selection and training as each member of his team is customer focused.  More impressive is  that they very much appear to care about delivering a quality product and experience rather than delivering an image and collecting a pay check.  Closing notes:  Try the Key Lime Pie, even share it if you must.  Also, the clock on the wall behind the bar is not a real clock do not rely on it if you need to be somewhere (Guys, can we get a real one that fits into the decor?)"}
{"text":"I use Yelp often, but this is my first review.  This place hits the perfect score not just from the top notch food, but the service is best I have seen..."}
{"text":"I went to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap with a decent sized group last Saturday night and we did not have a problem getting a table. The ambiance is perfect - it is relaxed, with an intimate feel to the place without being overly stuffy. It has a full bar in the middle of the restaurant and appears to have roll-up garage doors on one side of the restaurant for nice days. There are also community tables with game boards in the table (I only saw checkers but there may be other games).  In short, the food was phenomenal, which I expected based on my love for Wally's. I ordered the Roti and Ribs entree, which includes some ribs and part of a rotisserie chicken. It comes with Grassroots' cole slaw, which is not to be missed. The slaw has a slight Asian twist to it that is really delicious. It also comes with a side of beans - loaded with bacon of course. I also ordered a side of the shoestring potatoes. Everything was fabulous. Others in my party ordered burgers and the short ribs and they loved their food as well but my Roti and Ribs platter stole the show. I can't recommend that entree enough - it was absolutely delicious!  The staff was awesome, the service was awesome, the ambiance was awesome and most importantly the food was awesome. I will definitely be returning to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I thought I might have written a reveiw for Grass Roots already but I don't see it listed.     We had a GREAT dinner about two months ago because that's where we go for GREAT food, very fresh, delicious and nice size portions.. Everyone got something different and then we each sample each others plates! We're a sharing family!  I didn't take photos but was tempted to..  There is one thing that I give them an A+ for, and that is they have the BEST Cokes I've ever drank and it's not a fluke because they're always the same.   We live 2 blocks away so it's convenient, too. .  I think everyone will be happy with their meal here!    Best Regards,     A, J, A, K"}
{"text":"Oh my...where to begin! My friend and I just tried this place for the first time...we both loved our meals. The service was top notch, we did not wait for anything drinks refilled before glass was empty. My napkin fell on the floor, Idk how they saw that but before I could even pick it up they brought a new one. Our waiter was great! Cant wait to come back with my husband."}
{"text":"Our new favorite neighborhood restaurant. Great food, reasonable prices, excellent drinks."}
{"text":"Good salads and sandwich selection. We normally seat in the bar area and get good service. They do need to update their menu and offer something new. Getting old after one year with the same menu."}
{"text":"I probably come to this place too often but there are not a lot of restaurant choices by my office.  The name might turn some people off as not everyone is into healthy eating.  However... There are plenty of healthy and not so healthy choices to choose from.    My favorite choice in the \"not so healthy\" category are the jalapeño cheddar grits.  They are simply amazing!    Grassroots does a great job at accommodating just about everyone.  The service is usually a little slow but the staffs friendly attitude makes up for it.  Give it a try if your looking for something new."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Scottsdale for the final days of the 2014 Spring Training season. Stopped in to a favorite spot, Grassroots. They did not disappoint!  Started with a couple of craft beers and the Burrata starter. The Burrata with arugula and a house made jam over toast was really nice. The tuna poke starter was fresh with big chunks of fresh Avacado - great flavor. We shared the baby back ribs. They were tender and flavorful -- the BBQ sauce was killer!  The ribs were a bit scarce on the meat (I'm used to St. Louis cut), but tasted really good."}
{"text":"A really solid and consistent dining experience. Great food, delicious pies, and they have really amazing kids meals. The coconut and key lime pies are not to be missed. They have the best shoestring French fries, better than Houston's! The servers are attentive and pleasant, and so is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have been to Grassroots dozens of times and can't understand why all the reviews aren't 4-5 Stars.  The only negative I could ever say is that the inside dining area is only of adequate size and the outside patio is close to Hayden Rd and can be noisy.  This isn't a fancy/expensive steak or seafood house, just a great local spot that has ALWAYS had delicious food and wonderful, friendly service at moderate prices.   The jalapeno chedder grits side dish is superb, the pork chop that I often order is delicious, as all the main entrées that I've ordered have always been.  Try the fish sandwich - broiled or blackened - served with a different fish each day.  A favorite spot of ours for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went for lunch grabbed a seat at the bar and enjoyed some of the best service, friendliest people and excellent food. Poke starter well proportioned and flavorful (recommended side of coleslaw is a must) and ahi tuna salad were well balanced, well proportioned and reasonably priced for quality and freshness of food. Would go back in a heartbeat to have another key lime pie that was the best this side of the Mississippi."}
{"text":"Stopped into sample the food and was met by the head chef and he was very humble and welcomed us in like we were entering his house. If you are ever up in the area, you have to stop in."}
{"text":"The brisket is amazing and melts in your mouth. I rarely eat pie, but a friend talked me into the key lime pie. The limes are fresh squeezed daily and the pie is DELISH! A must have in my opinion. Domingo (aka Sexy Mexy) recognized my friend who has been before and even remembered the wine she liked. Impressed all the way around!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after flying into PHX from DCA.  Had a family of four with 2 kids under 10 yrs old.  Staff was really friendly and accommodating.  Food was great!  Good options for kids with food allergies as well."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! If I could give more stars, I would.   Food: We started off with the Tuna Poke. I've never had poke before, but theirs was delicious. I will most definitely try it again, and I can only hope that it is as good. For our entrees, we got the Prime Rib and Carolina Baby Backs. MmmMmMM! The Prime Rib was cooked to medium rare perfection and melted in our mouths. It's only available certain times, so get it if you can!! The ribs. Oh my goodness the ribs. As a southerner, I've had some good ribs in my day, but holy deliciousness Batman!! The meat slid off the bone, and the amount of sauce was just right. They provided a steamy napkin for clean up, which was much preferred over those tiny lemon scented wipes you normally get. For dessert we got their special of the day, which was a pecan pie with butterscotch cream. I absolutely loved it! My girlfriend, however, did not. And because she didn't, our server brought her out another dessert - coconut cream pie, free of charge. Turns out my girlfriend is allergic to coconut, so the server got her another drink instead. Much appreciated!   Drinks: We tried almost every cocktail on the menu. The Gimlet had a nice, subtle basil flavor. The Georgia Peach Tea was not overly peachy. The Pink Cougar, the Perfect Hound, and the Moscow Bull were all very refreshing. The White Sangria was a bit too sweet for me, but good nonetheless. My drink of choice is a Sazerac, and they made it perfectly.   Service: I cannot stress enough how awesome Kate was. She was very knowledgeable of the menu, attentive but not overly intrusive, sweet, and treated us like she was glad to have the opportunity to serve us. Best service I've had in the valley in a while. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night here!!Atmosphere was casual and upbeat and very comfortable.The menu selection had a great variety and the portions were just the right size to leave room for a yummy dessert.The food had great flavour,and was servered promptly by a friendly waiter.I would  definitely come back to this resturant again!!"}
{"text":"I visited this spot while shopping in Phoenix & based on the Yelp reviews decided to give it a try. The Shrimp & Grits that I ordered was very good, there was plenty of parking & seat available. Being from out of town, this place welcomed me in and I ate, drank & had an enjoyable conversation with the bartender."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week, it was kinda crowded and a bit loud but overall everything was very good. The Poke appetizer was very fresh and had plenty of shrimp with avocado and tuna. The burrata was excellent as well. The entrees we chose were the Shrimp and grits and the Short Ribs. Both excellent! The grits were awesome, so creamy and good consistency. The Key Lime Pie for dessert was very very good. Best I've had in Arizona. This place is worth a visit. Lots of wine and several beers"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 10 people for my graduation. First off, the hostess I set the reservation up with was super helpful and accommodating. The service was great and our servers were awesome. They were attentive, friendly and patient. There were no issues whatsoever and they helped make the night run smoothly. Also, the food was sooo so good (words won't do it justice, so just go eat there) and the craft beer selection was on point. In addition, the servers gave our group desserts for free! To make my long story short, fantastic experience all around! Side note-I unfortunately don't remember any of the names of the hostess/servers."}
{"text":"Another Yelp winner! Out of town and in Arizona. Looking for a nice lunch and we could've thrown a rock and hit this place. Reviews looked good, so we decided to try it. We ended up sitting at the bar and our server could not have been more friendly or more knowledgeable about the entire menu. This is a place that caters to an individual's tastes, preferences, allergies etc... Our lunches were excellent. Salmon was cooked perfectly!  They have a variety of menu items and I can say with confidence that you would not be disappointed with any one of them."}
{"text":"Great food and solid service. I have had most of the menu and strongly recommend the short ribs."}
{"text":"The food was decent, though a little on the salty side.  Ambiance is casual, and mellow.  We were surprised when the food was served before we had even halfway finished or appetizers. When we began to eat our food before it became cold our half finished appetizers were nearly whisked away. Also surprised that the Prime Rib being \"on Special\" didn't mean it was a special price, just that it was being recommended.  I don't think we will be visiting again very soon...though we are glad we have it a try."}
{"text":"Prefer chairs at the bar. A little nippy on here today. Very friendly staff. My husband loves the smoked salmon"}
{"text":"baby back ribs were excellent! as were the baked beans. can't wait to come back and try everything else"}
{"text":"Went yesterday. We sat outside the patio was awesome. I don't usually yelp but the service and food was spot on. had a salad and  ribs. Waldorf was a great salad and the ribs were super tender and on point.  Our server was very knowledgeable and knew exactly what he was doing without trying to hard. I don't remember his name but he looks like Zac Efron. Great spot hope they continue."}
{"text":"Super friendly place, great food. I had the roasted chicken that was terrific. Sit at the bar with Shannon for lunch. Do not miss the key lime pie."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I have to recommend the short rib for sure...just delicious!! There were 3 of us and we split a small salad, dads picnic bag, the ribs/chicken, and the short rib and still left full!  Can't say I was a huge fan of the coleslaw and the meat/cheese/bread app could use a mustard or something but everything was seriously fantastic!! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yumm love the salads, salamon and chicken. Can have a wait at lunch.  We doordash this place often."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. Angus burger cooked to order and good size. Roti & Rack wonderful seasoning and falls off the bone. Coleslaw some of the best ever. Coming here again !"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Great atmosphere. Great food. Great service.  Coconut cream pie was the best I've ever had.  Will definitely be back!  This place is a keeper!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Grassroots since it's opening and have never had a bad experience or a bad meal. They have a great beer selection, and wonderful food. My girlfriend and I are hooked on the Brisket sandwich, and often go there just for that sandwich. Their patio has really come along nicely, complete with heaters and misters, and herb gardens. Because it was packed recently, we braved the patio in the summer with the misters, and it was pleasantly comfortable (as long as you don't mind a little wetness). By far, one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants."}
{"text":"We have been to Grassroots many times since they opened and have always had a great experience. We went to meet various family members last week and as usual, had a great time. This time we had a wonderful server named Perris .  I think I spelled that correctly!  He was very friendly, patient and had a very quick, witty personality which we connected to right away.  He was as enjoyable as any server we have had in the past. Also, great to see our favorite bartender , Sarah as well.  We will ask for either of them on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Wanted a nice dinner for a night out and this place delivered.  We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation and got seated right away. The staff was very friendly and someone came by and got us water before our server was able to greet us.   We opted to go without appetizers and decided for cocktails instead (always a good choice). I got a manhattan which was served with one large ice cube and mixed to perfection. My wife had the Moscow Bull which is a Moscow Mule served with Red Bull and she liked it.  For my meal I ordered the fliet which was cooked exactly how I requested and hit the spot. I had the large asparagus with it which was very good. Wife got the Waldorf Chicken Salad and she enjoyed it. I have a large appetite and she didn't quite finish it so I tried some and I was blown away by how good it was. The mustard-honey yogurt dressing was incredible.  I would highly recommend this place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"The service was great, the wine was great, but the salad had no taste. My friend and I both had a Farmers salad and although it has a good mixture of items, there is no flavor to the champagne vinaigrette. We did get a small portion of grits to try and that was excellent. Next time that would be my go time item."}
{"text":"Overall food was okay though I have to say I don't really see the point of this place.  There is nothing on the menu that stands out as unique or interesting.. Good for a drink and chill but there are better places in the area and valley."}
{"text":"I have been going to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap since before they officially opened: my wife and I wandered in during their soft opening. The staff is attentive and extremely friendly, and the owner remembers our names and details about us ( we only go in maybe once every month of so). My favorite item on the menu is the Pork Chop. Rarely do you run into a restaurant who doesn't overcook the pork chop. I found their thick cut pork chop to be extremely juicy and have a very nice smoky flavor. I have tried the majority of items on their menu and have found them to all be extremely flavorful and worth the money. I have yet to be disappointed by any visit."}
{"text":"I wanted to try somewhere different  and came across Grassroots. What a excellent choice. The food and the service was great. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had lunch here a couple of days ago and the food was great (farmer's salad with salmon) and the service was wonderful (Taylor). The menu is wide and kind of eclectic with a combination of delicious salads, a great seafood selection and meat options, all with a new Orleans flair. The short ribs and pork chop looked fantastic!"}
{"text":"Loved everything we had which included the brisket, grits, blackened fish, dirty orzo, and key lime pie. I'm at a loss for words because I can't stop thinking about everything else on the menu I want to try. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Grassroots fills a severely underserved creative Farm-to-Table niche in central Scottsdale.  We thoroughly enjoyed a full front-to-back dinner, starting with the Grocery Bag Appetizer and the Pork Belly Appetizer, and enjoying the Red Fish Entree.   Our dinner guests enjoyed the Ahi Entree and Baby Back Ribs Entree, which are also highly recommended.  We are pleased to report that you will not be disappointed with a visit to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap.  The one downside is that I don't believe they have a Twitter page, so it is difficult to rave to the Twitterverse about how great they are, and I couldn't find a website either."}
{"text":"Ok, four people for dinner and the wait staff was fantastic, Nick did a great job along with his help! Had redfish (awesome) Brisket, rib and chicken combo, and ahi tuna. Everything was fantastic we will be coming back tomorrow. Appetizers were ok, brisket sliders and wings were ok, could do without but ok. Attentive staff, great service, good wine special, patio close to the road and busy but the dinner over took the noise from the road. Abby the hostess was fantastic!"}
{"text":"My gf found a hair in her ahi tuna salad! Never coming back! Get it together Grassroots!"}
{"text":"New favorite place! Been there twice already this week and can't get enough!! So glad I found this gem:)"}
{"text":"Awesome menu, fantastic service!  Tuna Poke was the best I've ever had. I've been craving the Brisket sandwich ever since I tried it a week ago!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night.  Staff was wonderful.  They were helpful and always attentive.   I was undecided on salmon or vegetables. The vegetable plate sounded wonderful, but I needed a little protein after a long day.  She let me know I could add a protein, just as on their salads.  It worked great.  I had the fresh grilled vegetables with a shrimp side.  The other person at our table had the BBQ brisket dinner.  I was given a taste and it was melt in our mouth tender.  We ended with splitting a piece of key lime pie.  It was one of the best I have had from a restaurant.    I would recommend giving this place a try.  We plan to go back again before we leave Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood Gastro Pub, love the chopped salad nothing but fresh veggies!!!"}
{"text":"Grassroots has an extensive beer menu and awesome southern inspired new American cuisine.  I had a blackened mahi sandwich that was super tasty.  The dining room is spacious and not too loud, a great place to enjoy conversation with the food.  The service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Good place to stop and eat and enjoy some good food you other wise would try. I HATE coleslaw and I LOVED theirs. Second time here and was not disappointed at all again. It's a must try and be open to eat anything."}
{"text":"We visited this location several weeks ago for happy hour on a Friday afternoon. The happy hour margaritas were very good.  Our server was great and upon his recommendation we ordered the beef sliders which where phenomenal.  We also ordered the salmon appetizer and it was just okay.  Very nice place but would probably visit other restaurants before going back."}
{"text":"Unlike the other comments, we found the food very ordinary.  I had roast chicken - which was very dry.  My husband had \"fresh\" fish of the day - which haunted him for 2 days.  The welcome service when we first arrived was excellent - very pleasant.  We received our water and menus very quickly.  After that - in spite of the fact that it was early and the restaurant and bar were not at all crowded - the service was very poor. Even though we were seated (per our request) on the outside terrace, the tables should have been clean.  They were not.  Many many wonderful restaurants in the Scottsdale area to choose from.  We most certainly will NOT return to Grassroots and encourage others to look elsewhere for a pleasant dining experience.  There are many to be had!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The ribs,  chicken,  and grits were awesome. Our server Seth was phenomenal! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food. Would highly recommend. Staff was great. Overall, just good fresh food which was prepared excellently."}
{"text":"Travis the manager is confrontational and rude! We were at Grassroots for our anniversary and had a legitimate complaint, and he was so rude and smug! I responded to his complete lack of respect and value for us as customers by quietly, calmly stating we plan not to return if he treats customers in this offensive manner; to which he shouted \"good riddens\"! I highly recommend avoiding this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  ~approached /acknowledged as soon as seated ~friendly & informative staff ~food & drinks brought out quickly but not rushed ~Our waiter, Joseph...top notch, knowledgeable, genuine  Excellent food!  ~Tuna Poke: outstanding flavor, fresh ahi...more please! ~ Brisket sandwich: great flavor, not too tangy, love the slaw that was in with it (tasted like there was some dill pickle *yum!*), crispy shoe string type fries.  ~ Special: Pastrami Sandwich: wow...excellent! With the tang of the mustard (although little dry), they need to add that to the regular menu. Opted for a side of asparagus spears that were huge & delish.  Nice, Cool place! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First time and I was satisfied that day. Glad that i had a great experience. Tasty dishes with fresh ingredients. The server was well! Had the Blackened fish sandwich and Hearts of romaine ."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a dozen times for lunch. Consistently really good. Great service, nice menu, quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Yelp scores again!  We would never have found this place without Yelp since we're from out of town.  The food was scrumptious.  We started with the smoked salmon appetizer which was delicious.  Then I had the \"almost famous\" pork chop, which was perfectly cooked and wonderfully moist.  It was accompianied by wilted chard which was very good.  My companion had the ahi tuna salad (and I sneaked a bite) - it was also exceptional.  The cocktails and service were also perfect.  Grassroots is highly recommended.  Had to edit my review to add dessert:  I'd add another star if i hadn't already given 5 stars.  We shared the toffee, sea-salt brownie ala mode.  OMG!  Worth every calorie (but share it)!  It was exceptional.  Exceptional simple and exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Fantastic atmosphere!  Fantastic staff!  We found this gem on yelp while on a business trip in Scottsdale from Missouri.  I had the short ribs and my wife had the shrimp and grits.  Absolutely wonderful!  And don't forget the homemade desserts, WOW!"}
{"text":"What a great find in the Hayden corridor.  From the street there is a big sign on the building but the restaurant is tucked back behind TCBY.  I would make the trip north for this one.    Started off with the house made salmon.  A very large portion of salmon smoked to perfection.  Really tasty and could be a meal by itself.  Had the burrata which was really yummy.  The tomato jam was super delicious and the arugula salad with the lemon beyond yummy.  Also got to enjoy Dad's grocery bag (love that name!)  this was a nice plate of cheese and meat.  It is a beautiful plate.  I had the sashimi ahi tuna salad and I loved it.  It was really flavorful and the tuna was done perfect.   Nice wine list.  The place has a nice vibe to it.  Go.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Wonderful. The service was great, the food was so delicious and fresh, and the wait staff accommodated my special needs. Great portion size. We realized half way through our meal that we hadn't touched our drinks because the food was so epic. Go here-it's worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, over-priced. Tried the portobello mushroom sandwich, not bad."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant.  From the name of it I would have guessed it would be a lot more local, organic and vegetarian.  Take note - only 7 non meat dishes on the menu.  Service was efficient just not real available - had to ask multiple times for drink refills.  Once we finished dinner & paid they ignored us.  Onto the food.  Nothing to write home about.  Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place. I'll start with the eye catching planters on the patio- tres' cool. Next, the ice cold brew was outstanding. I had an ahi sandwich that was cooked to perfection. It was remarkably delicious and memorable with that slaw and perfect bun. I oogled the salads of all of the ladies who do lunch and will definitely try one next time. Who doesn't love fresh, fresh ingredients and culinary prowess?"}
{"text":"Been here three times. Good food, nice servers, etc. Enjoyed the miso glazed salmon and asparagus. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Came here for first time on previous reviews from fellow yelpers.  Had the smoked salmon...was expecting slivers but it was a huge chunk of salmon..fantastic!  Salads are Huge and delish.  Coffee is served with real cream which you can taste and makes the coffee that much better.  Ambiance was great.  Service was great.  Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic find. The tuna poke was a delicious combination of ahi, avocado and shrimp - sort of a Mexican twist on a Hawaiian favorite. It worked!  The special was blackened reddish served with dirty orzo. The remoulade sauce hit the mark as well.  The salmon was also expertly prepared - slightly crispy exterior with a warm, moist center (but not raw).  Wait staff was also superb - \"Aidan on Heyden\" was enthusiastic, sweet and an excellent server. He even received my subtle clues about a birthday for one of our guests.  This was a great pick-I will definitely return when I come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"OMG! Where do I begin! Corinne, our bartender, was absolutely great! With a \"secret\" menu alcoholic beverage for my man and a special for me, she assisted with superb menu selections - neither of which disappointed!! Short ribs cringed and fell apart at the touch of my fork, baby back ribs falling off the bone, and the miso glazed salmon - perfect!! Atmosphere was astounding - locals embraced us with conversation as we sampled a variety of appetizers. I personally recommend Dad's Grocery Bag and the Smoked Salmon Dip. To round out your meal, you CAN NOT SKIP on the detectable Key Lime Pie - melt in your mouth goodness! I can't say enough about this spot and my experience. If you're ever in the central Phoenix area, do yourself a favor and drop in on Grassroots Kitchen & Tap!! Wine on tap also!!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid food.  I've been thinking to check this place out for a while, so I finally did it.  I had the short rib with a side of beets with honey and goat cheese. It was delicious! The beets was a special but I replaced the grits (I'm not a big fan of grits, in case you were wondering).  Even the ice tea was pretty good.  Although it was really good it was slightly pricey for what you get and the service was good but there's room for improvement for sure.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Fresh food friendly staff, I had the beef brisket it was very good mouth watering large portions for the lunch I had again very very good the food at this place is 5 star restaurant  beautiful place  great staff I will be back to this location they also gave us a very nice treat just because it was our first time there"}
{"text":"Colton, our Bartender/Waiter, was very informed on the Adult Beverages and Menu items...I'm a regular for the past 2 years now and I love every item I've tried. You don't wait for drinks or food or a Smile! Great vibe and people"}
{"text":"Amazing food, first time to area Loved the food. The desert place next-door is awesome try that out after dinner great ice cream the roasted walnut banana ice cream is off the chart"}
{"text":"Salads wee amazing!  Lobster bisque was well worth it. Loved how the drinks are all served in chilled glasses  The desserts are worth every calorie!' Atmosphere and waiters were top notch.  Only negative: my husband ordered the ribs and whole chicken breast but the way they cut the chicken takes half of the chicken breast off. When we asked the manager about it she said that is just the way they cut it. She was nice enough to bring us two complimentary desserts to our table of five.  Very customer friendly."}
{"text":"On our way to see \"Hamilton\" at ASU Gammage so time was of the essence.  We had a great server who was listening to us and took care of all of our needs.  We chose Angus burgers and loaded baked potato for one entree and it was simply delicious.  We were told that the potato would be ready at a specific time and we were not disappointed.  We sat outside and the service was wonderful.  While we were not hungry for dessert, we did order one slice of banana cream pie, to go.  That was outstanding.  The whipped cream was separate and placed in a container to allow it to be eaten later and not have it all slide together in the box.  Very thoughtful idea.  Thank you for a nice meal which contributed to our very pleasant evening.  \"Hamilton\" was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant! Friendly staff, clean, nice décor and the food is fantastic. Happy hour is great, try the signature Margarita! I had the Shrimp and grits and my friend had the Kobe sliders, both were excellent. Weather permitting, try to sit out on the patio at night time. Nice place for date night or to bring out of towers."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight for the first time and were lucky enough to have a server who made us feel extremely welcome and glad that we picked this place. Her name was Sarah Harvey (sp?) and her recommendations, and humor, were spot on! She made dinner much more enjoyable. From the food, the atmosphere to the service, everything was amazing! Per her recommendations, we ordered the short ribs, rotisserie chicken/ribs and all three were delicious. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and had an excellent experience both times.  First visit I had the shrimp po boy. Perfectly cooked shrimp and a perfectly soft bun for that type of sandwich. Shoe string fries are don perfectly. I also got a side of the cheese and jalapeno grits which were pretty darn good.  Second visit I got the braised short ribs. HOLY CRAP. Best short ribs I've ever had. Very nice portion and the meat... oh the meat... SO damn tender and juicy. Only forks needed for this dish. Had a side of their slaw also. Interesting mix with a light \"sauce\" which consisted of only cabbage and parsley. Slather on the Crystal hot sauce they have on the tables and it was damn good.  Hear from others the fish sandwich is also exceptional. Its on the same bread as the po boys. Perfect for a delicate sandwich.  Salads looked great too. Nice portions.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Good was delicious. We sat on the patio and the atmosphere was lovely. They served heavy cream with the coffee. The brisket in the sandwich was very tender. The green bean farmers plate special was very yummy with crisp green beans and feta cheese. I had the blackened fish sandwich and everything about it was yummy. Pickles yum. The bum and the sauce were delicious. All in all a very pleasant experience. Next time we have to save room for homemade pie!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been at Grass roots for eight months after a bad experience with a young male bartender who was more interested in flirting with female employees than serving. Tonight, my bartender/server was Kate. She served a half glass martini, was more interested in drying bar glasses for the following day than providing service, and was flirting with the male customers. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great casual dining experience. Went to dinner with friends last night. Service was excellent and everyone enjoyed their dishes; petite filet, swordfish, shrimp with grits and carolina ribs. We all fought over the 1 piece dessert we ordered to try, wow! The best banana cream pie I ever had. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been working in the Village at Hayden complex for over 4 years now, and my family has owned a business in the complex for over 15, so I've eaten at all the restaurants that have been in (and out) of the complex over the last decade and a half at least once, if not more.   It's owned by The Collins Family, proprietors of Wally's American Pub. The concept is really exciting to me. It's all about American favorites made with mostly local and always fresh ingredients of the highest quality. The decor is soothing, with excellent jazz-styled music for listening pleasure. The booths are large and comfortable, and the entrance for the patio is through garage-style doors. Unique, inviting, and pleasing to the eye. The other detail I noticed and loved was the weight of the flatwear. Maybe it's just me, but I really prefer eating a good meal with heavy and comfortable utensils.   The cuisine is what you're really concerned with, so I'll get to that now (finally!).  The only appetizer I've tried so far (because it's so amazing I can't stop ordering it!) is Dad's Grocery Bag. It comes with 3 cheeses (Manchego, Fresh Goat's Milk and Paremesean), 3 meats (Soppressata, Prosciutto and Capocollo), French loaf, olives, nuts and honey comb plated on a wooden cutting board, with the honey comb resting on a long-handled spoon. Now, if only my dad's grocery bag really carried all these delights when I was a little girl!  I'm a salad girl, largely because of my grain allergy (I save my grain consumption for delights like the bread and a craft brew), and they knocked the Seasonal Vegetable Chop out of the park. Tomatoes, beets, grapes, squash, corn, tomatoes, cabbage, manchego cheese and butter beans tossed in a parsley creamy champagne vinaigrette. Excellently executed, and something I would eat every day for the rest of my many-remaining days if I could afford to do so.   I've heard from a reliable source (my father, who is something of a fish nut) that the Blackened Red Fish was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection, as was the dirty orzo. And the Grilled Angus Burger is a serious meat-eaters delight, with excellent ground chuck and fresh veggies with Tillamook Cheddar.   Oh. And their hot tea! It's LOOSE LEAF brought to you in a nice little teapot. If only every dining establishment would recognize that loose leaf is so vastly superior to the bagged teas. Maybe they'll catch on soon.  For a restaurant that has been open less than a month, I have to say that they've completely hit it out of the park. My new fav lunch spot, in a complex where the Spotted Donkey, Zipps, and Tandoori Times vie for that spot. The Collins Family has another hit."}
{"text":"Good place, went for lunch, and had the burger, not the best burger but it was good.  Nice seating areas and good staff, although it wasn't that busy so maybe when Its busier there could be different review. Overall really good and would go back. (Could have a better beer selection)"}
{"text":"This restaurant as does it's sister restaurant continue to deliver good service and quality food for the price. I took out of towners and they loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Excellent, we are just visiting but if I lived here this would be a must go place at least once a month.  Food was great, no it was excellent and the service was just as good .  Really friendly staff.  If you live in Phoenix or just visiting take the time to go here."}
{"text":"Good for casual dinners. Second time here and atmosphere is always great, servers always attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and the food is high quality and very tasty. The service is wonderful! We had Kevin as our server and he was very accommodating and kind. The brisket is very well prepared as was the rotisserie chicken breast and the BBQ ribs are fall off the bone delicious. The sides are awesome as well and if we don't gobble it up before I remember to take a picture I'll post the brownie."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch at Grassroots today. Great service and an awesome atmosphere. We shared the Waldorf Salad, the Shrimp Po' Boy (my favorite), and the tuna steak sandwich. We also had the Ahi Poke appetizer and it was incredible. Can't recommend this place enough. 5-stars+, no brainer."}
{"text":"Definitely Scottsdale! The food was pretty good. The service was very good. Great location."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place pretty laid-back and very welcoming was served nearly have sitting down getting our drinks fast we started off with the smoked salmon probably the one of the best smokes and I've ever had not overly smoked didn't have the hard flash that you get some smoke salmon very soft and delicate love the sauce that came with it and the noble bread to definitely must I forgot the portobello mushroom sandwich that was surprising how good it was taste just like it had meat on it battles light and fluffy had a farmer's salad on the side probably would have liked it better if it didn't have so much mayonnaise in the dressing and space had service the match never need to ask for anything server was very good explaining things on the menu and could answer all my questions I had which lately it's a rarity overall this is a great place and not too overpriced Destiny will be back"}
{"text":"We came here last night based on yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. The hostess and waiter were supper nice and the food was great! I ordered a white sangria- asked them to make it a little less sweet than normal and they made it perfect. We ordered the cheese plate and it was good- Brie, goat cheese, and Parmesan. I wish they had put more unique cheeses, but they were good. For entree, we ordered the baby back ribs. OMG they were so good. The meat fell off the bones, there wasn't too much fat, and the sauce was spicy and unique. The fries were also good- totally fresh. We were too full to try anything else. I'd def come back- those ribs are one of the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Potentially the best southern-style food in Scottsdale! I went here for my birthday and treated myself to some of their delicious braised short rib. It was so tender that I could cut it with my fork. Rarely do any restaurant around here cook such meat to perfection. Additionally, it was packed with flavor. The asparagus and grits that came on the side were also memorably delectable. Near the end of the meal, the server treated me to a free dessert. Having a hard time choosing between all that they offer, I decided to go with the key lime pie. When I tell you that this was the best key lime pie I've ever had, I mean it to the fullest extent. The filling was made from scratch and tasted the part. The only downside to that dish was the crust. (I am being hard on them in regards to that since I am a pie perfectionist myself.) Otherwise, I couldn't complain about anything that they had to offer."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account just so I could write this review! My husband and I ate here a few days and ago, and I can't say enough good things! The food is fresh and delicious, the service incredible and the ambiance great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very well done new place with patio. We had a nice dinner experience with Salmon and thought it was done as ordered. The beer selection is good as well."}
{"text":"We went to grassroots last night for dinner and we both had the shrimp and grits and the toes the service was questionable they brought the wrong foods at the wrong time but the shrimp and grits were fair they weren't that good I was disappointed the grits for dried out a big glob a great big two big pieces of toast so I was very disappointed in the service wasn't great the ambience is great but the services off and the food I thought was not impressive so I'll try to again thank you"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner at The Grassroots last night. I had the chopped salad with chicken and my hubby had the pork sandwich with with the most incredible coleslaw.  We ordered the Thursday soup, the most delicious southwestern vegetable chili. A small cup is just a tease! Onions, butternut squash and tomatillo sauce made it irresistible, leaving us to want more!  The food had a great presentation and tasted awesome. We didn't leave a morsel on our plates.   The salad had lots of flavors and textures and was greatly complimented by roasted chicken that was moist and delicious. The salad dressing wasn't overpowering and the entrée portion size didn't leave me feeling totally full. I definitely had room for dessert.  The pork sandwich was served on a light white bread, sweet and sour pork barbecue flavors matched the fresh, light and crunchy coleslaw perfectly.   Apple pie was well done, beautifully displayed and paired up with vanilla ice cream and caramel. If you like cinnamon and sugar kind of apple pie, this dessert is not for you. If you like tart apples, you will enjoy!  I had a scoop of ice cream and banana with caramel. There was no way I could possibly embark on the ice cream banana split dish, it's for at least two people for sure!  We saw other dishes and desserts, people were very much into the ribs and the fries. There are a ton of beers and other drinks on the menu, but we loved the iced green tea infused with pomegranate. An awesome experience, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"I took my boss and my mother here for a nice dinner and they absolutely loved it! Great place good wine awesome staff! Couldn't have been a better dinner! I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"A+ service from Nick. Food was great. Atmosphere a little too snooty for my taste but that is common of the area and just a personal preference."}
{"text":"They discontinued their two best dishes, thereby eliminating the only reason why I came here. One was the Cardiff Salad with grilled Shrimp, the other was the \"Piggly Wiggly\" BBQ ensemble. I could eat their Cardiff Salad every other day of the week. Why? Why? Stupid change just for the sake of change ruins every business."}
{"text":"If you dine here and don't enjoy their 85259 Creamy Burrata... Well I just don't know if you know what a fulfilled life tastes like :) !  We were so happy when Grassroots moved into Town & Country central Phoenix (now we don't have to tolerate the Scottsdale cougar & spoiled kid scene at their other location). Service at the north location is appalling and I won't... Can't go back there! But I digress.  The shrimp PO' boy is amazing and our favorite smoked brisket is here too!  We've got the fat kid & prego chick syndrome so we make no apologies when we order these hearty, hefty entrees together.  On the lighter side their salads are delish (Cardiff is my favorite).  Omgoodness! I almost forgot...even better: you can purchase their amazing dressings by the pint and take home for nearly a month's worth!    Great place to take everyone because anyone can find everything they like on the menu! Laid back casual dress setting... Very Phoenix :)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Too bad I didn't take a picture.  Was there for lunch for the first time and the server recommended \"anything with ahi\".  He said it was phenomenal.  So we said very well, bring it on.  Let me tell you, this was hands down the best ahi tuna I've ever had.  Fish was fresh, they get daily shipments, amazingly tender.  It was smokey and had a great crust that had pepper and other spices.  It was phenomenal and I can't wait to go back just for that salad."}
{"text":"Lunch on Saturday and it was amazing! Sat on the covered patio which had a wonderful atmosphere and was nice and cool.  Unique menu items and all of it delicious! I had the special of the day ... a salmon patty with avocado and arugula on flax seed bun accompanied by creamy jalapeño cheddar grits. For dessert a huge soft fudge brownie topped witj vanilla ice cream, varamel, and toffee bits. Had the BEST service from Mike! This was our first time here and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food: -Pork belly with spicy tomato jam/candied pancetta/toasted points, MUST GET (unless your religion prohibits otherwise) or you'd be missing out on some serious mouthgasm. -Root's bbq brisket/Harris ranch braised short ribs/Smoked brisket, all were just okay, lacked tenderness and did not have enough flavor, but again my snobby tastebuds were trained on mind-blowing STL BBQ -Jalapeno cheddar grits and bacon baked beans were great sides, though the bacon was clearly missing from the cup of baked beans  Service: -Consistently really awesome -The waiter gets triple gold lovable stars for recommending smoked briskets ($13) over blackened red fish ($25), even if I should've probably gone with the fish"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this fun place with terrific food. Have always been a fan of Wally's, and Chris, the owner, has proved he has all of his fathers talent and more. Try the bbq baby back ribs. Yum"}
{"text":"I wanted to go here because of all the good reviews on Yelp.  Strangely, when I asked locals about it, nobody seemed to know what it was (and they thought it was a vegetarian place because of the name).  Could it be Scottsdale's best kept secret?  Well I'm glad I gave it a try.  The smoked salmon appetizer is amazing.  Good food, good wine, good service.  I will come back here again as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  So good you'll never know how healthy it is!  Unique cuisine, beautiful presentation, and Service extraordinaire!  Ask for Lesta...she's the best!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  I had the brisket sandwich and jalapeño and cheddar grits. Perfect blends of flavor. Great service, even was able fit us in without a reservation which I'd recommend doing if you're going during busy times.  I tasted the half chicken and thought it was excellent also."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Beef brisket sandwich is incredible. Wife had omega burger  (smoked salmon patty w/arugula) also awesome. Adam our server was great. Service was as good as food!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here. I had the shrimp PO boy with jalapeno cheddar grits. It was amazing. My wife had the ahi tuna salad. The tuna was so fresh and delicious. Definitely  try the tomato jam."}
{"text":"Returned to Grassroots many times.  I ordered the chicken salad for lunch and it was delicious! The Yogurt dressing was perfectly mixed and the chicken was very tender.  They give you plenty of food to eat.  My spouse enjoyed the smoked brisket sandwich with a ton of shoestring potatoes. Yum!  The short ribs and trout are also an excellent choice as well as the burgers.  Can't find a bad meal yet!  Please try it if you are in the area, you won't be disappointed. A little pricey but worth it! Parking can be a bit of a problem so go early for dinner if you want a space close by."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite lunch and dinner spot. The farmers vegetable chopped salad was so tasty! I'm sure I'll be craving it tomorrow. My girlfriends ordered the poke something or other, the roasted asparagus and a fish sandwich. I was able to sample all of it and it was amazing. The iced green tea was wonderful too. The place is clean and charming and it seemed like there were servers everywhere. The food came out quickly, drinks were never empty and dishes were cleared promptly.  We sat on the patio which had heaters and wasn't too loud. I'm looking forward to my next visit for date night. I would suggest brighter lights in the bathroom. A girl's gotta check her teeth after a veggie salad. :)"}
{"text":"Fourth visit ,never disappointed ,great blackened Mahi mahi sandwich,great service ,genuinely nice young professionals. First time for dinner though and arrive at end of Happy Hour, on a Tuesday night ,place was packed and very noisy . Had cauliflower side which was feature vegetable and was great,with mustard sauce and crunchy nut garnish. Think I will stick to lunch time to enjoy in future"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great food, sizable portions. Just wish I had time to try more items"}
{"text":"Wonderful food & service. Everyone loved the grits & the short ribs were the best!!! The miso salmon was good, just not GREAT. The service was absolutely superb, they all work together well.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoyed a fabulous salmon and asparagus meal that was perfectly prepared !  Our marvelous waitstaff, led by Joslyn, treated us all very nicely. They magically knew when we wanted to order and returned precisely when we we ready to order the absolutely delicious large portions of key lime pies!  Five stars to our waitress and the entire team !  Thank you"}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening. The restaurant was well appointed and very comfortable. Our server Dwayne was on point and helped us through the menu. The drinks were great. The shared plates hit the spot. And you will be making a big mistake if someone in your party doesn't order the blackened red fish. We will be back again."}
{"text":"shrimp and jalapeño cheddar grits were so good.  also had the key lime pie which may have been one of the best key lime pies ever.    service was good and fast.   a great spot for a casual and delicious dinner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend flew in from Thousand Oaks, CA to spend the day with me and my hubby and I wanted to take her to a special lunch. We got here about 1 PM for a late lunch and it was perfect timing as the lunch crowd was already leaving and there were only about 3 other tables being served. We were all hungry and didn't know what to expect.  We were not prepared for the culinary heaven we were about to experience.  OMG. OMG. OMG.  We started with an appetizer called Dad\"s Grocery Bag which was served on a cutting board and had a ciabatta loaf, artisan cheeses, cured meats,  country olives and mixed nuts. The bread was warm, the cheese rich and meats robust. We pretty much inhaled this appetizer and were ready for what we really came for and that was for the Carolina Baby Back ribs.   Two of us ordered ribs and my hubby ordered the Tri Tip Sandwich. The ribs came two different ways I ordered the full rack of ribs that came with the shoestring fries, my friend, the half of rack of ribs with the roasted chicken, asparagus and coleslaw. Let me first start with the  Try Tip Sandwich. Once my hubby saw our orders, it was game over. While he enjoyed his sandwich, he said it was an 8/10 he was agreed that these ribs were one of the best ribs we've come across.   Like I said, GAME OVER, these ribs fell off the bone every so slightly without any effort. The ribs also had the BBQ sauce spread out evenly and nicely (not too heavy, not too light) and had just the delicate balance of spices and sweetness. The portions were huge, I felt guilty having a whole rack of ribs in front of me, after 2 bites, I so didn't want to share these ribs with anyone. Not even my beautiful husband. But sadly, he talked his way into eating half of my rack. Now folks these ribs were so good, that we decided to just forgo our manners and not try to use our forks and knives to get the meat off. After the 3rd rib, we just started picking them up and yes, we used our hands at a white table restaurant. After all, there were hardly any people there.  I enjoyed each and every rib and savored the experience. All three of us agreed that this was the most perfectly cooked rack of ribs we've ever tasted. As far as the shoestring fries and coleslaw, the fries were lightly salted, nicely cooked and tender. The coleslaw was just right, not too mayo tasting and looked like a really healthy salad.  But we weren't done...  When we found out that the key lime pie and the brownie were homemade, we had no choice but to order it. Why not right? We already polished off 1.5 rack of ribs, beautiful bread, artisan cheeses and prosciutto.   The key lime pie was perfect. Not too sweet, not to tart and the crust and filling melted in your mouth. The brownie was excellent, moist and not too sweet. The portions of both the desserts were for sharing, which means between the three of us we only ate half of each portion.  All in all service was great, friendly and attentive. So with the specialty ice teas, 1 appetizer, 3 lunch entrees and 2 desserts, the lunch was about $140 with tip. Not too bad for a piece of heaven.  And if you're wondering if we'll be returning here the answer is YES. YES. YES.  After four months living in Phoenix, this is one of the best restaurants I've been to and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! I took some co workers who were visiting from out of town here and they were so impressed. The restaurant was very busy but our server was great and we could not have been taken care of any better. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place - unusual, varied menu with a southern slant. This place was very busy but not overly loud due to nice insulated ceiling panels. Service was excellent and friendly. We arrived during \"Social Hour\" (their take on Happy Hour), and our table ordered the brisket sliders and a Piggly Wiggly appetizer platter (baby back ribs, prosciutto-wrapped asparagus, and pork belly). The ribs were the highlight of the latter - fall off the bone tender and very flavorful. The sauce was a bit spicy and not too sweet. Our friends enjoyed their brisket sliders, commenting that they would definitely order them again. Our friends had the \"Roti & Rib Combo\", and echoed our thoughts on the deliciousness of the ribs. We had the shrimp & grits, very tasty and spicy - but we wished that the grits had been a bit creamier. Dessert (which we almost never order) was wonderful - our friends shared a piece of key lime pie that they said was excellent, and we shared a HUGE chocolate toffee brownie topped with Sweet P's wonderful vanilla ice cream. The brownie was sweet but delicious when paired with the ice cream.   We will be back to further explore the menu, and while mulling over our next choices we'll be sure to enjoy a craft beer or two...they have a very nice selection on draft."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing. The veggie farmers market, Poke, cheddar jalapeño grits and shoestring fries.... It was a difficult choice, as everything looked incredible! Looking forward to the next visit"}
{"text":"Wonderful lowlands food with decor to match. Good drinks. Pork chop and fish dishes are first rate. Ribs don't live up to the other foods, but just not the locale for real smoked pig. Gumbo was spiced very nicely but roux seemed a bit burnt. Reasonably priced.   High energy but not loud. We will be back. Maybe will try eating at the bar next time."}
{"text":"First time, it was a great experience! Cool vibe, chill music, and friendly staff! I had the smoked salmon appetizer it was cooked so nicely. The side options were listed on the side of the menu, sides on the side of the menu was a cool thing. The server was a tall guy w dark hair he was super attentive and informative and friendly. My friend had the cheese and nut appetizer, it came with a huge loaf of delicious bread! Will be heading back on a day when I get wine and chill on the patio!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, but the food was not that great. The baked potatoes were undercooked, and my medium steak was raw in the middle. I sent it back, but it came back the same, so I just gave up. I won't be back, which is a bummer because it is right down the street."}
{"text":"A-OK. That's what I have to say about Grassroots.  It's not a negative review by any means. Would I go back, probably not. I'm moving out of the valley and currently live in Central Phoenix. Scottsdale isn't a place I frequent often.  BUT, we were across the street signing the final documents at the title agency for the sale of our house, and we asked for a recommendation from our realtor for lunch. He said Grassroots. Nice and fresh. So away we went.  It was just before 1pm on a Friday afternoon. We walked in and they said immediate seating at the bar or a wait of about 15-25 minutes for a table. We opted to wait, though that ended up only being about 10 minutes (or it went by fast). Luckily they have adirondack chairs out front in the shade for relaxing.  We were seated on the patio, a little warm at first on a 100 degree day, but once the misters kicked on it was pleasant. Menu was appealing. Husband went with roti & ribs and I had the seared ahi tuna. Ribs were good, chicken was dry. Tuna was delicious (though they were unnecessarily heavy handed with the sauce) and the salad was tasty, but the cole slaw large and too much. Too much cabbage. We shared the key lime pie for dessert. It was light and creamy.  If you're in the area and want a nice fresh meal, try here."}
{"text":"OMG! Scallops (If they have them) and grits!!!! I thought I died and went to heaven! If not, the shrimp and grits will make you slap yo momma! Excellent service topped off wonderful birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"These guys always do a good job. I love the food it's upscale comfort food. I encourage you to get the brisket, chicken or shrimp and grits. They are all fantastic!"}
{"text":"I came in late one evening after landing at the airport and sat at the bar. It happened to be restaurant week so I ordered the three course special with the burrata, shrimp with grits, and key lime pie.  It was a lot of food for a very reasonable price. The shrimp were good quality and creole flavor was fantastic. Of course the grits were very rich so I left a lot on the plate. They were a little bit oily for my taste and the bread wasn't very good so I left that as well. I wished I had ordered something a bit healthier but can't blame the restaurant for that. Next time I'd like to try the New Orleans redfish dish on the menu. Seemed like really good quality seafood especially for the price. Very friendly bartender who went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable."}
{"text":"OMG.. so my girlfriend and I are food snobs and this place was amazing. She has the briskets dish and I had the blackened red fish. Just amazing. Great wine selection at very affordable prices. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Even the temperature of the food was just okay. The menu wasn't really that exciting. so I just had the soup of the day and salmon appetizer. Very bland salmon and the toast that came with it was very oily. My husband had the BBQ brisket and I thought it was fatty and tough. He said it was okay and agreed about the toughness. We ordered key lime pie, but did not like it so the waiter took it off the bill. On a positive note, the server was very knowledgeable and friendly; he seemed to like working at this place. The restaurant was clean and reminded me of a restaurant I'd find in a beach town."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of things on the menus and haven't been disappointed but I would recommend the burger!"}
{"text":"Amazing pork belly appetizer. Picked it up night before to have as part of my breakfast and it was still SO good. First time trying Grass Roots. Can't wait to go back to have dinner."}
{"text":"This place is.so.good. While we have yet to pop in for happy hour, my neighbors say it's great.   The food is proportioned appropriately and it's all very tasty. Drinks are delicious and there is something for everyone. It's a great spot for a fancier lunch or a quiet date night. The patio is beautiful and fully covered...a must in AZ."}
{"text":"This place serves hearty portions and makes great drinks.  Came here after hiking camelback and nobody batted an eye at our casual dress. So that was nice!   Tuna poke was yummy but the burrata was the app winner. Tomatoes, cheese and grilled bread came together for a really delicious bite!  Had the ribs and roti. Damn, that's a ton of food. There were easily 2 cups of Cole slaw on my plate, plus a ton of chicken and ribs. You could eat the ribs with a knife and fork because they were so tender. Definitely would order again!  Also, I ordered the gimlet which was delicious. Wish I had savored it a bit longer but it was just so tasty I couldn't sip it slowly."}
{"text":"The ahi tuna steak was good, the homemade tangy slaw (cabbage) was crispy and flavorful as well.  The cherry tomatoes were great and I can avoid the bleu crumbles, they were a bit on the saltier side.  The ribs looked pretty good so I may have to try this next time.  I went for the tuna because I saw the poke.  Though I didn't order it."}
{"text":"This will be a must-go whenever I am within two hours of a Grassroots Kitchen and Tap.  The ambiance is really cool and funky.  Very much going for that \"home-y\" feel.  Lots of wood, benches, communal table, etc.  It is a very inviting place.  Then there's the food.  The brisket sandwich was one of the best I have had.  SO good.  Fries were pretty good.   To me a \"Tap\" house should have a bit more exotic beer list, but they did have some local brews and hipster flair, which served me well, and really, when have I had a beer that was \"bad\"?  the seasonal chop was not really what I was expecting.  It tasted good, but it was not what I think of as a chopped salad, it was more of a slaw with a bit of Greek salad influence.  I just left that place feeling very good about the experience, and wanting to return."}
{"text":"My favorite kind of place. Casual atmosphere with amazing food. Highly recommend! When you're done here head next door to Sweet Provisions for dessert."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I wish there was a 4.5 stars, cause it would get it.   Fresh, clean menu and good drinks.   Can't ask for much more than that."}
{"text":"What a find!  We wanted a great meal before we headed to the airport.  We were not disappointed.  We enjoyed the yummy pork belly appetizer, great salad and Po boy shrimp sandwich.  Wait staff was attentive and food so delicious.  Enjoyed looking at the cookbooks stacked next to my he table. A wonderful week experience."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp in between doctor's appointments. The reviews were dead on! Grassroots did not disappoint!  All I can say is WOW!! I had the Best Shrimp Pro Boy and Oh My The Jalapeño Cheddar Grits Were The I've EVER Had! I can never have plain grits again! I went home & asked my boyfriend to make some for breakfast the next day!  My server Kimmie at bar was the nicest! Matter of fact, everyone was really friendly and super helpful! Casey even helped me out to my car since I'm on crutches! Based on the service alone...I'll be back!! But, to top it off the food is Amazing!  Plus I really like the ambience and their setup is really Nice ! They have an enclosed outdoor eating area but yet it's indoors! You have to come here! I definitely will with friends! I only wish we had one closer to the Ahwatukee or Chandler area! But, I'll definitely make the drive to North Scottsdale!  5 Stars!"}
{"text":"The salmon dip was great but with the bread from the cheese. The cheese was strange. Didn't like it very much. The wings were nice. Kids meals were satisfying. I may come back eventually but not craving. Prices on entrees were a bit much. Happy hour was very limited."}
{"text":"The roasted Brussels sprouts get 5 stars. Everything else was 1 star. I ordered the spit fire chicken. It tasted reheated - dry and lifeless. The grilled asparagus also tasted reheated. The atmosphere is not great. It is a shopping mall restaurant. The host annoyingly turned down the lights 3 times during our meal, apparently to try to improve the ambiance."}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service.   We had the short-Ribs and shrimp and grits.  The short ribs were very tender and flavorful.   According to menu they were served with male per o and cheddar grits however the grits were literally flavorless.   The shrimp and grits were on the spicy side but very good.   We ordered key lime pie because of the great reviews.  It was very good but have had better.  When they tell you the serving size is a 1/4 pie keep in mind it is a very small pie they are referring to.  My biggest complaint is I couldn't read the menu because of the lighting and the light print menu.   They didn't have any small flashlights so I ended up pulling up the menu on my phone.   If not for the tasteless grits and inability to read the menu it would earn 5 stars"}
{"text":"We had a really enjoyable meal at Grassroots with my Grandma and Husband to celebrate our Birthdays.  We arrived on a Thursday night around 6pm and the place was packed.  We had to wait about 10 minutes, but thankfully a table opened up and we were seated promptly.  There aren't too many tables in this restaurant and the atmosphere is really nice, very open and clean.  Upon being seated, we were greeted and our server was very nice and helpful.  The food itself was very good.  I had the chicken salad sandwich without nuts (they were able to accommodate me) and my Grandma and Husband both had the brisket sandwich.  The chicken salad was very good, but the bread it was on was AWESOME!  It was buttery and toasted perfectly - so good.  The Hubs loved his, as did my Grandma and the grits, which I tried, were unique, creamy, and very flavorful. Grandma got the root beer float for dessert and loved it.  The Hubs and I shared a banana split, which I thought was just OK, the strawberry ice cream was my favorite part.  All in all, I cannot wait to go back to this restaurant.  I loved the menu and look forward to trying some different things out.  Happy hour looked good as well, so perhaps we will hit that up next.  Awesome new place to add to our go-tos!"}
{"text":"Great selection of cajun influenced southern food you would find on menus along the Gulf Coast.  My goal is to go often and try everything!  We started with the Tuna Poke...fresh and delicious!  Then I tried the Portobella sandwich on a wonderful bread.  Then we had the award winning Coconut Pie!  Simply delicious.  Friendly service!  Definitely on my regular list to dine!"}
{"text":"As fresh as it gets!!  I had the farm salad full of chunky awesomeness and followed it up with the Ahi Poke.   Throw in a couple of ice cold beers, and that makes for an amazing dinner.   Love this place...."}
{"text":"I'm really sad to give this place one star. The food is awesome and I love the atmosphere, which is why I planned a triple date with my fiancé and friends here. Our waiter ( I believe his name was Michael) was so rude the entire meal. The few times he did speak and or respond to us he was condescending and acted as if we were putting him out simply by being there. If I ever do decide to come back I would certainly hope he isn't working or I would request someone else. Maybe since we had 6 and they auto grat tables of 6 or more he knew he didn't have to work for his tip. Either way he was miserable to be around."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here. I had the cheeseburger with fries. My GF had the spit fired chicken with rice pilaf. Everything was really tasty and the wait time was almost nonexistent. Our experience was awesome from start to finish. Caitlyn was very pleasant, patient and kind. The pork belly appetizer was delicious. I will definitely be coming back to try more delicious menu items. If you are on the fence about trying this place, do it! You will not regret it at all! Five stars would do more if yelp would let me."}
{"text":"Great food and great service are a wonderful combination. We started with the charred Brussels sprouts and they were yummy. The roasted garlic cloves are a nice surprise and we enjoyed the fun presentation of a very good appetizer.  I really loved the shrimp and grits. Spicy shrimp combined with pork belly is always an awesome mix. The jalapeño grits are a beautifully spicy upgrade from normal grits. Very tasty. I also thoroughly enjoyed the grilled focaccia although I only ate one slice since I unfortunately offered my wife a bite and she immediately grabbed the other slice off my plate along with some of the perfectly cooked shrimp.   She ordered the short ribs and I did a retaliatory steal. They are absolute delicious. Rich with flavor, they are also served with jalapeño grits which is an interesting combination offsetting the sweetness of the short ribs with a bit of bite from the jalapeño. Very nice. They're served with grilled asparagus which my wife said were perfectly done.   The best part of the meal was the service. The server didn't hem and haw when we asked her what she liked best and she kept the iced tea glasses full. She was witty and funny, but not obtrusive in any way. It's the way service should be.   This is definitely a place we'll head back to."}
{"text":"Came in Friday night and had a great experience at Grassroots and the food was excellent.  Sydney our server was awesome!  She was cheery and helpful and checked on us often.   I love the atmosphere from the moment I walked in.  It has a great vibe and everyone is very friendly.  We ordered heavy appetizers and everything came out perfect.  The dessert was yummy!  Key lime pie and brownie.   The manager checked in on us to see how we were doing.  It was a great experience and will definitely be back.  We will request Sydney for sure."}
{"text":"We stopped in here the other evening before going to the theatre and had an excellent meal. Yes, they've hit all the current trends, farm-to-fork, craft beer, wine, even a bicycle on the wall, but they've put it together in a really nice way.  The food was excellent, I had the pork chop, my wife had the scallops, and I tried a local craft beer. Service was great and fast, especially when I told them we had theater tickets so we couldn't dawdle, and the setting was excellent.  This is definitely a place that I would recommend and one to which I will return."}
{"text":"Delish! Brisket sandwich awesome but a little messy. Best eaten with knife and fork.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I went here a month ago when I was in Phoenix on vacation. The service was good and the food was fresh & tasty.. I would return here the next time I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service.  My new favorite restaurant. Short ribs are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst service experience at grassroots over on Hayden and via de Ventura. We used to like this place, I will never come back. Jason the manager was the opposite of what would be a good manager. The service was slow the food was cold  - and he was less than accommodating."}
{"text":"I visited Grassroots for the first time about six months ago.  Since then I have returned many times.  Often going out of my way and past many other great restaurants to do so.  I am so glad they decided to steal the Brussel Sprouts Appetizer from their sister restaurant Twisted Grove.  I really didn't know I was a Brussel Sprout fan until I had this gem!  Brussel Sprouts, Roasted Garlic, Candied Bacon, with a Balsamic Drizzle, I am salivating as I write this.  If you like fresh food and great service, you will definitely no be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here on recommendation of reviews and was not disappointed.   I have been traveling and eating on business expense all week and eating some disappointing meals at expensive places.   I decided to come down here for Something more casual.  So glad I did.    The beef short Rib came with grits and vegetable- very tasty. The sort rib was excellent.  Nothing fancy but perfectly done with a complementary sauce.  I think they must have browned the meat first before braising for hours.  It was so flavorful.   I nearly ordered Caesars salad but ordered the mixed chop instead.  So glad I did. It was fabulous - a mixture of many different vegetables in a light dressing with different shaved cheeses enhancing the flavor.  Simply delightful.   And the local Pilsner was also very refreshing.    Service was also friendly and attentive.   I don't often get to give 5 star ratings. Love this place."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I took a friend for lunch as a birthday celebration.  The server was really pushing some salmon burger special describing how moist and flavorful they were, and sadly we both ordered it!  They came after quite some time.  One burger had all the ingredients described, and the other had no arugula, no red onion, none of the other stuff, and they were both so dry they crumbled and were very hard to swallow [even after a lot a lot a lot of chewing].  The server never came back to ask how things were, though she did stop and see it was very hard to eat and we left most of it on the plate.  The side salad was horrible -- like all the leftovers from the refrigerator.  One of us had the slaw and it was good!   We've had WAY BETTER and we expected way better from a place that touts all the quality ingredients and care in preparation -- they might want to work on that -- especially on quality control!  I think they were just trying to get rid of old salmon -- that's what it tasted like."}
{"text":"Our family eats here once a week. Being mostly veggie and seafood eaters, the menu suits us - we each have a different favorite dish, from salad to salmon to grits. My husband is a New Orleans native and the remoulade satisfies him. We have always had good service and good food. The ambience is also terrific; the patio is warm and comfortable."}
{"text":"We came here for my 'birthday lunch' ... it was just ok.   Service was friendly, yet a little inattentive.  The decor is nice, I loved the big booth we sat at.  I ordered the Miso Salmon and asparagus, I was very underwhelmed (and left hungry!)   I ordered a glass of Prosecco and asked for a strawberry to put in the glass - my glass arrived, no fruit, no explanation UNTIL I asked and was told they only have vegetables, no fruit in the kitchen???  I have food allergies - they don't really cater towards that. No dairy free deserts. (Not even sorbet)   My son LOVED the French fries - so they were a winner!   Over all, not somewhere I would rush back to... but I am sure it would be a lovely meal out for people less picky than myself ha!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch and amazing service.  Their smoked brisket sandwich was incredible.  Plus their patio is perfectly covered and comes with misters, which will make this a great place to stop by during the summer."}
{"text":"With a name like Grassroots (basics), you would think that hospitality would be part of the customer experience. Not here unfortunately.  The owner/manager, is arrogant and basically a bully. He doesn't take feedback well nor does he train his employees properly to delight customers.  I was here for a business  meeting 4 days ago.  The food was ok. Service was ok.  I saw they had shrimp po'boy on the menu and told my husband about it.  I brought him here just for the po'boy, but unfortunately never made it to the food since the overall customer experience up to having drinks was not great.  We made a reservation for a booth, but when we got there they didn't have one.  They said they couldn't guarantee one. Why didn't they tell us that on the phone? We sat at the bar to have drinks, then within 10 minutes got moved to a table. No offer to help us move the drinks to the table .   We asked to speak to the manager. When he came over he was tapping his business card on the table. He immediately had a an attitude. He spoke to my husband telling him that he didn't train his employees to help move glasses to the tables. And he looked at me and said \"what about you?\" Huh? Not sure what that meant but I told him I had come here the other night and brought back my husband to try an item on the menu and he said \"keep 'em coming\" like I should keep coming back! We paid for our drinks and left.  Morale of the story here... Just because you own a restaurant doesn't mean you should. It's a customer service oriented business.  If you are not good at that don't own a restaurant or be smart hire a manager and staff that can provide great customer service."}
{"text":"One of the better culinary experiences of my life. Everything served is sourced locally and it shows.   Chopped salad was out of this world fresh and tasty.   Shrimp & Grits is a southern tradition that is hard to improve upon, but the cooks managed to do it with veggies and sausage.  Homemade Key Lime pie with fresh whipped cream was other worldly good.  Just go!"}
{"text":"I just came home stuffed and happy after my first visit to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap. Since it has opened, I had heard nothing but rave reviews....I'm happy to report it lived up to every single one of them. The service was amazingly helpful and friendly and the food was incredible. I work at Town and Country, so I will be going back quite often.  Well done, Grassroots. You've definitely gained my business."}
{"text":"Just had our daughter's surprise engagement party here and they were so accommodating, helpful, great service, flexible and kind!  The staff, especially the hostess, Lisa, and our servers were phenomenal.  Can't thank them enough for a wonderful evening! Oh, and the food delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to get great food and lovely atmosphere with exceptional service.  The food is absolutely amazing in taste and presentation.   I have been here for lunch and dinner many times and never disappointed.   Love their soups, salads and burgers and fries!  All so good"}
{"text":"Nice quaint trendy place with beautiful ofreshly made food. I highly recommend Grassroots. My husband had a couple beers (he can't recall the name) and shrimp and grits. Portion was sizable though not overwhelming. Shrimps was grilled. Crisp on the outside and tender to bite into. The jalapeño grits were creamy with a spicy sausage sauce over all. Not overly salty either like we've had elsewhere. I had a white sangria that was light and refreshing. My miso glazed salmon came with a nice portion of grilled asparagus with fresh lemon half. The salmon was tender and a bit crispy, exactly how I like my salmon. Everything was nicely presented. Our in-training server did an excellent job in answering our questions and waiting on us. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Adrien our server was fantastic:  good sense of humor, good timing (AKA not annoying), and kept the water glasses filled.  Now that I think about it, the host was very pleasant and accommodating as well considering how busy the restaurant was on a Tuesday evening.    I was actually here with two fellow Yelpers and we had a wonderful evening wining and dining!  We started off with the meat and cheese board known as the Dad's Grocery bag.  I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed, but the sopressata was delicious!    One person had the Shrimp Po'boy and she cleared the plate.  Not my kind of sandwich but she seemed very satisfied.  Another person ordered the Swordfish special and WOW!  It looked delectable! It was a large fish steak that was very tender to the 'forking'...is that even a word?  Anyway it was probably the highlight! It came with a side of cauliflower that was perfectly roasted:  tender with the right amount of crunch.    I had the ahi tuna poki with no avocado (see photo).  It was very refreshing and light on a scorching day with fresh ahi tuna, shrimp and green onion, accompanied by wonton chips to scoop it up.  It was perfect with my glass of wine.  I think I wish I had gone with the Grassroots Gimlet my friend had, but they may have gone down too fast and easy :)    I will be back to try more things on the menu and see our fabulous server Adrien!"}
{"text":"Go there hungry, leave there happy. When my appetizer (pork belly) arrived I told the server \"that's not mine\" because it looked big enough to be an entrée. It was delicious and I finished it, minus some of the bread it came with. The main course of chicken and ribs was also great, and the sides of slaw and baked beans were tasty in their own right. I finished with their moist and delectable chocolate brownie (served warm with ice cream)."}
{"text":"Excellent service and best Shrimp N Grits. So savory and lot of flavor. Great casual ambiance! Will return to this restaurant when visiting the Phoenix area again!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. My husband had the short ribs with jalapeño cheddar grits. Amazing, and I had the fillet mignon with loaded potato.  We were not disappointed at all.  This place is a must try"}
{"text":"Went here because the Yelp Reviews were very good and was not disappointed. On a Friday night at 8pm we were seated right away. The atmosphere is very relaxed. I loved the decor and the vibe. Our service was speedy without being overbearing. They got our orders without much wait and gave us plenty of time to sit and chat. The boyfriend got the blackened fish sandwich which he raved about. The pork belly beans were amazing. I got the farmers salad which was very fresh and good. The Lobster bisque was a generous portion for the bowl and was very tasty. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Aaah!! Finally! I found GOOD grits! So I came here after seeing the new one open in the Biltmore a couple months back, but didn't have the time to go to that location at this time. I came with my parents from out if town.. They are foodies as well and had a great time. The atmosphere is comfortable and casual, not swanky, but a lil trendy. I loved the layout of the floor. Our server was great, she came prepared with good recommendations and a smile. My short ribs were wonderful, and they were on some seriously creamy delicious grits, A+! My moms salad looked interesting, but my dad raved about his sandwich after he finish. It was so good, we lost contact with him during the meal. Ok check out my pics!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I worked in restaurants for 10 years AND I'm a health freak so I'm super picky about food..and service. First I have to say Austin is an amazing server. He did everything perfectly and he was so nice to talk to. We are definitely asking for him when we come back, which we definitely will be back!!! We were so glad there wasn't a wait and we were saying if this place was in NJ where we are from it would be at least an hour wait to sit down, and in NJ you judge how good a restaurant is by how many hours the wait is! The trout was sooooo delicious. I didn't leave one bite of food on my plate. Cocktails were spot on as well. I also didn't feel disgustingly stuffed full of heavy greasy fatty food which meant room for dessert. The banana split was delicious. I never get dessert so when I do, it better be worth it, and it was! I still didn't feel the gross kind of full I normally feel after dinner out which makes me so happy! I already have my server, meal and dessert picked out for our next visit (Austin, salmon, brownie). Can't wait. Thanks for such an awesome Friday night!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Made reservations and our table was ready. We had the chicken salad sandwich, brisket and burger. All were very fresh and tasty. Recommend when you are going to see a game at Talking Stick."}
{"text":"My husband and I took the family to dinner... A top notch wait/serving staff. As a restaurant owner myself,  I would be very proud of these young men and women and the wonderful jobs they were doing.  The interior was warm and welcoming. I felt perfectly dressed in a pair of colored jeans and a sweater.  Drinks came fast and strong.  Appetizer,  Dad's Grocery Bag was gone in a few mins.  This included three soft cheeses, prosciutto,  sopprassetta, capicola, a selection of nuts and olives, and a slighty stale and scored half bread loaf. Kids' burgers were all cooked to their liking.  My husband said his Spitfire Chicken was moist and juicy.  My Carolina Babyback ribs were very tender but lacked in their smoke ring and most of their smokey flavor.  They were good and I ate them; but i sadly missed the vinegar tartness I was anticipating from the bbq sauce.  The manager came over,  greeted us and asked about our meals.  He also sent over a complimentary dessert. It was warm and chocolaty with a nice toffee crunch.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Grassroots never disappoints!  I've been coming here since shortly after it first opened several years ago.  The wait staff are wonderful, friendly and accommodating.  The food is really good.  I especially like the short ribs, the miso grilled salmon, and the burrata appetizer.  The salads are really good too. Hit it during happy hour and the specialty drinks are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Grassroots is definitely my new go to place for lunch and dinner.  I haven't had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Saturday and sat outdoors on a nice day. The food was delicious and the waitress was very attentive. I would recommend this as a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Terrific all around restaurant.  Our food was delicious. I had the red fish with orzo which was a bit spicy bit with awesome flavor.  My vegetarian wife the vegetable chop and she enjoyed it but had to ask for extra feta cheese. We tried different draft beers and they were both good.  Since we are not locals, we appreciated the waitress offer to try it the beer before ordering. The meal was complete with a delicious key lime pie that rivaled ours from South Florida. The service was fantastic and we will definitely come back if we are in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to make it to Grassroots, but it's quickly become one of my favorite restaurants. My first visit was on Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. We got a pitcher of MBC's Celis White (I was so excited to see Michigan beer on the menu!), and I ordered the Waldorf salad. We had awesome service, enjoyed the atmosphere, and I was treated with a flower at the end of my meal.  Having lived in Scottsdale only a year, and there being so many different places to eat, there aren't many restaurants we've visited more than once. We've been back to Grassroots twice more in the last few months, and I wish we could take it with us when we move! We've never had to wait more than a couple minutes for a table (even on a Friday night), there are plenty of lower cost options on the menu, a great beer selection, and great service. The food is obviously delicious as well. I thoroughly enjoyed each dish I've had, including the cajun-spiced ahi tune sandwich and fries, and the roasted walnut chicken sandwich and jalapeno cheddar grits. All in all, it's a great place for some really good food, beer and atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I travel to Phoenix weekly for business, and this is likely one of the better restaurant experiences I had! It's a very unassuming place, and when I walked in, I wasn't expecting much, but we had a great experience! We split the buratta, and each had the tuna steak. They also have wine flights on Tuesdays - 3 wines for $10, which we were able to enjoy. It has a \"hole in the wall\" feel and decent food. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, drinks were left empty. Food was delivered 10 minutes before server checked on us. Hair was in our Cardiff salad. Refused to comp that item. Requested the manager, said it isn't their policy to comp poorly prepared foods. We were at least 4 time per month customers& will never go back. Dirty in Grass Roots, smelled like urine as soon as we entered restaurant. A real disappointment!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been here a few times and we had a really good experience. The menu is simple but the food is executed perfectly. The scallops dish is usually a daily special and is pure perfection. The shrimp and grits is a must try the cheddar jalapeño grits are very creamy not grainy and shrimp is never over cooked. Shrimp po boy is perfectly seasoned and the portion is quite large. For appetizers you can't go wrong with the creamy burrata and pork belly that is crispy on the outside but juicy and full of flavor on the inside. We are definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Very happy we chose to eat at Grassroots.  Entire staff is very nice and accommodating.  From the hostess to the bartenders to the wait staff...they are all super.    Made a table thru Open Table for 8:15 pm...we showed up about 30 minute early.  Had a drink at the bar and before we finished, they table was ready.    I ordered the baby back ribs and shoestring potatoes.  Wow.  Those might have been the best restaurant ribs I have ever had.  They fell off the bone and the Carolina-style barbeque sauce was really good.  My wife had the Shrimp and Grits...again, very tasty.    The other thing I like about the restaurant was that it was not very loud.  Some restaurants feel they need to crank up the volume for you to enjoy dinner.  Grassroots is not \"hear a pin drop quiet\"...but it is not loud either.  You could go with a group of 4 or 6 and have a nice conversation.    Here for another week...we will make at least one trip back before we head home.    Thanks Grassroots!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and desert! Love the vibes and the workers! Especially our young server Jacob Dickman who was extra kind to our family and definitely kept up with his job! He really took the time to connect and talk with us also which is great! Great work! Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Local, not a chain, nice ambiance. Food was pretty good but the service left a lot to be desired. Waitress seemed uninterested and aloof. Busy Saturday nite and I got the feeling she was more interested in turning the table."}
{"text":"I expected beautiful expensive Scottsdale nosh that would leave me ready for a Big Mac.  While the restaurant feels trendy food is both delicious and substantial.  I ordered the short ribs and the meal was fantastic.  This is a great date restaurant with both the cool factor and good food."}
{"text":"Shrimp Po Boy was great... tasty accompanying sauce. Green beans sounded terrific but fell a little short of expectations. Tasty and different nonetheless. Started out on the porch but the monsoons pushed us back to a table underneath an overhang. Service was terrific. Fellow diners loved their selections. Noisy inside but worth a trip."}
{"text":"So I just quit my shit job the other day & found out I got the job I really wanted today, so the misses & I were in celebration mode. We were thinking of going to the usual spots but I think we were both in the state of mind to try something new. We've seen this place every time we go to TJs & it popped into my brain.  We decided to sit inside. There's quite a lot of foot traffic in the patio area & didn't feel like being judged by the gym people. The interior is pretty cool. The walls open up to the patio area so even if you're inside, u get the open feel of a patio. The music was pretty good. Some songs you hear everywhere but some were more deep tracks. We were a lil early for dinner, around 430 so we were greeted by the bartender. Really like the fact he didn't try to schmooze us, he was just quick & helpful. Sunny was our server & was great. We mentioned it was our first time here & asked her for recommendations. She happily obliged & seemed very knowledgeable. We had some of the tap wines for 7 bones a glass. I had the pinot noir, she had the cab. I liked mine better but hers was good too. C'mon, its wine. Either way I'm downing it. We started off w the wings. We knew they were not traditional hot wings, they are BBQ. They were ok. Nothing exciting. I still destroyed them but I'm not ordering them again. They were on the sweet side & I'm sweet enough as it is. Ok main courses...I ordered the burger w bacon & fries, she had the southern style shrimp & grits. I got my burger and almost had an anxiety attack, recalling my experience from the place across the patio (see Cyprus Grill review) but this had all the characteristics of a decent burger...and it was. I ordered it medium but it was cooked medium well. Despite that, I still enjoyed it. Midfeast we switched plates. Damn, she got me. She had won this battle. Her dish was far superior. The grits were jalepeño cheddar...best grits I've ever had.....you know what I think I've only had grits one other time..but they sucked! These are great. The MVP of the night was the shrimp. These shrimp had dominated my fries & punched my burger right in the vajayjay. They woulda murdered all my wings too had they still been on the table. They were served on the grits w this tasty relish with bits of I think chorizo. They know how to cook shrimp to perfection here. Get some grits on your fork, top it w a shrimp, stick that in your cake hole & get ready to fucken die. It was so good it made me angry. My sweetheart was like, hey babe are u ok? You got the job, everything's gonna be ok. I'm like no its this fucking shrimp, its so delicious gawd damn it. She says ok just calm down, here...eat your burger.  The service was excellent. I'm not giving full marks because the wings were ok & my burger was cooked a lil too well but we will come back here to try some other dishes. Try it out."}
{"text":"Grassroots manages to be chic and provide a satisfying meal.  I could come here every night for a month and still enjoy the variety in the menu.  The staff makes an effort to be friendly and it shows.  This is quickly becoming our go to restarant for double dates."}
{"text":"Pet friendly dining. I came here with my German Shepard puppy and they were happy to accommodate us in their patio area. The food is great and the prices are moderate. Try the cole slaw. Even non- cole slaw lovers will enjoy it."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and service is as amazing. Thank you Armorie and Aidan (the bartenders) for a fantastic experience and recommendations! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Went here after my graduation ceremony. The food was delicious and the staff were friendly. I had a portobello sandwich.  I've never had one before and it sets a high bar, it was perfect! My mom had an orzo salad and can not stop talking about it. She says it's literally the best salad she's ever had. I do not live in the area, but if I ever come back, I'll definitely be back! I wish there were a place like this where I live."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as always but if you're looking for service, run!  Our server was awol all night and when we asked for something we got the rolling eyes. Too bad because in the off season places are slowing down and people have many great choices."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I could see as my go-to casual restaurant in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere, clean and crisp while also having a few TVs in case the game is on.  Farm to table menu with a ton of great options. So far have had the Ahi Tuna sandwich, great.   The Ahi Tuna appetizer (on nachos) was delicious, and the mozzarella appetizer was even better.  Would highly recommend for a casual night, reasonable beer and wine list as well."}
{"text":"An excellnt dinner. My family and I checked this place out. We are from the bay area so we are used to good american style.food. My take: excellent food, great service. My only  question is where is every one? Saturday night and it was most empty. Whats going on? I think the location is not choice, but check it out!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sandwiches and salads. Everything's so fresh, and tastes way better than I thought sandwiches and salads could taste. Lovely decor. Will be back a lot."}
{"text":"There is not one bad dish. Smoked salmon appetizer is top notch. It's a meal by itself. On Monday, I highly recommend red beans and rice. The burger is among the best I've had. Great patio in all seasons and the bar is very friendly and comfortable."}
{"text":"I have gone here many times for meetings. The location couldn't be better along with the food. The salads are amazing along with their lemonade. The waiters tend to not bother you by keep coming back to your table to ask questions. The service is great and they do a good job of not interrupting your discussion when refilling glasses/clearing plates."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service ! Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  I had the shrimp po boy and charred broccoli. Simply insanely delicious! Great wine selection and full bar.  The happy hour is also great.... Try the Piggly Wiggly. So good!  I've been here before and it was always great but tonight was so nice I just had to yelp about it."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Ordered wings for appetizer, was a bit bland. Dad's Grocery bag was mediocre, olives weren't seeded. Cheeses were good but Bread was ok. Got Shrimp PO Boy as entree and it was delicious, wished I knew it had pickles and would have preferred without it. Coworker got charred spinach and she says it was bland as well."}
{"text":"Pricey but tasty. Parking can be a little difficult but there are a lot of fun shops to tootle around in after dinner"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Amazing amazing amazing.  Reservation went smooth, staff worked with our group to ensure we liked our sitting area, and the entire team seemed to work together to provide services!  There was truly not one thing anyone can complain about.  We had 11 people, many of which are high maintenance, and we already have a reservation again for this week.  The appetizers were amazing.  I sub'd the beans for additional asparagus - how can asparagus be amazing?  It was large, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked - not soggy outside, still crisp but cooked all the way through.  BBQ fell apart!     Grassroots is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Grassroots is the type of restaurant that one can tell is serving fresh made to order food. The burgers are great, the brisquit is great, the sides are awesome. I have tried the fish and the steak. Both excellent. I have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"WARNING: Check your bill before paying, if you are there during \"Social Hours\" which is between 3 pm-6 pm.  Just wanted to get that warning out of the way.  For some reason, the last several times, (yes, several times), we have been at both Grassroot locations, when we get our bill, the cocktails and appetizers are not at Happy Hour prices.  We always have to bring it to our servers attention.  They always apologize, and go adjust the bill to what it should be, and that's great.....EXCEPT for the fact that it happens every single time now. It feels somewhat annoying that we always have to double check the bill.   So, my suggestion is just make sure you are being charged correctly.  With that being said, the food is wonderful.  We have never been disappointed.  We live nearby, and it's our go-to place for a casual meal, and delicious cocktails.  Just went to the Camelback location this afternoon, and food was great.  But, as is usual now, we were not charged properly for the appetizer.   Disappointing that they don't get that part of their business on track."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Very nice ambiance, great service but best of all the food was exceptional.  We had a good size group and everyone enjoyed their meals.  The prosciutto wrapped asparagus was so good we ordered more.  Didn't expect ribs but so glad they had them.  They were a mouth watering and tender.   The salads were fresh and flavorful.  The owner came over and chatted us up and it was clear that he took a lot of pride in his restaurant.  I highly recommend Grassroots kitchen."}
{"text":"My experience with grassroots was dwindling up until encounter with Jacob. I wasn't getting much service until a small, cute little bow showed up with 3 waters and a smile. Oh my god, he was soooo handsome. He immediately hit it off with everyone at the table, and to say the least, I was very intrigued. He then continued to make very astute recommendations on the menu. Short note, I ended up making love to my perfectly chosen meal thanks to no other than Jacob. At the near end of my meal however, rain starting pouring in buckets. I was fearful for my food and more importantly myself. Guess what though? Jacob. Jacob raced from his station, dropping his apron, and lifted me into his arms, carrying me powerfully, but carefully inside. Jacob is the best. If not going to this restaurant for its exquisite food, go for the pure experience of Jacob, it is just, filled with wonder."}
{"text":"We had a lovely birthday lunch here today!  Domingo gave us fabulous service.  The ahi tuna salad was a favorite.  The  chicken salad sandwich was terrific!  But really the brownie took the cake"}
{"text":"Had the roti and 1/2 rack of ribs. The chicken was great, the ribs were a bit dry but not bad. Don't know if it was worth the price though. If we come here again I think I'll stick with just the rotisserie chicken"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a party of 4 for dinner after the Super Bowl.   Yelp has closing time at 10pm.  Went in at 8:20 and manager said they were closed.  By the time we drove away I saw 5 other cars drive up, walk in, walk away and then drive away.  What a stupid way to run a business."}
{"text":"When I came here the other night, it was my second time at this location. I've been to the Hayden location many times but haven't gone much the past year because my fiance and I love Twisted Grove (a sister restaurant).   I started with a glass of red wine. Can't remember which one exactly but it was an Alexander Valley wine. Since I was meeting up with my pregnant friend and her hubby, I limited my alcohol consumption to one glass. I didn't want to tease her.   My go-to dish is the salad combo with salmon. It is a half sized portion of any salad and salmon. I always go with the farmer's chopped salad. I like the variety of ingredients but opt out of the cheese. My friend got the normal sized version of the salad and got it without beets.   Her hubby got the portabello sandwich and loved it. She tried some of his meal and loved it as well. It was their first time here so I was glad they enjoyed their meals. Of course, I had to get dessert even though I was full - but at least I shared ;) I decided on the brownie dessert - so yummy and perfect for sharing. The three of us could not finish it.   For my glass of wine, entree and dessert, my total was around $50 (tip included)."}
{"text":"Shane at the bar was a! The hostesses were so accommodating and sweet. Yelp hooked us up tonight. We had no idea this place was here and will be back on a very regular basis."}
{"text":"Had the braised short ribs with jalapeño cheese grits and asparagus.  Meat was fork tender and tasty.  Grits not very cheesy or didn't catch any heat at all.  Kinda boring.  Might as well have been a baked potato.  Pork belly and Salmon appetizers stood out more than wings and ribs but were okay, nothing I have to go back for but not bad.  Waiter seemed to be rushing us which took a toll on the experience.  Desserts were what stood out.  Key lime pie was stellar, toffee brownie was money.  Lots of great options in area.  Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today with my dad and stepmom for my birthday. I've heard great things and the menu has always enticed me to come check this restaurant out. The food was fantastic. I ordered the rainbow trout with kale. Both were cooked perfectly and just delicious. My dad had the beef brisket and really enjoyed it and my stepmom had a romaine salad with the soup of the day. We also shared a few desserts, the brownie a la mode and the key lime pie and both were simply amazing! The only not so great part of this lunch was our server. He wasn't attentive at all and we had to ask for drink refills twice (our drinks were completely empty) which is pretty uncommon at good restaurants. He seemed like he didn't want to be there and with his lack of friendliness and attentiveness it just kind of put a damper on our lunch. Food is a 4.5, service was a 2 so I give this a 3 star for now. I'll be back and just hope he isn't serving next time!"}
{"text":"love this place!  been here many times but had the best service tonight with the waitress Megan.  she was amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at Grassroots on a Wednesday night. It was good but not great. Drinks were a good value at the \"Social Hour\". Our bartender was really good and was a pleasure to hang out with. The menu has a lot of interesting dishes with a Southern flare. I had a filet which was cooked properly but was totally unseasoned. There was no evidence of any salt, pepper, or anything really. It was a shame too, because it was a nice cut and a perfect medium rare. The baked potato was hot and loaded with toppings but no salt and no pepper. My wife ordered the ribs. They were fall off the bone tender, but again they just didn't seem to be flavorful. I didn't get a smoke flavor or a sense of a rub either. They did have a good char on the outside. The ingredients were good quality and the temps were great, but we were left wanting a lot more flavor in each of the dishes. After tip it was about $90 for two drinks and two of the more expensive entrées. Dining room was clean and attractive. Be careful of the glare through the West windows in the afternoon sun."}
{"text":"We just finished having lunch here.  We were not sure what to expect. Wow, what a nice surprise.  You have to try the bbq brisket sandwich.  One of the best I've ever had.  Cole slaw is kind of plain .  Great little place that was very busy but people were coming and going quickly during the busy lunch hour.   Would recommend to others and well be back next time were in town"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! Pork belly appetizer--FAB! Lobster bisque--DELISH! Seasonal chop salad--FRESH AND WONDERFUL! Fresh, beautifully-presented, fabulous service! Warm, beautiful atmosphere!  GO!"}
{"text":"Our server Corinne is great!!!! Always friendly and fun. The food is excellent and so is the service."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and ribs meals, Caesar salad, and cup of lobster bisque. The bisque was good, not great. The Caesar salad was one of the best salads I've had a in long time. I was left wanting more. The chicken and ribs was excellent. Ribs were fall off the bone good. The chicken was tasty. We asked for a side of bbq sauce and that really kicked up the chicken to the next level. Five star dining. I knocked it down to four stars because I called head for a reservation and they told me they don't take reservations. Ok that's fine. When I got there, they asked if I wanted outside or bar. I said, I want inside table (there was several empty). They said, sorry those were reserved... ummm.... say what? come again? que pasa? We wound up at the family table and played checkers which turned out to be fun. Also, the sangria was no good we sent it back."}
{"text":"An old business associate recommended this place for lunch last week. I looked it up and saw some menu pricing and realized lunch was not going to be cheap. Is anything cheap around the Biltmore?  Service was outstanding.   Food was fresh and delicious. I ordered the Sashimi Ahi Tuna salad seared rare! Oh yeah the agave ponzu miso vinaigrette was soooo good, light and packed so much flavor. It was a perfect summer salad. $18  My friend ordered the blackened fish and that looked pretty tasty. $16   We also shared some grilled Brussel sprouts that had a sweet glaze and were delicious. Mom never served them like this; falling onto a cutting board from a tipped over glass jar! Excellent presentation.  The whole experience was great. I'd be back often if my last name was Hilton, but it's not. I guess that's what made it special; that a ratchet, hood rat like me could blend in with the upper crust and pay my bill without police interaction at the end of the meal. Ummm PS if you are on a date here's a little secret...they don't take EBT here.   Good work owners, stay true to your game and stay the realist!!!"}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. My friends and I came for dinner. I am the o oh vegetarian out of the bunch, so I was a little nervous because of all the barbecue items in the menu. BUT! They had this awesome grilled veggie platter with blue cheese a a few remarkable veggie dishes otherwise, that I was so in love with! And the booth was comfy and fun for all of us. Such a great night"}
{"text":"Most Excellent.  Mrs Commissioner Held is a phenomenal bartender and extremely organized."}
{"text":"Our lunch was delicious. We had the Chicken Tortilla Soup, the Farmer's Vegetable Chop, and the Scottish Salmon. Service was friendly and prompt. Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Fellow vegans: you will be well accomodated at Grassroots.  While they did not have any vegan options right on the menu,  they had several vegetarian items that were easily modified for vegan. The servers are very knowledgeable on the menu, the kitchen, and the wine list.   I got the vegetable plate with vegan modifications.  It was so yummy! It had farm fresh veggies including red cabbage,  asparagus,  cherry tomatoes,  and chard as well as Texas toast which they prepared with no oil for me.  It was delicious and satisfying.   Nice work Grassroots!"}
{"text":"Great fish sandwich. Great atmosphere. and i really believe that Chris (the owner) cares about his customers and it shows in his staff's attention to the customer."}
{"text":"This is a great dinner spot. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious. We throughly enjoyed the spit fire chicken entree and the swordfish special. We even needed gluten free accommodations and they did with no questions asked. I recommend this restaurant to any hungry soul!"}
{"text":"Great find. The shrimp and jalapeno grits are a must as other reviews have said. My husband had the blacked ahi sandwich. He said it was one of the best he's had which is an amazing compliment being that we come from Hawaii and have great fresh fish all the time. Great staff , cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was blah. We had a burger ordered medium that came rare.  The brisket and slaw and grits were tasteless. The halibut required a fork. Service was slow. Gimlet was good."}
{"text":"We had an fabulous lunch.  Friendly hostess and effecient team service.   Comfy seating and nice open warm space.  The brussel appetizer is as good as advertised but you need to love balsamic.  Starter Caesar and Swiss Chard side were stellar. Loved my chicken salad sandwich on a killer flaxseed bun. The slaw that accompanied was respectable. Wife loved her salad with the grapes and edame.  Presentation, flavor, and service were excellent. If i lived around here, it would be in my weekly rotation. Good operation."}
{"text":"Was in the area and was craving some Southern Shrimp & Grits ...   I hit the jackpot .. .. With this spot   The food was spectacular, the service was friendly ..  The management, ( Shane ) was awesome ..   I'll for sure be back and recommend this quaint restaurant whenever you are in the area"}
{"text":"We ended up here thanks to fabulous Yelpers and once again, you all know what you're talking about!    My ahi sandwich was yummy although it could have been cooked a teensy tiny bit less.  The jalepeno cheddar grits were to die for although I didn't taste any jalepeno.  Drinks are definitely strong so beware if you're imbibing.  We shared key lime pie for dessert which was also tasty.    Service was quick, attentive and friendly.  I don't get to this area that often but I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is a regular business lunch and a nice dinner place for us.  Shrimp and Grits are wonderful.  Everything the group has had has been great.  Grassroots is the top restaurant in the area, no question."}
{"text":"First off, I had been avoiding this place due to the small menu. Boy, was I wrong. I picked up my significant other from the airport and had the dog with us so we called ahead to make sure they were dog friendly, as advertised. They were, and when we got there the hostess lead us back out to the patio and got Ruckus water. Our server, and I cannot remember his name, was awesome. He helped us pick out drinks and food, with helpful suggestions. We got a glass of wine, Hall had a Red Bull Mule, both of which were great. Then we decided to get the sandwich of the day, a steak sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. Both of which were DELICIOUS. the shoestring fries and garlic sauce suggested by our server was to die for. Not only did we have great service, but they were dog-friendly and the people dining there seemed to love it as much as we did. Next time we will return and sit in the oversized couches with friends. They looked so comfy. A++"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is hopping and wether you are a local or visiting the area this is a perfect place to dine, meet with some friends and enjoy some cocktails.  I was personally traveling on business solo so I found myself a comfortable spot at the bar.  Andrea and Jason were par on with their service and recommendations.  I started with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus followed by the filet mignon and tipped it all of with the roofer brownie to go!  The asparagus had the perfect tenderness where it still had a crunch to the bite but was not chewy.  It was the perfect salt and sweet combination with the prosciutto and honey.  The addition of the sea salt on my filet was killer.  No additions needed and the temperature was spot on.  The Brandy-7 was tasty as well ;)  Top notch, well done Chef Christopher!"}
{"text":"CONS: - Surprisingly few vegetarian options. - Pricey.  PROS: - Great patio area. - Pricey for good reason: everything was incredibly fresh, flavorful, and the portion sizes were very generous."}
{"text":"Walked right in for Father's Day today and as always we had the best food and the best service one could ask for!! Absolutely love this place, highly recommend the blackened fish or the brisket. As an added bonus today the manager just gave us a slice of key lime pie on the house and it was to die for! I have never had poor service or bad food here."}
{"text":"The lunch menu provided a nice selection, including appetizers, salads, sandwiches, soup, and entrees for those who want a heartier option. My friend and I both ordered salads. I ordered the Club House half salad, which was a perfect portion size for a warm day filled with errands to run. The bacon was crispy, but not over done and adding chicken was the right decision! My friend ordered the Waldorf Chicken Salad, which she raved about. The green iced tea was delicious and unsweetened. I highly recommend this place to meet a friend, co-worker or family member for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"This place is deeelish! A little crowded inside, but the patio is perfect ambiance. The food is great, and even though they try hard, the service could be improved. Overall, a great place!"}
{"text":"I'm torn.  This place is so darn charming, a very warm atmosphere, much cozier than its previous identity.  The service during my--brief--visit was amazing: I was waited on immediately upon entering the door, but I wanted to order something TO GO, so I bellied up to the bar for a menu.  My first thought?  The menu is boring.  Nothing about it makes it stand out.  \"What is new and different here?,\" is what I thought to myself.  \"What is the ONE THING that will bring people back again and again?\", I thought to myself.  I was told the chopped salad was amazing, so I ordered it.  In the meantime, I ordered a glass of wine.  I had only been there a few short minutes, when another server came over to ask if I would like to try some other red wines.  Perhaps it was chance, but I noticed, she brought two reds in the same \"family\" of that which I was drinking.  Very observant, I thought to myself.  I wasn't happy with either, really, and I was definitely not happy with the glass I ordered, so the bartender took it off the bill at the time my food arrived.  Terrific!  I took home my salad, opened it, and was immediately disappointed.  It was not fresh, and I expected the chicken breast to be hot, which it was not.  The greens weren't even \"juicy,\" but rather tasted as though they had been in the refrigerator WAAAY too long.  Not even close to amazing, as I was told.  So, I may return and eat in the restaurant because I think it is only fair, but I have to say, I'm not very enthusiastic about it.  :-("}
{"text":"I live really close and have been wanting to try Grassroots for a while now and I'm glad that I did!   The waitress recommended the short ribs and said they have won some type of award so of course I had to order the short ribs. Let me just say, all the hype is true. They were amazing! They were really tender and the hoisin glaze on top was soooooooo good. It came paired with jalapeño grits which we're also really good.  I would say I'm excited to come back and try more of the dishes, but I'm most likely just going to order the short ribs again.   The desserts did sound good too so that'll be on my radar next time around."}
{"text":"I've been twice, once for brunch and once for dinner. Brunch was great as there were good variety of options and the pitcher drinks were perfect for the occasion. For dinner, had a family get together of 8 and everyone loved the food. Healthy food, yet still flavorful and satisfying. Would recommend sitting on their great patio if weather permits. Great customer service as well. Recommend making a reservation for dinner at least as the restaurant does fill up."}
{"text":"This place is great. A very interesting menu and probably the best food in the area. There are a lot of restaurants in this area and Grassroots is fairly non-descript in this little strip mall. We stopped in for lunch and were so blown away with the food we ended up coming back for dinner too. Well worth it. The service was slow at dinner and it was not that busy so I was surprised by that .I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was close to our hotel and has great reviews - those reviews did not lie! This charming restaurant has amazing food with a great menu. We ordered the Dad's Grocery Bag which took us back to Europe (meats, cheeses, olives), followed by red beans and rice which was straight from the south! My husband had the petite fillet which melted in your mouth. We ended the meal with their key lime pie which was beyond delicious!! I will definitely come back to this restaurant, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"No. No. No. Came with locals...Yes locals from  Foutain Hills after Cubs game.  We were dressed in Cubs gear and were invited to have our drink outside. They want to serve the 60+ crowd who wears turtlenecks when it's 55 degrees outside. Worst witch of a manager ever. Very very nice bartender.  Pass on this place unless you like being judged and under appreciate. My Amex black was readily appreciated a few doors down."}
{"text":"The staff was kind and generous. We had the pork belly, lobster bisque, ahi tuna salad and half chicken. Everything was very well cooked and presented. The key lime pie was absolutely delicious. We took it to go because we were simply too full to eat it at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped here simply because of how close it was to my hotel. I sat at the bar and ordered the pork chop. It was amazing. Perhaps the best pork chop I've ever had."}
{"text":"The ribs are fall off the bone good... Great portions and amazing taste.  Shrimp and grits are fantastic too.  Had fantastic service to boot.  Great restaurant that gives you that southern charm and taste.  We will be back again and again... love this place"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time . The staff was friendly.  . The place has been remodel nicely . I was very disappointed that gumbo and red beans are only available on one day .. The  food  should probably be rated higher maybe 4 stars but it took our waitress 15 minutes to bring our bill"}
{"text":"Grassroots is a great restaurant that locally sources its food. Ive been here at least 20 x's after being introduced by a co-worker. The food is relatively good for the most part and I've enjoyed several dishes here with one of my favorite being their salads. The Garlic Ceaser dressing is to die for and the portion sizes are adequate. The chocolate brownie dessert (when fresh) has got to be one of my all time favorites anywhere. The quality of service does vary however, based on how busy they are at any given time.  If you're looking for a healthy meal or happy hour and desert in the Scottsdale Ranch area this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Ate at the Angry Crab but alas they don't have key lime pie, that's where Grassroots came in... hurried over just before closing and had the most amazing key lime pie ever... definitely check this place out! It's kind of hidden over by the Trader Joe's so don't be fooled by the Camelback address...   If the pie is any indication the food here is amazing. The pie crust was the perfect texture and the filling was nice and creamy in the middle with bits of lime throughout."}
{"text":"Simply put the food is always delicious. It's consistently flavorful and well-prepared.   The service is great as well. We went for my birthday and a friend's birthday and our server Sarah was very accommodating. She even offered us a birthday dessert.   I ordered the miso salmon prepared medium. Excellent glaze with just enough sweetness and \"crust\". I substituted the side of asparagus for a special side - cold red beats with goat cheese and a honey sauce - delicious.   Grassroots is easily pulling into my front spot as my \"go-to\" dinner spot."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful! We had basically every food item on the happy hour deal. Wiggly Piggly, Dad's Grocery Bag, and the Smoked Salmon dip were all great! To drink we enjoyed the Pink Cougar and Georgia iced tea. Our server even gave us a free scoop of ice cream for the place next door."}
{"text":"We got the ribs and red blacken red fish.  Both were so so good.  As were the side jalapeño grits and a fried rice.  Plus had a yum yum pumpkin beer by four peak which I definitely seek out again.  This is a home run date Mitch or just for a guaranteed great choice!!!"}
{"text":"So, so, so good!! Casual atmosphere, but totally comfortable! Food... amazing! Had the tuna... fabulous and hubby had the chicken salad sandwich...bun, amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire lunch!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the large Caesar salad for $12 and added chicken for an additional $4. When the salad came, it looked and tasted like a bag of salad that you buy at the grocery store. The chicken was hiding in the salad and it was just pieces of cold chicken that had been torn off of some left over chicken. There was dark and light meat. It was awful! I tried one piece of the chicken and pushed the other pieces to the side of my plate. I would never recommend this restaurant and I definitely will not be going back. Wish I had gone to Chipotle! It would've been much more tasty, filling and inexpensive!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Found this gem by chance and so glad we did. Food is....great. Our server Taylor was very helpful with recommendations that made our experience fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great experience! Very clean food with a beautiful blend of flavors. The key lime pie was absolutely the best I've ever had. If we lived in the area, we'd frequently the place regularly! Excellent friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Holy healthy yum! I had been here when this location first opened for HH and totally forgot that it existed!! I was in the mood for a healthy lunch so my mom suggested that we meet here and boy am I happy that we did!   We split the burrata appetizer to start and it was seriously H.E.A.V.E.N. The grilled bread that they serve with it was crisped to perfection and I also loved the lemon-y arugula and tomato jam that they served on the side. Next, I ordered the farmer's vegetable chop salad w/chicken. I have honestly never had a salad packed with so many goodies in my LIFE! It had cabbage, beets, grapes, butternut squash, corn, radishes, cherry tomatoes, scallions, cucumber, edamame, feta, basil, parsley, and a champagne vinaigrette. Seriously guys, I could eat this daily!  Thank you so much for another amazing experience! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Okay, this will be a rare review for me.  This is a review of a restaurant I have never been to.  My wife went there tonight to meet her mom and to see what all the rave was about.      Apparently, this place KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK.  My wife called me on the way home and said \"Oh my god, this is the best place I have ever been to and it blow the Henry away (see my review on Henry).  I thought wow, glad you really enjoyed it.  She then informed me that she had a \"take home surprise\" for me.  Yep, there was a task little sampler platter she brought home so I could try it.  The sampler consisted of Short Ribs (AMAZEBALLS), and the Pork Belly Appetizer (also incredible), the grits with jalapeño pieces (WOWZA), the smoked salmon appetizer (TAH DYE FOH) and last but not least the Key Lime Pie (BEST KEY LIME I HAVE EVER HAD).  Needless to say, on a pure food level it gets my highest ranking (as it did for my wife and mother-in-law as well).  But if you have been reading Attorney Steve's \"find your sizzle reviews\" you know that food is only part of the equation, and service and environment must also be weighed and factored in.  Again, I was not there, but I have it on good information that they KILLED IT in these areas as well.  I will quote my wife (now this is hearsay, but I believe it is an exception to the hearsay rule \"the excited utterance\" if you are a legal buff).  Here is what she says:  1.  \"When you walk in you feel like you are in someones beautiful comfy warm home\";  2.  \"The service, (including the chef coming over and asking how the meal was), to the friendly servers who did the same, and to Jordan who went above and beyond to make sure our first time there was phenomenal.  He hit the mark, as did all the others.\"  3. \"I have been to a lot of very, very very nice restaurants in my life time and I have never been treated as well as I have tonight at Grassroots.\"  So there you have it folks.  If you don't go to this place you are MISSING OUT.  The only concern we now have is that with this and other positive reviews we will no longer be able to get a table when we go there (I am sure they would come up with a solution for that as well).  At any rate, this is a MUST TRY - get  out, get it done and go here!    Enjoy, and find your sizzle!  Attorney Steve, the Business and Real Estate Lawyer http://www.AttorneySteve.net"}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that my wife and I had a worse experience here than any other I can remember.  We didn't stay to try the food.  There were 2 of us for lunch.  There were many open tables.  We were obviously unhappy with being sat at a high top style table (that seated 4).  My wife was having difficulty getting onto the chair - she is 5'3\" and was wearing a skirt.  The waitress the we had was rude, unaccommodating, and snarky.  She waited for my wife to struggle into her seat, while I mentioned that a high top was not optimal.  After my wife was settled, the waitress snarkily said \"well you could have asked for another seat.\"   This place isn't Denny's. The sandwiches are $12 - $16 each.  I am sure that they are tasty.  My wife and I both felt that the waitress was out of line.  She made us feel as if she was put upon by having us there.  We left and ate at Bianco's.  As we walked out the door, she followed us, continuing to make snarky comments as I looked around to find a manager.  Since I was unable to find a manager, we left rather than be berated by her  Despite this, we may actually come back.  the food is supposed to be good.  If it doesn't work out, there are many other options within walking distance."}
{"text":"Hopped over here after finding that our original destination, Spotted Donkey Cantina, had closed. The restaurant is definitely a nice one, with a wonderful atmosphere - relaxing, casual, yet upscale. I dined with my husband and another couple, and they all loved their food. I think I had less love simply because there weren't a lot of vegetarian options, and what I got was not all that special. However what my meat-eating friends got did look amazing and they all confirmed it.   I had the Grilled Portobello sandwich, and it was just fine. Not all that exciting (mushroom sandwiches and risotto are pretty boring to me since they are the de facto vegetarian options). My girlfriend got the club house salad and the Sunday soup of the day, and both looked awesome. The salad was big and full of cheese/meat toppings. The soup looked and smelled out of this world, and was a very substantial bowl of soup. My husband had the chicken and thought it was really good. I ordered the chocolate toffee brownie for dessert, and it was good however since toffee was in the title I was expected a lot of toffee, whereas there were just a few sprinkles of it.  I highly recommend Grassroots for the meat-eating population, but less so for those of us who only eat veggies."}
{"text":"Grass roots is a cool place.  I liked the layout.  You don't feel like you are in a walking mall when your inside and I like that.  Food was great.  The pork belly with toast is really good.  tasted like a pork chop and bacon at the same time.  Server was nice and just the right amount of attention.... and it was a late lunch too.  She didn't act in a hurry.  The salads we had we great!  but nothing in the restaurant could hold a candle to the beauty of my lunch date.  I could be eating a shoe and staring at her and it would be delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! You won't be disappointed if u are looking for a casual place to eat delicious comfort food in a trendy atmosphere. We had the brisket, scallops special, \"Roti\" and ribs combo - and our little one had the grilled cheese. Their grits are AMAZING!! The waitstaff are top notch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix, bar none.  If I was a death row inmate all I would eat is their prosciutto wrapped asparagus appetizer and their key lime pie!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. From all the reviews, my wife and I thought it would be amazing. However, the service was slow even though we were the servers only table. I had the shrimp and grits. It was way over seasoned. My wife had a salad that had almost a half of an onion in it. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place our first night in town and boy am I glad we did!  Great ambiance and really friendly server.  Super cute patio - too cold for us on that rainy night but would love to come back and check it out.  Excellent food.  Ordered Dad's Grocery Bag to start and the Pork Belly.  Both were delicious and had some great flavors.  I had the grilled portobello sandwich which was really tasty and a huge portion!  I could barely eat half.  And the cole slaw was really yummy as my side.  I had a Purple Haze beer to drink which was also great.    They were kid friendly (a huge plus for me) and ready with a highchair and some kids options.  Something I really appreciate for a bar/kitchen type of place.    Check out the sweets shop next door down (same owners) for something sweet after dinner!"}
{"text":"I loved this place, we had a corporate function with about 10 guys out in their private patio area.  It was fantastic, the drinks were good, a great selection, we had all of the share plates, the pork belly was soooooo goood... For my entree I ordered the scallops over jalapeno cheesey grits, it was fantastic.  The meal was so good, i went back for lunch the next day.  Got the shrimp and grits, and the french fries, and it was awesome.  Great bartender working at that hour too, good conversation, great food. awesome experience"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance,  love the coffee, it's very good flavor coffee and cute design, but the food was just to simple for me, and the avocado was brown , that turned me off. 4 stars for the coffee but 1st at for the food."}
{"text":"We came here with neighbors for lunch after a movie. We arrived about 1:30 which was good. I doubt we would have found a table before then. It is obviously popular. I had the soup du jour and the club salad. I was pleased. The others had sandwiches and were pleased.  Key Lime pie and apple pie ala mode were well received. I was the only alcohol drinker. The pale ale and ipa were ok but not great. The wines by the glass didn't excite me and I felt high priced. Service was straightforward and attentive. Good lunch but expensive at about $20 per person excluding my beers. I guess everyplace is expensive these days."}
{"text":"This 2nd grassroots fits well with town and country. Really great bar area. Same unreal food and service as first restaurant. Good happy hour dishes for all tastes. Def recommend for happy hour or a date."}
{"text":"Service deserves 5 stars. The food fell a bit short. For the price I expect amazing or larger portions. The servings are small and the food is only okay. I'm hardly a food snob, but I definitely don't think the price was warranted. I'd be willing to try again, assuming I ordered the wrong thing (brisket and beans), but considering there aren't a plethora of entree options, I think they should do the ones offered extremely well. I am visiting from out of town, and when there are a million superb places in the city to eat, I rarely give an \"okay\" spot second thought."}
{"text":"I popped in to have a quick lunch and quite enjoyed the atmosphere and food. The salmon was cooked perfectly--a little extra pink in the middle. I am docking one star because I think my meal was a touch overpriced. $28 for 5 asparagus spears, a beer, about 7 oz salmon, and about a cup of grits. Seems like island prices to me! Was tasty though."}
{"text":"I came here to have an early celebration of Fathers Day with the family. We were a party of 6 adults and 3 kids. We are not an easy group to manage but the entire staff was great. My wife went to the bathroom to change our little one and found a wallet. She turned it in to the hostess and it turned out that it belonged to one of the employees. As a way to thank us they gave us two complimentary appetizers. It shows you the kind of establishment this place. The first was \"85259 creamy burrata\" which was really good. Everyone loved it. The  creamy burrata was very fresh and the tomato jam was uniquely delicious. The \"tuna poke\" was well seasoned and very fresh. Both were 5 stars.   For my main entree i got the \"topher's braised short ribs\" and they were really good. The short ribs had a sweet outer layer but they were savory on the inside. A great contrast of flavors. The jalapeno cheddar grits were perfect. Actually the best grits i have ever had. My wife got the \"roasted chicken waldorf\" and she really liked it. She said it was the perfect amount of dressing and all the fixings on it were well balanced. She really enjoyed it.   For dessert we got the chocolate toffee brownie a la mode. I thought this desert was tasty but it was not a home run like the main entrees. Overall i would come again. The staff is awesome, it is reasonably priced, and the food is prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere and staff were very good. Had a great Saturday night dinner with a group of friends. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  I had the best portobello mushroom sandwich I've ever had, and that's saying a lot because I look for those wherever I go.  My husband had fillet mignon, and he thought it compared favorably with others he has had.  We had the caramel filled brownie for dessert, which was warm and gooey.  Service was awful.  Or rather, the service we received from our waiter was.The waiter forgot things, like refills and our dessert, and had to be reminded to bring our check. Twice another waiter had to step in to help us.  He was very nice, and the restaurant comped our desserts because they were sitting around for awhile.  I have the feeling that this doesn't happen often, so I'd gladly go back again and try for a different waiter."}
{"text":"Two visits so far-  and MANY more to come!  First was with a good friend. We each had a cocktail, she had the brisket sandwich with side of cheesy jalapeno grits, I had the farm to table veggie plate.  OMG! The sandwich was solid, the grits were amazing! (She complained they were too cheesy. On my planet, there's no such thing!) The veggie platter was one of the most perfect plates I've ever had! Tri colored cauliflower, heirloom tomatoes, garlicky Swiss chard and grilled asparagus. Beautiful, delicious, and a huge portion!   The following week, I brought out of town family. There were 6 of us - and we were all over the menu. Everyone was quite happy with their orders - and my cousin who is a bit of a foodie/veggie snob pulled me aside to say it was the best meal she had while in AZ!  Across the board - the cocktails, the entrees, and the dessert were top notch. Service has been flawless both times - and I am so glad I live close to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is above average for sure. Killer pork chop, and fried shrimp sandwich. My wife also loves their chicken Waldorf salad."}
{"text":"Delicious!! My husband and I shared the pastrami sandwich, with jalepeno cheddar grits, and their bunch of wings. All so great! I was pretty impressed with their bbq sauce and homemade ranch. I like that they make everything in-house. It's a little on the pricy side but well worth it."}
{"text":"I was not disappointed by my meal. I ordered the petite filet and it practically cut like butter. My friends has the scallops over jalapeño cheddar grits and they said it was fantastic! I've always thought grits were bland, but these were delish. And try the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- wonderful! Key lime pie? A must have. The service was also spectacular."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!! The flavors flowed together and we thoroughly enjoyed each dish served. The pozole was absolutely delicious. And the burrata was perfection! Lydia Lynae was a delight to chat up and she helped set a great atmosphere. Perfect person to have in front to make people feel comfortable and friendly!"}
{"text":"I truly loved everything about my experience at this restaurant. Ambiance is warm, inviting, fresh, but not the least bit trendy. Menu consists of meat-heavy Southern inspired dishes. Our experience was as follows:  Cocktails - We ordered the manhattan and the margarita. The cocktails were straightforward and made with high quality ingredients. Nothing to rave about here, but definitely well made drinks. Would order both again.   Appetizer - We shared the burrata with tomato jam. When the dish first came out, the burrata was too cold and had a tough outer later that disallowed the flavor to come through. Once it warmed up a bit, it was quite delicious, although the outer layers of the burrata was not edible. Serving burrata at the wrong temperature seemed like a rookie mistake and was definitely disappointing. Would be willing to give this a second try to see if temperature was a fluke the first time.   Entrees - We ordered the short ribs and the petite filet. Both were perfection. Short ribs were the perfect combo of sweet and savory. Consisted of a very large portion of meat that was accompanied by asparagus and the famous grits. The famous grits are famous for a reason and it was definitely a standout dish. The petite filet consisted of an excellent cut of steak served with a loaded baked potato. Pretty straight forward, very delicious.   Dessert - We chose the toffee brownie sundae. The brownie was HUGE. This dessert was a little disappointing, but I did not take off any stars because the following is truly a matter of personal opinion. The brownie consisted of a light, cake-like texture as opposed to the fudgy, gooey brownie texture I prefer. Some people may love this dessert, but it was not chocolately enough for me.  In conclusion, I cannot wait to return to Grassroots. I can't wait to try the shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I am a huge fan of clean food and a little seafood here and there. This was perfect for those with a family full of various dietary restrictions.   Sarah was my waitress and she's the best. So sweet, kind, and will be the reason I come back!   I enjoyed a craft beer and an appetizer. It was a little on the pricey side for a weeknight, but not bad for a date night! I love the urban garden feel of the restaurant. The waitresses and waiters are 5 star service. Everyone is so knowledgeable and very professional.   I recommend any seafood dish on the menu! They are perfectly cook and smell overwhelmingly delicious. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I can confidently say this will be my newest \"go to\" spot in the neighborhood. Prior to actually eating here, I had visited Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for just drinks. The drinks were made well and the prices seemed fair. They have a pretty good selection of wines bottled & on tap. The beers average about $6 but you can get a pitcher for about $12. It's a great deal and even better if you go during happy hour. The bar has a great atmosphere and the bartenders are all very friendly. After a few fun experiences of just hanging out at the bar, I finally actual got a chance to eat here this weekend! It was AMAZING!   First we started with their soup of the day, Black Bean Sirloin Chili. We ordered a side of bread to go with it so we could all share it as an appetizer.. It was the perfect way to start our meal. Lots of flavor and they don't skimp on the sirloin portions. For dinner I had the Vegetable Platter, my husband had the Half Chicken, my mom had the BBQ Brisket, and my dad had the Short Ribs. The Vegetable platter was shockingly very filling and had tons of flavor. I was afraid I would miss eating meat for dinner, but I ended up not missing it at all. It was perfect! The kale had a great garlicky flavor and the tomatoes and blue cheese mix is now one of my favorite flavor combinations that I'm definitely going to try to mimic at home. I got to taste a bite of all the dishes my family ordered too had they were all great. The chicken was super moist and had a slight sweetness in flavor. The ribs & brisket were both tender and booming with flavor as well.   Where this restaurants loses a star is because of the sides. Aside from my vegetable platter, All the other side dishes were really lacking in flavor and added nothing the main course. The grits seemed a little mushy and didn't have the flavor your would expect from the Jalepeno. The orzo was just average too. In fact, everyone cleaned their plates of the meats but no one really touched their sides. They kept eating the kale and tomatoes off my plate. The next time I go, I might ask if I can get the kale with my main course instead of the grits or orzo.  Overall I loved it here. I can't wait for a chance to go back and so excited to have a new place in the neighbor I can stumble home from."}
{"text":"These stars are all about the taste of the food, which is what i find most important. I had the ribs with frys, fries where cripy hot and seasoned, and the ribs had perfect flavor In my opinion and fell of the bone with tenderness. I went with my parents and fiance and we all shared a peice of coconut cream pie after, which was dreamy and toasted in all its glory. On a side note, both my fiance and father ordered a burger well done, one came well done and the other came back medium well and was sent back, common mistake, and if it was mine i would have still ate it."}
{"text":"The short ribs are truly something to admire and enjoy with enthusiasm.  Great service, great food and good ambience!  Definitely will be heading back!"}
{"text":"Came in with a large group on June 22nd during the evening. We sat at a large table that offered the option of playing checkers and scrabble while we waited, which we enjoyed. My husband ordered the miso salmon and I had a burger and fries. Food was good and service was good until the bill came. The bill was sorted for all the parties which I appreciated. However when looking more closely I realized that gratuity was added. I don't have a problem with auto grat but I had a problem with not being told it had been added. Some people didn't notice and double tipped which was not their intention. I mentioned it to the people on my side who appreciated the heads-up. I realize this may not be the restaurant's intention but the server's but I do find it a shady practice when this happens."}
{"text":"Great dinner and atmosphere! Had the key lime pie to finish. Enough for 4 people to share! Ended up at Sweet Provisions for cookies!"}
{"text":"After many cancelled reservations at their Scottsdale location, I finally made my way to Grassroots.  Admittedly I wasn't aware they had a second location closer to me until recently.  My Mom had raved about their location near the Biltmore so I tagged along for lunch.  Its located in the Town & Country shopping complex on the southeast corner of 20th St & Camelback.  Its not really visible from the street so you have to do a little exploring to find it.  Enter from the 20th Street entrance and you'll come up on it.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty casual and resembles a lot of the trendy restaurant setups I've seen around the valley.  Some booths, some table seating, some high chair seating, some patio seating, and a big central bar for happy hour patrons.  Nothing really distinctive, but comfortable nevertheless.  We sat at a booth this go around.  The menu seems to incorporate some southern comfort fare with typical American classics.  For my lunch today I went with the Shrimp Po Boy.  I love me a good Po Boy, and this one (while probably not to New Orleans specs), was quite good.  The shrimp was fried perfectly and the remoulade sauce was a delicious dressing for the shrimp and veggies in the sandwich.  The bread was a little bland, but there was enough going on the inside of the sandwich to make me happy.  I got a ludicrous quantity of french fries as a side which came with a tasty aioli.  For dessert, my Mom and I split a slice of their famous key lime pie (which was also quite generously sized).  The pie was outstanding.  Not as tart as key lime pies I've had elsewhere, but much richer and denser than others I've had.  It was actually pretty tough for two people to take down.  Total price for the sandwich, fries, iced tea, slice of pie, tax and tip was about $30.  Pretty pricey for a lunch, but I knew going in that Grassroots locally sources their stuff which is more expensive.  And the portions for all my dishes were pretty large.  All in all, I was pleased with the quality of the food, the friendly service, and the relaxed atmosphere.  I'd certainly come back to try the dinner menu (though thats even more expensive), but I might try a sharing plate next time to save a few bucks.  And this place looks like a decent spot for happy hour.  Just do yourself a favor and save room for the key lime pie."}
{"text":"Great service and great food, pork belly appetizer is awesome"}
{"text":"Always awesome, especially the shrimp grits & margarita!  Also love the shrimp po' boy.  Desserts are great too.  Place is nice but casual.  Modern but comfortable.  Huge wrap-around bar is great place to hang out, eat and drink.  Patio is great too."}
{"text":"Wait staff was very friendly to us out of towners. (Free dessert for first timers!!) Food was fast, fresh, and delicious! Great atmosphere, a couple of vegetarian dishes, and moderately priced. 10/10 would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness - we had the most incredible dinner here last night! I've actually been before for happy hour and lunch and totally spaced a review, so this is all encompassing! :)   Specifically last night, our server was SO friendly, attentive, and knowledgable about the restaurant and entire restaurant group as a whole. {They also own Twisted Grove!}. We started with the Burrata appetizer which is a MUST. They serve it with toasted bread, spicy tomato jam, and arugula with a zesty lemon dressing. I've had this before and now have to get it every time that I come! My friend and I split the farmer's vegetable chopped salad to start and holy salad heaven. It was cold, crisp, and packed with every veggie under the sun! Off the top of my head, I know that it had beets, edamame, feta, cucumber, squash, radishes, tomatoes, scallions, herbs, and more! I could live on this salad!  For my entree, I got the short ribs with jalapeno cheddar grits and my oh my it was HEAVEN. The short ribs fell apart and basically melted in my mouth.   This is a place that you must try - you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"BBQ brisket wasn't the best we ever had but the simple, pure, clean menu was a nice change of pace. Wholesome food. I had the Waldorf salad and I will return for that salad!! Staff is really great, very friendly. I believe our server was Morgan and she was very attentive and not annoying. Her timing was spot on and she was never intrusive. Very relaxing time. Adorable patio and very cool ambiance. Would like to try the wings on the next visit. Cannot beat the happy hour prices and offerings."}
{"text":"Service was great, portions are well sized. Food came out fast and delicious. My sister accidentally left her sweater, our waitress came and found us at the dessert place next door to return it to us."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have given 5 stars to a restaurant.  But, they so deserve it.  Our waitress, Jill, was SO wonderful and helpful.  Her recommendations were spot on.   I loved everything about the place.  From the most amazing jalapeno cheddar grits to the banana split we shared for dessert.  The manager made many stops by our table to be sure everything was to our liking...and it was. I wish we lived in the neighborhood.  It would definitely become my neighborhood haunt."}
{"text":"Received our food quickly, servers are friendly and food is awesome. We had the ahi sandwich and farmhouse salad"}
{"text":"This is a fun place. The ambiance is great. Great crowd and delicious food. Had the sword fish and it was cooked to perfection. And of course good wine. They have their own hot sauce that's to die for."}
{"text":"We live very close to this resturant and thought we would give it a try.  We are very picky with resturants because my husband and I are good cooks, but we both LOVED this place.  Great food! Good atmosphere- inside and outside!  And the service was fantastic!!! Fantastic portabella sandwich with jalepeno grits!!   Price is a little high but worth it!"}
{"text":"We had baby back ribs with baked beans and Caesar salad. All were excellent as was the service. We will return next time in area."}
{"text":"Grassroots is farm to table. It's home cooking taken up a notch! I came here with my mom when I was in town for a business trip. We made reservations (highly recommend) as they were packed on a weeknight. We decided to go with the short ribs and the special which was a sea bass. The sea bass was my absolute favorite. We got the last one, so they really do value freshness. It was served with roasted cauliflower. So Good! We also had prosciutto wrapped asaparagus. I highly recommend. I would eat this over and over and over and over again (get my point!?). The short ribs were amazing, melt in your mouth, and we had ours with fries and the fries were on point and absolutely delicious.  I also enjoyed some house Pinot with my meal. It was amazing. LOVE LOVE LOVE. Would definitely vitsit here. Great ambience, excellent service."}
{"text":"Great service, i had the salmon with jumbo asparagus and i can tell the cooks know what they're doing! Totally perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I go back atleast once a month and try something new everytime and they never disappoint. The pork belly app is phenomenal and so is the ahi salad. I also have never had bad service, everyone is nice and they know the menu."}
{"text":"First visit last night & was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the food. I have read some spotty reviews on here, therefore I didn't rush to try the restaurant until now.  We were greeted by the chef within 5 minutes of sitting at the bar which was very welcoming. We decided to start with the pork belly & Burrata. They are both huge portions and the Burrata is brought in by Gina's Homemade which I have been a fan of for many years. Delicious creamy Burrata served with a tomato jam & arugula salad.  The pork belly was good as well. Next time I will try a few other things because the menu is quite lengthy. I was going to try the lobster bisque which is their Friday Soup of the Day.   Overall everything was great including the atmosphere.  I do appreciate not having to ask for water though, it should be given mandatory. It is a personal pet peeve.  3.75 stars- check it out!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try this place out. Came in during happy hour and we were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. We had the $5 chicken wings and it was so delicious. They didn't have ranch or blue cheese to go with it but they did give us some garlic aioli which tasted like garlic heaven. I had the shrimp po boy and I thought that it was better than the po boy I've had at (I dare say) New Orleans. The shrimp was deep fried perfectly in delicious breading. It came with shoestring french fries. My boyfriend had one of the burgers which he loved. The burrata was just okay, nothing special, but you can't beat the happy hour price ($8). Our server was great. Would definitely come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am so happy I found this place. Actually, my hubby did.  It is in North Scottsdale, so I don't have to drive so long for a nice meal.  The restaurant is very clean looking and the decor is really nice and inviting.  We sat in the patio since the weather is so beautiful this time of year.  I had a glass of bubbly and Shrimp and Grits.  Yeehaw, those were some tasty grits.  A little bit large a portion of grits, but my hubby always has some of my food anyways.  A girl has to stay fabulous somehow, even at my hubby's not so svelte figure expense.  I had not had grits in over 10 years.  They were very creamy, with enough cheddar and jalapeño flavor.  My hubby had the shrimp Po Boy, a very tasty sandwich.  I was too full to try their desserts, even though they looked so tempting.  I guess I have to come back for some more."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eat at Grassroots this weekend! The food was great, and the service was friendly, helpful and relaxed. They were really on top of things but never seemed rushed. Our server had great suggestions and knew the menu very well. I'm celiac and had looked up their menu online a few months ago, and was kind of surprised that they didn't have a gluten-free menu online. Usually restaurants that care so much about their ingredients are knowledgeable about allergies too. My birthday was last week and my boyfriend wanted to take me to a great meal, so he called them to ask about gluten-free options and it turns out they *really* get it, and the way they were able to easily rattle off the ingredients in their various sauces and things and which were safe for me, it was also just super evident that they care about their food. It was Friday so I did the prime rib, though I'm confused why their menu says \"limited availability after 5pm\"? That's... prime prime rib time? It was delicious and a generous portion.   All in all it was good food, cocktails and atmosphere, but head's up on the beer selection... their web site says \"extensive menu of craft beers\" but it was all Anheuser-Busch other than San Tan. Between the claim and Tap in the name, craft beer lovers will have a sad. Talk them into a gimlet.  I will definitely be going back to Grassroots and will find excuses to shop around Camelback to do just that."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the service was good, but there was certainly a downside. The tables are way too small considering all the things they put on them; from the flowers, salt and pepper and candles there almost isn't room for food.  We moved almost everything to the table next to us which gave us a decent amount of room. We were seated close to the front door and the side patio which thanks to the recent rains and wind it was super cold in there. By the time we left my feet were freezing and I was pretty uncomfortable. This would be a great place in the spring and early fall when the temps are a little more moderate, but we won't be back till it hits at least 70* after the sun goes down."}
{"text":"Great place - nice ambiance, cool decor, tasty food and good service! We were going to check out the Spotted Donkey, but finding it out of business, we noticed Grassroots across the parking lot and decided to check it out.  My daughter got the brisket sandwich (she let me try a bite - nice combination of BBQ sauce, slaw and pickles - but she picked out the pickles and slaw!)  The fries were quite nice as well.  I tried the short ribs - asian fusion sauce with asparagus and jalapeño cheesy grits...I've never been a fan of grits, but these were tasty!  The ribs were very nice...the sauce reminded me of something my Mom used to make (but I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it was familiar).  A browned with toffee flakes and gelato on top capped off a very nice dinner.  (And you've gotta love a place that has the Gadsden flag as part of it's decor).  Definitely will be coming back!  (and my apologies to our attentive and helpful server for not having been more demonstrative of my appreciation for the food...it was quite good, I just wasn't in a 'dang that's good!' mood last night)  Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"We decided to do date night at Grassroots last weekend and were excited the patio was pet friendly, so we could bring our fur baby.  This place has a great atmosphere both inside and out, the service was incredible and the food was fresh and flavorful.   I enjoyed the salmon entree with grilled asparagus and my hubby enjoyed the shrimp and grits.  We were both beyond pleased with our choices.  My hubby got excited when the server told us about all of the specials when we were seated and he decided to save room to enjoy the deep dish apple pie with vanilla ice cream.  Our server was informed that the apple pie wasn't up to standards to serve, so she had to break the bad news to us.  Needless to say we were disappointed and she could tell.  She ended up working some magic with the chef and was able to serve us an amazing apple pie with ice cream and caramel sauce...heavenly.  And even better, she gave us the dessert for free...now that's service!"}
{"text":"Excellent waiter with nice recommendations. We had a grapefruit vodka concoction that was very tasty. The prosciutto wrapped asparagus was a nice appetizer, followed by the chicken and ribs combo. Both meats were cooked to perfection. The slaw and beans were also tasty. No complaints. Very quick service."}
{"text":"The highlights of my night:  -DWAYNE (our server) -THE SHORT RIBS!!!   First I need to shout out our server Dwayne. He was outstanding! It was my boyfriends birthday and it was our first time there. Dwayne made us feel extremely welcomed and did an excellent job of allowing us time to chat but not too much time were we had to go looking for our server. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SERVICE!  The food.....to die for. I got the short rib and my boyfriend got the pulled brisket plate. I can't even begin to tell you how outstanding this meal was!! Personally I liked the short ribs better, but both were amazing. Also, the jalapeño cheddar grits are SO good!!  Definitely coming back and spreading the word about this place! Sad I didn't find it sooner!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour a week ago and got drinks and food for a very good value.  Wine on tap for five dollars a glass, 16 ounce beers for four dollars,  Bbq Beef brisket sliders on Kings Hawaiian rolls were very filling and a very good value, lots of beef and not too much sauce  As always the burrata with tomato jam and dressed arugula was a perfect combination of sweet, creamy and slightly bitter. Our only issue was that the toast was not crisp maybe they had made a whole bunch in advance and it sat around and the moisture from hot slices got some of the slices a little chewy.  We shared the brined pork chop with candied pancetta and sautéed Swiss chard with shredded Parmesan. All amazing and delicious. The pork chop was well brined and very juicy and tender.  We will return!  ---------------------New review 1/22/17  This week we returned for dinner and again sat at the bar because we did not have a reservation and it was very crowded.  My better half got the prime rib sandwich with shoestring fries and it was amazing. Tender roast beef, terrific toppings and crispy and well seasoned french fries. We do have to admit that the prime rib sliders during happy hour are a much, much better value. You get more meat, but with the entrée sandwich you do get fries, although that may not be worth it!  My order was the shrimp and grits and I was very pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Eight good size shrimp after cooking, which were also well seasoned sitting on top of a flavorful and creamy white polenta with cheddar and jalapeño. Two really thick slices of tender and nicely grilled focaccia topped it off although I was a little concerned with how many carbs were on this dish. It made for a great leftovers in the toaster oven!  The wines and beers on tap during happy hour are a great deal."}
{"text":"Salmon was cooked perfect, just slightly pink center.  Ambiance is wonderful.  Very relaxing.  A great place to fall in love, be it with your wife or life in general. Plus they have coconut cream pie too"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. It was laid back and casual which is just our style. We picked the coldest night of the year to sit outside on the patio and although it was chilly due to the wind it wasn't that bad with the heaters going and we had a good time. The other option was a 25 minute wait for an inside table. I had the spit fire chicken which was delicious....the soaked bread and baked potato were tasty and comforting....the servings were more than generous and I couldn't eat it all. My husband had the ribs and a bowl of soup and our son had the grilled cheese. In his words the shoestring fries were amazing. We also decided to have dessert. I had the key lime pie, my husband had the pecan pie and our son had a huge root beer float. Everything was yummy but we couldn't finish them.  Prices are fair....our meal came to $72 before tip, the service was decent. The food came out quickly but we had to wait a bit for service in between such as refills and the check.    We will be back"}
{"text":"Grassroots is an American restaurant at its core that offers a few vegetarian options. Soups, salads, sandwiches? Got it. Seafood, pork, chicken, beef? Done. Whole key lime pies or roasted chickens to go? Yes, go ahead and cancel your evening plans because there's plenty to indulge in.  Grassroots is a restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's cheese plate is dubbed \"Dad's Grocery Bag,\" poking fun at Arizona dads for only buying deli products at Safeway. There's a center island that has a bar counter all the way around, with enough TVs to make you think this was some \"bar and grill.\"  It's not. Grassroots offers $20-$40 dining experiences that keep it busy during the week. I ordered the common ground burrata and the grilled portobello sandwich with a side of asparagus.  The burrata was fantastic. Is there any better way to eat soft cheese than on top of jam, argula, and bread?   The grilled portobello sandwich was delicious, too. I told myself to only eat three of the four \"sliders\" that the sandwich came presented as, but I ended up eating everything. Serving the sandwich in slider form with toothpicks made so much sense. Clearly someone in the kitchen has tried to eat a mushroom sandwich and understood how slippery fungi can be.  The asparagus was fine. The table ended up ordering multiple sides, and none stuck out to me as exceptional.  The service has the same fun attitude that the menu does. At one point, a server spilled some nuts onto the floor. Cracking a sly grin, the server mentioned that she meant to do that, causing the table to laugh.  Funny enough, my group was actually trying to go to Scottsdales Twisted Grove and accidentally ended up at Grassroots. We weren't disappointed. I would go again if I were in the Phoenix area looking for American food."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and amazing food.  The scallops and grits special was the best dinner I've had in recent memory.  I'd be here every week if I lived in AZ"}
{"text":"The Piggy Wiggly was good and the Toffee Brownie was excellent. The Hawaiian Sweet Roll Sliders were juicy and and flavorful while the Key Lime Pie was tasty!! Waitress was super sweet with awesome service. Great place for a relaxing birthday dinner!!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing. If you go you must try the coconut cream pie. I usually am not a big fan of coconut cream pie but I read the other reviews and decided to try it. It did not disappoint. The slice was large and when it came out I thought there is no way I can finish this... well I did. It tastes like a macaroon. I told my boyfriend shhh.. don't talk I just want to enjoy this and savor every bite ;-). It was heaven. I also had the brisket with dirty orzo and asparagus. All cooked to perfection. The service was very friendly and quick. They were even so kind as to comp one of our desserts since it was our first time there. They didn't know it was our anniversary, but they definitely made it a special one. We will be back."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! A real neighborhood gem!! I've been there twice for lunch and twice for dinner. Anxious to try more things on the menu as I have had a hard time trying to choose between all the great items. Great casual atmosphere with a bar and the inside dining area is open to the outside patio, also open for dining. Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Grassroots is simply amazing. They have a great selection of beer and wine on tap as well as a simple but delicious menu. I had there chicken and rib combo plate and I have to say it was great. The ribs were so tender the meat just fell of the bone. The chicken was also very tender and juicy. The homemade colsaw was fresh and tasty. Everything about this place is really good. I would recomend it to anyone."}
{"text":"One my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale and probably the one we return to the most often! Don't miss it , the food is excellent, prices are very fair, and the service always attentive. They also have an excellent happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is a must go! We are from San Francisco, which is the mecca for cuisine. Whenever we travel, we are always less than thrilled sometimes. BUT, this place did not disappoint in anyway. Service was fantastic. The food was amazing, the app was amazing and my daughters meal-- was impressive. It came on a ceramic plate that had separations for her two sides, a sauce and than a big space for her main entree. My daughter asked for asparagus ( which was perfectly cut for a small child), the grapes (which she also chose) was cut in half!!!! Which again, is ideal for a small child. Than the chicken tenders were in the main one. At the end of the meal, her meal came with a treat- which was a free ice cream next door! They also have only two-three desserts to not compete with the ice cream shop next door- now amazing is that?!? Pretty nice business etiquette. We can't say anything negative, except...WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO SAN FRAN?!? :)"}
{"text":"Am amazing place! Seared Ahi Tuna Salad is the best salad I have ever had. They gave us free coconut pie!! Have good prices on cocktails and deals on food daily. Great service and wine/beer/tails."}
{"text":"Prompt service and friendly staff. The food came out rather quickly. I ordered the shrimp po'boy and my friend ordered the shrimp and grits. Everything was delicious, a bit over priced for the sandwich offerings but we were pleased."}
{"text":"I stinkin adore this lovely neighborhood spot! The patio is always so inviting with its herb garden and flowering plants. On my return had the chance to try the NM chile and pork soup. The size was just perfect to hit the right spot of hearty yet overwhelmingly Buffet size portion. It is phenomenal. It's flavorful with the right balance of dimension of both slow roasted veggies and crisp cuts of fresh beets. I would want it a tad bit spicer but I'm sure it can be requested. I highly recommend that you not leave without having the sashimi ahi salad, a tall pint of the Michigan Celis White beer and the heavenly key lime pie. There's something about the whipped cream that is so nutty and the hand squeezed key lime is just simply perfection in a slice! I will warn that service gets overwhelmed during rush hour so anticipate a long lunch hour :)"}
{"text":"I am late in giving my review-HOLY COW! This place was fan flipping tastic.  I asked my friend to research healthy lunch spots as we were in town from Chicago.  We thought this menu looked great and decided to give it a whirl.  Ambiance was wonderful-lots of windows, light and a nice terrace in the back.  Our server was Sydney (sp?). We were torn over what sides to get so she brought us the greens on the House - they were awesome.    My friend got a salmon salad which she enjoyed, but I'm not much of a salmon fan.  My meal is the one that stole the show.  My friend and I agreed my meal was the best food we ate all weekend-Chicken salad sandwich and cole slaw.  I don't know which was better, the light, sweet, but hearty chicken salad on a crispy wheat bun, or the light-dressing cole slaw (not mayo based +++) They complimented each other perfectly.  That sandwich...WOW!  Service and food were fantastic, would come back here in a heart beat! I live above True Food in Chicago, and I wish I could kick them out and put a Grassroots in . Any hopes to expand???"}
{"text":"I made a mistake and wrote a Bad review for this restaurant when in fact it was the one around the the corner called Snooze. I had lunch at this restaurant and everything was suburb. I had apps, soup and a beer. You can't go wrong with this place. Excellent service at the bar. My apologies for the error."}
{"text":"We keep going back for buratta, pork belly and I always have the shrimp po'boy.  All are excellent.  The po'boy is really quite good and reminds me of Baby Kay's which used to be in this exact location.  They had a great shrimp po'boy as well.  We try to sit in one of the booths in the far back of the restaurant.  Its nice and cozy back there.  The ice tea here is great too.  We will definitely be back as its close to the wife's office."}
{"text":"Everyone in my family LOVED their meal. We ordered Prosciutto Wrapped Asparagus to start us off. I got the Spit Fire Chicken that was beyond excellent and paired nicely with the soaked bread. The rest of my family ordered Root's BBQ Brisket, Club House Salad and the 'Roti' and Rib Combo.  For dessert we got Key Lime Pie and Chocolate Toffee Brownie. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We detoured from carbs and tried Grassroots on a Saturday afternoon; only our second visit since this convenient location has opened. Beau had the Ahi Salad and was pleased. I was on a mission to try another Caeser salad and Grassroots hit it perfectly; anchovies offered and plenty of homemade croutons. Drip coffee was perfect."}
{"text":"We tried the ribs and brisket. Both were very good. My favorite side was the jalapeno cheddar grits. The menu has a nice variety but isn't overwhelming, which I liked. Service was very good. Four stars because we waited a little too long for the food from the kitchen, imo. Otherwise, good."}
{"text":"Grassroots is a fabulous little lunch spot in Scottsdale. It has a strong neighborhood vibe and is immediately likable upon entrance. The restaurant provides seating variety - around the bar, a common table and standard two and four tops. The service was casual yet professional with very friendly and knowledgeable servers. Lunch is a busy time, so reserve or expect a little wait for a table. We opted for a bar seat which worked perfectly. Now, onto the food.  Grassroots offers a varied and local menu. I'm sure you will notice that that the shrimp and grits is frequently reviewed (and ordered) for a reason - it's awesome.  The dish is well balanced and delivers the right mix of cheese gooey-ness and spice. It is not very southern, but this is Scottsdale...Order it! My lunch companion selected the ahi, also excellent and worth consideration. The key lime pie is sublime.   Overall, a great restaurant and my new goto haunt for a special occasion lunch around the office.  Hope you enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic find on Yelp! Went here during Happy Hour, amazing prices and kids meal is free from 3-6pm with an adult entree! One of the nicest kids meals we have seen. Beautiful shrimp, asparagus (and fries of course). My husband had the tuna salad and I had the Club salad with their creamy pesto dressing which was fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place this was! I've wanted to try it for months, not knowing it was the sister restaurant of Twisted Grove Parlor (where they have the most amazing brussel sprouts, by the way!). We made a reservation, so seating was no problem. We sat outside and although it was a little chilly, they had plenty of heaters, overhead and on the ground. It was perfect.   Our service was impeccable. My pork chop was seared to perfection and the loaded baked potato was one of the best I've ever had. I had two of the Georgia Peach Tea's and while I'm a fan of sweet tea (being from the south), the iced tea was perfect to top of the alcohol.   To finish off dinner, we had the pecan pie with a scoop of ice cream and can I just say it was heavenly! Before dessert came out, the owner and head chef, Mr. Christopher Collins came out. It was so nice to know that he was concerned about his patrons.   What a great restaurant. Visit, soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! My boyfriend and I found this gem in Phoenix magazine where they were voted the best burger in Phoenix. We recently moved to Phoenix from Portland, OR. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a friendly staff. We ordered the 'dad's grocery bag' appetizer and a glass of wine and beer on happy hour. The food was amazing! Every aspect of it shined, the honey, cheese, delicious meats and bread were in harmony. We had an amazing server who was very attentive and had a wonderful demeanor. She recommended the shrimp and grits which were great!  The burger was amazing too! The personable management and chef came around to introduce themselves and check on us, a true commitment to excellence! It was a nice reminder that dining is not just about the (fantastic) food, but the entire experience that grassroots has perfected. Truly Phoenix's finest!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place!  Two thumbs up!    While at a conference in Scottsdale, AZ, I yelped a healthy restaurant and found this gem.  The chef is awesome!  He was able to accommodate my needy ways and made my shrimp and grits to my dietary restrictions and it was wonderful!  I've been craving shrimp and grits since my visit to Charleston, SC and these did not disappoint.  The ambience was great.  The music was cool alternative tunes playing in the background at the perfect level.  You know, not too loud, I like to be able to talk to those at my table without yelling.  Everything was perfect!  The prices were totally reasonable and the food was stellar.  I hope to make it back one more time before I leave the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Had the Portabello Sandwich with the jalapeño and cheese grits. One word: Phenomenal  Great friendly service - thanks Domingo :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. The menu is well thought out and the food is consistently good. The burrata appetizer is not to be missed. The short rib entree is a great dish. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere excellent food beyond belief as far as flavor one of my favorite places we've been in the last two weeks"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  The food is out of this world.  The service was spectacular. Our waitress was so friendly and attentive.  I dream about their charred brussle sprouts!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day dinner. 4 adults and two kids. We didn't have a reservation but they offered us seating on the back patio.  It was very comfortable and less crowded. Good for the kids to have some freedom. Our waitress was very attentive and we ordered an appetizer that came out quickly and was delicious. I had the blackened fish and it was very tasty. Others had the filet and the scallops special and both were good. Kids meals were also good. Definitely would recommend this place. Pj"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! However we were watching the grass grow while waiting for the server to come back to check on us...slow service! Make sure you have plenty of time to spare."}
{"text":"I really like Grassroots and go when I want to treat myself. I always get the Shrimp and Grits. It's just great. Last time I tried the Dirty Rice side where the \"rice\" is actually orzo. It was a disappointment. The beet salad was so tasty, I \"stole\" the recipe and make it at Thanksgiving. I will be back the next time I have a celebration!"}
{"text":"Nom!!!!! Smoked salmon and orzo salad was to die for. It is not often that I actually eat EVERY little crumb left on my plate but today that was the case. It was fantastic. We took a group of business partners to lunch and all had never been. They loved each meal they got as well. Shrimp and grits was another big win. The salmon and asparagus was flavored just perfect and the sandwiches were exactly what you need out of a lunch portion.   The service was attentive and polite. I drink water like a crazy person so whenever I go out to eat it's basically a running joke to see if anyone can keep my water glass full.....they managed to get out of this meal with a big win with a full water glass the whole time!  Yaayyyy for amazing servers."}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim driving for date night.  I was impressed by the menu and the ingredients, figured we would try it. This is one of the best places I have ever been to! Our server was great, the food had exploding flavors, everything on your plate pairs so well together.  Really cute joint with simple decor and warm ambiance.  I enjoyed my experience here very much and intend to return."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  I had the Farmer's Vegetable Chop Salad.  It was average as it lacked flavor even with dressing. The small portion was VERY small.  They do not have non-alcoholic beer which was disappointing for my non-drinking friend.  Like the atmosphere and have enjoyed past meals, especially the Ahi Poke."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I took my out of town guests here. We all loved our food. They ordered salads with ahi tuna.  Such large portions. When the salads came my friends said no way they could eat it all. But they did!  It was that good. I ordered short ribs with grits yum!  Tender boneless ribs with the sauce. Our waiter Adam suggested a fire roasted broccoli with feta cheese sprinkles. That was so delicious. The service was great and food was delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"Grassroots never disappoints. The manager Robbie is always hospitable and their service is always fantastic. I've gotten the ahi salad and the burrata more times than I can count - you could say I'm addicted! I've also tried various fish items with different combinations of sides, the key lime and the chocolate toffee brownie - they were all phenomenal. Every dish has amazing flavors and you're never waiting long for your food! Also, the environment is very sophisticated and well cleaned. The music isn't too loud and there are tvs around the bar but they are muted - everything about it is classy. I would highly recommend Grassroots to anyone and everyone. Definitely one of my favorite dining places."}
{"text":"If you want some straight up good, pure food, this is the place.  It was our first time, and we will be coming back.  Since it was our first time, she gave us a free slice of pie.  Totally blown away with the customer service.  Do yourself a favor and COME ESY HERE."}
{"text":"Enjoyed every aspect, menu has lots of great seafood choices, service was good from arrival to check, food was delicious- we will return"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. We missed happy hour, but the portions are large enough that we still got a great deal. My husband had the soup of the day, which was red beans and rice and he couldn't finish it. I split the half Club salad and Pork Belly plate to share with my preteen daughter and we couldn't finish the pork belly. Both were scrumptious!  My son's kids' meal was a bit pricey at $7, BUT it came w/a side of chopped asparagus (which he didn't touch, but I though was delicious--corn kernels might've been a better choice for kids, fries and a sizable cheeseburger.  Backing up to that pork belly...TO. DIE. FOR. The only thing that I discovered by chance that made it even more amazing was to put some of the onion slices and blue cheese from our salad on top of it. It was like a party in my mouth.  The customer service her is also over the top. Would love to come back if we're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice addition to the area.  The area needed a solid place with good food that is geared to the younger crowd and Grassroots hit the mark.  They have a menu full of comfort food-like selections that doesn't overwhelm you with choices.  For an appitizer my table shared the barrata which was excellent and perfect to share because of it's size.  I was also surprised at the size of the short rib entree.  You get 3 large hunks of rib that were cooked perfectly.  The BBQ sauce was just ok but the meat was plenty flavorful and tender so it really didn't need much.  The grits were also delicious and a perfect compliment to the ribs.  The 2 under cooked asparagus spears were more for decoration than to be eaten though.  I also sampled the bbq brisket which was also very good.  As with the short rib, I prefer my meat a little fattier (I know, I'm sick) so it wasn't out of this world good for me.  All-in-all Grassroots was a good experience and I would return.  Next time I'm getting the shrimp and grits for sure."}
{"text":"This is a cool neighborhood restaurant. They have done a nice job with the neighborhood vibe and atmosphere. I sat on the back patio at a long picnic style table which was very enjoyable. I tried the highly recommended shrimp po'boy but, I was not blown away by it. The side that I got with it was the jalapeno cheddar grits which was the best thing that I tried there. I felt that for what we received the items were just a tad bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were first timers here last weekend. This 5-star rating goes to Chuck, our waiter, who was awesome!! He gave good input and made sure our experience was positive. We even got free dessert! The food was very good as well. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Ohh this was very yummy!  And quick!  I had the brisket sandwich which was excellent."}
{"text":"My colleagues in Phoenix raved so much about this place that it was inadvertently booked for team dinners two nights in a row. What accounted for the Grassroots campaign? I can see why as the menu feels South by Southwest if you know what I mean. It has a definite twang but it ain't lard-laden heart attack on a plate like a deep-fried Paula Deen extravaganza. A group of us arrived at the Shops at Town & Country where I immediately let out a foodie sigh since Chris Bianco's famous Pizzeria Bianco was right next door. Been wanting to try that. So close yet so far away. Anyway, six of us huddled into one of the party booths competing with a much louder group.  For some reason, a $9 White Chocolate Martini sounded good and pretty cheap with 360 vanilla vodka, Bailey's and Godiva white chocolate liqueur (photo: http://bit.ly/2foPpfJ). Just a bit too sweet but on a humid Arizona evening, not a bad libation to sip. We shared a couple of appetizers that managed to satisfy our collective palates. The first was the $9 Piggly Wiggly, a generous platter of mini-baby back ribs, pork belly, and prosciutto-wrapped asparagus (photo: http://bit.ly/2exAlgN). It was certainly meaty enough and most essentially, quite shareable. The second was better, the refreshing $8 Common Ground Burrata, which presented fresh mozzarella, dressed arugula, spicy tomato jam, and happily, six toast points, one for each of us (photo: http://bit.ly/2flx9mV).  The freshness of the mozzarella really brought this one home. For my entree, I went for a house favorite, the $18 Spit Fire Chicken, which took a half-roasted chicken (a bit too charred) and laid it on top of a huge slice of bread soaked in pan drippings and accessorized it with New Orleans-style \"dirty\" orzo mixed in a cup of gumbo (photo: http://bit.ly/2fEBAxj). I thought the bread was going to be carb overkill but it was so saturated with the poultry juices that it became almost polenta-like. The chicken could have been a bit more tender, but hey,I didn't complain since I was filling out the expense report. A good time was had by all, and now I know where at least one of the Pizzeria Biancos is.  FOOD - 4 stars...Southern dishes with a modern sensibility and good flavors that don't reek of lard AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...contemporary take on a Southern cafe, I think SERVICE - 3.5 stars...certainly attentive enough TOTAL - 4 stars...definitely would come back even as a paying customer"}
{"text":"Great dinner location! Our server was wonderful and super friendly. I had the baby back ribs and they were fall off the bone delicious. Cocktails were tasty as well. I loved the dessert: strawberry-lemon ice box pie! I could have eaten the whole pie!"}
{"text":"Definitely a very good spot. It was smaller than we we imagined but they had some good tables outside with misters. Only thing is it was 115 when we went so nobody was sitting outside, otherwise I bet those tables would be fun.   Reserved our table via OpenTable and our reservation when we checked in went smoothly. Our first server - to be completely honest - had to be so hungover. She was having a rough day and wasn't very enthusiastic and just dead. She got our beer order wrong, which wasn't terrible because I could drink it but my boyfriend isn't a huge fan of the fruity beers. They fixed the problem no big deal. She ended up leaving for the evening and we got a new server who was from out of town. She was great. I wish I could remember her name but she is from Wisconsin.   On our food - we ordered the happy hour wings for $5. It was a good deal and the wings were tasty. They're not spicy at all so we poured hot sauce on them. They also have a good deal on their pitcher of beer (50 oz for $10). My boyfriend ordered the BBQ brisket sliders for $7. They were good, pretty standard BBQ sliders.  I ordered the special of the day which was scallops and grits. Coming from Seattle I was skeptical of their scallops but had to order them and satisfy my craving. They were cooked perfectly. A little on the saltier side but paired with the grits was delicious. The grits had corn, sausage, celery and bell peppers. A fun way to make grits. I was very satisfied.   I gave them four stars because of the service we got from the second server and the quality and time of service. We were celebrating my birthday and the server got us a chocolate brownie with ice cream on the house :) they don't normally do anything special for birthdays so it was a nice gesture.   I would definitely recommend for happy hour and dinner, nothing mind blowing but good service overall and timely."}
{"text":"Completely unassuming from the outside but a real gem inside. Wonderful service, delicious food and thoughtful menu. I will definitely be back. Great options for vegetarians as well as meat lovers. Sarah took great care of us and even comped us a free slice of their delectable key lime pie!!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wanted this to be a 5 star experience, unfortunately it was not.  The restaurant is small and cozy which I like.  I also like the décor, some of the art on the walls was absolutely gorgeous and the ambient music is good (we heard Metallica playing!)  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which was fine since the place was packed; we came in right around the end of their happy hour.  If you want to go here on a Friday night make a reservation!  They also do one of my biggest pet peeves.  They have a really nice outdoor seating area but they don't serve food out there!  I really hate restaurants that do that.  I was a little surprised by the crowd at the restaurant since it seemed really trendy.  My husband and I are in our early thirties, there was one other couple around our age and the rest of the patrons were 50-80.  Our waitress was nice but I wouldn't call her above average in any way.  We started off with the Poke appetizer.  It was alright, the tuna was really fresh and the shrimp were cooked perfectly but I felt it was lacking flavor.  I used the half lime they served it with liberally and my husband doused his portion in hot sauce.  I also didn't like the wontons they served it with.  They were so hard it cut my gum!  My husband ordered the mixed BBQ plate which our waitress told us was \"huge.\"  It was not huge; it was a small chicken breast and maybe 5-6 bones worth of ribs.  The chicken skin tasted heavily of cinnamon so my husband pulled it off.  The chicken was well cooked but pretty flavorless, he doused that in hot sauce too.  The ribs weren't bad but they were average.  The coleslaw was an Asian slaw which was nice and I think the baked beans were the star of the evening.  They were probably the best baked beans I'd ever had and a big reason why this review is 3 stars instead of 2.  For $24 we both expected a lot more!  I got the braised short ribs.  It was 2 small pieces of short rib.  They were cooked nicely, they fell apart when I stuck my fork in them and the sauce was flavorful.  It was served with 2 asparagus spears and the jalapeno cheddar grits.  I am very sensitive when it comes to heat and the grits had no spice to them at all.  It tasted like green peppers instead of jalapenos and lacked flavor in general.    We had the appetizer, two entrees, my husband had a beverage with alcohol and I had a soda.  Our bill was $74, $90 with tip.  If it had been cheaper I might consider going back.  It was definitely not worth that much money for the amount of food we got and how it tasted!  Their cooking technique is spot on, but the flavor of all the food we got was seriously lacking.  I'm glad we went so we could check it out but we won't be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The bar seating is great! The bartenders Mia and Corinne are awesome. Great salads and happy hour. Come and check it out!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to go ! My husband and I live right across the street and it is one of our go-to places . Our favorite is the shrimp po boy wither the grits and cole slaw ( wish I usually hate ) . Never had a bad meal here !"}
{"text":"If I could give a restaurant 6 stars I would do that for Grassroots.  It's that good.  My husband and I have eaten here 6 times in the past 4-5 weeks and we've tried a number of different menu items: salads, steak, ribs, red fish, burrata, and  the pie.  Everything is very high quality, thoughtfully prepared and absolutely delicious.  The owner carefully sources everything and his quest for the best is evident in the results.  And the service is exceptional.  Upbeat, conscientious, happy employees.  While everything is very good, here's what's great:  the burrata with ciabatta, arugula and tomato jam; the creamy garlic dressing, the petite filet, the perfectly roasted chicken; the jalapeño grits; the pie!  Who would expect to find perfect pie here? Not me. But there it is: tart key lime, fresh apple, spicy pumpkin, custardy coconut cream. The chef makes them on premise and flavors vary (except the key lime).  The owner and managers are fully engaged in everything going on and  take  time to check in with diners and not in a perfunctory way, they care and listen. Town and Country is back! Check it out."}
{"text":"Highly recommend having dinner here.  Got the pork belly app.  Outstanding.  Very smartly done.  Pancetta disguises as tomato.  Think bruschetta but with pork belly.  Game over.   The next app was wings.  Complete fail on that.  Free range chicken that was over fried... the sauce was a fail too but you get a bottle of hot sauce on the table which was great.    Got the ahi tuna salad.  Smartly done and even comes served in chilled plate.  Excellent.  Please use more fresh lettuce as it was browning and the sauce was too much but the hot sauce actually cut it well.  Overall satisfied.   Great ambience and servers were great.  Highly recommend you stop by and get a healthy sampling.  I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"The best part of our visit to Grassroots was the service. Quick, attentive. Or it was the in-house smoked salmon appetizer. Salty, smoky, great texture.  The main courses were so lackluster, so downright bad, that I'm baffled as to this restaurant's rating.  -Shrimp and grits- Tiny, cooked to rubber, over-seasoned shrimp atop grits that were so thick, so dry, it felt like spackling paste. Served with a very large portion of focaccia. Wrong choice here, as the grits would be the starch you'd sop up any sauce with. If there was any sauce. There was not.  -Po' boy- Again with the tiny shrimp, think frozen salad shrimp. Bread? Meh. How a 7-11 would mass produce a southern sandwich.  -side dishes- The baked beans were a tasty, and meaty option. The chard should really just be billed as spinach here. One leaf of chard, possibly two. Tasty nonetheless.  I love southern food, from crisp fried hush puppies to blackened fish. Beignets to crawfish pie. Our visit was uninspired. I couldn't be convinced to return."}
{"text":"Love!! Monday's red beans and rice are my absolute favorite. Such great service and vibe! Highly recommend the coleslaw too!"}
{"text":"After talking about trying Grassroots several times, my boyfriend and I finally had dinner here, and I'm glad we did! The food and service was great; if I had any complaints it would just be that it's a bit on the expensive side.   The weather was perfect when we came in, so we sat outside on the patio, which was really nice for a weeknight dinner because the vibe was quiet and intimate. I would just watch out and not sit too close to the misters (they were really strong, but luckily turned off soon after we sat down because I hate misters lol). The table was maybe a bit dusty as well, but nothing that ruined our night.   For dinner, I decided to be healthy and ordered the Waldorf Chicken Salad, and it was delicious. I love that kind of salad, and this one had the perfect amount of dressing (normally I think restaurants add too much). I would have liked more chicken, but overall it was super good. My boyfriend ordered the Carolina Baby Backs, and I will definitely get those next time! We love ribs and thought these were really well done. I was really impressed with the barbecue sauce.   We didn't order dessert, but our waitress recommended the Chocolate Toffee Brownie, which we definitely want to try next time! I tried to get pictures of our food and the cute patio, but the lighting was bad and one accidental flash was embarrassing enough ;)"}
{"text":"Food was good. Salad portion was large but I'm not sure about the price for what it was. The brisket sandwich was delicious. Service not good. I understand venting and joking around with co workers .. they spend the most time with you. I don't understand not paying attention to paying customers during their time with you. So yay on the food but not so much on the service."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food and atmosphere. Come in and see Nash. He'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"Great location. Our server was out going but not obnoxious. I really enjoyed their play on the greyhound. My chopped salad was a treat with 14 different vegetables in it."}
{"text":"This is based on 1 meal, and yes my choices were informed by other Yelpers. The burrata was one of the best appetizers i've had in a long time, and it's also true to say the Shrimp Po'Boy was the best i've had of that sandwich (though I admit i've never eaten one in the Delta or NOLA)"}
{"text":"I am very polar -- good food and good service gets you 5 stars. Bad service, no matter how good the food, gets your 1 star.  Had to wait at least 15 to 20 minutes to order. Took the order of the people next to us before me that came in way after. Even after I told her I was ready to order. Not cool. Guy next to me trying to order being ignored. So it isn't just me."}
{"text":"I ordered short ribs with grits and asparagus.  It was an extremely memorable meal...beyond delicious....and I'll be sure to stop at this restaurant every trip to Phoenix.  The restaurant also has good drinks."}
{"text":"I've stopped here for dinner during my last two visits to Phoenix, and find that their food and drink options are fantastic, and the service friendly.  They're usually pretty busy, but this last time, we were able to get seats pretty immediately on a slow May Tuesday evening (I imagine the seasonal crowd is gone by this time of year).    My favorite appetizer is the charred brussels sprouts (they aren't really charred, just fried so perfectly crispy).  It comes in a short clear canning glass sitting on its side on a cutting board, half inside the jar, and the other half poured onto the cutting board.  The sprouts are crispy and bits of garlic and pork belly are sprinkled throughout.  The pork belly appetizer itself is pretty decadent.  Rich, but delicious!  Their various salad options are pretty tasty as well.  We had the poached shrimp salad.  The flavors were fresh and the portion was fairly generous.  Their blackened red fish was also a solid performer.  Finally, I was a big fan of the jalapeno cheddar grits!  They're amazing warm, so eat them right away!"}
{"text":"One member of the staff was courteous in seating us however we chose to sit at the bar.  The bartender came off rude in his demeanor as if we walked in at closing or something. So much that a couple sitting next to us seemed to agree with us. Not sure if he was just having a bad night but it made it a rather unpleasant experience. Unfortunately the food was not very good either. I will not return there but I do wish the owner the best."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Grassroots. Came in on a Friday evening, with reservations (although not really needed) we sat outside. It was a chilly evening but the heat lamps and enclosed patio kept us warm and comfortable.   Our server was ?Angie?, I think, she was super cute, tiny and had short hair. She was very friendly, happy and had great explanation of the menu and food.   We started with a dirty martini and traditional Moscow Mule (not their version of Moscow Bull which add red bull) My husband had a couple as he thought they were delish!  Our apps were the prosciutto wrapped asparagus and the pork belly. Hands down, the best pork belly I've had in a while. Greasy, tender and melt in your mouth! The spicy tomato jam and toast points were a perfect accompaniment to the pork, although I swore the tomato jam was Apple Butter but none the less AMAZING! The asparagus was jumbo and when I say jumbo, I mean huge! Tender, salty and tasty.   Our entrees were the shrimp and grits and chicken/ribs combo.  The shrimp and grits were delicious. Spicy grilled white shrimp with creamy cheddar and fresh jalapeño grits. Was spicy but not overpowering and left you wanting more and more! My only wish is that the grits were slightly runnier and not as stiff, nonetheless, delectable! Have you ever been to Brenda's in The Tenderloin in SAN FRAN?? They have the best shrimp and grits in America (personal opinion) but Grassroots is giving Brenda a run for her money!   The rotisserie chicken and baby back rib combo came with the sweetest baked beans, those were my favorite in the plate. Re ribs have a light, not overpowering BBQ sauce. Tender and fall off the bone. The chicken had good flavor but was slightly dry for our taste. We subbed shoestring potatoes for the coleslaw. The potatoes were super crispy and perfectly salty. Yum!   Couldn't make it to dessert as we were completely stuffed to the max! But I did ask our server if I could try the garlic vinaigrette and champagne vinaigrette as a 'dessert'. I could have drank the garlic vinaigrette, sweet and garlicky with hints of herbs. I can't wait to go back and order this dressing on a salad.   We had a great experience here! Some of the negative reviews on friendliness may be true. I saw two servers who were completely blah and underwhelming at their tables and barely could look anyone in the eye. But not out server, she was fantastic! We will absolutely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Seriously, my new favorite place.  I've been here twice and the food is amazing.  I've tried the short ribs, pork ribs & chicken, shrimp po boy, chopped salad, buratta with tomato jam, grits, bacon baked beans, key lime pie, and toffee brownie.  All were excellent, except the chicken which was a little on the dry side.  The must try items are the short ribs (flavorful and tender), shrimp po boy (seasoned perfectly with fresh, soft bread), toffee brownie (still warm, so good, just get it!) and baked bean (my husband and I don't like baked beans but these were amazing).  I'll definitely will be back to try other items.  People around me were eating burgers and shrimp & grits that looked amazing.  In addition, they have a great selection of salads which is great since I'm always looking for delicious, fresh salads."}
{"text":"Angie at the bar was awesome. She created a new cocktail for me that wasn't even on the menu. Great, fast service. Only had the wings at the bar but they were great. Will def return!"}
{"text":"Stuffed. Had Taylor as our server, friendly and bubbly, kept our drinks filled and checked on us frequently without being intrusive. Had the wings, perfectly sized appetizer, slightly sweet sauce very tasty and piping hot. I had the portobello sandwich (great but could have halved the bun) with tortilla soup, yummy. Husband had the filet which he said was great. He let me have a bite and I'll have to agree. We skipped desert because we had no room. Overall awesome meal. We ate out on the covered patio which is a nice option"}
{"text":"We ordered the blacken fish sandwich and the special of the day: prime rib sandwich with white cheddar and shoestring fries. Out of this world good. The local draft pilsner beer was also really good. Food came fast, service was good. A must try!"}
{"text":"A buddy and I came here after we both went searching on Yelp for a place to eat, we chose Grassroots based on the reviews.  We arrived and the spot is clean and fun but the hostess station is set up weird. We did manage to snag a booth which is always nice.  We were greeted by Kate, our server, who was fun and quirky and kinda allover the place in a good way. My buddy got the Shrimp Po Boy and I got the burger with slaw at the recommendation of Kate who made the claim that the slaw was exceptional.  I must say this was a pretty amazing burger, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. And to my surprise the slaw recommendation was spot on, this was one of the most unique and delicious slaws I've ever had.  Overall this place is really good and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had the short ribs and blackened red fish per recommendation from our server. Both were wonderful!! I usually don't like orzo but it was prepared very well here and I really liked it. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch today.  Alfred (awesome server, and not related to Bruce Wayne) was very helpful in the selections and knew his stuff!  Well done...   Ok. The food....My wife an I started with a couple cups of Short Rib Black bean chili.... delicious and the chili consistency and flavor was on point.   We ended up splitting the Root's BBQ Brisket with white cheddar Jalapeño grits and sub'd the beans for Char'd Broccoli with a champagne vinaigrette.  The Brisket and sauce (not too thick, tangy and a little sweet) was perfect . The grits and broccoli made a nice combo. All well presented  THEN IT ALL HAPPENED.  We were presented with the Pumpkin Pie to die for... its hard to even explain other than its light, creamy, with an awesome chewy crust.  Believe it was a pumpkin custard ...no matter it was crazy good. A must have at this time of season!"}
{"text":"I visited Grassroots Kitchen & Tap while on business in Phoenix.  I ordered my dinner to-go, as I was very tired and just wanted to relax.  The female bartender was very friendly, and was kind enough to offer water while I waited.  The food was ready to go very quickly, and I was impressed by the short wait.  I ordered braised short ribs - so delicious!  The meal came with jalepeno cheddar grits, which were OK - they could have been a little creamier, and southern baked beans, also OK.  I would welcome a dining in while on business again."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent and staff is super friendly. They have a HUGE staff so multiple people are always checking in. Other than not being seated outside as our reservation requested, I have never had any issues."}
{"text":"I never write negative reviews, but this was so disappointing. There is a real Southern restaurant near IKEA for a fraction of the cost. This place is an exploitation of the Whole Foods crowd that was less than mediocre. The sandwiches were soggy and the chard is thinned out with cabbage and doused with flavorless oil and enormous quantities of nearly raw garlic that made me feel sick afterwards. Not like any Southern greens I have had. They screwed up our order and the table next to us. Save your money. Go get some good food somewhere else."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend I hadn't seen in years and loved the food and tea. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Met the Gf for a quick dinner after a board meeting. Got in right away and sat in the patio area. Great for people watching as it is close to Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and LA Fitness. Had a Lagunitas IPA to start the meal and at the Club salad with shredded chicken. They toss the salad for you with the chicken and bacon so the whole thing has their garlic ranch like dressing mixed in. It is by far my favorite salad there. Comes in two sizes, lunch and dinner which you can get anytime of the day.   My gf had the Shrimp and Grits. I seriously stole about a third. The grits have a ham jalapeño purée and it is fantastic. Each table also has Topher's Angry Saice which is a lot like Franks Red Hot. You can buy it for 5 bucks plus tax. Good amount of Shrimp for the price and the portion is very big."}
{"text":"Stopped in for HH. Nice space, modern industrial look with bar in the middle. Nice patio, but too hot today. Service was good. Rather limited tap selection, but $4 happy hour price. Wife got a glass of wine for $7. It was a generous pour. HH app selection pretty good, but wife ordered salmon from the regular menu. Not much there, but it was done right. Came with a side of asparagus. At $26 it seemed a tad meager. I just ordered the HH wings. They were ok, but they only have one sauce, barbeque. I had to add hot sauce to spice it up. They give you a lot of wings, but they are tiny!! Dove size."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went for my husband's birthday and had the burrata, red bean soup, short ribs and scallops (special). It was all delicious and had great service. Corinna was great."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday for a early dinner and was very happy with the food and service.  We made it in time for Happy Hour and had some delicious wings and a couple of beers.  I had the Cajun Ahi sandwich and my gf had the Shrimp Po boy.  We both loved them and will be going back soon!  If in the area I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Yummy! It was restaurant week so I was able to try the ahi poke chips, the baby back ribs, and the key lime pie all for a gnarly price of $33! So very worth it!   The ahi poke chips were so delicious and wonderfully made I wish I had more! Although it would be nice to have more chips, the portion size was very generous with poke and fresh avocado. Also very perfectly seasoned. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.   Next was the entree of a whole rack of ribs and and skinny French fries! The rack of ribs were so flavorful and perfectly marinated my tummy was happy by the end of it! The fries were also plentiful and being a fry lover myself, I was extremely happy with my choice.   Last was the key lime pie. This was one of the best key lime pies I've been had (note that I haven't eat that many in my lifetime though)! It wasn't too sweet and it sufficed perfectly to end the meal.   I came with my coworkers so we had a large group of 11 people. The waiters were nice enough to provide everyone with key lime pies and brownies with a scoop of ice cream!   Overall, best place I've had in Arizona. Highly recommend and would definitely come back if I visit again!! Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"I love this place. The farmers chopped salad has the perfect blend of vegetables! My favorite of all salads. Great drinks and ambience! A modern touch to southern dinning! Must try BBQ brisket and spit fire chicken!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was very pleased with the service and the choices on the menu, the burger I ordered was cooked to perfection and portions were just right, plenty of parking, patio seating was large enough for a group. With plenty of seating inside also. We will keep this on our go to list."}
{"text":"Great dishes here.  From the pork belly for appetizers, to the river trout for entree, to the absolutely sublime key lime pie, everything here was perfect.  It has the feel of a local diner, but in a up scale Scottsdale Southwestern style.  I love it, and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We're visiting from California and are hungry.    There isn't much I can really say as I only got as far as ordering my iced tea then left.  The host was friendly.  The ambience seemed Tommy bahama meets Napa Valley.    Price was average.  Our server seemed nice but made us feel very, very rushed and upset my husband - which is why we left.  :(  I gave this place 2 stars cuz now I have to deal with a pissed off hungry hubby while looking for another place to eat."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  We had a table of 5 and ordered several entrees to share.  The short ribs and scallops special were my favorites.  Our server Marina was hilarious and took great care of us."}
{"text":"We wanted to try everything!  We ordered the piggly wiggly, dirty orzo, shrimp and grits, boat load of wings, and ahi poke.  Best dish of all was the shrimp and grits and I don't normally order this type of dish. Social hour (Happy hour) goes from 3pm to 6pm.  The wings are the best bang for your buck.  6 bucks will get you a boat load.  The domestic drafts are $4 during social hour.  When you are finished with your meal you can order sweets from next door and eat them at your table.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"A complete disappointment! To start we ordered a Four Peaks Double Pumpkin porter beer on tap that tasted like pennies. This is indicative of the tap lines not being cleaned. Our waitress was notified about this and she stated she would tell the manager. A manager never came out to talk to us and we were still charged for the beer. Additionally, the service was awful. I waited 20 minutes to get a tea refill. The waitress only checked on us twice. The asparagus was charred and under seasoned. The hamburger was also over cooked. This place was over priced for what you get. On a positive note,  the ambiance was cozy and welcoming. (Written by my better half.)"}
{"text":"WOW, OMG, amazing, and a few more exclamations were what I was hearing last night when three of us stopped in for some nosh.    We shared the brussels sprouts.  Simply amazing - I think someone who hates them could begin to like this preparation.  Presentation on a board with a tipped jar - a sight to behold - befitting the fab flavors.  The roasted garlic were incredible - I'd have loved to have a few more cloves, and the balsamic was perfect.  And how can you go wrong with pieces of thick bacon.  We also shared the cauliflower side - amazing as well.  But the sprouts are my favorite.    I ordered the Short Ribs with the hoisin glaze.  Every. Single. Bite. was pure enjoyment.  The incredible jalapeño-cheddar grits were perfect.  The grilled asparagus had great flavor - but the large stocks had some pretty woody bottoms - took away from that component - but overall - SOLID dish.    Dining companions gushed about the Roti and Ribs (the cole slaw was amazing) and the Southern Shrimp and Grits - Jalapeño-cheddar grits, Tasso ham relish, and grilled focaccia.  The first time I've ever heard someone say \"OMG that's the best toast I've ever had\".  Service was fantastic.  Drinks (which were amazing) were delivered promptly, and our server kept a good eye on our water - and my penchant for lots of ice with my water was well satisfied!  He was attentive without being over bearing.  I like that.  The manager stopped by the table - very friendly.  I can see why she does - her staff and kitchen put out a top notch product with incredible service.  No need to hide behind the office doors - people have to be seriously enjoying every minute and morsel there.  Can't wait to try the location up closer to home.  Great job!"}
{"text":"The grits are to die for. The service is amazing. Unique eats and great bartenders.  Love this place."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Very good. Ahi tuna salad was delicious, but a little pricey. Great beer and wine on tap and great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"So we were told that the food here was amazing.  I think the heat of Phoenix has gotten to some peoples head and good judgment.  This review is based on the food only as our server was tremendous.  He was very friendly and engaging and accommodating.  He would get 5 stars.  However, the food really needs to be tasted again.  We had the roots BBQ brisket.  These folks have never had good brisket.  KC Brisket is still the best and then the others follow.  This was not even brisket.  It was like a fatty piece of cheap meat that you were told was brisket.  The bark was barely visible, the taste was not desirable at any level, no BBQ taste and the quality of the meat was just terrible.  The salad it came with was just so plain, a little extra veggies  (carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers) would not hurt and be much more pleasing.  I'm not a grits fan but I was told these were amazing.  Just saying, I'm still not a grits fan.  The server gladly replaced it with huge pieces of asparagus.  They were not bad, just very large which takes away the tenderness and taste of the vegetable.  Lastly, the brownie was a massive disappointment.  It looked great, but tasted exactly like a flour-less cake.  UGGGG!  If it was not for the server, unfortunately on this visit, Grassroots would have received one star."}
{"text":"Still an excellent lunch spot with free wifi as well as an enjoyable dinner venue. I had last Wednesday's Gumbo special, (sausage and chicken variety) which was excellent. The bowl probably was enough for lunch, but I needed an order of their jalapeno cheese grits which may be the world's best.   Excellent food, excellent service. We continue to enjoy this restaurant every trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in and have lunch with your friends or by yourself. I would definitely recommend going during their happy hour as their food seems a bit overpriced to me... But hey, it's close to the Biltmore right?... They have really great customer service and they cook their chicken just right. The atmosphere is something right out of a rustic design pinterest board. All in all, would recommend and would go back."}
{"text":"We stumbled across Grassroots today at lunch and loved it!  Great menu.  Friendly service. Reasonable prices.  Comfy vibe.  Super veggie options!"}
{"text":"The tuna poke was awesome..... and I'm very critical of my raw tuna! Also had the veggie chop salad which was totally on point, and margaritas that were also incredible. Great service as well. Nicely done, Grassroots.  Nicely done."}
{"text":"When you bring clients here twice in one week, you know it's a winner! Grassroots boasts a simply incredible menu, mouth watering side dishes, and an upscale yet casual environment for dining to impress or relax.   The key stand-outs were the Root's BBQ Brisket and the Carolina Baby Backs. Both had savory sauces and fall-off-the-bone, tender meat. It's the kind of bbq that silences a table and all you hear are the occasional groans of enjoyment. Food envy will be rampant, though it's difficult to choose a bad dish. For sides, I also recommend the Jalapeno Cheddar Grits, a Pork Belly Baked Beans. The flavors really pop.   For the vegetarians and vegans, don't fret. Grassroots offers dishes that are veggie-only and convertible vegan.   There's a fine selection of wine and craft beer featuring some local brews from San Tan and Four Peaks. They even have Purple Haze, which is a fun one from Louisiana.   On each of my visits, we sat on the patio, because, why not sit on the patio? With a slight chill in the air, the patio is covered, and there are heaters available to keep you toasty. The servers were knowledgable and friendly.   Overall, I really like Grassroots, and I've never been disappointed by a visit."}
{"text":"I have really grown to love the Grassroots location in Scottsdale over the years, and when I moved to the Biltmore area, I looked forward to having another Grassroots location close to me. Unfortunately, my experiences there have been hit or miss. Though the food has been pretty much consistently delicious, the service both in the bar and at the tables has not been very good...and I'm judging this off of at least 5 or 6 visits, not just one off-day experience. I've also had to deal with a couple rude hostesses, and there's no excuse for that. Chris Collins is a notable local chef with great culinary creations, and I'm sure he wouldn't want people to refrain from choosing his restaurant due to poor service. Hoping the service becomes more consistent in a good way."}
{"text":"Fairly reliable and tasty cuisine. Laid back atmosphere. Wait staff seems nice but not particularly quick or attentive until they want to give you the bill. Excellent brownie for dessert."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful! Manager gave us a dessert on the house just for being first time guests. Red fish was awesome! Short ribs were great...not the very best we've had, but still good. If coconut cream pie is on the menu that day, get it! All in all a great little spot!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint. I live in California and try to come here often  Highlights: Good service, owners, managers have introduced themselves  Love the farm to table feel Never too crowded, bar handy in case there's a wait San Tan Bavarian Wheat Beer, smooth and complements the salty food well  Recommended apps and entrees Chicken and wild rice soup, prosciutto wrapped jumbo asparagus Spit-fire chicken, pork chop  Lots of ingredients, very savory entrees and a relaxed ambiance"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area from Houston, TX so went here for dinner on Friday night.  We had heard the place is cool and hip.    1) Food = 5 stars - my finance and I both got the swordfish special, it was fantastic! If this was solely a food review, 5 stars for sure  2) Service= 4.5 stars - no complaints overall  3) Ambiance - it has a TON of potential, but the music in my opinion was SO bad to the point that I will not go back.  Maybe I'm sensitive to ambiance / music, but the place is pretty cool and could be so much better.  The music made me feel like \"the lights are on, the parties over\".    I could be way off from others, but personally, it's a deal breaker for me.  I mean, it was 7:30 on Friday night and there is elevator music on?  Really?  I'm sure we'll be back as I live so close and the food was great, but it will be in and out for food if the music is as poor as it was last time."}
{"text":"I have dined 3 times at Grassroots and 3 different menu options. For lunch I had the shrimp poorboy and another time the hamburger. For dinner I had the pork chop. The shrimp poorboy was very good and brought me back to my visits to New Orleans. The hamburger was very juicy and full of flavor. Each time I ordered the coleslaw as my side and must say the coleslaw is the best I have ever tasted. For dinner I ordered the pork chop which came with the grits. The pork chop was cooked perfect and full of flavor and the grits had some spice and I very much enjoyed. Owner Chris Collins surprised us with the pork-belly appetizer and I must say it was very very good. The wine list is very reasonable and the service is second to none. This place will have plenty of success and we will continue to frequent for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant at 4:45... asked for table or both in bar.. were told they were all reserved for 5:00... they were empty when we left.  Wanted a baked potato for a side I was told that it was not available... but the tables on either side of me received baked potatoes??"}
{"text":"Stared off with the pork belly as an appetizer. Awesome flavor and melted in my mouth. Came with toast. For the main course I had the special clams and grits. I added some blacken shrimp. One word it's was freaking awesome. So flavorful and they gave me three big oysters and tons of shrimp. The grits were very smooth and had jalapeño mixed in. I live In the west valley would drive to the east valley to get this dish again."}
{"text":"Wait at lunch time is annoying -  I ended up waiting at the bar for 15 minutes for a table that was empty since I had walked in, and 15 minutes later I was brought to that same empty table to be seated.  Food on the other hand was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food and service here have far exceeded my expectations.  I am very Impressed with this place and will be back especially now that I moved up the street.  Both servers I have had here are amazing!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale location is good, but this location is consistently under average.  My burger came out cold, bacon under-cooked and after explaining 5-6 times no butter on the bun, it came out soaked with butter.    They said they would \"re-make\" the burger and they actually took my food that I had already touched and re-fired it.  Doesn't sound in compliance with the Dept of Health, does it?    Unfortunately, this has been the same experience in multiple occasions.  Well, off to Pizzeria Bianco to actually be able to eat.    Just as a side note, my husbands short ribs he said was good, though the tuna poke seemed not fresh.    The waiter was very nice...that's one pro :)  Sad thing is they weren't busy - Reputation is key."}
{"text":"Oh my lord. Can I please recommend the prosciutto wrapped asparagus? Something about the salt and the dressing is amazing. Additionally I had the ahi salad special which was a ton of food but I ate every last bit of it.   The lemonade was recommended to me and it was perfect for a nice lunch treat, not too sweet.   Highly recommend but also suggest that you plan on it being crowded."}
{"text":"The food tasted great. I got a shrimp Poboy with slaw (minor point--put the slaw in a boat side dish so it doesn't soak the bread, guys!) My date had the blackened fish sandwich (it was Mahi) and cheesy grits.   The beer list isn't amazing, or I'd go 5 stars, but it was okay... And the happy hour specials ($4 pints and $6 for a boatload of wings) are great. We didn't stay for dessert, but the offerings were standard/yummy-sounding.   Service is weird here: be prepared for a different person each step of the way. I hope they split tips evenly."}
{"text":"Grassroots rates 3 1/2 stars for me but I'll round up with 4 stars for this review. They serve the beer ice cold which I love. I started off with the appetizer of the pulled pork sliders which were delicious. For the main course I had the sliced brisket with some funky side to it which was forgettable as far as I'm concerned. They don't give you enough BBQ Sauce so you have to ask for more. The brisket was just okay for me, and for what they were charging it should have tasted much better.  The service was decent. This place is a great alternative if you ever get stuck waiting in line at that hip pizza place across the way. I would definitely come back and try some other menu items. Just when I thought it was safe to carry the Discover Card I find out that this place doesn't accept it. I think the Discover Card was rolled out in the mid 1980's. Hey Grassroots, if you want to be that upscale and sophisticated go to restaurant and bar then you'll have to accept all major credit cards."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Grassroots! I am from the south originally and this place is a pleasant reminder of the delicious food I left behind. Shrimp & Grits are excellent if your into grits, and you have to get the pork belly appetizer. If the weather is nice try and get a table on their patio."}
{"text":"Based on just one lunch visit it's too hard to determine if the Grassroots Kitchen is deserving of four or five stars but I can tell you it was pretty DARN GOOD! Also very solid and above average!  I was going to order a Chicken Salad of some sort but the server tells me about the Fish Sandwich of the day that was Ono and the Vegetable Side of the day that was Tri Color Cauliflower with Mustard Sauce, Pecans, Golden Raisins so I had to go with that. It was so good simple but so many details done to perfection. The good quality  Bun was carefully toasted and buttered. The Tomato and pickle slices were very high quality. The sauce was extremely flavorful and delicious and the fish was cooked to perfection.   The Farmers Side of Tri Color Cauliflower was also fresh and delicious and very much above average.  My husband was thrilled with the Shrimp Po Boy and Jalapeño Cheddar Grits! He said his plate was so good that it will be very hard to order something different next time.  As delicious as my sandwich was I was careful not to completely fill my self up and held back eating half my bun to save room for their specialty dessert Key Lime Pie.  WOW this REALLY was the BEST Key Lime Pie I ever tasted. It isn't a beauty for presentation but the crust ratio was perfect. It was the just right sweet, tangy and Just bitter enough. Wow it was really good!  Service was great too!  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"We had a terrific meal here!   It was hard to decide on what to order because they offer a nice variety of plates you don't see everywhere with many irresistible side option choices.  I went with the Blackened Fish Sandwich, the fish they offer differs between a few and is red fish sometimes but on my day it was Maui Maui. My side I picked was fresh green beans with olive tapanade and feta cheese. Everything on plate was delicious, the fish was prepared perfect on an above average artisan bun with a tasty slightly spicy sauce and some toppings and I thought my side was above average too it was also prepared perfect and seasoned very nicely.  My husband went with the shrimp po boy. He said it was also delicious and prepared perfect but could have used a little more shrimp. He couldn't decide on one side so he picked two and had to have the dirty orzo and the jalapeno cheese grits. He said they were awesome and we have to come back to here again.  I was full but we wanted to try dessert and went with the house made apple pie because it was a special offering that they don't have all the time. They bring out a large slice that is plenty for two people dressed with caramel and vanilla gelato. I liked that the pie had a super thin crust and the apples were cooked well and nicely seasoned but for my taste the crust was a little doughy but it still was good.  Service was fantastic!  A very solid four stars!"}
{"text":"I really like this place ALOT, the food is all organic/free range/ hippie friendly so I respect that.  I especially respect that when the food is delicious with such restrictions and it is so good job Grassroots!  I have tried the Spit Fire Free Range Chicken which is the juiciest half a chicken I've ever had in my life, amazing flavor as well served with dirty orzo which is like dirty rice but with orzo and it translates perfectly.  Great meal overall, they also have a really good happy hour I haven't taken part in but I uploaded a picture of the menu so everyone can see before they go, any place that has \"BOAT LOAD OF WINGS\" on the menu deserves a visit in my book.  Also on a side note there were some hot waitresses always a +1 #google (internetjokes)"}
{"text":"Another must try in the Scottsdale area. Drinks, Food, and atmosphere were incredible. Will be back here again when I'm in back in AZ."}
{"text":"Let's start in reverse.  Never knew I loved Coconut Cream pie.  After tasting It not only did I liked it, I loved it.   Three of us shared it soon we fought for it.  We came in at 6:15 it was  extremely busy on a  Monday night.  Started with what they called 85259 Creamy Burrata Cheese as an appetizer.  It was dressed with arugula, spicy tomato jam and sea salt. It came with beautifully toasted Italian bread.  Although simple my dinner was wonderful.  Farmer's Vegetable Chop Salad with a perfectly grilled Salmon.  The salad came with green cabbage, red beets, grapes, butternut squash,  corn, radishes, cherry tomatoes, scallions, cucumber, edamame, feta cheese, basil, parsley and champagne vinaigrette.  We also ordered grilled asparagus, Cole Slaw, and French Fries.    The food was both simple with its perfection.  The waitress, the price and the manager made certain of that."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch at the prime time of 12:00 with mi madre. We walked in and greeted by, I believe a manger, whom welcomed us in and told us the hostess, Jessica would be right with us. It was super friendly start to a great meal. Jessica was quick to meet us with a big smile and pleasantly quoted us around 15 minutes to get a table, which isn't too shabby for the noon lunch rush. My mother and I huddled around the hostess station because there was no where to sit and wait, except for several adirondack chairs outside. However, this wasn't an option for me because being the native Phoenician that I am, I cannot stand this current humidity and several other folk had the same plan. Instead we all either herded left or right to let people in and out of the entrance door.  We were seated in about 10 minutes, which could have been sooner, but we opted to sit inside instead of their cutely decorated patio complete with living walls. Three glass garage doors separated the patio from the inside eating area. In the center of the restaurant is a large bar with surrounding tables and about 4-5 booths on one side.  Marcus was our server who was also very pleasant and attentive. My mother and I both ordered iced teas ($3/ea) to drink which came with crushed iced, score! I ordered the salmon and small club salad ($17) and my mother ordered the carolina baby back ribs ($25). Because my mother ordered the ribs (you can't help but get messy), she requested a wet nap. Marcus showed up with a warmed wet fabric napkin folded inside a coffee cup, cute presentation as opposed to those paper packaged ones that require three or more before your hands are actually clean.   This was actually my second time here, I ordered to roti and ribs combo last time and enjoyed that just as much as I enjoyed this meal. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and even though our lunch was expensive ($51.82 + tip), we both wouldn't hesitate to come back.   Big shout out again to Marcus for stellar service, he is one of the most brilliant servers I have ever had. When I decline dessert, my mother stated, \"that why she is skinny and cute and I am not\", and without any hesitation, Marcus responded, \"you're both skinny and cute\". Boom, tip increase, well played sir, well played!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna appetizer is seriously so amazing...your life is not complete without it! Every thing on the menu is pure quality. Love the atmosphere and the staff is incredibly attentive. I have been to both locations and the experience and quality is equal. I have also tried the ahi tuna burger as well as the ribs and they are both superb. The key lime pie dessert is making my mouth drool just thinking of it! Whenever I have family or meet someone from out of town I always tell them to check this place out! Can't wait to try their new ice cream place they're building next door!"}
{"text":"My man wanted ribs so my man gots ribs! We came here 30 minutes before closing and we stood at the hostess table with no one greeting us. We weren't sure if these were one of those places where you seat yourselves... still standing. Finally someone acknowledged us and brought us to a booth. He of course ordered the ribs and I had the pork belly appetizers along with the  shoestring fries and a rootbeer float. I eat like a child, clearly. OH MY GAWDDDDD the pork belly was AH-MAZING! Seriously, so juicy and sweet and cooked perfectly right! Shoestring fries .... I can't even say enough great things about these babies! I ate the whole dang thing while only giving my man measly scrap pieces because I don't share good food. ALL FOR ME! My boyfriend said the ribs were probably the best ribs he's had, so A++++ x 1 million. We were both happy campers with our food babies in tow. Seriously, get the pork belly, get the fries, get the ribs, it seems like anything you get can't go wrong.  P.S. the good looking young workers were canoodling behind the bar which I'm not sure if it's appropriate... sometimes we couldn't find our server because the bartender was too busy trying to get her attention and vice versa. Oh young work love, how sweet and kinda gross. Luckily this place wasn't packed."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after I tried Twisted Grove Parlor.  Unfortunately, this place fell a little short.  My daughter ordered the ahi poke and she barely touched it.  I hardly find a poke I don't love, but I did find one here.  My husband and son shared the ribs and chicken dish.  I tried the cold slaw and thought it was incredibly refreshing. I had the short rib and cheesy grits.  It was okay.  The ribs were just a little on the sweet side. I like sweet, but not quite as sweet.  Maybe I'll go back for happy hour one day. The cocktails looked interesting."}
{"text":"Great Vibe!  The restaurant and bar kind of meld so the place can be pretty noisy but fun.  (Of course, when we went... it was \"the\" Thursday night of the Trash Can Open and Super Bowl weekend... but I have a feeling this place is always busy... so I highly recommend making a reservation.)  We got lucky and found a couple spots at the bar (where you can order anything on the menu.)  Bar tenders and servers were prompt and friendly.  Menu had a really good variety of salads, sandwiches and entrees.... with the focus being Farm to Table.  We started with the Proscuitto wrapped Asparagus.  You can't go wrong with this dish. It came out perfect... crispy but not burnt and the asparagus wasn't soggy.  I had the Veg Chop salad for dinner... lots of great veggies. (Which help off-set my horrible eating and drinking for the day at the golf tourney.)  Husband had the shrimp and grits ... which I got a small bite of... and it was Great!  Grits were not gritty at all... very smooth."}
{"text":"Once again Grass-roots delivered the amazing chicken Waldorf salad, along with the grilled salmon!"}
{"text":"This place has a long way to go before it even matches the service and the quality of cooking at their Scottsdale location. Starter was the chicken wings which had alot of water in them probably from being boiled and not fried out or baked out whichever their process is.  When brought to the waitress's attention the response was defensive and unapologetic. Main Course\"  Split chicken and ribs.  The chicken was dry.  We did not bring it to the attention of anyone since the waitress was already defensive when taking the order.  I had the brisket which I had advised that I could not eat real spicy food when again the defense was we take the seeds out of the jalapeno so it is not that hot.  WRONG!  Yes the seeds are the hottest part but so is the actual vegetable.  I had to argue with her and finally break down telling her about all my digestive problems and how it would put me in the hospital before she would back down.  We had ordered fries but they never made it to the table and again did not mention it because we did not want to have to defend the request. Drinks:  Iced Tea and Soda.  Never once was more ice brought to the table.  Refill, no ice.  Refill no ice.  Hmmmmmm, in the desert wouldn't people want ice?  I know in hell they want ice water?  I have visited there a time or two  LOL Needless to say, because of the great inconsistency of the two businesses we will never return there again. The waitress.  Her name was Aaron.  Pushy, rude and unapologetic.   Not the way I wanted to treat out of town guest on her last night visiting. Oh yeah, here is the kicker too~  we called for a 7pm reservation to be told not available but they could do 715pm.  When we arrived, the place was not even half full.   There is a reason this place was not full and it is probably because staff and management are driving it right into the ground."}
{"text":"We love Grassroots. Long time repeat customers. Everything on the menu is amazing and will not disappoint.  Chicken with dirty orzo  and bowl of gumbo. So good."}
{"text":"I am a little late to post this, but better late than never. Back in June a group of us went here for my birthday dinner. My fiance made a reservation for 6:15 and requested to be sat inside because sitting outside in June in Phoenix is not so comfortable.  When we got there and they told us there will be a little wait because the table was occupied and that table was not done eating yet and we should be sat right when they left. We were ok with waiting a bit, about 15 minutes later they asked if they can move us to a different table, smaller than the one they were going to put us in because that smaller table would be finished before our original table would be done. We agreed, but it was awkward having a group of ten people waiting inside, while people walked in and out. 10 minutes later the hostess offered us the back patio that we can be seated right away and they will put on the misters on back there for us. We agreed because we wanted to sit and get out of the way. My fiance was not happy about the move outside. The waiters were prompt with our drink orders when we sat, but never came back to check on us after that. I think they might have forgotten us, because about 45 minutes later two waiters came out and apologized and they gave us a couple of free appetizers. (They didn't offer free appetizers, one of my friends asked for free appetizers when we had to be moved outside) Once we placed our order the food came out right away, which I was pleased about, the food was good and great portions for the price. About half way into eating our meal, the waiter asked if she could box up our meals? I thought it was odd, but told her we are still working on our dinner. About ten minutes later the waiter came out and asked us who was on what bill so she could split them, we let her know and she left. She came back with our bills and told us no hurry and left. I did not think much of it until, a different waiter came out and approached my fiance telling him that our reservation time had expired and we needed to leave because another group was waiting for our table! He was not very polite to her when she pretty much told us to leave. I was so upset that I didn't even wanted to say anymore. They changed our reservation table 3 times and now they are telling us to leave because someone else is waiting for our table, I couldn't believe it. The food was good, but they defiantly need to work on managing tables better. I don't plan on coming back for the fear of being kicked out before I finished my meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix--the best things on the menu IMO are the short ribs and shrimp and grits. SO GOOD! If you haven't been here, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has fabulous food!  I had the salmon with grilled asparagus. So yummy and cooked really well. There is not a physical kids menu, but just ask the waitress. They have popcorn shrimp, that my kids love, and the side options were good. For example they had grapes, grilled asparagus, edamame, etc. good choices for kids. Brandon had the shrimp and jalapeño cheesy grits. Omg!  It was GOOD!  The pomegranate green tea is good too. Loved this place. Nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been to Grassroots on numerous occasions and the food & service has always been fantastic. However, the past two visits have been less than stellar.   Just this past weekend, we had friends in town and decided to give Grassroots another shot at redemption. Unfortunately, it failed miserably.    We ordered the poke for an app and it was amazing.  However, the braised short ribs were so tough you couldnt eat it. What made matters worse, was the service.  Our server had NO personality and acted like we were an imposition when we asked for anything. I was so disappointed with my experience.  Time to explore other options.   Positives:  * Poke appetizer * Ambience * Brownie dessert   Negatives:  * Braised short ribs & grits * Service"}
{"text":"Food was good. I had a chopped grilled vegetable salad that I loved. My husband had a burger that he liked, the fries were good! Service was ok. Not super kid friendly but they do have high chairs."}
{"text":"Great food! Typically good service, but the bar staff is not very attentive. Grab a table if you can."}
{"text":"Angie was tha bestest server!  My shrimp and grits were jam packed with flavor! Ice cold glasses for our water - who would've thunk?! But we noticed that and it DID keep our drinks chilled! ...can't wait to come back with other guests!"}
{"text":"I cannot praise you enough, Town and Country Grassroots! Your food, your hospitality.... You're my home away from home, but with amazingly flavorful, crafty dishes! Thank you all at the bar (only spot I've so far enjoyed) for being fun and friendly and recommending scrumptious things for me to try!   From your braised short ribs and daily soups (they're all my favorite) to your locally soarced and uber fresh salads--and I can't forget the Burger(so much NOM!), you really have a great thing goin' on!   I'll always be faithful to you Grassroots Kitchen! Don't go changing, EVER!!"}
{"text":"Although the prices are high, the food is delicious. There wasn't too long of a wait, although i did go during the day. Both my boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our plates. The jalapeno grits are delicious and just the right level of spicy. Ribs and brisket-delicious!! Love Love Love!"}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant for the first time and not only was the food delish... The service was more than outstanding. Our server went above and beyond!! She has a fantastic attitude and exceeded our expectations!! Thanks Blaire!!! She was phenomenal and only hope the rest of the staff are the same when I return. Which I will!! The food was incredible as well. Can't wait to come back and try the entire menu!!Yum!!"}
{"text":"Chris and Wally got this one right.  What a a great place for a casual dinner.  The food is excellent and reasonably priced.  Phoenix needs a restaurant like this.  Its manager, Jason Blumer, is a wonderful host.  He has a great personality and understands hospitality.  We dine out a lot and will be sure to make Grassroots a frequent stop.  I would encourage you to give this place a try - I know you will be pleased.  Dick B."}
{"text":"The place has definitely created an atmosphere that fits the neighborhood. The menu ventures beyond most neighborhood comfort staples and that merits an extra visit or two. The place has a professionalism and creativity that reflects the experience of ownership."}
{"text":"Worst happy-hour in Arizona. Charged $2 for ice and 7 up on well drinks. They are ripping people off and never will I go back.  If you go to drink, prepare to pay for extra luggage fees."}
{"text":"From first bite to last, fabulous! As first time diners, we came here because of their support to local farmers and vendors. We arrived at 4.30 pm on a Saturday evening which happens to fall within their \"social hour\". We ordered two cocktails and the smoked salmon dip from the \"social hour\" menu; all were wonderful. For dinner my wife had the braised short ribs and I had the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were fantastic. My wife boxed her leftovers and I ate every morsel on my plate. For dessert we had a shareable brownie with ice cream, no leftovers on this plate. I would like to acknowledge and personally recognize and compliment our server, Tatum. He was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and personable. We shall return and recommend this eatery to our friends."}
{"text":"Alway a nice meal at Grassroots! Consistently good quality ingredients prepared for their healthy fare. My husband loves the grilled fish sandwich and gets it Every Time we come, I enjoy a lot of variety so this evening I ordered the Asparagus wrapped in Prosciutto and a loaded baked potato!  Our server was friendly and attentive. We enjoy coming here after working and the atmosphere is always relaxing and cozy casual."}
{"text":"So glad that Scottsdale has this place, because it sorely needs restaurants like this.  Just ate here for the second time in the last week.  The first time we came here was for lunch while out shopping.  Not very creative orders on our part, but my. Wife and I both had the blackened fish sandwich.   Very well prepared and just right on the seasoning.  The burrito app was excellent as well.    I was actually even more impressed with our son's meal: fried popcorn shrimp that he devoured, but I did get to sneak one in and they were delicious.  And it came out fast!  Those of you with a toddler can appreciate this.    Our second time here was on a Friday night.  We had the kid in tow again (he's a restaurant veteran, so no worries).  First off, the vibe of the place at night is great.  Totally want to bring my wife back here again, just the 2 of us, for a date night.  We sat near the bar area, totally chill.  Great service, and again, my son's food came out instantly, so there was no risk of a meltdown.   Then our meals came.   My wife had the shrimp and grits, which tasted great.  Very authentic as well, and as a former southerner, I can speak with some expertise on this.  I wished the shrimp were bigger, but the flavor was there.  I had the redfish entrée, and let me tell you, they have some excellent cooking going on in the kitchen.  Great seasoning, and the fish was cooked perfectly.   Overall, I am so happy with this place. Cocktails and wine were also spot on, and service was terrific.  We will certainly be coming back again."}
{"text":"Seared Cajun ahi with the jalapeño grits  oh my god.. So damn good. Sarah, the bartender suggested the grits and did not disappoint. She's also super personable and down to earth. Can't believe we just found out about this place.."}
{"text":"Good spot to chill out and throw down a few beers. Great atmosphere, and ambiance. The drink and food list was a little underwhelming however, the food that I did choose was fantastic. The shrimp poboy was on point. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Solid food, good atmosphere, and attentive staff. Not much else to add here.   Love this restaurant and it is close to home.  Extra bonus: Great outside patio--it is very generous and well protected from the elements while still being in the fresh air.  The only (possible) negative is that it can get very busy, even on weeknights.  Plan on a short wait.  They are pretty good about seating you as quickly as possible, so I don't get discouraged even when I see a line out the door."}
{"text":"Great Choice   We needed a place for a late lunch, and GrassRoots Kitchen and Tap sounded good, so off we went. GrassRoots offers a were good selection of entrees on the menu and all of us were happy with our choices, and beverages.   The atmosphere at Grassroots Kitchen and Tap is realaxing and inviting. We decided to eat outside in order to avoid a wait and to take advantage of one of the rare occasions when you can eat on the patio in Phoenix, Arizona, in October and be comfortable .  My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some of the \" Hawaiian Sweet Roll Sliders\"  and the \"Boat Load of Wings\".  Both of these appetizers were excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the wings, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.  As an entree I ordered the Roasted Chicken Walnut Salad Sandwich.  It was quite good.  My lunch companions had the Angus hamburger, Almost Famous Pork Chop, and Southern Shrimp and Grits The shrimp and grits had grilled shrimp over jalapeño cheddar grits with tasso ham relish and grilled focaccia slices. I have to say, the grits were absolutely amazing. Honestly, all our entrees were equally delicious.  The service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Always so good! Some of my faves at the burrata which is made In house-yum! The burger which is classic but so good the perfect amount of everything and delicious melty cheese. The fries are also amazing- thin cut and seasoned well. The pies here are also to die for! The key lime is amazing.  My favorite cocktail is the pink cougar but be careful it's so good it goes down quickly!"}
{"text":"We've been to Grassroots several times (both with and without kids) and LOVE IT!  Chris does a great job making each guest feel special and right at home.  We've enjoyed \"Dad's grocery bag\" (the cheese/meat platter), the smoked salmon is perfection, the ribs fall off the bone, the short rib is decadent.  I loved my grapefruit martini.    There are 2 must trys!  1- the loaded baked potato (after 5 only) and 2- the simple and delicious banana split with yummy sugared nuts.  We almost always share one.    Overall I really hope this little brew/wine house continues its success because it is seriously yummy and a great addition to our neighborhood eats."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Every Friday....PORK BELLY and Lobster bisque.  No Matter WHAT!!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is that this place has a nice atmosphere - modern country chic.  I had been to the restaurant that previously occupied the space and it's unrecognizable.    The service is above average starting when the hostess opened the door as we approached.  They are very pleasant and solicitous without being overbearing.  I drink a lot of water and they were all over it.  Most diners were in shorts and tee-shirts, even workout clothing, but the staff treated us like we were out for a very fine meal.    And it was a very fine meal.  My husband and I weren't overly hungry so we split the portobello sandwich.  It was delicious - the mushroom was thick and tender, the other ingredients complimented it beautifully, and the focaccia bread was brushed with sea salt.  Our side, the loaded potato, was enormous and baked to perfection.  It was a great portion, so we didn't have room to try the desserts, though they sounded great.  We saw many things on the menu that we wanted to try, so less than a week later, I went over to pick up some take-out.  We ordered the tuna sandwich and the vegetable plate (and two of those excellent potatoes - my sandwich came with one, and we bought another to accompany the veggies).  I eat a lot of seared tuna - it's my go-to order at just about any restaurant, all over the valley and in travels worldwide.  This was one of the top 3 tuna sandwiches I have ever had.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the cajun flavor complemented it without overpowering it.  I was incredibly impressed.  The vegetables were lovely, as well, though I suspect my husband found cabbage and chard (the seasonal vegetables) to be a little unusual - he absolutely loved the asparagus and tomatoes, though.  Our baked potatoes were amazing, again.  Since then, we've been back many times, and everything we've tried has been well-executed and delicious.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little pricey - the quality is absolutely superior, but a $15 tuna sandwich ($16 with avocado) is just a hair above reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been to Grassroots twice.  Both times, my wife and I have had excellent service and food.  I'd highly recommend the short ribs and the shrimp and grits.  The last time we ate there, we were both too full for dessert, but the waitress insisted that we try their coconut cream pie, so she boxed up a slice for us free of charge.  The pie was unbelievable!  5 stars all the way for Grassroots!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Close to Talking Stick hotel/resort. I had the ahi salad -- ahi was served perfectly and the salad itself was full of interesting flavors."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch had the Waldorf salad got dressing on the side. Not a place I have to come back for. My boyfriend got the Waldorf sandwich it had way too much mayo for me he thought it was okay. Everyone was friendly that worked there."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I have been eating very well while in Arizona. On our 3rd night in town we made a reservation at Grassroots Kitchen and Tap. Our Waze app got us a bit lost but the hostess steered is in the right direction when I called.   We all shared the tuna poke (the added shrimp was a nice touch and very tasty) and the burrata (ok) I tried the special \"Scallops and Cheesy Grits\" (tasty and loved the corn added to the dish) my colleagues had tortilla soup (average) and spit fire chicken (good).  Best thing was the key lime pie at the end. It was a generous slice and the crust was perfect.  We are here in AZ for 6 more days. Hope we can get back here for another meal. I really want to try the Shrimp and Grits."}
{"text":"First time here. We loved it.  Excellent cocktails and food. We started with Dads. Grocery Bag meat and cheese plater for an appetizer. Very tasty. I had a cup of the black bean sirloin chili, excellent and spicy too, Mike had the club house salad. Very fresh and the not skimpy with the blue cheese!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We've been looking all over the Scottsdale area for a salmon and salad meal.  Grassroots kitchen and tap has Scottish salmon, nicely grilled, with a farmers chopped salad.  Our server, Aidan, was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is very pleasant, and overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I had the scallops (special) on a bed of grits. I'm not sure why - I don't really think I like grits. But I sure liked this dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly and lightly seasoned with a salty somethingorother that really brought out the flavor of the scallops.  Which is commendable because, in my opinion, too often chefs get too fancy with light-tasting fish and overpower it.  The grits we're also very good.  What?  Apparently I like grits?  I don't know, but I liked these.   My buddy had the Tuna and reported that it was excellent.   I finished with the key lime pie which was also notably excellent - some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Our favorite place we ate at the entire AZ trip!  The food was just fresh and tasty.  The chef came out and talked to us, she was so friendly and sweet.  I love places like this where you feel like they put some TLC into it from the service (cute prego lady), to the food and drinks.  We had the shrimp Po boy and it was so tasty, I wish we ate here twice!  We wanted to try more things on the menu, wish our tummy's were able to take it!"}
{"text":"I feel duped by the Grassroots happy hour.    We have been here several times for dinner and happy hour and have always enjoyed the food.  We enjoyed the food this evening.  However, we ordered what we thought was a typical well drink as we have ordered here in the past but we were charged an extra $2 to have Scotch on the Rocks.  What, $2 for a block of ice!  In their defense it does say it in small print on the menu.  Diners need to be aware!  We will certainly think twice before coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had dinner here again. It's still very good - great menu and food, excellent service, pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok.   A burger for me and colleague had brisket.  The sazerac was the most memorable.  Roasted asparagus above average.  The burger ....very good but not exceptional.  The brisket, again, nothing wring just not special.   Convenient location.   Solid food after a long day so it was appreciated but not particularly inspiring.  If you are tungry or hangry, its fine."}
{"text":"It's the night before my friends and I ran our first full marathon together and we scrambled to find the perfect restaurant that serves great tasting food that wouldn't be too hard on our stomachs - so somewhat healthy and fulfilling. We all agreed unanimously on Grassroots.  Although i really enjoyed eating their rack of ribs entree the first time I ever came to Grassroots, I knew it probably wouldn't be too good before our run. Our waitress pointed me to the Blackened Redfish with dirty orzo and sausage. I basically licked the plate dry. I really loved this dish! It was served with a Nola remoulade but the fish was full of flavor and almost didn't need that.   Topher's Braised Short Ribs with jalepeño cheddar grits was another major stand out. I'm not the hugest fan of grits. Typically, I'd have to smother a full stick of butter and a box of salt to make it enjoyable but who knew that jalepeños and cheddar could be a mind-changing combination?!  Key lime pie - definitely worth ordering! But it's kind of a lot to eat when you also order the banana split, so I would recommend getting one or the other at a single sitting.  Ahi poke with avocado - my hubs and I really enjoyed it but a couple of friends thought it was a tad on the fishy side. I was bewildered by the comment since it's ahi!  Pork belly appetizer - ours was a bit on the drier side but still flavorful.  Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner together. Service was on point, and the food paralleled the service. Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"I like most all of their salads. Nice décor. Good staff. I've been there many, many times for lunch and twice for dinner. My fav is the chicken waldorf salad and my husband loves their ribs."}
{"text":"Had the most wonderful meal , plus they refill,coffee ! Had a server so gracious and caring , his name is Adam ! Adam couldn't do,enough to make our visit so delightful and special! A real tribute to grassroots staff! Will return very soon ! Outstanding in everyway!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  We were thrilled that they opened a location that is near our house!  Not quite a cheap dinner, but you can get out of there for $50 (tip not included) with two entrees, a drink and app/dessert.  We recently tried their happy hour and I must say I was impressed.  The chicken wings were amazing.  My favorite thing on the menu is the farm veggie platter.  I dream of their swiss chard.  Their ribs arn't bad either (being from Memphis that's a compliment).  Could use a hair more vinegar in the sauce but better than any other bbq we've had since coming to the Valley."}
{"text":"Service was prompt, food was good. I had the petite filet which was cooked perfectly, although as described was definitely petite. :) We dined with a one year old and everyone was friendly. There are kid's menu options, but you have to ask for them. My son had the kids rotisserie chicken which came with steamed veggies and edamame (this was a swap from french fries). We ate on the patio and enjoyed the charm of the courtyard. I would definitely eat here again, it's great to be able to eat a decent meal at a nicer place that's accepting of kids."}
{"text":"The food is delicous and the service was great.  Had the lobster bisque which wasn't too rich, just right.  The pork chop was the best we've had in a while.  Oh and the green tea, superb!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Happy Hour food, fun drink specials, excellent service....thank you, YELP, for yet another out of town win!  We chose the Piggly Wiggly and the Salmon Dip and enjoyed both. The server was attentive and helpful, and the drinks were fabulous!"}
{"text":"1st visit.  Scallop special (Me) ....... Fillet Mignon (Dona); 2nd visit. Short ribs (Me)........ Club salad (Dona)..... Chicken Walnut sandwich (Charlene).... Monster desserts.   We have been here twice and I will continue to come back. Both times we've been here we have just been over the top happy with the food, the service, the atmosphere, just everything. We were very impressed with the food, portions were just right and the quality was worth every penny. I like a place where there is nothing left on my plate and I couldn't eat another bite. Not stuffed, but pleasantly full. If I really had to say something derogatory it would have to be the damned desserts were SOOOO BIG that we had to box them to take home. This is a very casual place to take someone for a good meal."}
{"text":"Very good quality food here.  We ordered the broiled rainbow trout, red beans and rice (soup of the day), and romaine salad.  The rainbow trout tasted off, like not fresh, nor good so we returned it.  The sauteed chard that came with it was very good.  The red beans and rice and romaine salad were good, I am told.  I did not try it myself.  After returning the trout, we ordered the roots bbq smoked brisket.  This was very good.  The smoked brisket was very soft and moist.  The pork belly bbq beans that came with it were awesome!! tastes like homemade.  Even the beans tasted fresh and not canned.  The cheddar grits were very good as well.  Cooked to perfection.  Service was very good.  Just remember don't order fish on a Monday anywhere.  lol.  It's forgivable since everything else was fantastic.  We both talked about coming back again.  We took the key lime pie to go.  It was heavenly.  Tasted homemade.  Update: Came back on a Wednesday and ordered the blackened redfish and gumbo.  Gumbo had a good taste 3.5 stars.  The blackened redfish was super yummy!! about as good as you are going to get it in Arizona.  5-stars.  the rice pilaf that came with it was 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Salmon salad was good & the homemade key lime pie was very, very good ! I will be back:)"}
{"text":"It is small inside but very nice. The ambiance is somewhere between a sports bar and a fancier restaurant. The food was delicious. It is natural/homegrown I think.  Highly recommend the prosciutto wrapped asparagus.  There is a sweet shop next door too"}
{"text":"I was happily surprised with Grassroots! For some reason, the name has always made me think it would be a health food restaurant, but it's quite the opposite! It's really more of a hearty and homey restaurant with great BBQ among other hearty items on the menu. We dined here at night and although the summer temps were high, we were still able to enjoy eating on the patio. The atmosphere here is nice and charming. It would be great to come with a couple friends, family or even on a date night. I ended up ordering the chicken salad sandwich which had great flavor and was very hearty. It was on thick bread and came with fries. Every bite was delicious. In addition to the food and atmosphere, the service was excellent as well. I will definitely be back soon to enjoy another meal here."}
{"text":"We ordered the Farm to Table Vegetable Platter and the Almost Famous Pork Chops. Substituted the sautéed chard on one platter for the loaded baked potato and the sautéed chard on the other platter for the heirloom cauliflower (sans pecans).  Everything was amazing!  The food was cooked to perfection, the flavors were phenomenal and our server, Tara, was delightful!  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner with coworkers and you can walk right in, service is well timed and lots of good choices on the menu. The entrees have a 'tall food' look but not so heavy or rich. Sliders are great and I've ordered the vegetarian plate twice and enjoyed it. Don't let the strip center location scare you away - great atmosphere and the covered outdoor patio is also nice."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a recommendation from a friend. And loved this place.  Wish I had it closer.  Why? Great service. A friendly waitress who knew when to joke around, but who didn't do that at the sacrifice of good service.    And the food was really great. Got the gumbo special to start and then the blackened redfish.  Every bite was delicious. My lunch companion had...exactly the same thing and enjoyed it even more.  Desserts are big but do not miss the key lime pie.  It was terrific.    Overall, a terrific experience. Parking is a bit of a pain, but overall, would come to this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Awesesome, amazingly delicious food. I got the farm to table vegetable platter and a key lime pie. I got it for takeout, and it was ready in about 10 minutes. This was very convenient for me since I am staying in the hotel that is basically attached to the mall. I had plenty of food, and I have enough for leftovers."}
{"text":"I couldn't say enough great things about this place! I frequent here at least once a week (dine in & take out) The food is superb & the wait staff is top notch! I love the seared ahi tuna salad (wasabi peas on the side) The seared ahi tuna dinner is divine too (substitute a side for grits) oh my goodness their jalapeño cheddar cheese grits are TO DIE FOR! I never not get a side of them. Their salmon app is delish along with their prosciutto wrapped asparagus & tuna poke. I have never had a bad thing here. Bonus: they have wine on tap!!! Their Moscow Mules are a must try! Jake (from State Farm) is our fave waiter.  If you haven't tried this place you definitely MUST!!! You won't be disappointed I promise!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Couldn't ask for more.   Server very attentive to my needs. Am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"the food....the food is excellent. as it was on our last meal there. i was impressed before and i was impressed again with my food. the fish sandwich was cooked perfectly, the bread was crispy yet soft. my side of cheese grits with jalapeno was creamy and not over powered by the jalapeno. my wife loved her farm vegetable plate. i snuck a few bites and had to agree....tasty.   our party was there for 3 hours. i feel like i'm being nitpicky when i complain about not having my water glass filled, but as my wife has mentioned before...i go out not only for the food, but for the service/experience. and my water glass was filled once...let me correct that....i had to ask for my water glass to be filled 3 times.   i don't know if she was the only server, but she was non-existent. after we were seated, literally 15 minutes before she made herself known just for drinks. other than that, we basically didn't see her except when she stopped by to ask us if we wanted dessert. our food was brought out timely, but it was another 15-25 minutes before we got our drinks until our food order was taken.   again, a number of factors could have been involved. it was busy last night, maybe a server called in sick, maybe they were trying to convey a european sense of dining, however, i was so thirsty when we left, i drank nearly a gallon of water when we got home.   this place has excellent food and on our previous visit, the service was great. so we'll go back i'm sure. this was just an oddity i hope."}
{"text":"Tried the salmon with dip and the ribs, both were great!  They are very close competition to Hillstone which I love. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time at this place. We found it via Yelp and the vast majority of the reviews were 4-5 stars. The reviews were spot on. We were greeted and seated by the head chef, followed shortly by our server.  After selecting a good Calif Cab at s good price, the menu reflected unique offerings including bar- b-que, seafood and steak.we ordered the bar-b-que and ahi tuna. Both where outstanding! Our servers were attentive and pleasant!  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Grassroots has a number of locations in the valley and enjoy them all. The Scottsdale location seems to a little more crowded than the Phoenix one. The wine list is decent and the prices are not the usual 100% mark up you often see the the valley. Many good selections on the menu. We went with the salmon and the short ribs. There were no complaints from us. We will be back."}
{"text":"Shrimp and Grits were good.    (I'm from Louisiana,  so it may be an A+ for people not from the south).   We also had the blackened fish sandwich,  baked beans and chopped salad.  All of these items were awesome.   Why 2 stars?  Snotty and very abrupt young hostess.  Says 25 min wait for some and permits immediate seating for others who have no reservation.  Also,  the service did not match the good food.   These things matter."}
{"text":"Dined with a co-worker, sat outside.  Waitstaff was friendly and fun, gave great recommendations. We had the prosciutto asparagus for an app and both had the halibut special that was fresh and full of flavor.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time in and it was amazing! Highly recommend the Spit Fire chicken, Angus Cheeseburger, and THE SHRIMP PO' BOY WAS TO DIE FOR! Of course, our server Dillon (sp?), was wonderful and took good care of us! We'll definitely be back here again! Thanks Grassroots"}
{"text":"This was recommended to us. I was not impressed. Food was fair service ok. Chicken wings were fried to heck. I got sampler appetizer which was ok and of bread and jam that was uhh"}
{"text":"Went there with my family. Having lived near New Orleans and visiting the Big Easy dozens of times, we're very familiar with Southern, Cajun and Creole cuisine. I ordered the shrimp poboy. I saw NOLA written multiple places on the menu and asked what it meant to separate waitresses who both were clueless. In the south it stands for New Orleans LA. but I was curious to   confirm it. I was surprised how good my poboy tasted. Sure the bread was their own take on it and quite different from the ones in the South. But the shrimp and the sauce were great. My wife ordered the blackened fish with grits. Fish was good and grits were the healthy version of what you find in the south. I liked them and thought the idea of adding cheese and jalapeños was clever. Overall the experience was good though I think the staff needs to know what the menu means. Will be back when Im craving a poboy."}
{"text":"Their food I'd amazing always so fresh and great service. Love the ambiance as well. Highly recommend the prime rib and white sangria or ahi tuna salad or ahi tuna steak are amazing. Be sure to try the jalepeno grits. I dont even like grits but I love these!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. This was my first time and I will definitely be back. Sammy was a wonderful server. Great place for GLUTEN FREE also. Salads are amazing. Lobster bisque was delicious and gluten free. I absolutely will return. I am a fan. Thank you!"}
{"text":"BEST MEAL I have had in a long time. Had the roast pit chicken and prosciutto wrapped asparagus, and both were cooked perfectly with amazing pops of flavor!"}
{"text":"I had the best brisket sandwich of my life!!! The melt in your mouth brisket comes with a great thin barbecue sauce. On top came their tangy slaw, and my goodness it provided an amazing crunch.  It came with their shoestring fries which are seasoned and cooked to perfection. I also had their white sangria which was the perfect amount of sweet, and complemented my meal perfectly! The atmosphere was open, happy, and inviting, I couldn't help but to feel at home. The service was also friendly and they had answers to all of my questions.  I will definitely be back, both here and their Scottsdale location!!"}
{"text":"So good! Food was amazing! Service was superb! Friendly,clean, great atmosphere will return most definitely!"}
{"text":"Great chicken Waldorf salad & I love their shrimp & grits!  Great service, knowledgeable about menu items."}
{"text":"I'm actually a fan.  The decor is attractive and fun.  Our waitress was perfect and helpful.  The food has a southern flair but I would say that it is only average.  Not every night out has to be an unbelievable gastronomic experience and this won't be one of those evenings out but you'll have fun and the food is fine.  Put this restaurant somewhere in between The Mission and Chilis to give you an idea."}
{"text":"Danny is a fantastic server and made the experience phenomenal!  The barbecue brisket sandwich is out of this world and the shoestring fries are already definite must!"}
{"text":"I just had the brisket sandwich with the jumbo asparagus and it was incredible. Everything was cooked to perfection and the service was fast and easy."}
{"text":"The inside the inviting doors of North Scottsdale's Grass Roots... the chic and rustic decor flaunts brick interior walls, mason jar lighting fixtures, and garage door walls that roll up exposing the charming patio.  A horseshoe shaped bar demands your attention the moment you walk through the doorway -- boasting wines on tap from America's premier vineyards in California, Oregon & Washington... a nice selection of domestic beers, and unique list of hand-crafted cocktails.  ... But the food is where the real love affair began for me.  Smoked brisket sliders...  If you make it in for \"social hour\" (Grass Root's version of happy hour) do yourself a solid and order these -- as they are not on the regular menu!!  I can still taste those tender sheets of beef, smothered in tangy bbq sauce -- snuggled between the buns of a Hawaiian sweet roll.  And just when you think they couldn't possibly taste any better,  you discover a slice of homemade pickle hiding under the top bun...  ...POW! The perfect compliment to the sweetness of the sauce. Sheer genius!!  It's Burratta... I'm in love  Prepare to be whisked away with this build-your-own bruschetta platter. When the dreamy combination hits your lips, you'll keep going back for more.  Crispy grilled bread topped with creamy mozzarella, a slathering of the sweet and spicy tomato jam and a pinch of lightly dressed arugula salad.  It's the perfect way to start a meal, and there's enough to share... if you HAVE to. :-)  Downright Tasty Short Ribs...  You'd think these inspired Willie Nelson's hit song \"I Fall To Pieces\"... Cause that's exactly what they do! (Bonus points if you sang the chorus out loud ;-) This fork-tender heap of beef is slow braised and smothered in a sweet reduction of its own succulent juices.  This dish also features the Jalapeño-cheddar polenta. This savory concoction isn't spicy. It hits you with burst of cheesy goodness with a fresh jalapeño finish -- without sending your mouth screaming into the night.   Step 1 - load fork with a chunk of short rib...  Step 2 - scoop a heap of Polenta right on behind it...  Step 3 - party in your mouth...  Grass Roots is the perfect spot to experience great food, in a casual and lively atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and the service is good. :-)  With food and love, -Ashley  ForkMeDaily.com"}
{"text":"Grassroots is awesome! I had been past here before and had enjoyed other restaurants in this complex, but this weekend was my first time trying grassroots. Went here to celebrate my birthday with my family, and I am happy I did!  We got there at about 4:30, and it was not busy at all yet, but for the hour we were there it got busier and busier and was pretty packed by the end. For a good reason too because the food was awesome! We started with the common grounds Burrata for happy hour. It comes with fresh mozzarella, tomato jam, dressed arugula, and bread. You kind of get to assemble your own Burrata toast, and it was so delicious. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. It was a challenge to not completely fill up on that alone. For my meal I got the portobello sandwich (sans mayo) with fries. I wasn't all that crazy about the fries because I prefer thicker fries, but the sandwich was good. The bread was definitely my favorite part, grilled focaccia!  The highlight of my meal by far was the toffee brownie topped with vanilla ice cream. It was really big too! Very chocolatey and delicious. The only issue we had was my dad's beer was warm and foamy, but luckily this issue was fixed! The server gave him a different beer and did not charge us for either! Also we weren't charged for the brownie because it was my birthday! So the service was excellent. Not to mention the atmosphere is nice too, plus we got a huge comfortable booth. I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars   The common ground burrata was a great starter. The shrimp and grits was smokey, peppery, and awesome.  The roti and rib combo was a little average and dry but still pretty good. I imagine with as many pics of the shrimp and grits i saw on yelp that its one of their popular entrees."}
{"text":"This place is exquisite. I was there on a Sunday Brunch with one of my horse friends. I got the Waldorf Chicken Salad and she got the brisket (I believe). My salad was beyond amazing and so delicious. I will definitely be back. I cannot get enough of that salad. My friend absolutely loved her chicken as well. The service was amazing, both of our drinks were never less than half full and the waitress was incredible."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant because of the great service and atmosphere! I am usually picky with my restaurants and hate trying new places, but the first time here I was in love. My favorites are the roto combo and the short ribs. Also get the appetizer with the brussel sprouts. Honestly you can't go wrong eating here because all the food is satisfactory. As a college student, this is my favorite place to come back to when I am home."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food at fair prices. The service is excellent. One problem. They serve cold stale toast with the Burrata and the pork belly apps.oh and the fries have seasoning embedded in them."}
{"text":"This place is in our weekly rotation. Dependable reliable and very good food and service. The servers kinda of move at a slower pace. But that's ok.     Great Salads and Sandwiches. However the Brisket with Grits and Baked Beans is a highlight."}
{"text":"Love his place, happy hour has great prices but a little limited. The portion are good size tho. The staff is always professional and friendly. I've been here a bunch of times, and always happy to go back."}
{"text":"Thanks for the recommendation Yelp!! We had a great meal ( try the fish sandwich)  we had the pork belly app too - friendly and great food - wish it was in Portland !   Came back with the kids for another chance to eat here - unfortunately my daughters pork chip was raw in the middle - although I understand that mistakes happen - the way the manager handled the problem (actually failed to handle it was unacceptable) not only did they still charge for a replacement meal - when I asked to speak with her she didn't even acknowledge that they really messed up nor did she apologize for the mistake or the inconvenience/- crappy management !!!!   If I am grading in the food inly -  this place is five stars but the management decision was really disappointing and they should really take a look at how they deal with mistakes!"}
{"text":"We ate at both Grassroots and Twisted Parlor, and both were good. At Grassroots I had a bit harder time finding something I preferred as I am vegetarian. However, my husband go the ribs and loved them. We agreed that this was a great place to eat with good food, good service and a good atmosphere. It is a comfortable place to eat and relax."}
{"text":"Went for \"social hour\" and had an assortment of appetizers and cocktails. Food was creative and well prepared, and the ribs and sliders were exceptional. Cocktails were first rate as well. A surprisingly good restaurant."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Deee-Lite - Groove Is In The Heart)  The meals that you fill in my mouth Keep me filled with satisfaction when we're done Satisfaction of what's to come  I couldn't ask for another No, I couldn't ask for another  Your food, I do deeply dig Bo Bites, only the best, my supper dish My palates wish  I couldn't ask for another No, I couldn't ask for another  Grassroots in the heart, Grassroots in the heart Grassroots in the heart, Grassroots in the heart   Grassroots is a fancy pants southern twang kind of place.  Definitely a popular spot for locals and definitely a spot for foodies to explore.    My group and I started with some Ahi Tuna Poke and the Pork Belly Pancetta.  I didn't care for the poke since it was fishy and the chips seemed somewhat stale.  The pork belly was quite fatty, but I like it like that; plus the thick bits of bacon gave it some texture.  The spicy tomato jam that came along with it made this dish pop!  For the entree I went for the Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna sandwich since I wanting some fries.  Lightly grilled ahi with condiments of butter leaf, onions, avocado, and a Siracha mayo.   Hands down the Siracha mayo made this sandwich a delight.  Overall, the sandwich was okay in my books.  I really didn't care for the shoe string fries; thought I'd be getting thick fat fries from the looks of the place.  For dessert we ordered the Key Lime Pie and Banana Split.  Both were pretty darn good, but nothing too special.    Service overall was pretty good and on top of things.  Ambiance was borderline posh and some southern twang!  In the end, food was pretty good if you wanted to venture out a tad bit, but nothing to over the top! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here. Chopped salad was very good and my miso glazed salmon was cooked perfectly. The grilled asparagus served with the salmon was on the thick side and only half of each spear could be eaten but the meal still was pretty delicious. Dessert was awesome...the coconut cream pie was one of the best I've ever had. The crust was slightly chewy and was so good! The root beer float was also fantastic. A lot of options to choose from on the menu. Prices are reasonable and decor was tasteful. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Enough said. Good beer. Their happy hour rocks and their appetizers are plentiful for the price. Yay."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've had such a good meal! I eat amazing food all the time so my bar for excellence is set very high. Grassroots Kitchen did not disappoint! I met a friend here for dinner at 6pm. It was busy and we didn't have a reservation so our options were sitting on the heated patio, or sitting at a \"communal\" table inside. We opted for the shared table inside because even with the heaters, the patio was toooo cold! We sat at the end of the shared table and had no issues with the couple sitting next to us.   My friend and I ordered a meat and cheese board for $10 (HH price) that came with a giant loaf of fresh bread, mixed nuts, olives, and honey. Delicious! There were three types of cheese (brie, goat, and maybe munster) and three types of meat (salami, prosciutto, and...?). Everything was high quality and so flavorful! It was a lot of food for the two of us, so we were pretty full by the time we ordered our entree. We decided to split a plate, which was the right decision.  We went with the waitress' recommendation and ordered the short ribs with cheesy jalapeno grits. OMG. Amazing!!! Best short rib I've ever had, ever! As I said, it has been a long time since I've had such a tasty meal! The short rib was plenty of food to split between two, and between the entree and the appetizer, we were stuffed! My one and only complaint is that the short rib came with TWO pieces of asparagus. TWO!? That's it?! I need some veggies, c'mon guys!   5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambiance, 3 stars for a pathetic portion of asparagus. I'LL BE BACK SOON!"}
{"text":"Came here for the other day for leisurely lunch and really enjoyed their food, service and everything about this place. Oh except parking. Couldn't find one close by right away and had to walk in heels...  We didn't have a reservation but since we came early for lunch, they had a patio table available right away. Other choice was communal tables. If you have intimate or private conversation, highly recommend making reservation.  Salmon I had was cooked perfectly. Fish sometimes get too dry but their salmon was juicy and so tasty. I also tasted their steak too and oh my, I think I am going to order steak at my next visit!  They have a plenty of heaters outside to make it comfortable sitting outside."}
{"text":"Best cooked salmon in a long time!  Get the brownie dessert and be ready to share.  The Caesar salad is great, amazing baked potato, and baked beans are cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Amazing ambiance, super nice people.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Met a friend there for happy hour on a Friday.   Another friend had visited the place and said it was good.   Our server was Brandi.  Professional and friendly enough.   I had the BBQ wings on the appetizer/happy hour menu.   My friend had the salmon appetizer with the wontons.   Uhmmmm, well, the wings were rather tiny, the tiniest wings I've seen.   I hope they were chicken wings.   They only had some kind of sweet-like BBQ flavoring.   I like hot, but no  chance.   Non descript to say the least as far as flavors.   My friend was disappointed with the salmon.   It was actually a little bit of salmon (I'd say enough to give it a salmon color and flavor, only) but it had a LOT of filler.   Looked as though it would fill the bill as a salmon sandwich type of appetizer.   Long on the filler,  short on the salmon.   The wontons were nondescript, but it didn't matter since she ordered it for the salmon on the menu.   I would have given it two stars for the food.   The only reason I give it three stars is because the service was good.  David, the manager, came over to ask how everything was.   We said it was okay.   Would I return?   Probably not.    Would I try it for the dinner?   Possibly.  Too many places in the valley to go to a mediocure restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is everything that you are looking for in a small restaurant. Ambience is nice without being pretentious, wait staff is knowledgeable, beer selection is good, food was excellent and filling. I would most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed a lot since opening. Not sure if may have changed ownership. I was in on Wed night and the hostess was great and seated us right away in a nice booth. I think we may have been the waitresses last table as it appeared she was rushing us to order. We ordered a few drinks and the salmon appetizer. The bread was so hard we couldn't even chew it and salmon was just ok. The waitress must have been new to serving as she just grabbed plates without asking if we were done and there was still food left. She also tried to upsell us on the dessert before we even ordered dinner even saying she will hold the last piece for us.. it was very strange. Almost seemed like she would win a contest if she sold the most dessert. My friend and I split the fish special which the waitress made it a point to tell us all about the remoulade sauce as if it was the main part of the meal. Funny part is fish was dry and this amazing mayo sauce was not even on the plate but she didnt come back so we ate it without. The beets definitely came out of a can. To top it off the waitress again just starts grabbing plates and she grabbed my wine. I told her I was not done and grabbed it back. I hope the rest of the staff is better than this waitress!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally fresh, creative and friendly. Try the Farmers Vegetarian Chop salad- it would cost a fortune in time and ingredients to make this at home. Yum!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I tried this place today out on a whim because it seemed everywhere else was closed.. But I am so glad we did. I got the shrimp po boy and it was one of the best I've ever had, as well as the side of asparagus. We will definitely be back thanks to the great tasting food, reasonable prices and the whole ambiance of the place!"}
{"text":"This place does a great job with well-prepared American comfort food at decent prices.  The decor is warm and inviting and service was prompt and friendly.  I had the prime rib which was served a perfect medium rare.  The creamy horseradish was very good and the side of brussels sprouts rounded out a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"This is a solid neighborhood place.  My BBQ brisket was very good.  Always friendly service here at the bar."}
{"text":"This was a great stop on the way home to L.A. after a 6000 round trip to NY. We sat at the bar for lunch. Awesome bartender Sarah (I thought she was the manager or part owner, she was so knowledgeable and cared about her job) took her time to explain the beers to me. I had the delicious Walnut Sandwich and Lori had the Southern Shrimp and Grits. This was a really fun experience with friendly people and TV screens at the bar. I would make a detour if I come through Phoenix again. Thanks...."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Burger was awesome, shrimp poboy was awesome, poke was different(AZ style I guess) but good. Key lime pie was awesome. Service was awesome. ill be going back to try the brisket. oh yeah the baked beans were awesome too."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food is consistently outstanding. The staff is friendly and competent. Great menu items. We frequent this place and have never had a negative experience. You can't go wrong on this place! It's a busy place!"}
{"text":"Thanks Valerie Ward, Kristen Boyd, Theresa Jacobsen, Lois Judd and Mindy Diller for the wonderful going away treat. The food was phenomenal!  From the Dad's Grocery Bag appetizer to the Brisket sandwich that I had was wonderful.  Mindy had the fried chard and she said it was wonderful as well. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"You're really going to enjoy Grassroots Kitchen and Tap.  The receptionist greeted us with friendly smile and voice.  We were seated early for our 7:15 PM reservation by about 10 minutes.  Grassroots has a fun vibe and was teeming with people but the noise level was not as loud as I expected considering the full house.  Our server was Adam and he took excellent care of us.  He appeared shortly after we were seated and got our drink and dinner order in a very timely manner.  His description of my Wednesday special Grassroot's Gumbo was right one when he said hearty; I'm sure glad I only got a cup because it was so packed with meat (chicken, pork and sausage)!  And it tasted delicious.  For our main course my wife got the salmon and I had the blackened red fish. Both dishes were very tasty and the portions were excellent in size.  Adam and other service staff kept our water glasses filled at all times.  For dessert we split their well-known coconut cream pie, another recommendation I can make for both taste and portion size.  As we were talking with Adam towards the end of our visit, we asked about other recommendations he might have for our next visit considering he was so helpful so far.  He said we should come hungry for short ribs or the baby back ribs next time.  And so we shall."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant!  Consistently delicious, great service, nice ambiance, reasonable prices.   Seems like so many restaurants are hit or miss - great one time, disappointing the next - but we've been to Grassroots probably eight times since we first discovered it six months ago and  have thoroughly enjoyed it every time.    Love the Angus burgers (cooked perfectly, with killer fries), the chopped salad, the brisket, the chicken walnut salad sandwich, the salmon/salad combo, Dad's Grocery Bag (perfectly sized appetizer with a variety of cured meats, cheeses, olives, nuts, and bread - paired with a glass of wine, I've died and gone to heaven!).   I'm sure we'll get more adventurous and try more menu items in the future but we've so enjoyed the aforementioned items that we seem to keep ordering the same thing.  Have also over-indulged a couple times by sharing the banana split afterwards.... not doing the waist-line any favors but decadent as an occasional treat : )   Totally agree with another post regarding the amazing renovation of the space - ate here when it was a Chinese restaurant, and an Italian one before that, and it's unrecognizable as the same place.   Very pleasant and relaxing ambiance, both inside and out on the patio."}
{"text":"Have lived close to this restaurant for many years. drive past this place every day but thought it was a vegan restaurant. Boy was I wrong. Went tonight during happy hour which runs from 3-6 PM. The interior of the restaurant is inviting with a large and welcoming bar in the center. Very cozy and comfortable interior.  TV's overhead at the bar.   Now..the food, oh, the food. At happy hour my husband and I had the brisket sliders with Carolina barbecue sauce. You get three sliders with pickles and a subtle but not too sweet sauce, loved it as the vinegar flavor was excellent. The cost at happy hour is $5. We also had the wings which had The same sauce and were delicious. The club salad is excellent with a garlic dressing. The salmon is grilled and was moist. Would highly suggest this dish. The man next to me at the bar had the ribs which he was raving over.   So glad there is a new place I can go to in the neighborhood. If you come for dinner you can make a reservation . Try Grassroots, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Service was great, food is fantastic, atmosphere is dim and inviting. Elegant and modern. A must try. We had the brisket and grits. Girlfriend says the beans were the least appetizing out of all 3 items on the plate-yet still great. The brisket is amazing. Grits were great with a nice jalapeno taste to begin with but not overpowering.   Come on out and give em a try.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars to any restaurant, but Grassroots deserves every one of them. Not only was the food very good (we had the beef short ribs, shrimp & grits and some fish) but the dining experience was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and really seemed to care that we enjoyed our time there, continually checking on us while refreshing drinks and offering suggestions; he acted more like an owner than just an employee. There was a small wait for our entrées to come out, no big deal (I've waited FAR longer for food) and the waiter profusely apologized. When he brought us the desert menu, we were told that the manager was buying us a round of deserts because of the delay (and they were awesome btw -- get the key lime pie!) They didn't have to do that, but it was nice that they really cared and went above and beyond to make us happy. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"Love this place laid back and friendly. Best smoked salmon I've ever had and love their gimlet! Dads grocery bag is super good. Have yet to try something I don't like."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Atmosphere is simple and quaint. I'm a barfly so had lunch today at the bar. For a 'taproom' the draft selection was very limited. Though it looked like most of their wine was on 'tap'. As for the service, let me use an example. The bartender asked what I'd like to drink as I seated. I ordered water and said I would look at the draft list. Water came quickly along with a menu. So far so good.  I asked what today's fish was and was told it was 'Red Fish', which I assumed meant red snapper. I ordered the blackened fish sandwich with sautéed chard. With the exception of the sliced tomatoes on the sandwich, it was excellent.   However, as I was about halfway done, a patron that was clearly a regular, sat by me at the bar. The bartender and he had friendly banter then she went into the day's specials.  SPECIALS...I'd heard nothing about specials. At all!! When the patron told her she didn't have to recite specials, she responded, 'It's my job!'  That's laughable. Considering she felt it appropriate to omit the specials to me. Odd.  Thanks Wally for all the great experiences previously. The food was great as always, but in this case the service was sorely lacking!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Tophers raised short ribs with the jalapeño infused grits--oh my!   Finished off with the chocolate toffee brownie.  Oh boy what a treat!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Really laid back and comfortable. Great service. Had a very pleasant experience. I would recommend the brisket or the grits. Also the pork belly appetizer is amazing!"}
{"text":"Grassroots was on my 'list of restaurants' to try so I was happy to meet my friend here for lunch.    Our waitress was very accommodating.  She could tell we had some catching up to do so she opened up our menus for us and suggested we take our time and leave the menus open until we were ready to order.   We both ended up ordering the special Salmon Burger.   It was surprisingly juicy and the side of asparagus was very good."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, but sorry, this place doesn't do it for me. The food tastes old."}
{"text":"First , went for lunch. I tasted my guest's trout with real good veggie salad which was better than my miso glaze salmon with asparagus( they are tender and tastier when thin)"}
{"text":"This is the second time visiting grassroots with my mother and both times the quality of the food was phenomenal! The choices vary and everything is portioned properly and very healthy! The miso salmon is cooked to perfection which I've had both times. I highly suggest if you haven't been here yet to get in asap! The service is very simple and friendly. The staff knows the menu in and out. I am bringing my grandmother and extended family in asap"}
{"text":"Looking for a diverse menu to please everyone from the pickiest eaters to adventurous foodies and those in between?  Grassroots is your place!  I've now been to Grassroots on several occasions. The first time was for lunch with Lindsey D, and that was followed by two dinners with family.  In those meals alone, I dined with a pregnant woman (Lindsey), a plain Jane (think no sauces, no oil, etc...), a vegetarian, a Cross Fit coach (my bro) that eats mostly Paleo, a big meat and potato type (my dad), a moderately healthy eater (me), and a couple of in betweeners.  I've either seen or tried firsthand the following menu items: -the chopped vegetable salad (with and without protein added) -the broiled rainbow trout -the roasted chicken walnut salad sandwich -the smoked brisket sandwich -the short ribs -the shrimp and grits -the shoe string potatoes -the grilled asparagus  and probably a few more!  It's all been satisfying; maybe not the best meal in the world, but consistent and nothing has been sent back...  Service has been attentive and drinks (wine and cocktails) are approved as well...  They've got both indoor and outdoor seating and a convenient location off of Hayden and Via de Ventura.  They also have a second location in the Biltmore area that I wouldn't hesitate to check out!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and wanted to sit on the patio. The hostess thought a couple was leaving, so it would be a few minutes, but then they ordered another glass of wine. Ok, we will wait for another table. We go to the bar and are sat less than 15 minutes later. We ordered dinner and out of the blue, to say sorry for the initial mis-quote on the time, we were given a burrata board.   We eat out a few times each week and lately the service has been lacking, not at Grassroots.  The food and service were wonderful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"the staff and manager are idiots. Although I told them I am allergic to chili, my meal comes with chili flakes sprinkled all over it."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere are nice. I like that it's quite and I can hear my wife talk. The food was just ok and overly seasoned. The ribs had hardly any meat them. The ribs were supposed to be baby back but they didn't have any back meat. Only the little bit of meat between the bones. The ribs were also over cooked and mushy but they did have a good flavor."}
{"text":"Beautiful gimlet, amazing coconut cream pie, and awesome service at the bar! Thank you Mia and Corin!  Update for today 7/22/17... I just love grassroots!   Lauren the bartender was amazing and provided amazing service even with a full bar!  I had the redfish with the chard (I don't eat pork so I substituted out the dirty orzo) and my boo had short ribs with a loaded baked potato! Yes please!  Cool atmosphere and great wine list (everything is available by the glass)! The Burrata and short rib chili were a great way to start!  Right on all of the way!!"}
{"text":"Holy moley these guys throw together a mean, green salad machine! My team brought me here for my pre-birthday lunch. I ordered the Club House half-salad w/ chicken and had I been wearing socks, they would've been knocked right off of my tootsies.  We went at about noon, so parking was a little tricky, but as we approached someone pulled out *giggle* and we were able to get the rock star parking a pre-bday lunch enjoying girl should get. (If you saw some of the heels I wear, you'd probably sign a petition for me to get self-imposed handicap parking...you know, the handicap spots that you find that are nowhere near a door, but are still closer than BFE at the ass-end of Wallyworld?)  Anywho, since it was noon, there was a little bit of a wait (maybe 5-7 minutes) to sit inside however they have open seating at the bar and outdoor seating (which is what we went with). The temperature outside was oh-my-f'ing-holy-hell-hot for only 1-2 minutes, at this point we had our promptly delivered liquid refreshments and had become acclimated to the misters (for those not from hot places, those are the delightful mist contraptions they put on restaurant patios to keep guests cool, not a euphemism for the guys at the table...get it? Misters? lol)  The salad dressing they used was all I could think about for the rest of the day. It was phenomenal. The server was quick and efficient and the hostess was on the ball. Oh...and did I mention there's a full bar? Yeah, check this spot out. YUM!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch on Friday and it was packed!  Tried the Roasted Chicken Waldorf Salad and it was amazing...seriously delish!  The honey mustard dressing was a tad too sweet so I had creamy garlic instead and it really made the meal.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I go to grass roots alot. The servise at the bar is amazing. Mia and Loran make a great team and always happy. Keep it up i like goung there."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat. I did not even like beef brisket until I tried this place! Their poke was the closest I have had to Hawaii's poke in the valley, very delicious. They have great happy hour food and drinks. Always a safe go to for tasty quality food:)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I like eating at new restaurants when I travel and I'm so glad I decided to go to Grassroots. The outdoor seating was great and the misters helped keep it cooler. The trout and key lime pie were fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Grassroots for restaurant week and they did not disappoint! I'm not going to lie, I shop at Trader Joe's next door often and I always thought this place was a vegetarian/vegan place so I wasn't entirely all that interested. Why did I think this? I have no idea. I saw grassroots and just thought that. Anyways, my boyfriend picked this place out and I was shocked haha. We ordered off of the restaurant week menu since obviously it is such a good deal. My boyfriend and I like to each order something different so that we can try a wider spread of the menu.   We started with the tuna poke and the common ground burrata, so both of the options they had for restaurant week. They were both amazing. I would seriously come back just for both of these appetizers. The tuna poke had tuna, shrimp, avocado, scallions, jalapeños, cilantro, and agave ponzu served with large wonton chips. The poke ingredients were really fresh and the dish itself was refreshing to eat in this heat. The wonton chips were fried nicely. They were crispy, but light and not oily. I honestly couldn't taste the jalapeños and there was no heat so don't be deterred from trying this dish if you think it will be spicy. My boyfriend can't eat spicy and he could eat this just fine. The burrata, which is like a mozzarella, came with dressed arugula, a spicy tomato jam and toasted bread pieces. I was a huge fan of this dish. The creaminess of the burrata calmed the spicy tomato jam and balanced it; and they paired really well with the nuttiness of the arugula. The tomato jam by itself was really good. It had a really good balance between sweet, spicy, and a fruity tomato flavor.  For our entrees, we ordered the shrimp and grits, as well as the braised short ribs. The shrimp and grits had grilled shrimp over jalapeño cheddar grits with tasso ham relish and grilled focaccia slices. I would say the main star of this dish was the jalapeño cheddar grits with tasso ham relish. OMG! I have never actually had real southern grits before, so I can't tell you if these are traditional or not, but I can tell you they were creamy, they were smooth, and they were delicious. The jalapeño cheddar flavor were very present, but they did not overwhelm or overtake the grits. The ham relish on top went really well with the jalapeño cheddar flavor. The focaccia was grilled nicely and that it paired well with the dish. The shrimp in this dish were grilled, which unfortunately dried them out a tiny bit, but they did have a nice char flavor to them. The shrimp and grits is definitely a comfort food dish. The braised short ribs came with asparagus and jalapeño cheddar grits. The braised short ribs were reall good. They were so tender that they just fell apart with my fork picking at them. The ribs had a nice sweetness to them from the hoisin sauce glaze. The jalapeño cheddar grits on this dish did not have the same texture like the jalapeño cheddar grits on the shrimp and grits dish so that was confusing for me. I had no idea they were the same. None. I seriously thought they were dry mashed potatoes with jalapeños. It had good flavor, just an off texture. My thought is that maybe the ham relish sauces seeped into the grits and changed them completely into what tasted like completely new grits. The asparagus were grilled and were nice and crisp. The asparagus was the much needed fresh aspect the dish needed to help lighten up the dish.   For dessert, there were two options so once again we ordered both. We had the key lime pie and the chocolate toffee brownie. The key lime pie was so light. The pie had a definitive key lime flavor and it was sweet, but not too sweet. Normally, key lime has a tartness to it, but I didn't think this one had any tartness to it. It made me a little sad, but the pie was still really good so I guess I can't complain. The crust was thin and really good. I wish there was more of it! The chocolate toffee brownie came out warmed with a mini scoop of ice cream on top and the plate was drizzled with caramel and toffee crumbles. The brownie was dense and a little heavy so the vanilla ice cream on top was nice to break some of that up. The caramel is hand made so it doesn't taste artificial at all, but had a good, sweet flavor. The toffee pieces were also really good and provided the crunchiness the dessert needed."}
{"text":"It very much lived up to what I had hoped, oh and I had high hopes.  I am on a roller coaster diet if there ever were one.  I started the year out awesome (strict) lost weight, felt better, the whole nine yards... I left for the weekend to visit my sister up in Oregon and beer, chili cheese fires, way too much wine, cake, pizza, pie, ice cream....   ok wow, long story short, I needed one last \"I am gonna eat what I want\" meal before getting back to fixing the damage.  After weighing out our choices all day while waiting at the gates, and on the plane, I wanted most to come here, and try the short ribs.  They were so wonderful, each bite needs to be the grits and beef combo, they work and magic spell together, it was everything I needed. That's the five star part, everything else, solid 4.  The iced tea was perfect, the social hour bbq wings were super yummy, and my Hubby's burger was solid, oh their fries are amazing! Of course, I had to go nuts and get the brownie, yeah the toffee, caramel, fudge finish was perfect.  Now on the the vegetables! Weeks of them, so much damage to fix"}
{"text":"We are frequent customers of Grassroots. Some of our favorites are the farmer's chopped salad, shrimp po boy, and key lime pie. Today we were super hungry and got the brussel sprout app. Amazing! It's cooked with bacon and a sweet balsamic glaze. Super tasty, I don't think I'll be able to dine there again without getting the brussel sprout app."}
{"text":"interesting food choices with well assembled flavors and textures  (please refer to the menu). I liked the ambience and the service was professional. I would come here again when in Sdale."}
{"text":"Ate here while my wife and I were in town. The short rib was perfect.  The cocktails were good, but really small. I got the barrel aged manhattan, and it came in a small glass with a giant ice cube.  I think there were about 3 sips in the glass.  Other than that, very nice experience."}
{"text":"First time here .  Came in early for dinner about 545. Seated quickly and drink order taking. When drink arrived ordered the piggly wiggly combo of pork belly small baby back ribs and pancetta wrapped asparagus and some well done toast.  The hit was the tomato jam.  Sweet and spicy , best on the plate.  Ordered the famer side salad,  good mix with beets radishes corn and a slaw mix. For side pretty large.  Needed some citrus or acid to really make it sing.  Order the main which came out half way through the salad.  Braised short ribs with hoisin sauce and jalapeño grits.  The ribs were really dry and maybe more sauce would have helped.  As I lived for a while in New Orleans , grits are one of my favs and these were overdone and the chucks of raw jalapeños didn't help.  Also don't order if you are really hungry only 2 ribs.  Ordered the key lime pie and was pretty good overall.  Food score on a 0-10 about a 6 pie about a 9.  Service was really rushed with plates being delivered halfway through each course.  Maybe due to not a big crowd.  Wait staff seemed to be having a good time in the prep area.  Will wait a while to try again."}
{"text":"Salads here are incredible! The service is superb. The dishes overall are very unique and fresh. I've been here 4 times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Love this rest & everything about it. It' reminds me of a Hillstone group rest. Food is terrific & they seem to care. Atmosphere is low key & they seem to take pride in the quality of their food & prep.  So far it is a winner !!"}
{"text":"Stop number two on my eating summer vacation.  Joined by Arana W and Lisa E. With that company I could have forgotten all about being there to eat.  We shared an appetizer plate (Dad's grocery bag) while deciding what to have.  So we decided and our waiter came around and told us what the special was and I couldn't resist.  Turned out to be some the best grilled swordfish I had ever had, not sorry in the least I did not have the filet.  The service was as good as the food, excellent! Right from the start our waiter was there every time we needed him.  Wine samples, drink explanations, food questions.  Yes it is a mini Arizona chain, but the next level up, and certainly not for every day dining for my or most of my friends budgets.  And it certainly feels like a one of a kind.  But for me it was a rare weekday evening I was not constrained for time or mileage and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Grassroots has a fun, casual atmosphere with Southern inspired food!  We were seated in a big booth and our waitress was very informative and friendly.  It was busy on a Saturday night with people seated outside waiting but with our opentable reservation we walked right in.  We had: *Salad with edamame, beets, cabbage to share-pretty good *Rainbow trout- very nicely grilled with swiss chard *Shrimp and grits-very good and good portion  The $7 kids meal includes fries, grapes and a certificate for a generous scoop of ice cream next door at Sweet Provisions  The entrees were a little on the pricier side but the quality of the food was worth it.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and the tangy slaw is wonderful. So glad they share the recipe online! Worth going back for."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal!!! We had the Cobb salad and the baby back ribs and it was superb. I have never tasted French fries as good as theirs. Also, for dessert we had pumpkin pie, which was to die for. Our server Lesta was very informative and made the experience that much better. I will definitely be coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The service is always good. Gluten free bun on the burger was perfect. For those who are gluten free, the staff if very helpful and very accommodating. Adam was very helpful and a great server."}
{"text":"After urging by others we stopped by for early dinner here last week-pleasantly surprised by the great, lively, casual atmosphere-a great addition to McCormick Ranch for the locals! Salads were great and we will definitely stop by again to try the baby back ribs! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had lunch last Saturday after stumbling onto this great place. The decor and atmosphere was really nice. Hip but relaxed. They had a nice outdoor seating area with lots of shade and good misters. My daughter and I each had a salad. She had the chicken Waldorf salad and I had the farmers salad. Portions were ok but for salads could have been bigger. The dressings were homemade and really delicious. Flavorful but light. And they did not drench the salad in dressing. The service was great. I asked how big the bread and cheese appetizer was and our waitress said it good size. I mentioned to my daughter bread would be good. The waitress picked up on that and said I can bring some bread with olive oil and salt. I like that kind of attention. So over all it was a nice place with good food."}
{"text":"Holy Moly Delishious!!!!  We went to an early dinner on a Saturday afternoon.  The atmosphere and service are amazing.  The waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable.  The best part.....the Etch A Sketch!!!  The kids loved it.  Allowed us to have a nice dinner while the kids were entertained.  The tuna/avocado dish was to die for.....we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to see what the hype was about... Guessing it's more about the patrons than the food. I had the miso salmon ... Was very good. Served w al dente asparagus which lacked flavor. For the price of $18 I was expecting more. The cappuccino was warm ... Not hot . Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great service, always consistent excellent food..love this place.  Vibrant bar scene and just love everything about it.  Brought friends from Chicago...they agreed it was very good."}
{"text":"Our go to lunch place.  It's owned by the same people that own Wallys so we were really excited to see Chris even closer to our office.  Food is always healthy, fresh, and served just right.  Great patio.  And I've even had a few of their drinks (after work, I promise!)"}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend here for lunch. Was on a 10 day detox so my choices for food were limited but I was not worried coming to a place like this. I knew regardless of my food restrictions even if I was the world's pickiest eater, I was in good hands.  My girlfriend ordered their ahi tuna salad and I ordered their chopped salad with no dressing. Basically a bowl of variety of chopped veggies, raw, nothing else added. The salad came with feta and as I was not doing feta as part of the cleanse, I explained this to the waiter. With a smile, he whisks it away and promptly comes back with a salad with no feta.  Although my girlfriend doubtfully asked if the salad was tasty with no dressing, no feta, nada nada except for a bowl of delightfully fresh veggies, the salad was indeed extremely flavorful with the mix of beet, corm, and bounty of other goodness.    The key is freshness and Grassroots had plenty of it! I wish most people would realize that with the right combinations of greens and vegetables, the flavors of just the natural goodness packs plenty of flavor. No dressing needed. No feta or any cheese needed. It's a cleansing of the palate and the body.  I digress. Okay, Grassroots was everything I expected. Even though it was my first time here, I just knew their menu and service would be excellent and I was not disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Not great, but solidly good. And we would have had a really pleasant lunch, but our waitress was a total snot. Wow. So rude, unfriendly and unhelpful. The atmosphere of Grassroots is nice and I really liked the location -out of the chaos of Old Town- but we won't go back. A rude waitress ruins the whole experience. If you go, try to get the blonde waitress. She was super nice. Wish she was ours!"}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week and I highly recommend it! Great deal for $33 for 3 course menu with options to choose from. Had the burrata appetizer with tomato jam and toast points, the short ribs with their famous grits, and a chocolate toffee brownie with ice cream.  I took left overs home! Only reason not a 5 star review is it kept smelling like burnt toast most of the night which was a little overwhelming."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, one of the best eats in town.  Great beer and starter menus.  Exceptional service with pleasant servers (We had a red haired girl that was kind, friendly, and extremely personable). Look and ask for her!  She's the best."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! Everything about it was awesome. We had a wonderful server. She was on top of everything and was very pleasant. We went with some friends who recommended it. I love the Decor! The vegetarian options were great. My husband and his friend loved their pork dishes. My friend got a salad that she routinely gets and raves about it every time. Can't wait to go back and try some of their desserts, we were just too full for sweets this time. I wish they were just a little bit closer but can't wait to bring some of my family back there."}
{"text":"Tried Grassroots for Arizona restaurant week and I'm glad we did.  I had wanted to try out their ribs and was glad to see it as an option on their special menu.  The ribs were good and the entree was plentiful with more ribs than I could share and eat and a ton of their crispy shoestring fries which were great. Instead of ordering two meals (we're light eaters), we ordered a side of beans and a loaded baked potato and shared.  With the starter and dessert, we didn't even finish one of the items between the two of us!  They are very generous.  Our starter was the burrata and it came with a huge amount of toast!  It was very tasty with the tomato relish and dressed arugula.  The chocolate toffee brownie dessert was super yummy too!"}
{"text":"We walked in about 20 minutes before closing.  The service was friendly, helpful and not at all rushed.  We had a variety of food from shrimp poppers to chicken wings.  All in which arrived hot and in a timely manner. Such a relaxing and inviting atmosphere.  We were traveling from out of town and would definitely make this a stop when visiting."}
{"text":"We did the restaurant week three course menu, which was a great deal! Not included on the menu tasting, we also ordered the smoked salmon, which was excellent. I had the burrata and my husband had the poke for starters, both were huge portions and very yummy. For an entree I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the bbq ribs. The ribs were awesome, shrimp and grits were just ok. For dessert we had the brownie and the key lime pie, the brownie was gooey amazingness and the pie was perfect balance of tart and sweet. I recommend the white sangria as well, very refreshing. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum and more yum! Went there on a recommendation from a co-worked and he did not lead us astray! Service was fantastic and the food was even more fantastic. Ordered the southern shrimp and grits, topher's braised short ribs, and the special of sea bass with heirloom cauliflower. All were delicious and we all left with leftovers. If you're ever in AZ, definitely plan a meal here."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. I got the borrata and the southern shrimp and grits. The shrimp were really flavorful."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 4 on a Saturday night and did not experience a wait. My party ordered (1) Dad's Grocery Bag, (2) Salmon Entree, (3) Baby Back Ribs, and (4) Prime Rib.  Dad's Grocery was a great opening appetizer. Our's came with a brie, goat cheese, and a harder white cheese. I don't think our appetizer came with honey, but all the other items were included in our order.  The Salmon entree only comes with asparagus.   The Baby Back Ribs were nice and tender. It was also a very large entree. Two people can share this entree.   The Prime rib is only available either Friday/Sat night or Sat/Sun Night. A fatty cut, as expected. The mashed potatoes side is made with bacon! What a delight.   Overall, Grassroots has a very dimly-lit-living-room feel. It was enjoyable and I will be coming back again, if I'm in the mood for American."}
{"text":"Great menu and everything is different and delicious!  There is a killer candy and ice cream shop next door too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great open air vibe with plenty of great menu choices. The food is fresh, properly prepared and seasoned with a gentle hand. Drinks flow easily out of the bar, and happy hour specials are on par with the best in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this spot for Lunch, Dinner, or Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner and drinks!! I had great service and the atmosphere/music was wonderful. My server Tyler was excellent and I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Big portions of veggies which is huge in my book. The chicken and the key lime pie were both phenomenal, as was the service, especially the manager (?) Domingo who helped my mom make a substitution because of her allergies. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is close to our house and I figured it could be our new hotspot. After eating here I'm not so sure.   The positives are that its a nice ambiance and our wait time was short.  The service was sub par. Our waiter was nice but he would disappear and take forever to bring us food, drinks, and the check. I thought he ran off with our credit card bc he took so long.   The food was fine but not worth the price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here at least once per week for their AMAZING happy hour !!! We love the food, the service, and the ambiance.   The Burrata is to die for, as are the shortribs with jalapeño cheddar grits.  Seriously, everything is so great here and we've never had a bad meal.  For drinks, I highly recommend the white Sangria!  For dessert top it all off with a toffee brownie... or go next door to their ice cream/candy shop for something sweet!"}
{"text":"First off let me say I thought it was going to be great after reading all these positive reviews.  Not so much.. We went last night. It was so crowded but we were able to get a table.  We started off with the poke.  When it came it looked interesting but it was aweful.  The fish tasted water logged from being frozen and then defrosted. The flavor overall  was really bland.  The fish wasnt even fresh.  Come on now.  It you are going to serve raw fish lets make it fresh please.  The wonton chips tasted like they came out of the bag and even tasted a bit stale.   I had the vegetable plate.  On the menu they said these were local farm fresh vegetables.  Terrible.  The tomato was hard as a rock and the basil on top was all shriviled like it had been old.  The swiss chard and the asparagus were ok, but nothing special. Very oily... The corn tasted like it was frozen corn with cheese in it.  yuck.  The craziset thing was that there was a huge huge pile of coldslaw that dominated the plate.  What is that even doing on there? My husband had the shrimp poboy and again it was ok but the shrimp tasted frozen and just fried.  My son had the corn dog and loved it.  At least someone liked their meal.  This place really needs to rethink its \"farm to table\" concept because they are really not living up to that statement."}
{"text":"I really like to give Grassroots Kitchen a raving review, but I just can't.  It's a fairly new restaurant in Town Country next to Trader Joes- nice open space, big patio, nice employees, but the food is ok at best.    The first time I came to visit was for happy hour.  They had good specials, but the food was not that great.  Then the second time I came was for lunch yesterday.  The restaurant was pretty empty and they do not do breakfast or brunch.  I order the burger - well done with roasted asparagus.  The burger lacked flavor, but the asparagus was good.  This would definitely not be the place to come for a burger as I can think of a few better options.    The server(s) were attentive and really sweet though so I kinda feel guilty not giving them a better review.  The bill came and I was even more disappointed because again, I would of rather went to a few other places spending what I spent here."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  This place is pretty darn good.  When a colleague called me up to go to lunch and said \"hey, let's go to Grassroots\", my immediate response was \"dude, that's not one of those healthy vegan places is it? because I don't like those kind of restaurants\".....he laughed and said \"trust me, this is your kind of place\".....he was right.  We met around 11:30 am for lunch and the parking lot in the shopping center it's in was jam packed.  When it's mid-day in Arizona, the last thing you want to do is park far away from the restaurant and walk in dress clothes to/from your car....it's too hot.  In this case, I had to park really far away in the parking garage.  The parking situation gets 1 Star.  The food and service on the other hand gets a solid 4 Stars.  I decided to go with the Smoked BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich w/Fries, $13. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=Fd9b4bUF72Anw5bE3sFiZA#Fd9b4bUF72Anw5bE3sFiZA  I immediately fell in love with the Sandwich after 1 bite.  The Cole Slaw that was put on top of the Brisket was the perfect compliment....this thing is full of flavor.  However, it was messy...I don't recommend it for a business lunch.....I am trying to stop ordering messy menu items during business lunches, but for some reason I can't stop.  Good thing I didn't get any on me.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  Despite the joint being packed for lunch and crazy busy, she was able to ensure we were well taken care of.  Tip - Ask for a table away from the front door.  There are several tables near the front door and we sat at one of them.  Since it's so busy, there are 2 things about those tables that are bad....the constant opening of the door lets in the 400 degree convection oven air from the Sonoran Desert and it's very hard to stay cool....the other thing is that when people wait for their table, they're almost on top of you.  That said, next visit we'll sit in the back.  Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"We are from Virginia and couldn't find a good restaurant.  We passed Grassroots and went in.  BEST DECISION!! Joseph was amazing and so excited to learn about who we are and where we are from.  Amazing ribs and the best desert we have ever had!! Thank you Joseph!!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. Not crazy priced. Megan was our waitress and she was incredible!"}
{"text":"Have tried this place a few times and I always end up getting the same thing. The brisket sandwich and jalapeño grits. The brisket sandwich is good but the bread gets a bit soggy and the grits are the best and I'm not even a fan of grits but they are delicious. Service is always good for me as well."}
{"text":"We have been to Grassroots several times and never disappointed.  The food has been great every visit.  Especially enjoyed the ribs and brisket entrees and the jalapeno cheddar grits are different and delicious. The service has always been efficient even at busy times. MARINA was our server on last visit and was friendly and helpful with the menu. She checked on us frequently. Although the prices were somewhat high, which is typical of Scottsdale restaurants, we thoroughly enjoyed the entrees and sides. We will continue to visit Grassroots. It is a nice place to eat and  visit."}
{"text":"Thank you for the best coconut cream pie in AZ. I highly recommend It. Add it to your Thanksgiving list of pies on the table."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! A must go to. Great ambiance in a great location. The food is excellent and the staff is very friendly. I would recommend trying the shrimp po boy sandwich or the burger, But it's all delicious."}
{"text":"The family really enjoyed the pork belly and salmon appetizers. Knowing in advance that I will be trying the adult root beer float I had a cup of the spare rib chili soup and large farm chop salad. Both were great. My wife had the swordfish, son the brisket sandwich, and daughter the angus burger. All plates were cleaned! The toffee brownie all mode along with the Dad's root beer float did not disappoint. We will definitely be back. There was a lot left on the menu we are looking forward to trying."}
{"text":"Came here on a blind date.. and the best part of the date was the food! ha! The short ribs were amazing!! I took my folks back there for lunch I thought it was so good but the food wasn't near as good... so again a restaurant that isn't consistent in the excellent food! Service is just ok.. not bad- just kind of \"ditzy\" sorry.. but true.  The atmosphere is cool too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happen I had been a few times and loved this place so I was pretty disappointed to return to find the food taste had disappeared. The service was lacking and the overall experience (outside of my guest- they were still wonderful) was disappointing. The grits use to be cheddar jalapeño and they danced in your tongue this time they just bored me to death. UGH I'm getting fed up with tasteless places!"}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and accommodating! I reserved seats for 20 at the last minute...they made it happen even though they were pretty busy."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Always wonderful food and the BEST service...don't hesitate to try this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's been okay. Today we walked in and sat at the bar and waiting a good 12 minutes for a bartender to arrive. During those twelve minutes, a gentleman is sitting at the bar finishing his meal. He then proceeds to get up and walk into the kitchen. This gentleman, was the manager and watched us sit there and wait for service. There was absolutely no sense of urgency to take care of guests. It was really disappointing because we will only go to local establishments especially in the summer to support our local businesses. Sorry Grass Roots! Not a win!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a few friends and decided to check it out. Although it isn't really a chain, thank God, this is the second location a bit further west from its Scottsdale flagship.  What a great addition to T and C Shopping Center!  Peg and I found it welcoming and the interior was inviting. Clean and fresh looking without being \"flavor of the month\" like some chains that pop up trendiness on a regular basis.  MIndy was our server (although others took care of providing great service) and Jordan was gracious and quality-controlling. The Red Bean and RIce soup was terrific.  The Brisket platter was delicious....brisket was fork tender and yummy and the usual sides (bbq beans but a nice twist with japeno grits) were not usual...they were very tasty. Shrimp po'boy was also good and worth a repeat as well. Gumbo is on the menu for a different night special...like the red beans are for Mondays. While not typically dessert tasters, key lime pie is always at least worth a few words...and theirs is the real deal. To show their versatility, they offer a tuna poke app which was was very very good. I would strongly recommend this place!  It will make a great  neighbor for Chris Bianco's place a few doors down."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this fabulous restaurant.  Our waiter, Tatum, was just 3 weeks into the job but handled it like a pro! He was so knowledgeable, easy to talk to and recommended the dishes for our entire dining experience.  First, we started with the Burrata appetizer, to die for, I could've eaten the entire plate on my own.  We shared the chop salad, the ingredients were so fresh and the bacon added that nice salty punch. Onto our entrees, my husband had the spitfire chicken and I had the short ribs.  The portions were generous!  The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful.  The short ribs were falling off the virtual bone, no knife needed for this one.  The cheddar jalapeño grits are a must!  We were so full but Tatum described the homemade pies in a way were we could not refuse!  We had to order 2 slices, the coconut cream and the key lime.  What a perfect way to end our perfect dinner!  Tatum, keep doing what you're doing!  We will be back to see you again!"}
{"text":"I've finally decided to review this great little restaurant since I've been here 5 or more times.  I was first dragged here several months ago by my father who lives close to there, for lunch.  This place is owned by the same people who own Wally's, and he is a Wally's fan while I am not, and so I wasn't thrilled about the prospect.  I was glad to be proven wrong.  I have to admit, I have had only one thing on the menu: the seasonal vegetable chop salad.  It's seriously one of my favorite things in life and I eat A LOT OF SALADS.  There are so many different ingredients that somehow don't compete with eachother but rather delicately blend together and yet all stand out as delicious little pops of flavor in every bite.  I have seen dining partners order various things from the menu and have never seen anyone disappointed.  Sweet Pea loved the hamburger, and he's a real hamburger aficionado, often proclaiming them \"too charbroil-y\" or other made up adjectives that I don't quite understand.  The jalapeno cheddar grits that he got as a side were out of this world- just enough of both the pepper and the cheese flavors without being overwhelming.  I think my exact comment on them was \"I'd like to dive headfirst into a vat of these and eat my way out.\"  The service is always top notch.  Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place knows how to do a vegetable platter. The joint was jumping at 5:50pm on a Wednesday - who knew? Service was excellent and the vibe was awesome.   PS I've never seen so many man-buns in one place. But the hipster quotient wasn't annoying :-)"}
{"text":"This review is for their Scottish salmon with romaine salad that I took to go in a hurry last night. Have to say one of the best salmon salads I've ever had. Salmon was cooked and seasoned absolutely perfectly- crunch on the outside of the salmon. The dressing was killer - loved every bite!  I don't live in the area but will come again when I visit!"}
{"text":"We live a few min away and have been consistently coming to grassroots for a few years. Food is always great and service is usually pretty good (4 stars there). Favs are: rib combo plate, farmers chop salad and several of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"thought the food was good. But not over the top. Loved the patio on Hayden, the inside was too noisy. I had the ribs and they were good, but had to order an extra side of sauce. Not too much on the ribs.  I guess what got me, was the dirty dishes and glasses weren't taken. we had to ask. and I think they should know and if not the waiters should ask 'can I take this?'  We shared the brownie with 4 of us and it was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eager to try Grassroots since it opened a month ago.  After our experience last night I'm torn between three and four stars.  If we had been seated at an actual table I think I'd be more generous.    We walk in and were told that there's a 45-minute wait.  Okay, so it was a Friday night--this is understandable.  We put our name down and wait outside.  Three minutes later the hostess informs us that our table is ready.  Interesting.  We were seated at a community table next to some older men who were drinking martinis and eating appetizers.  I'm not sure if we got shafted with this one.  I had to put my precious Kate Spade bag on the floor because there were no extra stools or hooks to hang it on.  That in itself made me want to leave.   The menu consists of fish, ribs, chicken, salads, sandwiches and a few a la carte sides.  The items are pricey and the portions are small.  The tuna poke appetizer was bigger than my ahi tuna salad entree.  I was most impressed with the poke; the tuna and shrimp were incredibly fresh and there was a nice kick of acidity.    Our waiter said that the ahi tuna salad was \"lighter\" but reassured me that the portion size would fill me up.  Liar!  I wish there were three times more greens on the plate.  The salad was quite tasty but the ahi was a little overdone for my taste.  I enjoyed the soy ponzu vinaigrette and I requested some wasabi on the side for a kick.  Sadly, there was no ginger on site to accompany the tuna.  We had to grab a second dinner in Old Town to feel fully satisfied.    The crowd here isn't exactly my generation...we were youngest couple in the entire place.  I could return, but there are many other place I'd like to try before I do.  It's a good place to go if you're older and want a light bite."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service is okay. It was a busy Friday night, but we had reservations and it was my birthday, and knowing this our server still wasn't the nicest but I didn't let it ruin my day. The food was amazing and that's why we came.   You've probably read this in 10 other reviews, but start with the burrata cheese appetizer. Holy cow. It's my new favorite way to eat bruschetta. It is sort of like a deconstructed version but insanely flavorful and good with the fresh cheese and spiced tomato jam (see picture)  We ordered the burger of course, with baked beans. And the short rib with cheddar jalapeño grits!!!!!!!! GRITS!!!!!! Haha I love grits. I also love that the menu had classic items with a southern flair. There were so many entrees I wanted to try so I'll definitely be back.  The place has such a cool vibe. Perfect for a date night or girls night out. We got to sit on the patio which I loved it had cute lights and cute wood booths and fires going. Super cool ambiance. Romantic.   All in all I'd be back, but you're paying good money for good food so good service is EXPECTED. :)"}
{"text":"Went to Grass Roots for our first time last night.  It was such a great experience!  The food was really incredible.  Loved the friendly wait staff as well as the patrons!  Energetic, electric and sensational!"}
{"text":"From out of town, stopped by here yesterday during their happy hour. The happy hour menu was great and very well priced , shared several of the appetizers on there . Great service , nice atmosphere . Ordered mostly meat dishes and cheese plate so we didn't have a chance to try the entrees or salad. Will definitely be returning for dinner and expect the same upon return . Thanks grassroots !!"}
{"text":"There are times when you go to a restaurant and the food is amazing but the service leaves you a bit dissatisfied.  There are other times you have great service but the food or drinks leave you wanting for more.  Tonight, we walked to one of the many restaurants in the area.  By we I mean me, my wife, and my small tribe of children.  Many times you go to a restaurant with your family that doesn't have a mascot or theme and they make you feel unwelcome.  The servers think, here goes a bunch of kids meals, a big mess, tired and needy parents, small tip.  Lydia L didn't treat us that way at all.  She was welcoming to us from the moment she came to our table.  She was attentive but not overbearing.  Never came at the wrong time but we were never needing for anything either.  Had a good sense of humor which is welcoming for parents of four small tyrants.  The food, as has been our experience the past few times there was delicious.  Very well thought out, flavorful but not using the salt as an easy way out.  I know the Beckett's and it is everything I wish Sourthern Rail to be.    It is winter and my children (9, 4, 2, and 1 month) have no immune systems.  They are basically walking petri dishes.  At the end of the dinner, my two year old, sick with the flu starts vomiting all over the table.  Lydia is unfazed.  (which is more than I can say for myself.  I think I casually threw my napkin to my wife and looked away).  She apologized for him being sick.  Wished us a Happy New Year.  and when I mentioned that \"I guess I won't be having the Key Lime Pie for dessert\", surprised me when she returned my debit card with a complimentary Key Lime Pie to go.  Servers have a tough job.  I know it, I met my wife when she was a bartender at Chelsea's Kitchen.  But good servers don't let you know that they have just dealt with a table full of ingrates.  They treat each group as individuals.  It is surprising how many good restaurants employ poor service professionals.  The best servers however, go above and beyond to make your stay memorable.  We are in the Biltmore area.  We can go a lot of places.  But we'll definitely be back to Grassroots, with the dirty kids in tow, and when we do, we'll be extremely lucky if Lydia L is our server!"}
{"text":"We met friends here for dinner and had a very good meal. Dad's Grocery Bag was a nice variety of items to share as an appetizer. I had the miso salmon with asparagus, and it was very good. My husband ordered the ribs and said the best ribs he'd had in some time, very tender. I also liked the fresh lemonade.   Our service was just OK for a restaurant with prices like these, which is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless we would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Passable, kinda quirky little place. Small but solid beer and wine list. The good food only gets better at happy hour prices. I'm partial to the cold-cuts & cheese plate."}
{"text":"What a beautiful and delish spot to dine and drink. My husband and I were drawn in because I love all things green and organic... But in addition to having organic and locally sourced dishes the staff is amazing. Amber, our beautiful, friendly and welcoming bartender gave us a sample of the sirloin chili... Yum!!! Give this place a try ASAP."}
{"text":"During our recent 4 nights in Scottsdale while staying in Kierland, we had the pleasure of eating at Grassroots. The menu was varied, but two items caught our attention; the blackened redfish, and the shrimp and jalapeno-cheese grits. More about the food in a sec, but the other highlight was our server Michelle. We wanted a nice slow, relaxing meal and she made that happen. She got my wife the cocktail (customized the way she likes it) knew the wine list and made a recommendation which was better than the wine I wanted to sample first, but she also knew the menu inside and out, and knew what went in to the making of each dish.  Now for the food: my wife's redfish was perfectly seasoned, spicy but not ridiculously so; just right. Now shrimp and grits is a real southern thing, and I try them anywhere I find them, and every place has their own unique way of doing them. In some places you get just shrimp and grits...kind of bland and boring, but not so at Grassroots. The shrimp are very nicely seasoned, and the grits are very mildly flavored with jalapeno, but the burst of flavor that pulled it all together is the andouille sausage gravy.  It was the best I've had anywhere.  Thanks Grassroots for a great evening."}
{"text":"Excellent service; delightful food. Had a healthy vegetable platter and cup of soup. Sounds sparse, not it was a terrific amount of food, thoughtfully prepared. Great friendly place. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday for lunch. Very friendly staff and great atmosphere.  I sat at the bar and Joe (Joseph?) took great care of me. He had some wonderful recommendations- one being their house made sangria which I ordered and it is delicious! They make it with on tap white wine, fresh squeezed lemonade and some other ingredients I can not recall. But it was very refreshing and tasty!  For food I ordered their chicken salad sandwich which was incredible!   Highly recommend this place. I will definitely be back with co-workers for lunch another day or after work drinks."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week was a 5 for taste and value.  Our table had short ribs and the barbecue ribs and chicken.   Huge tasty portions.  My husband said the short ribs were the best he has ever had; which is a strong statement from him.  The Poke was a great appetizer and I loved the key lime pie as a finish.  Also a great ambience."}
{"text":"Grassroots is always a solid choice whether for a meal with clients or a celebration with friends.   I always love the short ribs but last night I tried the Blackened Red Fish and I may have a new favorite."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The shrimp po-boy was piled high with tasty fried shrimp and the remoulade sauce was perfect. I crave this place at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for Mother's Day. We all enjoyed the food and great service. Will return again soon."}
{"text":"Came back with the s/o for dinner one night. I ordered the white sangria and the Spit Fire Chicken. I usually don't update my Yelp reviews, but I felt the spit fire chicken was SO good, the best chicken I've eaten in... probably literally years. I had to come back and talk about it.  It was tender, and the flavor somehow soaked all the way through even the breast. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water. The dirty orzo was also really good; a great twist on the usual dirty rice, as the orzo was a little chewier and more interesting texturally.  Man oh man, recommend."}
{"text":"I went here for my business trip and went here due to reviews in yelp. I had the pork chop and it was just ok. It was good but for the price, I know I could have eaten a way better pork chop. I think the pork chop was undercooked. As for the wait, considering I was just alone, it took them almost an hour for me to have a table after they initially just said 20 minutes wait time. I needed to follow up for my table which tells you that there is something wrong. I would probably try this again in the future to give it a chance but will try another dish."}
{"text":"The service was marginal. Our water glasses sat empty and our iced tea too. The manager asked us if we needed anything but never bring our requested items. I tried to get his attention a few times, but he mostly looked around and smiled at the waitstaff- not much help to the waiters. Our empty plates sat in front of us for a long time. I noticed the same thing at neighboring tables."}
{"text":"Cool little place to grab a quick bite. It was cute, great service. We definitely will be back. Presentation on the plates was what I expected it to be."}
{"text":"Good food, cute décor, great location, but definitely overpriced. We had the muffaletta (sp?) and a chicken and walnut salad, and both were very good, but they were $18 and $15, so kinda high for lunch. They have a good beer selection and happy hour deals, so I might return some day."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. From appetizer to dessert. I had the chicken and ribs for dinner. Service was excellent and it a great place for dinner. I will be back next time I come visit."}
{"text":"This is a great spot that was literally right around the corner from our hotel. They have a mix of seafood and bbq. We got some fun apps and happy hour drinks.  The best part was kids eat free during happy hour(3 to 6) when you purchase an adult entree. And every kids meal gets an ice cream from the sweet shop next door."}
{"text":"Grassroots bills itself as a modern elegant twist on southern cuisine.  From a decor and menu perspective, it hits on both notes.  Unfortunately, it misses badly on the food.  My wife ordered a salad with very lightly seared Ahi tuna.  While it looked great on paper, she found it relatively tasteless.  The tuna wasn't seasoned and the salad included goat cheese, radishes and field greens.  She indicated that since this was a special order, I shouldn't put too much weight on her dish.    One of our dinner guests ordered the poki appetizer.  I prefer poki to be lightly seasoned and leaning towards a citrus flavor.  This was sweet (IMO too sweet) and not particularly inspired.   My wife and I both agreed that we have had better at local fast food poki bars.  I ordered the lobster bisque appetizer and the shrimp and grits entree.  Unfortunately, both fell flat.  While the bisque was creamy and nicely seasoned, it didn't have that velvet feeling of a perfect bisque.  It was also missing any hint of lobster.  I know there are schools of thought that say you shouldn't have pieces of the protein in a bisque, I personally consider it a cardinal sin.    Another of our dinner guests ordered the short ribs.  I thought the rib was tasty but if I had to guess, it would have needed another couple of hours in the slow cooker.  It just wasn't sufficient tender.  My entree was the true disappointment of the evening.  For perspective, I love love love good grits.  I consider them the poor man's risotto.  They need to be cooked for the right amount of time and served immediately after cooking.  If you wait, they turn into a mushy paste.  That's where this dish started.  I never leave over grits and this time, I couldn't get past a few bits.  The dish actually went down hill from there.  The shrimp, which should have been the star of the show, were overcooked salt bombs.  I hungry enough to finish them but I'd never try them again nor would I recommend them.  This is not a particularly complex dish but it does require some care and timing. Neither was apparent last night.  Overall, the atmosphere is good and the service was solid. But the real reason you go to a restaurant is the food and Grassroots just didn't cut it last night."}
{"text":"omg !!!!!  what a fantastic place!!!!!    last time i was here i fell in love with greek town. love it!  so my plan was to go there tonight.  well they are on vacation.  i hit up yelp and found this amazing place!!!!!  5 stars all the way around!!!!!  i will be back when im in town again!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and very friendly service! My girlfriend and I ordered the club salad and the poke appetizer. The salad was delicious and the poke was super fresh! We had a chat with the manager, Travis, and he was wonderful to us.   P.S. if you like iced teas, the the pomegranate green tea!"}
{"text":"Impressed with the service and freshness of the food. I had the pastrami sandwich with a side of braised cabbage. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Grassroots Kitchen will not disappoint. They are up on all the modern food trends and service was overall very strong. I was visiting from out of town and decided to check them out based on a solid online reviews. The place appears to be a popular hangout, it was pretty busy when we got there despite showing availabilities at all times on Open Table. We had to wait about 20 minutes after our original reservation because they were seating an unusually large group, but the hostess was gracious and seated us on their very nice covered patio. Weather was great this time of year. Our waitress was similarly very friendly!   We started out with an order of their pork belly, which was excellent. They served it with candied pancetta on top, plus bread and a tomato jam that was excellent. GF got the Ahi Tuna for the main course, but I got the Braised Short Ribs based on the online recommendations. Let me tell you, make sure someone you are with orders this, it is superb. They put a bit too much sauce on it though. With meat like they made, they should let it shine without too many distractions. The jalapeno grits were similarly tasty, nice bite but not stupidly hot. Finally, the key lime pie was perfect. We went to another restaurant with twice the tab and the pie didn't touch the slice we shared at Grassroots.    Eating as a couple, the whole meal plus two draught beers cost us about $82, which for the quality of the food was very fair. Great food with a fair price, and good service, that's five stars in my book."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an early dinner last Sunday, grilled Miso Salmon was fabulous.  Definitely a fan of this place, looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is our first visit to this restaurant and we are very impressed!! The lunch atmosphere is very inviting, the bar is centralized to the open room without being overwhelming and there is also outside seating. We were sat at a booth by the Windows and was very lovely spot. All kinds of cook books and food books are on display to read while waiting for drinks and food. Our server, Dylan, was very attentive and prompt with drink refills and was overall very friendly which was really refreshing! He surprised us with a delicious treat to share after lunch as well! We look forward to trying their dinner menu when we're back in the area. This place is a MUST of you love fresh tasty food and a relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my 3 star is based on comparison to other places I go and not an indication of poor quality or bad service. The overall quality was good, and the service was excellent. So why the low rating?  I think other reviewers must not get out a lot. Grass Roots is just average for similar places and overrated compared to like priced  restaurants. For the same cost you can go to Lons at the Hermosa Inn and get much more value. Grass Roots does a good job and you probably will not be disappointed but  they are over priced for what they deliver.  I have been there twice, once mid afternoon for Key lime pie and coffee and this time for lunch with business associates for lunch. The Key Lime pie was wonderful but not worth that cost, the wait staff was fun and attentive, and the coffee was good but cold on delivery. And we were the only people in the place. But it was about 3:00 pm so that is not an issue.   Lunch was OK. I ordered coffee from a very fun waitress as did my associate. The coffee had to be returned because it was again cold. To their credit they remade fresh coffee and their coffee is good. I asked if they had whole chilies and I was told they have Poblano chilies so I asked them to put a chili on a burger and serve it with no bun. The waitress came back and said they could not give me the chili but they could put Halapenos on it. I declined those and asked to just serve their normal burger with no bun medium well.   I got a diminutive burger, like a fast food place, cooked hard. It was very good but for $11.00 I anticipated something more substantial. Compared to let's say Rosy McAfery and their wonderfull  pub burger. Much bigger, much better and half the cost.  The fries are really good and I ate every one of them.  All four of us got fed, the food was good, the atmosphere was conducive to conversation and the service was excellent but the place was not even half full at lunch and it was expensive.  So you will not hate it, but you can get much more value at several places in that area because 20th Street and Camelback is cluttered with good to wonderful restaurants."}
{"text":"One of the better restaurants in town. Southern influenced  solid American food with great service and amazing dinner and desserts. Ribs are good but brisket is the way to go..."}
{"text":"Yum!! My husband and I came in for a late lunch and were extremely impressed! This place is in a bit of a dingy strip mall, but don't let the exterior steer you away, it is very well done inside!  I had the club house salad and my husband had the brisket sandwich, both to die for!! We also finished with the key lime pie.... Holy cow. Everyone needs this!!! First of all, the slice was huge, and second, best key lime pie I've had.   Let me repeat, get the key lime pie!!  We sat at the bar and the bartender's name was Corrine. She was extremely friendly and nice. Great server.   Food came out quickly, large glass of wine... What more could you need? ;)  Couldn't say one bad thing about this place!"}
{"text":"Healthy and clean-eating options available at Grassroots. Their menu isn't huge, but does cover small plates, sandwiches, entrees, etc. I tried their Angus Cheeseburger w/shoestring fries and it didn't disappoint.   Prices are high, in my opinion, but the quality is there. Location is prime being on Hayden (south of Shea Blvd).  Our server was helpful and checked in frequently with us.   Grassroots is sort of a plain-Jane type of restaurant with sort of a \"vanilla\" type of personality, which normally annoys me. It does. But - today, it worked and it was actually refreshing and quite soothing."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to go to.  The hostess welcomes you very kindly in, & thanks you for visiting the restaurant, which I have never heard of before but found to be very pleasant.  My waitress was on point with taking my order & handling special requests.  I had a pomegranate iced tea, smoked brisket sandwich (with baked beans as a chosen side), & a toffee brownie.  The sbs was cooked very well, though I recommend leaving the toothpick in the sandwich as some may fall onto the plate.  This is a good place to bring a group or a date, even if the prices are slightly higher than I would have liked."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  My first time there. I explained to them I am a foodie and Yelper. Our young waitress gave us a menu to keep and photograph.  She offered her opinion on several items. I think maybe you should try everything on the menu. we ordered 5 different items to get a taste of several dishes. All of it was so great. Pig, yep they have pork fat, bacon, pieces of tasty pig.  If you don't want pig they have veggies.  Tons of veggies, beats, which I love. Just go there and eat.  We were given free desert to try.  I usually never order desert but it would be rude to not accept.  It was a Key-Lime cheese cake.  I liked it but expressed, I prefer it more tart with more lime pulp or flavor. If it don't make ya pucker... They made certain we had a good meal and great service.  I will go back again.  I was also informed they offer discounts on wines at certain times.  We went for brunch and I got an espresso which had superb flavor."}
{"text":"We visited Grassroots Kitchen and found the food to be good- The Halibut special was delicious as were the baby back ribs.   I am only giving three starts because there were just a couple of weird controlling things. We walked in 7 min late (the hostess told us how late we were after I apologized for our tardiness) and then informed us that next time we should really call because at 15 min late our table would be given away. It was just a little weird and felt like we were being chastised. There is also a note on the menu to silence our cell phones and our waitress seemed to have a certain order that she was supposed to take our order in. These are all small seemingly insignificant things that didn't impact the quality of the food or our overall experience but just a little on the strange side..."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and it was amazing! We got some \"share plates\" since it was just a lunch and oh my God! Wow. I mean I was blown away at the flavor. Brother's spicy slaw and shoe string fries  did i mention it was cheat day? and my boyfriend had jalapeno cheddar cheese grits and he said they were \"f****** amazing\" now on top of the food being perfect the service was outstanding. Kate was just a real treat, breath of fresh air, kind, knowledgeable of the menu. Even if the food was bad if go back to see Kate. What a doll!  Veggie options always important. Just a true treat! You won't be disappointed here  can't wait to go for dinner and try that wine list!"}
{"text":"Ambiance definitely New Orleans and cool Rolling Stone mag covers in bathroom.  Went to this restaurant because it came up in Yelp as top 10 vegetarian restaurants in Scottsdale.  Some vegetarian items but very limited.  Had reservations outside had to wait for inside table.  Another larger party near us had same experience and were very unhappy and loud about.  Place was packed so I will give that to it but I'm not rushing back.  Server was great and had a passion for what she did."}
{"text":"We moved away from Phoenix a year ago and I constantly about this restaurant. It was our favorite place to eat and we always took our out of town guests here. Today, we were able to make a detour on our trip to eat lunch here and I was reminded why it's my favorite. Our server Kaitlyn (and all other servers we have had in the past) was exceptional--attentive, friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. Kaitlyn took great care of us today which was much appreciated after living in a small town that lacks such fantastic service.   We ordered our two favorite meals and they were perfect as usual. I got the seared ahi tuna sandwich and my fiancé got the braised short ribs and grits. We had to share with each other because we couldn't decide which to get. We don't even normally like grits, but the ones here are just incredible. Trust me, give them a try! The menu has something for everyone and the farm to table aspect means everything is super fresh. They care about the ingredients that go into the food and it comes through.   We finished it off with some pumpkin pie, which came highly recommended--best pumpkin pie ever, period, end of story. Friends bought a whole one for Thanksgiving.  All their pies are clearly homemade and I am ashamed to admit I've eaten a whole lemon icebox pie in just a couple days!! If you have room, get dessert you won't regret it. Worth every calorie."}
{"text":"Can I give them more than 5 stars? This is mine and my boyfriend's favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Whenever we have friends or family in town we make sure to take them here for a fantastic meal. Between the two of us we have tried most everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. Our favorite is probably the short ribs and jalapeno grits--let me tell you I don't even like grits or jalapenos normally, but I crave these ones! Their salads are also great--if you get chicken on it, they use their roasted chicken which is so flavorful. We always leave here too full for dessert sadly though because dessert is just as good as their entrees. I really can't say enough good things about Grassroots."}
{"text":"We have been here many times for happy hour or dinner.  Food is good.  Service is excellent. Tonight my husband and I were racially profilled at the bar. My husband is very Italian and can be boisterous and fun,  however tonight we were having a quiet drink. After 2 rounds the operations manager for Grass Roots, Wally's Gastoro pub ( yuk) and Twisted Grove cut my husband off. We were sitting quietly at the bar. The bartenders had no idea what was  going on and were as surprised as we were! Bottom line is I  would not spend money at any establishment owed by Chris Collins. I am sure his father, the REAL WALLY and a great host is horribly disappointed. Go to Zipps. Much friendlier!!!"}
{"text":"Ok service, great atmosphere and ambiance and exceptional food.  Loved this place and will come back, but the waiters need to pay attention to their customers."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! The portobello sandwich is absolutely amazing!! I'm so stoked about finding this place!! On Fridays they have the Lobster bisque soup! A must try!!"}
{"text":"I will begrudgingly give the food here 3 stars because it's pretty good, especially the fish.  Very nice piece of salmon. But it's overpriced  Here's the rub: I've never had a friendly server or bartender here in my life. That's about 10 visits or so, and the last visit WILL BE THE LAST VISIT!  Why so glum, chum?  Let's be real: Grassroots is, in reality, a deluxe Applebee's. But you'll get friendlier service at Applebee's.    Better yet, Keegan's. It's Keegan's at a 25% premium. Down the block, 32nd and Camelback."}
{"text":"Call ahead for reservations, person on phone says we don't take call a heads, ask projected wait time if we arrive, person says can not state a certain time, I say just a ball park, can not tell you,  we show up place as least half empty, I ask for big booth sitting there empty, that's. for 6. I tell them we have badly handicapped person and require the space, if we cab have that place we will dine there, if not we will not, they say ok, I atate I. Tried to make a reservation and no reservations, they say yes we do,  I go out to get my guests and when we return different person starts to argue about the booth. The wrong meal brought for one of orders, frys hard and burned, what a disaster 20% tip given I am a sap.  Bye bye!"}
{"text":"Grassroots is my favorite in Scottsdale. Grassroots has a varied menu and over the past 12-months, I have never had the same entree twice and have never been disappointed. When we have guests staying with us from out of town, Grassroots is our default choice as they seem to have something on the menu that appeals to everyone - be they young, vegetarian or just difficult to please. The service is also wonderfully helpful. We had a 13-year old who was unsure about whether to order something on the menu and our waitress told her \"don't worry; if you don't like it, I'll get you something else.\"   PS She loved it."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant in the neighborhood. It's hard to find a place in the valley that serves shrimp and grits. Not only do the serve it but it is absolutely amazing. Last night I painstakingly tried something different. I ordered the sashimi ahi tuna salad. I have a hard time trying something new when I have something like the shrimp and grits that I love so much. Anyway, it was a good decision as it was outstanding as well. Now I have something on the lighter side as well. Skip desert at Grassroots amen stop next door at there sister property Sweet Provisions for desert. Outstanding as well!"}
{"text":"This place is always so comfortable, with friendly staff and amazing food and drinks!  My go-to menu items are the Blackened Fish Sandwich and the Southern Shrimp and Grits. They also have some excellent specials. I had the prime rib special during my most recent visit. It was an amazingly flavorful piece of beef cooked to perfectly. I always order my prime rib rare so I can warm my leftovers up to medium rare at home, but there were no leftovers this time! Yum!"}
{"text":"Had the brisket, which was super tender. It came with tasty jalapeño white cheddar grits and pork belly baked beans. My mom had the lobster bisque and enjoyed her meal. Will go back here next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"While staying at the nearby Marriott Courtyard on a business trip, my colleague and I decided to pop in for a quick dinner. We were very pleasantly surprised with this place! It's in a pretty nondescript outdoor mall that does seem to have a few nice little restaurants sprinkled in with big box stores and a Whole Foods.  We were seated at a comfortable booth, surrounded by what I'd call 'modern farmhouse' decor - wood, metal, modern and rustic at the same time. We thoroughly enjoyed the charred brussel sprouts appetizer (despite it being served on a plank, pouring out of a mason jar. c'mon guys), and I LOVED the shrimp & grits. So flavorful, spicy, buttery, and delicious! Will definitely be a repeat stop next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Really close to my office and awesome for lunch. I have not tried their dinner yet but hear great things. Patio is very dog friendly which Ziggy loves and the Tune Poke appetizer is amazing! You won't regret it, fresh, delicious food served with a smile every time."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Phoenix! Love the burrata appetizer and get it every time I go! Also they always have great desserts!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat. Ordered the shrimp po'boy. OMG! The shrimp were cooked to perfection, the bread was fresh and tasty and the sauce was a tantalizing treat for the tastebuds! Marina was our waitress and she was wonderful! My wife had the chicken walnut salad with a side of asparagus. She said it was simply the best! Great atmosphere and music!"}
{"text":"Was here in November for a company brunch. The food was really good.. I can't get enough of the Jalepeno Cheddar Grits! We ordered 3 deserts: Banana Creme and Pumpkin pies and a Fudge/chocolate /icecream delight-ful-thing! The Banana pie was EXCEPTIONAL!! Will be back to the Scottsdale location for sure."}
{"text":"Had a great casual lunch with the girls today; the presentation was fabulous, our wait staff was friendly without being overbearing, and my brisket sandwich was big enough to have half left over for dinner.  Definitely a place I'll go back to."}
{"text":"Went to the Phoenix location. It is a true Valley find. Food was interestingly prepared, delicious & piping hot. Service was exceptional. We had the tuna, short ribs & brisket. It would be hard to say which was best. And, the desserts was equally fabulous."}
{"text":"Wow, let's just talk about Grassroots for a moment. This is easily the best restaurant in the entire Scottsdale area. What makes it so great you ask? Impeccable service down to the tiniest detail, incredible food that makes you salivate at every bite, and an intense atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Each and everyone of my needs were met, and the host (Jack) greeted me with utmost and genuine respect. Definitely get the Carolina Baby Back Ribs, so good. Also, make sure you inquire about desserts - as they were fantastic. Just woah, I am utterly speechless."}
{"text":"OMG. Five stars, fifty stars. Perfection. Open, clean great specials, fresh local food. Great, friendly service. Bar is in center of the restaurant so you can people watch. There were a lot of dating couples there, siting together and looking out from the booths at everyone else. It was people-watching paradise! But more importantly, their food was super. We started with the chopped salad, had so much in it hard to remember it all. Beets, squash, cabbage, veggies galore... crazy good. The pub board item \"My Fathers Grocery Bag\" or some such,  was great. Assorted cheeses and olives, nuts. My friend got a fish sandwich, which she liked but I did not try. We saw so many things we wanted to try that we promised we would stop here next time we drive by and try something else on the menu. The bartender was great, on top of things and very friendly."}
{"text":"Grassroots is my long time favorite.  Wonderful team service which sets the standard for Scottsdale dining.  Great food too.  Comfort food.  Always leave smiling.  Am sitting now at its sister restaurant Twisted Root.  Another FANTASTIC entry into the Scottsdale dining scene.  Thanks, Chris, for another hit!  Holy cow, which do I choose?"}
{"text":"What a find.  Our first visit but certainly not our last. Our server Marina made this a really great experience. So helpful and her meal recommendations were perfect. The food was fresh and flavorful and the menu was a refreshing change from typical Scottsdale experiences. Highly recommended. Thanks Grassroots. Thanks Marina. We will be back...with friends!"}
{"text":"Great food, good date night type place.  I wish i wrote this review earlier, my wife and I went here awhile ago and to be honest I don't remember much about the food besides the fact that we both got different sandwiches they had. It was a good amount of food, not to stuff you, but not to leave you wanting to order 5 more things to satisfy yourself.  I do remember we enjoyed going there and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I love the original Grassroots on Hayden in Scottsdale and was super excited when another location popped up. My husband and I were in the area, so we decided to check this location out. We were not disappointed!   I ordered my usual - the brisket sandwich with a side of dirty orzo. I dream about this sandwich and it really hit the spot. My husband ordered the lobster bisque and then he helped finish off my sandwich.   Since it was lunchtime, they were super packed but we were given the option to sit at the bar. Sitting at the bar was perfect. We got our food quickly, our server was super friendly, and we had a great time.   Overall, I love Grassroots. I'm glad they opened another location so more people can try their amazing food. If I'm in the area, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Grassroots Kitchen and their food. I originally found out about them from Yelp and I was not disappointed. My first visit was for happy hour with my husband. They have great happy hour food and drinks from 3-6pm. During happy hour, signature cocktails are $6 and some appetizers are discounted.   For drinks, we both ordered their signature margarita. Let's just say it was a lot of margarita. For appetizers, we ordered Dad's Grocery Bag which came with a loaf of French bread, three cheeses, three cured meats, nuts and local honey for $10. We also ordered the \"boat load of wings\" which is 1.5 pounds of chicken wings/drumsticks for $5 - a great deal! For our entrée, we split Topher's Braised Short Ribs which comes with asparagus and jalapeno grits. The Grocery bag was delicious - especially the meats and cheeses. The bread was a little on the hard side and I was expecting olives, but not a big deal. The wings were delicious with a sweet BBQ sauce. Definitely a lot of food, but we managed to polish them off. The short ribs were really good - both juicy and tender. The jalapeno grits were good, nice and spicy from the jalapeno, but grits aren't my favorite. We wished we had room for dessert because the key lime pie sounded yummy.    We loved Grassroots so much that we came back for lunch. We came around 1pm on a Friday and it wasn't very busy. They were able to sit us right away and our waitress was quick to take our orders. For a starter, we ordered the pork belly which comes with spicy tomato jam, candied pancetta, and toast points. My husband LOVES pork belly and orders it no matter where we are. This pork belly was delicious, but a little on the dry side. I loved the pancetta, but they aren't really \"candied\" so much as drenched in maple syrup. It's cool since it was still delicious. For my entrée, I ordered the smoked brisket sandwich with dirty orzo. Oh my goodness. I am in love with this sandwich. The brisket melted in my mouth. I am craving it just writing this review! The dirty orzo was also delicious which a myriad of flavors. (Also makes a great snack the next day.) My husband ordered the shrimp po'boy with shoestring potatoes. The po'boy was on a French baguette and while delicious, I found it difficult to take a bite when I sampled it. My husband loved it and enjoyed the shrimp greatly. I can't wait to come back for lunch and get the brisket sandwich again.  Our third visit was for dinner on a Wednesday evening. Soup of the day for Wednesday is Grassroots Gumbo so we ordered a bowl to split. We also ordered the pork belly appetizer and decided to split the short ribs, which was a good idea because everything was so delicious and filling. The Gumbo was amazing with super tender chicken and spicy sausage. I want to come back every night for this Gumbo, that's how good it was!   Overall, I would highly recommend Grassroots. Definitely come check it out. Whether it's lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food! I recommend the salmon appetizer and the farm fresh vegetable dish or the shrimp&grits. Everything tastes fresh :)"}
{"text":"Food here is always really good. You can tell they use quality ingredients. I haven't had anything I haven't liked. Service and atmosphere is also really good. My personal favorites are the smoked salmon and the shrimp po-boy. If you're a gin fan, I recommend trying their gimlet!"}
{"text":"Seated promptly and our waitress gave us the scoop saying this place was as good as New Orleans. Wrong people to say that too unless it was true! Ordered the shrimp and grits which was good but not great, but the true failure was that the food was not served hot. I ordered the Roti & Ribs, food was good but again not hot. No second trip for this foodie"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for dinner based on proximity to my hotel, and Yelp reviews.  I'm sooooo happy I did.  I was in Scottsdale for the night on business and stopped into Grassroots with no expectations.  It was a Tuesday night and the place was surprisingly pretty packed.  I found the one lone seat at the bar and was promptly greeted by a friendly bartender.    I saw the couple next to me order a cup of soup and it looked good (I'm a creepy food peeper), so I decided to try it.  The soup of the day was Chicken Tortilla.  I was planning on picking the tortilla strips out, but there was cheese stuck to them and I couldn't fathom wasting cheese, so I took one for the team and ate them.  The soup was seriously to die for.  As I was eating it, I was texting a friend and explaining how I would be bathing in that soup if hadn't just showered.  THAT's how good it was.    I also tried the Cardiff salad which was a chopped salad with shrimp.  It was one of the best salads I've ever had.  I went in there starving, and could only finish half the salad.  It was loaded with shrimp, and the dressing was amazing.  The atmosphere is classy and trendy, the staff is super efficient and pleasant.  If I'm back in the area, I will definitely re-visit."}
{"text":"Every time my girlfriend and I visit Pizzeria Bianco, we can't help but notice Grassroots. I've always wanted to give them a try, as it always seems to have a fair amount of customers dining both inside and out on the patio area. Reviews were decent, so our expectations were reasonably high.  Unfortunately, after experiencing Grassroots once, it reminds me of a lot of trendy places in Phoenix that place too much emphasis on ambiance and not enough emphasis on the food itself. Another reviewer described this restaurant as \"pointless,\" which I feel is a pretty good adjective to sum up my thoughts. In short, it's just simply not my style.  The food isn't necessarily Southern comfort food, but food that is Southern-influenced, if that makes any sense. Maybe it's a slightly more modernized version, while throwing in a lot of wines and locally crafted beers that seem to be mandatory at most \"hip\" places these days.  We started with the creamy burrata, which drops a Scottsdale zip code in its title. I'm assuming this is a reference to its original source? The burrata is served with a spicy tomato jam, a consistency that is typically reserved for fruits (as it should be). We didn't like it. Not because it tasted bad. It just simply didn't taste like anything! I scooped some on my knife and asked my girlfriend if she could detect any flavor whatsoever. She couldn't. Nor could I.  It's not even in the same league as the burrata served at nearby Federal Pizza. Hell, we'd be better off smuggling in some generic cream cheese! The spicy tomato jam was just flat out bizarre. Think of the familiar jam consistency, only with a ketchup-like flavor that includes a bit of spice. It's different, but it just seemed wrong.  For entrees, I ordered the braised short ribs, which came with a little asparagus and the ever-so-popular jalapeno cheese grits. For 24 dollars, the serving size was pretty stingy. The ribs tasted fine. The mouthfuls of fat I ended up chewing up whole on a handful of bites? Not so much. The grits were basically your standard grits with a bit of jalapeno flavor in them. Their novelty wore off after a couple of bites and I didn't finish them.    My girlfriend ordered the shrimp po 'boy, which she said didn't have as much flavor as she expected. The fries, which I did sample, seemed to have an odd aftertaste which I'm pretty sure was the result of the oil that was being used that completely killed off any potential potato flavor.    Okay, so I'm not completely cynical. The chocolate toffee brownie was excellent, so that's one offering that I feel warrants some praise. Not enough to where I'd ever go back, but enough to where I'd definitely recommend it. It tasted like it was brought to our table immediately after being pulled from the oven.      I really wanted to like this place. The service was fine, but I guess the food just wasn't for us.  As previously stated, the place just seems kind of . . . pointless.  On a more positive note, my little chihuahua and I argued endlessly over the quality of the short ribs. He claims they're top notch, as evidence by how quickly he devoured my remnants. I still maintain that they're rubbish - but whatever.  Agree to disagree."}
{"text":"We were given a gift card and so it was a great chance to try Grassroots.  We will definitely be back!  The food was great and our service was fantastic.  The kids even eat free during their social hour with the purchase of an entree.  I can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place Based in previous reviews and the menu. Unfortunately disappointed greatly. We were in a mini vacation trip and ordered a cocktail and appetizer. The appetizer never showed and when our entrees came out they said they could bring the appetizer as well as \"it was taking longer\". Having worked in restaurants and now in the hospitality industry, this is inexcusable. The quality of the staff undermines what could be a good restaurant. When will people learn what working in the hospitality industry means.   Unfortunately this took a nice date night to a poor experience due to lack of preparation, detail and training. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour drinks and sat at the bar. The vibe is casual and yet nice at the same time. We had really attentive service from the two bartenders. Everyone seemed to be regulars there. I got Georgia Sweet Tea cocktail which had peach purée and sweet tea and vodka. It was great and not too sweet. For my second drink I got a white chocolate martini, also great! Tasted like alcoholic ice cream. We had a good time and will be back."}
{"text":"A five star very rare for me, so this is already rare atmosphere . Loved this spot. Very comfortable, neighborhood feeling. Just the right mix of informality and formality for me. High energy but not overly loud. Genuinely friendly, efficient and proud staff. Now for the food. Unusual menu although plenty of usual favorites. Loved the southern influence, e.g. Yummy cheese grits. Good very fresh, eg asparagus. Entrees very well spiced. One of the few places where you wonder if you could do as well at home. I had short ribs with wonderful Hoishin sauce. My wife had equally tasty brisket. One of the few restaurants I could return to night after night"}
{"text":"LOVE THESE WINGS!! free range, all-natural, college educated chicken is what makes these wings so special!!  Yes the wings are small because no hormones have been fed to these birds but the flavor and tenderness just can't be beat.  At just $5 during 'social hour 'for a 1.5 lb pile makes this the best wing deal in the valley. Had the ribs and chicken with pork belly appetizer!  Both were fantastic!! Grilled asparagus is a really nice side and it's very lightly seasoned, tastes great!  Service is 5 star every time!!   FYI: (Pancetta, the Italian version of bacon, is made by seasoning a pork belly side with salt and lots of pepper, curling it into a tight roll, and wrapping it in a casing to hold the shape. It's cured, but it isn't smoked.)"}
{"text":"Consistency, Value, Service! Great food in a comfortable setting. We often get an entree to go and it's always delicious. That's a true challenge Tonight, it was a shrimp PO Boy with a side of Grassroots orzo. Grassroots Kitchen is not only a bona fide contender, you'll be satisfied you chose to get into their ring! Order something from their tap! Cheers"}
{"text":"We went for lunch for the first time and were pleasantly surprised at how delicious our sandwiches were. We got shrimp po' boy and blacked fish sandwiches and both couldn't have been better! The jalapeño cheese grits on the side were delicious. Staff was friendly and the place and atmosphere were very nice."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! LOVE this place. The food is awesome. I like the atmosphere the best, very inviting and after you eat here you won't be disappointed. I shall be back again and again!"}
{"text":"great service, Ahi Tuna salad is perfect.  Location is great with fair outdoor seating.   Short rib are excellent."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a group of coworkers last night and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere of the place was very nice and I really liked the large booths near the back. They had a very good selection of Specialty cocktails including a delicious Manhattan.   Everyone very much enjoyed their meals from the ribs to the burgers to the special of the night the Scallops over jalapeno Grits. The scallops were some of the best I have had ever and the grits(not normally something I enjoy) were amazing. Licked the plate clean!"}
{"text":"Do not support this business. Their food is ok (they made a mistake on my order and the food I got was cold - fortunately they remade it after waiting another 20 min) but I saw the way they treat their employees and it is NOT OK..  This area has some great restaurants, give another one a shot instead! You'll be happy you did"}
{"text":"Had date night with the misses and decided to give this place a try and boy were we damn glad we did. The food was so good we can't wait to go back! We started with prosciutto wrapped asparagus which were perfectly grilled. The asparagus still had a little snap to them. So good. The wife had the grilled miso glazed salmon and said it was off the hook. No pun intended. I had the chicken and rib plate with beans and Cole slaw. Damn that was good. Chicken was seasoned beautifully and the ribs were fall off the bone tender. The star was the oh so good slaw. Crunchy, tangy, and sweet. Perfectly dressed. Finished the evening off with the warm brownie with ice cream. It was drizzled in Carmel and sprinkled with toffee. Duhamm We were also fortunate to have Jess as our server. She was the best."}
{"text":"Get the jalapeno cheddar grits. You will NOT be disappointed. Tasty food. Little on pricey side but it's Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I came here on suggestion of someone in an office I was visiting while in town on business.  I must say, I'm impressed.  Prices are reasonable, food is delicious, atmosphere is fun and modern.  I might make this a regular thing every time I come to town (which is looking like once every 3 months).  Dish ordered was the Spit fire roasted free-range chicken with dirty orzo.  The orzo was amazing.  Lots of flavor and just yum.  Made me really pause to really taste it despite how hungry I was.  The chicken is juicy, tasty and just wow.  You get basically half a chicken minus the wing.  The chicken is served on top of a slice of thick buttered Texas toast.  Until next time!  I can't wait to try something else."}
{"text":"I love going to Grassroots for lunch!  The atmosphere is always buzzing (they do take reservations, and I highly recommend making them) and the food is consistently good.  I like to go on Friday's in particular because they have their special Omega 3 Salmon burger that day.  Fresh salmon with arugula, avocado and aoili on a flax-seed bun with your choice of side (if they have the grilled broccoli that day it is a must order) - a super yummy lunch without the heavy guilt!  Service is also impeccable and I've yet to have a server that I didn't enjoy.  I will say though, I do get extra excited when I get to sit in Sarah's section; she's very knowledgeable about the food, incredibly upbeat, and has a great sense of humor :)  If you get a chance to sit in her section you won't be disappointed.  Can't wait to go back for another stellar lunch experience soon!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for lunch today. The menu has so many options but got stuck on the shrimp and grits. They were fantastic.   The key lime pie was very yummy and perfect on the hot day.   Staff was wonderful from the moment we walked in till our departure. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant!  There was five of us and we all ordered something different.  The meat on the ribs literally fell off the bone. No knife required! The special with scallops and their specialized grits was great.  Another had the beef brisket sliders and shrimp with grits.  I has the salmon and ceasar salad.  All excellent.  Oh and the brownie was huge with homemade vanilla bean ice cream for dessert was delicious!  Adam was our server, and he was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went to Grassroots with a large group today and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was great as was the service.  There were 16 in our group and our servers got everything correct which is a challenge for a large group.  We had separate checks and all was correct.  They treated us so nice.  The one thing was parking.  It can be difficult at the Hayden location but it is worth it."}
{"text":"came here for lunch yesterday with a colleague and client. excellent lunch spot. it was 95 degrees and we had to sit outside, not that inside was much cooler as the restaurant is fairly open, but it actually wasn't bad because the overhang blocks out a lot of the sun's heat. this is coming from someone who acts like it's the 28th day when it's hot. no Aunt Flo visiting today tho.  I had the tuna ahi sandwich and it was good af. then my colleague talked me into getting the caramel banana split (because it was apparently Nat'l Dessert Day and I do desserts better than Debbie did Dallas.) I murdered it. I'm leaving AZ tomorrow before they find me..."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. This place is both elegant and warm. We had a ladies lunch there with eight women and they really took care of us. My cousin, who has some pretty extreme food allergies, was approached by the manager several times to assure they were meeting her health requirements while also being able to throughly enjoy her meal. The manager was great! The portions are large and delicious. I ordered their ahi salad and it was a great choice. Even got a side of fries, which are thin and savory. Dip them in the sauce that comes with their Po Boy and you have an explosion of flavors. Would 100% recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews did not disappoint us. We had the pork belly and burrata. Both were perfect and super delicious!"}
{"text":"Living down the street, the wife and I have wanted to try this place for a long time.  My parents visiting town for her birthday proved to be the perfect occasion  We started with the dad's grocery bag appetizer which was an excellent start   I had the ribs, which were so tender I didn't need a knife, they split once the fork hit. The jalepeno grits were also a nice addition    For desert the key lime pie was a very refreshing treat. Everyone was also raving about the coffee which was  fantastic and came with a very real cream.  Our server Jake was wonderful- prompt, friendly, kept my soda full and made good recommendations.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Grassroots is a great place that we first tried 3 years ago. Just as good today. Chris truly made the experience even better. He's got great recommendations and is a class act. Come too grassroots and ask for Chris. He's the best!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here yesterday after a recommendation from a friend. It was one of the best experiences we have had eating out in a long time. Our waitress, Christina, was genuinely nice and gave excellent service. I would recommend the scallops with grits, the ribs and the chop salad. We will surely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Went to Grassroots for Happy Hour. Was pleasantly surprised, we had a couple of $4 craft brews that were priced right and delicious.  Also ordered the BBQ brisket sliders and the burrata appetizer. Everything was fresh and tasty. Would definitely go back for happy hour or dinner. Their menu looked interesting. Service was great and we loved sitting out on the nice patio."}
{"text":"This is was my very first time in Arizona so while browsing Yelp, I came across this gem in Scottsdale.  I sat at the bar because i came alone and Kate, amazing bartender, helped me out. She was very energetic and bubbly. Kate makes THE BEST Cadillac Margarita.   I started off with the Prosciutto Wrapped Asparagus....INCREDIBLE. And I had the Short Ribs  for my entrée....DIVINE."}
{"text":"Didn't get beyond drinks at Grassroots which is unfortunate. First they had two booths available but refused to let us sit there because they don't let reserve booths ...well except if you happen to be a bigger party. We waited at the bar and when a booth was available but the hostess didn't offer to help carry very full drinks. (And told us to clear the bar tab which we actually didn't have to ). I mentioned to her that it's good customer service to help carry drinks and them she went to the other hostess and was laughing about my comments. I requested to talk to the manager (whom happened to be the owner) and whom came with an attitude. He said he hadn't trained his staff to do that and he saw his restaurant as a neighborhood restaurant. Not sure what that had to do with good customer service and it did't help when he impatiently tapped his hand while talking to us. First don't be be defensive about feedback. Second, listen with the intent of caring about the customer. Lastly, aspire to be something great rather than average for your customer..   We instead went to Pig. & Pickle and had fabulous food AND customer service. We won't ever go to Grassroots and I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"Grassroots is a Southern-influenced American cuisine restaurant.  Came here on a Saturday evening for dinner and it was packed.  Make sure to make an OpenTable reservation.  Our waiter was friendly and very patient with our large group.  I have to give him kudos for his positive attitude and professionalism.  For appetizers, we shared the pork belly.  It has six large pieces accompanied with crusty bread and a great spicy tomato jam.  I really liked this.  My friend had the Dad's Grocery bag and they must of liked it cause it was gone pretty fast.  For entrees, our waiter recommended the Root's BBQ Brisket.  It came with five thick slices of brisket (doesn't look like your typical BBQ beef brisket) but it was very tender and moist.  The BBQ sauce was good as well as the cheddar grits.  My other friends enjoyed their entrees as well.   They had a pretty good selection of draft beers.  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Good, but overrated. If you're going to try it, don't sit on the patio, regardless of weather. Its like sitting on the side of a freeway- that loud. Though disguised with bushes, Hayden Road is a six lane thoroughfare, less than 20 feet away. Motorcycles, loud muffler pipes, sirens, you name it, we could hardly talk. The menu choices are good, the food was prepared well and delivered promptly. Entrees are all ala-carte. Not sure why, this place just didn't want to give us water to drink along with our beer and wine. Asked once at the bar when ordering our first round, no luck, then at the table had to ask twice. Maybe they don't like doing the dishes. Then they brought a small highball glass with water, no ice, never refilled, and only brought it to two of us. That isn't good service.  Waiter recommended the short ribs with asparagus. It was ok- two small sprigs of asparagus is more decoration than accompaniment. Two of us ordered the baby back ribs- nothing remarkable and neither were the fries. Key lime pie had zero flavor, tasted like it was straight off the Sysco Frozen Foods truck. There are so many other good choices in Scottsdale, so pass. Note to owner: that huge Tea Party flag on the wall by the hostess is absolutely offensive."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Grassroots and my fiancé's first time.  This was another great experience for me and my fiancé loved it as well.  Top notch service all the way from being greeted at the front door to on our way out the door.  Our waiter Kirby was friendly, efficient and outgoing.  The appetizer order somehow did not go through the computer to the chef so the manager came to our table right away to let us know what happened.  He also made it right by giving us the appetizer for free.  That is something all restaurants should take note of.  They admitted right away they made a mistake (really I think it was the computer), they came right over to let us know and gave us the appetizer for free...that's how you treat customers!  We appreciated the respect and kindness.  We will definitely being going back."}
{"text":"Still good.  Servers are changing over and the bar attention was kind of blah compared to before. Eat here often!!!"}
{"text":"they went out of their way to make our stay as amazing as possible.  they accommodated a party of 12 without batting an eye and comped us appetizers and deserts without us even asking.  seriously a class act all the way"}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh, farm to table food.  Every employee there has been fantastic and down to earth.  I highly recommend this place for a laid back healthy spot!"}
{"text":"Having dined here at least four times, twice at the bar, once at patio area, and once at an indoor table, I have to say that dining at the bar is the way to go.  It's livelier at the bar, as I may keep to myself, or chat with the people sitting next to me, which is what I did this afternoon!  I wasn't sure I'd dine in, but I knew I wanted to take home one of Grassroots homemade Coconut cream pie ($20). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=Z6WQVZ0It7zIJ8J6ePmwvw  Yessir!  One whole pie, please!  The bartender sounded so surprised!  He tried to get me to buy the pumpkin pie, as well (I'd called earlier to find out what the Pie of the Day was, and I was told there were two, so I was hoping to let fate decide...), but since pumpkin pie will have its spotlight in about fifteen days, I decided I'd go with the coconut, which was also what bartender said he'd rather have.    I decided I'd enjoy a $6 glass (during hh) of a Georgia Iced Tea (360 peach vodka, Appleton rum, peach puree, lemonade, and iced tea; SO good!) and try the $14 plate of Smoked Brisket, pickles on the side, please! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=50beHLTdqnZc1r2dRWtY3w  The cherry- and applewood-smoked brisket came with BBQ'd slaw, mayo, and local pickle chips (but not mine!) on a French baguette.  It was very tasty, but I kept wishing that the French baguette was more crisped on the outside.  The bread's texture felt like it was steamed-- too soft.  I originally ordered the sandwich to come with Pork belly baked beans, but when another guest asked what time it was, and I learned it was 5 pm, I asked if I could change my side order to a loaded baked potato, which is only available as a side from 5 pm onward.  No problem.  I only had a few forkfuls, but the toppings and large potato, crisped skin on the outside and fluffy on the inside, tasted great.  Saved most of it, as well as the other half of the smoked brisket sandwich for Mommy dearest.  It was a fun afternoon, with a refreshing peach beverage and delicious food, while chatting with the neighbors: Mary on my left, who was having a glass of chardonnay-- thank you for offering me a taste of your side of tasty coleslaw (!); and the couple on my right, who arrived after I'd received my entree-- it looked so enticing, and they'd never tried it, so they decided to share one.  I hope you two enjoyed it!  FYI, the kitchen couldn't, or wouldn't, let me have a thin slice of the pie to enjoy at the bar, so I had to wait till I arrived home to set up this money shot...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=ErJEo1UOxzJg8pIrXQaI-w"}
{"text":"Worth the stop if you head up to Phoenix. The dessert was so good. My daughter came back for the toffee caramel brownie. The pumpkin pie was soooo good."}
{"text":"We went in just for some take out food while visiting in Scottsdale, and while we enjoyed the food we ordered, their takeout system is extremely confusing. Everyone we spoke to was very nice, but we were told to basically wait next to the end of the bar in the entryway where servers were walking in and out of the kitchen and try to get the bartender's attention to place an order.   The food took a while to get done, we both ordered almost the same item, a salad and a salad sandwich, and it took way longer than expected to finish. Meanwhile, we weren't really sure if it was finished already and the bartender who was serving customers hadn't noticed yet and we were trying to stay out of the workers' way to make sure they could get around while staying in eyesight.  The food was great, and it looked like a really cool restaurant-I do just wish they had a more efficient way to do takeout orders."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Very clean and modern inside."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the customer service at Grassroots. In early February I went to Grassroots to set up a family dinner for 12. We looked at the accommodations and specifically requested the area by the patio which  had a large regular dinner table and regular chairs accommodating 12 people.  I said that we did not want to sit in the area by the bar because we had older people who needed backs on the chairs and we wanted a more private area. The young lady at the front said that she could not make the reservation as the Manager, Christopher Collins must make them for a party of 8 or more. She showed me the schedule and the date/area/time was available  on the schedule. I would have to contact Chris at 5 for him to make the reservation and  I was given his card. I called Christopher and explained what we needed and the area that we wanted to sit and why. He said the date/time and area in the restaurant was available He took my name, phone number and in return he gave me a confirmation reservation number. We arrived 15 minutes early only to be told we will be seated in the front , hightop table with no backs on the chair. I explained that was not  what we reserved . We were very specific about what we needed. The Manager Christopher came over and tried to say that I didn't request the back area. I told him you talked to me and I was specific and he knew it. He said he couldn't move the people although they just had received their menus. He did not respect our reservations. I asked him how could he let this happen? SILENCE. His alternative option was moving us to his \"New\" restaurant across the driveway. They were going through a \"soft opening\" and they could accommodate us. We had no choice as where can you get a place to eat on Friday night in Scottsdale for 12 At no time did he apologize or even to come over to see how the party was doing. The alternative restaurant was slow in service, obviously not ready for a party if 12. For spending over $600 it was disappointing and certainly not the expected family gathering. Most managers in the hospitality industry distinguish themselves when dealing with mistakes graciously and often generously.  Grassroots did not respect our reservations nor did they handle their mistake with any class."}
{"text":"The bartender was the absolute coolest guy and poured great drinks!!  Thanks R.  Food is good the place is comfortable and draws a good clientele. Over all a classy hang out spot!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, eat the grits!  We stopped in after holiday shopping for a quick bloody and a cheese board. The bloody was perfect and the cheese board was a great snack for lunch. We sat and watched the game and talked with the bartender and it was really fun. The bar is in the center of the restaurant and you can see into the kitchen a bit and it just makes for a cool spot to hang and people watch.   When it came time to enjoy our next cocktail, the bartender recommended their gimlet. Normally, I am not a fan of gin, but he explained that Hendricks is distilled with cucumbers so the taste is not as offensive as juniper berry gin. So I gave it a whirl and think I found my new favorite cocktail. Its light and refreshing with muddled basil in there....YUM.  Now onto the grits...Fiance had been there for lunch before and had already experienced this wonder and we were talking about coming back just for that, when all of the sudden, I had a plate of the grits put down in front of me. They are light and fluffy (not normal for any grits I've ever had). They were slightly cheese with some jalepeno and green onion and were just so amazing to my already filled belly.  I cannot wait to come back here as their menu looks awesome!"}
{"text":"I Love this place.  Great Happy Hour, called \"Social Hour\".  Service is great, prices are excellent.  Nice Patio area."}
{"text":"Went to check out this place around 9ish in the night. Huge place and kind if felt empty. Food was good. Reasonably priced and tasty."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food & drinks.  The bar staff was great as well.   I typically hesitate to write a great review for most places because after I do, they become overcrowded and I can no longer enjoy them.    But I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while on a business trip with a few colleagues. Happy hour prices were great! Loved the décor and patio. We had the brussel sprouts and they were awesome- could definitely split between 3-4 people, large portion for an appetizer and the bacon with it was to die for. Had the miso grilled salmon 6 oz portion as my entrée with the asparagus and it was absolutely great! The asparagus were literally enormous, I have never seen such huge asparagus in my life, they were literally the size of small cucumbers. Were really good though! We all split 2 slices of the key lime pie and they were equally phenomenal. The slices are more like 2 slices or 1/4 a pie so they do give you a generous portion! Service was great as well, overall a really great place to have lunch or dinner in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good food, but a little higher-priced. There are two locations and I find them both to be equally good. The Scottsdale location is next to an amazing pastry and sweets shop.  The best thing about this restaurant is that they have something for every palate preference, so with our extended family everyone gets fed and is happy (hubster gets the burger, I can get a salad with fish, kiddo has grilled cheese, and my mom can get a traditional pot roast)."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Our salad was ordered with chicken, and we thought it would be grilled chicken,  but instead was chicken leg pulled right off the bone. Not the most pleasant. Our server didn't come check on us until we asked for the check, which is why we didn't send the salad back, since we couldn't find her."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch here and was promised that the key lime pie would change my life. While it was excellent, for sure, it was the pretzel bread my Reuben sandwich was served on that changed my life. The bread was warm, soft pretzel dough--I would have eaten it plain had it not been part of my sandwich. My server, Sarah, was very sweet and attentive, as well. Look forward to trying their other specials in the near future!"}
{"text":"We LOVE, love it here! My favorite is the roasted chicken & jalapeño grits with a Manhattan martini!"}
{"text":"I'm in town buying a new home, and have walked past this place on several trips. Stopped in tonight and I'm glad I did. It has a nice casual atmosphere and a range if diners - couples, families with children, groups. Football was on over the bar (Go Steelers). The food was excellent. I had a heart of romaine salad - their version of a Cesear Salad - which was very good with plenty of Parmesan cheese and toasted croutons. I also had the Shrimp an Grits, which was one of the best I've ever had. Very creamy grits with a bit if jalapeño, BBQ shrimp - and lots of them - and toasted focaccia bread - the waitress called them toast points, which we both laughed at because they are huge. All in all a great dinner. And they have a good selection of local craft beers. I'll definitely be back once we move here."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and am happy to have found a new place close to home. We went for happy hour and enjoyed their cocktails and wine. Best of all hh is daily from 3-6.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had seen them reviewed on \"Check Please, Arizona\" (that was the Scottsdale location), and realized there was one not too far from us.  They have the same menu, so we decided to give it a try.  We came for lunch, and were greeted immediately.  The restaurant's not too big, but they also have a nice sized patio.  We decided to sit inside, but the patio doors were open, so it was quite pleasant.  Corinne, our server, was very nice and friendly.  I ordered one of the specials, the tri-tip sandwich on french bread with shoestring fries.  Hubby went with the shrimp and grits, since he'd seen that on the TV show, and couldn't wait to try it.  My sandwich was delicious!  The meat was tender, the bread was soft and the aioli gave it a really nice flavor.  Plus, the heaping portion of crispy shoestring fries...yummy!!  Hubby's shrimp and grits were gone before I realized it.  The shrimp were blackened, with creamy, cheesy, jalapeno grits and sausage gravy, which he sopped up with the grilled bread he received on the side.  He also ordered a slice of coconut cream pie, which was more like a slice and a half.  He loves coconut cream pies, and tries them wherever we go.  He said it was good, but a little too sweet and dense.  But, somehow, he managed to finish the whole piece...LOL!  We would definitely go back for dinner.  I'd love to try an appetizer and the toffee brownie dessert next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in the Grassroots Kitchen after a very long day of air travel, hungry and a bit worn out.  The wait staff was professional and very accommodating.  At their recommendation I had the pastrami sandwich lunch special which was fantastic!  Their sauce was delicious and having it served on pretzel bread was next level.  Seems the Grassroots Kitchen was just what I needed and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and it was great! The sweet Hawaiian sliders and smoked salmon dip got to the table in less than five minutes. (Not too much prep work needed!) Both were delicious and shareable. I got the Cadillac marg (super strong!) the Georgia iced tea was sweet and not as strong. The waitress was great, she brought me water every time she checked on us. Nice. Good atmosphere, very laid back. We would have sat outside, they have misters and the cutest patio seating, but with the heattoday, no way!"}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant. First time going was tonight and I wanted to review it right away. Service, food and atmosphere was perfect. Our waiter was terrific and we will certainly be coming back and bringing friends. They were vegetarian friendly and so helpful with the menu and accommodations. Everyone was smiling and had a great attitude. We ordered the burrata appetizer, the chop salad, the veggie plate and a side of grits and it was all PERFECT. Also if you like iced tea the iced green tea was so delicious. Toffee brownie for dessert and I couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"Read great reviews. I need to go back and not get any seafood maybe? Shrimp and grits were nothing in comparison to NOLA shrimp and grits.  Shrimp were tiny and over seasoned. Salads looked good. Will have to try a salad or short ribs next time.  Service and ambiance was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is a solid spot with lots of options and good service. Good vibe inside. Po boy reminds me of NOLA. Wish the jalapeno grits had some more spice."}
{"text":"From beginning to end, this was a great dining experience. A little confusion with our reservation upon arrival, but Colin quickly attended to our party of four and seated us. Our server Sam came immediately and was patient as we chose drinks and appetizers. Pork Belly and Tuna Poke both excellent. She asked us if we would like to wait to order the entrees and that worked well. Never did we feel rushed. Three of us had the Scottish Salmon with a small side of the signature jalapeño grits; the other diner chose the short ribs. We were all very happy and well fed but had to try the Key Lime pie- similarly excellent. Everyone who served our table was friendly and professional. Absolutely will return next Winter when we fly back to town. Kudos to all."}
{"text":"When I'm hungry my mind tends to dream of plates of jalepeno cheddar grits ... salivating short ribs ... Smoked salmon swimming in remoulade sauce... And then I realize I'm dreaming about Grassroots. And then I go and eat all of those meals I mentioned and leave extremely satisfied happy. Dreams do come true."}
{"text":"My favorite place! Cocktails are amazing and you have to try the short ribs with grits. Service is typically excellent albeit there can be quite a wait at times. We go here for special occasions and regular days alike but having hosted a twelve person party here I can assure you it's great for all!"}
{"text":"AMAAAAAZING.  From the atmosphere to the menu to the staff and the bar. It is all around amazing. Seriously anything on the menu is delicious. My fiancé and I have been here probably 20 times in the past year it's so yummy. The sangria is to die for by the way."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 2.5 and 3 stars.  In town for the weekend with 3 friends for a birthday celebration.  After a long day of travel, we were ready for a good meal.    The service here is terrible, you will wait a good 10 mins at your table before you even get water.  Waitress was inattentive, food was mediocre, we split several apps and I had the shrimp and grits.  Nothing impressive.  The best thing about this restaurant is it's location.  There is an ice cream and sweets shop next door and the chocolate mousse cake there is divine!  Also worth mentioning that the table next to us had some type of issue with a gift card.  I think that also speaks to the service at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6. Had a comfortable booth to accommodate us all. Drinks were delicious as was the food. Flexibility with the menu along with the quality of the food delighted all. Worth visiting."}
{"text":"Scottsdale eats earlier than Denver does.  Back home, you could wander into any restaurant at 5:15 and sit right down.  Here, we were told we'd have a 20 minute wait, which turned out to be closer to 40 minutes.  Aside from being a bit irritating (though we understand what a guessing game \"wait time\" can be for the staff), we were also in a rush by the time we actually sat down because we had an event starting at 6:40.  The hostess came by a couple of times to assure us that we were getting closer, and eventually we were sat.  We didn't explicitly tell our poor waiter that we were now in a big hurry, but our demeanor must have given us away.  He was efficient and fast, bringing us our food very shortly after we ordered, and bringing the bill to and from the table quickly.  We made it on time, and he made it look easy.  Kudos.  The food was solidly above average.  I had a hankerin' for some of the southern food my grandma used to make, so I had the BBQ brisket with baked beans and grits.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The brisket fell apart, the baked beans were hot and tasty, and the grits were creamy and delicious.  The BBQ sauce wasn't anything to write home about, but that's secondary to the meat being cooked properly, which it was.  Tanya had a salad, and it was a solid salad.  I believe it was the Waldorf.  It had a good amount of things that weren't just lettuce.  I would like to come back again and be less rushed to really enjoy the ambiance, which is warm, open, and inviting.  The good food and great service warrant a return trip."}
{"text":"Such a great location and great outside patio that allows dogs :) plus, the have great plastic wind shields that came in great handy this past weekend. Food is also on point and very very good!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner and was greeted and seated promptly. Happened to be AZ restaurant week and we decided to try out the prefix menu. We started with the Ahi salad it was solid not the best I've had but really good nonetheless. Our entree was a delicious shrimp and grits dish that had plump, juicy shrimps and buttery grits, I would order this again. For dessert we shared the key lime pie slice. I love key lime pie and this was a pretty good one. My son enjoyed a giant root beer float topped with a black cherry and rich whipped cream. He loved it!  We need to return to try other dishes on their extensive menu! Another 5 star spot for us."}
{"text":"I ordered the Grilled Miso Salmon and it was one of best I've ever tasted. The salmon was very well cooked and the Miso added great flavor. The asparagus on the side complemented the fish."}
{"text":"Perfect for a light and flavorful meal with a friend or business associate!  I was eyeing the salmon and 1/2 salad but saw a neighboring table enjoying the blacked fish of the day sandwich.  The awesome server suggested that I get the sandwich off the bread and switch out my side (fries?) for the veggie chopped salad that sounded so good.  I was very impressed with the dish (DELISH!) and how accommodating they also were for my dining companion who happened to be on a very strict (HCG?) diet.  They also had really good iced tea, green or black, which makes a place a winner in my book.  This is now my go-to scottsdale venue for client lunches and meeting up with friends over a meal."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here as well as the unique drinks. I would suggest this place to anyone looking for something different and fresh. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food, service and sincere wait staff is impeccable! Highly recommend...perfect for ambiance."}
{"text":"Would give Ten stars. Delicious. Had the pork belly.  Nick had the brisket sandwich.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I wish there wee a 3.5 option, but since that's not available, we have to round down for this restaurant. First off, the music, some sort of mutant cross of twanging folk and tired country, really detracted from the experience. I had the ahi tuna salad which was both rather small and very salty. The combination of too much soy sauce on the tuna and too much of the sesame seed/corse salt made way too much of a good thing. My beloved had the chopped veggie salad, which he enjoyed. But again, it was a little small. After tax and tip, we paid $35 for two smallish salads. Too bad, I was hoping to add a new restaurant to the rotation."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, excellent servers, food was on point.  We entered the restaurant at 4:30 after business meetings and before heading to the airport back home.  There were three of us and headed to a high top with four chairs (there were 2 of them); \"Those are reserved....\" is what we ran into.  We were directed to a large community table in the bar area also.  This was fine until a mom showed up with her two kids and they consumed the table with backpacks, school books, notepads and proceeded to do homework.    Not a very business meeting friendly place.  When back in PHX with my family, i will go there, otherwise I will stay away.  The high top tables  remained empty the entire time we were there for cocktails, starters and meals, ~2 hours."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was fabulous! Waitress was very pleasant... when we couldn't decide on which Pinot Noir, she brought us out a taste of each so we could decide which one we would like! Offered helpful suggestions on what to choose.... I had the smoked brisket sandwich, it was so delicious , the Smokey flavor was not over powering, and the brisket melted in your mouth. With each bite you took you also Tate's the homemade cold slaw that topped the brisket , so delicious. Not to be forgotten was the Lobster Bisque soup, that I started with... so smooth and super delicious.... this is a very popular place, so if you are going for lunch get there early... They do take reservations so if time is an issue it might be wise to have a table waiting for you, especially if you want to eat outside on the patio. We arrived at 11:20a and all seating outside was taken and most tables were already reserved. You can't go wrong going here .... We came from Anthem and it was well worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service you can tell wait staff love the food which makes a big difference- poke - shrimp po boy amazing, wine amazing"}
{"text":"Had never been to Grassroots before, but we always heard good things. We started at a table and not only had some of the best food I've had in Scottsdale, but excellent service from our server Sydney. We ended up staying for a few drinks at the bar with Lesta and Seth. Exceptional food, incredible service. Would absolutely recommend brisket and ahi tuna."}
{"text":"Great location to have a quick lunch and meet friends. The salads are exceptional and tasty. Very healthy. Service is great. Now that the weather is great, seating outside is a must. They have quite a nice sports bar as well.  Easy to access. Parking can be a bit tricky. If busy, go to the underground parking. Convenient."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after shopping in the area. Definitely a great healthy location. Everyone was extremely nice and service was 5 star. We ordered the salmon and grits. Beautifully cooked and well presented. After our dinner they were kind enough to serve us Apple pie. Wow...the Apple pie was delicious! The way it was baked was a way I had never had a pie done. Overall, the food was great, dessert was delicious, service was perfect and atmosphere was laid back and relaxing. Would recommend this spot to anyone if they are in the area."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent, highly affordable food. And the best service anywhere. Just one wonderful server after another. Mia, the manager, did a wonderful job assembling the best wait staff you'll come across.  Doesn't matter what you select. It's good! But the Portobello 'burger' is beyond delicious, and my wife's favorite, the grilled fish, is top notch. Hint: ask for it on focaccia bread. Plus some great soups and salads.  The location is also great. Food shop in Trader Joe's and/or Whole Foods before or after you eat."}
{"text":"Southern food with a healthy twist.    I immediately loved this placed. The atmosphere, the staff, and the great menu choices.  I ordered the chicken walnut salad sandwich.  It was excellent. Great flavor, not over bearing in sauce. I would definitely order again. My side dish was the dirty orzo which was equally delicious.   My friend had the brisket sandwich and from her comments she couldn't be happier. Lol  Decent beer and drink choices. Can't wait to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious! Also, every time we walk in the door we are seated right away. I always get the shrimp ok boy or beef brisket sandwich. You can tell they use fresh, local ingredients. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Dinner for 7 (5 were out of town guests) on the patio recently.  (Note:  Make reservations - this place is busy, especially in season and the patio is a highly coveted location.)  Everyone ordered something different and each raved about their entree selection.  Butternut squash side was a huge hit, as well as key lime pie for dessert (big enough to share).  Service was excellent and highly accommodating.  Thank you for being so consistent Grassroots.  Nice to have a dependable GoTo location."}
{"text":"Very mediocre service. She'd disappear for stretches. Empty dishes left long time. Orders not taken in a reasonable time. Literally every server walks in sloooooooowwwwww motion. Odd. Salmon and salad very small portions for $18.   Side of chard great.   Grilled salmon no flavor."}
{"text":"Discovered this place on a recent visit to Phoenix. Their charred artichoke with lemon aioli was the best I've ever tasted. They have a rich and delicious French Onion soup. It's a very high ceiling and can be a bit noisy if there is a crowd. If you are hoping to have a conversation one one one, sit outside or go when it's not too busy. They also have take out available - which I totally did within a few days to just have more of that artichoke. They can seat large groups because of the open atmosphere. Overall, excellent food, service was great and price was reasonable given the high quality of food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Here on vacation and tried this based on yelp reviews.  It did not disappoint. I had the red snapper and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Grassroots is by far the best surprise I've ever had. IN LIFE! EVER! Sorry. That's a little dramatic. But I am SO glad I finally stumbled upon this place.  I had some besties in town and we were looking to have a tasty night out to dinner after a vigorous day of hiking, college basketball and patio-hopping. I don't really know how or why I came to the decision of Grassroots, but BOY HOWDY (yep.) am I glad I did!  I used to work right over in this area and put Grassroots on my mental \"to-try\" list when it opened. Time got away from me, and I really have no idea why we just now tried it out, given how close it is to home. Nothing could prepare me for how glorious it was. Walking in, we were transplanted into someone's hip, modern kitchen with lots of Americana art adorning the sleek space. We were promptly sat at a high-top for 4 and perused the menu. We all ordered a cocktail (or beer) to start with, and my Hendricks/cucumber concoction was cool and refreshing.   Ordered:  ~Burrata app: Heaven. Creamy, dreamy burrata served alongside lightly dressed arugula and tomato jam. Served with lil grilled toasts. So perfect.  ~Seasonal vegetable chop for the table to share: Not sure why, but our order came with chicken on it? At a normal time I'm sure we would have sent back but we had already placed our dinner order and it was getting closer to the kitchen closing. No matter. Those who weren't eating meat just picked around. The plethora of veggies was outstanding! (Beets, grapes, bnut squash, corn, edamame, cucumber, herbs, cherry tomatoes, feta, I'm sure I'm leaving something out.)  My choice as my main was the grilled portobello sandwich, no mayo, add avocado. The combo of smokey porto, creamy avo and sharp, melty white cheddar was outstanding! The soft and warm sea salt foccacia was insanity. Paired with a side of fatty grilled asparagus spears, this meal was amazing. I also loved how they cut the sammie into tiny squares...easier to handle and inhale.  Friends ordered the sashimi ahi salad (was told the ahi was PERFECT and it actually went better with the champagne vin that came out with the chop salad rather than the miso vin), the vegetable platter (the sauteed cabbage with goat cheese was TO DIE) and my boyfriend said his burger was one of the most perfect orders ever.  With the meal, we ordered a bottle of the Rockus Bockus, which is a mix of Cab Franc and Zinfandel and was SO, SO perfect. Juicy, man. It's a new favorite.  Service was great, even though we stayed a little past closing. Whoops. (PLEASE SCOTTSDALE, HAVE SOME NICE PLACES LIKE THIS THAT STAY LATER THAN 10:00 ON THE WEEKENDS, PLEASE!) There were several groups still lingering over drinks while we left, which I don't blame them for. What a great place to hang out and enjoy delicious bites. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So so food. For the price best go to a fine resteraunt. When asked waitress if the salmon is wild or farmed? Her response \" by Scottish standards it's Wild\". Continued to explain that the salmon are in the ocean trapped in a net ."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place a little over a year now. I enjoyed coming in the mid day and talk stories with the bartenders while enjoying some draft beers and there Ahi taco/tower that they serve is soooo delicious. I could eat a pound of just their ahi mix all by itself, Its that delicious. Its the salty, citrusy but, a hint of sweetness mixed together Its ono! Lol  Customer service has always been nice, the host/hostess are very pleasant and the people Ive met so far are very helpful and always smiling!  I recently came here with my girlfriends celebrating a special event for us three and this was my first time I sat outside. Such a nice umbiance, not too loud and enough for us to hear each others conversation across the table...   The food was all delicious - the pork belly pupus and I had the filet mignon (im not a big eater but, hungry for meat) and it was cooked to perfection.   Our waiter was great in dealing with us and being patient as well!   I love this place and yes, totally worth coming back to enjoy some delicious appetizers/cold beer or wine"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Grassroots (as one of the top rated on Yelp) and it did not disappoint. One of the best meals we had while in Scottsdale. Every single aspect of this restaurant is impressive, from the service to the food."}
{"text":"Amazing shrimp & grits & appetizer. Happy hour boasts a 50 oz beer for $10!  Reading other reviews, key lime pie was a must & had to be one off the best!  Everything was amazing, service was excellent. Sat outdoor but had covered seating. Perfection"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, service and food!! Our server Josh was attentive and so friendly. What I did find odd was the woman in the white chef's coat roaming around the dining area. If she is the owner I would think she would have come over and asked how our meal was right? Anyway I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant gets our patronage a few times yearly and never disappoints.  Good food and service although this trip hot food on very cold plates is not good. Nice atmosphere, booths and enclosed patio. Good bar too"}
{"text":"Love. Love..love..Grassroots.. Especially the grits! AWESOME.... Like a spot with personality..great servers and awesome food"}
{"text":"My son and I visited this restaurant twice while visiting family in Scottsdale. I have a sensitivity to soy and cannot eat anything with soy. I mention this to my server every time I eat at a restaurant.  After the first visit, we were so impressed that we raved about the outstanding food, ambience, and service for our late lunch. I ordered the Scottish salmon and salad, with a side of asparagus. I mentioned my soy issue and was reassured there was no soy in my meal, which was perfectly prepared and delicious.  We returned the second day for an early lunch, and this time I ordered the fish sandwich and a side of asparagus. I mentioned the soy sensitivity and my server double checked to make sure my meal was soy free. When the food came, I noticed the sauces and asked the server to check again, as they may have soy in them. Again I was reassured there was no soy.   I ate my sandwich and immediately fell ill with the painful stomach cramps, gas, bloating, and diarrhea that are  the unmistakable tell-tale signs that I have, in fact, ingested soy. I rushed to the bathroom doubled over with pain. My son was left to tell the server I had fallen ill, and she said, \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" and dropped off the bill. My son had to ask her to remove my meal from the bill, given their mistake. Then they told my son the bread in my sandwich contained soy. I would be shocked if there was not more soy in the meal I ate than just the bread, given how terribly ill I was for the next six hours. Even now, after 18 hours, my intestines are raw and sore. Not the kind of experience I ever want to repeat, so we will not be back to this restaurant.  This kind of mistake, in this day and age, is inexcusable, and the chef was irresponsible to the point of negligence. I hope they get their act together before their lack of care results in something even more tragic befalling a customer who unwittingly consumes food causing a poor reaction after being reassured it is safe."}
{"text":"We just stopped in yesterday after our flight we were tired and hungry.   LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Was a little apprehensive as I thought we didn't fit the \"cool vibe\", no worries - our waitress was adorable, attentive and really engaging.   The burrata was awesome, as were the grits, and all the food.  It was southern barbecue with an upscale twist, definitely a deft hand.    I would come back here again, and might before we leave.   I wish I could remember our waitress name, she was a very pretty girl with long dark hair.  If I HAVE to have a complaint it would be the sangria, but it might be me as I haven't sound one I like here, I guess I will have to keep trying;)"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night with the girlfriend recently. I love the atmosphere, albeit its a bit crowded inside. I had the ribs and they were fantastic. We also shared soup which was absolutely delicious. Will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. The hostess was incredibly sweet and brought us to a very nice table outside. Good choice on the teak furniture! We started with a dad's grocery bag appetizer which was a charcuterie.  I wasn't overly impressed with that, but It wasn't bad by any means, I've just had better. I drank pumpkin porter from four peaks, which is one of my favorite beers and I was grateful they had this selection. For dinner I had the short ribs which had outstanding flavor!! Service was good, whish I remembered her name (neck tattoo with the name joey) she was knowledgeable and sweet! I can't wait to come back here with my boyfriend for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Me and my partner each had a different steak (one petite filet and one prime rib) both were delicious. We are pretty picky and couldn't come up with anything to complain about. The ambiance was relaxing and our server, Aaron, was very gracious. We will come back again to try other dishes. This place is a great date night spot with easy parking. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar. I had the Shrimp Po' Boy and dirty orzo. I was a fan of the Po' Boy; crispy shrimp with a nice pickle to balance. The orzo was al dente. My husband loved it. He ordered a bowl of the green pork chile stew for his dinner. Good flavor, but very small portion. He ended up sharing my food. I had a $9 Greyhound with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. It was good, but again small portion (served in a martini glass) and hard to not finish in one gulp.  Food was good. The deducted stars are for quantity of food versus price. We left hungry."}
{"text":"The setting is great in McCormick Ranch.  They have a great patio and also an awesome community table.  There are great seats at the bar and always busy.  All ingredients are fresh and creative choices.  The salads are my fav and I love the wine choices in tap.  The have a great burrata as well with a homemade tomato jam and great bread.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive service!! Try the farmers chop salad! We ordered the seared sea scallops, and the salmon, both of which were outstanding! Also, try a local craft brew. I personally recommend the four peaks IPA! I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was lukewarm, but tasty. The brownie however, THE BEST EVER! Love the ambiance. The team serving can be confusing (different server greets table)... like the team idea, but it's nice to have and chat with one server, maybe I'm old school that way... but it did throw us for a mini-loop when we wanted our check as both servers retrieved it for us with different totals. Still highly recommend Grassroots and DEFINITELY get the brownie!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. I had the Shrimp Po Boy and my girlfriend had the Blackened Fish Sandwich, but we split half and half.   While the fish sandwich was us trying something new and not really out taste buds, is was good. The fish was cooked absolutely perfectly, and that's not something we say often. We avoid fish mostly because of that.  The Shrimp Po Boy on the otherhand was amazingly delicious. We almost ordered one to go! However we settled for a Coconut Pie, which had us both laying back wishing we had larger stomachs. By far the best Coconut Pie we've ever had. I am craving one as I write this.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now.  My parents turned me on to this place and I love it.  I have sent several people here too and they have all loved it.  I think I have tasted almost everything on the menu and it all rocks.  I really dig the short ribs, and the jalapeno cheddar grits, and the tuna app.  Update - 10/4/2013.  I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 3.  I have been back several times since my 1st post and I have to say that the service is going down hill.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but bad service kind of jacks it all up.  I don't care how f'n good the food is.  Last night my wife and I had the most unaccommodating server ever.  Won't split a salad in the kitchen (because they don't do that), and would not leave a mason jar of water at our table because it is needed for other tables. How hard would it be to get another jar of water from the kitchen?  My wife is preggers so we are not drinking any alcohol.  I feel like we were treated like crap.  There are a ton of restaurants that I can give my business to.  The food might not be as good, but the service won't leave a bad taste in my mouth (I like that sentence).  On a positive note, my wife had the short rib and I had the brisket and they were both awesome.  Too bad the service sucked."}
{"text":"Ate here last nite to celebrate a birthday and it was excellent. We had the miso salmon which came with fresh asparagus and we also had  shrimp and grits which was excellent. We had the homemade key lime pie as well. Would go back here in a heartbeat. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service, delicious and fresh food, and relaxing patio. I love the blackened fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, the food was tasty, and I really dug the atmosphere/decor.  I can say without a doubt that I'll be back again.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food and warm environment.  We ordered the salmon and salad, spare ribs, and the clubhouse salad with chicken.  We finished the evening with key lime pie and the brownie sundae.  The pie was FANTASTIC and will definitely order that again.  Really solid place for dinner and family friendly."}
{"text":"Went last night and ordered the special - scallops and grits. Wooo! Dayum, that dish was bomb. It was topped off with this decadent spicy ham relish thing. I was eating with my parents and their friends and honestly didn't say a word once the plate went down in front of me to the moment I had scraped up the last bit. Scallops and the Arizona desert, at first, dont appear to be a match made in heaven. But these guys conquered any obstacles and served up some of the tastiest scallops. They could be considered \"rib-sticking\". WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SCALLOPS COULD BE RIB-STICKING???  Also, had a bite of my mom's short ribs which were to die for. They were dressed in this hoisin glaze; meat was falling off the bone; making me tear up, the memory is so beautiful.   beyond that, I finished my meal with a root beer float. I kinda just wanted root bear and ice cream because of my basicness but even with this dish wow-ed me bc of the house-made whip cream they placed on top.    All in all, if you want some bombastic comfort food, come to this place. You will leave feeling warm and fuzzy"}
{"text":"Great food. For vegetarians there is sandwich and vegi platter. The best I have had in years. Love the service too. Their Apple pie was delicious. In all you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a nice time and a very good meal at Grassroots.  Service could have been a little faster and it seemed that some of the waiters were not as well trained as others.   Ribs were excellent and I would highly recommend them.  Key Line pie was good too!"}
{"text":"Grassroots was AMAZING. Our server, Maura, was so friendly and very helpful - even offering travel tips for while we were in town. The food was fresh and delicious, we all loved our meals. I 100% recommend Grassroots to anyone - it was a great experience."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant! I try not to come here more than once a week, but it's so good! So far I recommend the seared tuna salad, the special pastrami sandwich, and the smoked salmon appetizer. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to go in here for some time.  It's sort of unassuming. In a strip mall located at the Camelback Corridor.... next to Trader Joe's and Whole Foods.  Decided to stop in today. What I liked for a Sunday..... No Brunch. Yep.... I said it.  I like brunch..... but not everyone does it well.... and when I want lunch..... that's what I want!!  So in we go.  Great place . Decor very nice. Big booths and tables. Nice round bar with open kitchen.  Noticed many a tap.... beer it is.  Oregon Porter for Husband.... and a wheat beer for me.  Menu I just couldn't decide. So many great choices. Server mentioned a few specials.... one being a Kobe Beef Hot Dog .. served with slaw and Fries. Ok. Sold!  Husband ordered Shrimp PoBoy with Pork Belly Baked Beans.  Omg..... can't wait to go back. Both delicious!"}
{"text":"My family ate here and dined outside on the patio. I had the redfish and substituted the orzo for green beans (the side special). The meal was good, but not great. The burrata appetizer was flavorful. I tried the desserts that my table ordered- brownie and key lime pie. I would skip dessert next time. Overall a safe dinner choice and nice that you can make reservations."}
{"text":"You cannot beat the food here at Grassroots! Everything is so good from the main dishes of fish and meat to the sides including grits and salad. The drinks are amazing, the desserts were amazing, and the apps!  My biggest concern is the service here. They're friendly and they mean well but nobody seems to write anything down and you have to asked several times for anything no matter who we asked.  It's a good thing my group wasn't in a hurry because it would've been walk out if this was a quick lunch or dinner.  Food wise I recommend you get one of everything. Like the ambience and they also have high tops and booths. This is right next-door to the other Pizza Bianca location."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this neighborhood restaurant by neighbors, with whom we went for dinner.  We liked the ambience, food, drink prices with generous wine pours, and service.  Altogether a great place to go without breaking the bank.  The only impediment to giving a five-star review is that the lighting on the outdoor terrace is far too bright - like the Spanish Inquisition.  We were told that there is no way to dim those lights.  Fortunately we were able to move to a booth inside, where we were expertly served by Colby.  I especially liked my Red Fish dish.  The burrata starter was also excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for lunch and dinner! The farmers chopped salad is awesome, if I go for lunch I usually order this with chicken. The Cardiff salad is another one of my favorites. The ingredients always seem high quality and very fresh. They have a great selections of salads/sandwiches, I've tried a few and have never been disappointed. Lots of tasty southern comfort food.   Service has always been excellent - attentive and friendly. They have a great patio that is enclosed during the winter months with heaters so it stays comfortable even on chilly nights. And for dessert, I'm obsessed with their toffee brownie with vanilla ice cream. It's stupid good.   It can get busy - if you show up during prime lunch/dinner hours, expect to wait."}
{"text":"Still the best of the best. It has become the standard by which all others are measured. I love the environment, the staff, the food and the drinks!  Home Sweet Home!  I had the shrimp and grits tonight with a Tito's martini. Loved it! And, their house special dessert tonight, apple pie a la mode was fantastic."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business and had seen/smelled this restaurant, as it was in the same strip-center as my hotel, and knew I wanted to check it out based on aroma & asthetics, alone. My last night in town, I found an opportunity to make my way over and thank goodness I did!   Absolutely delightful & delicious! Beautiful space with a great vibe - Staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable without being overbearing and the menu offered a diverse selection of fresh, seasonal, farm-to-table type options and all with a bit of a hearty, southern twist.   I am a proud carnivore but couldn't resist the Farm-to-Table Vegetable Platter (heirloom tomato & bleu crumbles . sautéed chard . grilled asparagus . chef's featured vegetables . texas toast) and I was NOT disappointed, nor left wishing I had some sort of meat in there. Soooo good!  I can't wait to be in Phoenix again so I can revisit this spot!"}
{"text":"From our recent visit and note to their Founder:  We live in North Phoenix and began trading in your area a few months ago.  This was due, in part, to our plan for relocating my aging Father (from south Florida)  to Scottsdale.  Found him a great little place @Tuscany in McCormick Ranch.  My wife and I have had lunch 4-5 times at Grassroots Scottsdale the 2-3 months and now that my Dad is here, 3 more times.  Called last monday am and Shawn took my call as we wanted to reserve a booth.  He said he would request it and with our early arrival it should not be an issue as this was the first night of MNF.  He was mistaken on one front as the place was quite busy yet we did get the booth.  Dmitri was our server and like most of the talent here, he was over the top gracious, humorous and attentive.  First time to try your crab dip-utterly sensational and enhanced by his description of the preparation.   We collectively enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, the salmon, the cardiff salad and another dish I cannot recall.  Even had that crazy brownie to share.  Not sure we have had  dining experiences (almost 10's) in a short period of time whereby we did not fatigue or get dis-enchanted by the inconsistency of prepping a dish from one night to another.  Grassroots is so over the top with the faire and cuisine presentation.  It is incredulous in a good way Christopher.  Yet in the end , it is always about the people and a fact that your Team truly operates in rarified air on this note.  And this is a supreme credit to you and your GM who finds and keeps this talent.  BTW, your Manager that night, a young woman (30 something) was very visible and interactive."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is so fantastic. First and foremost, SERVICE! It is outstanding. These people have been trained in customer service, and it shows. They are all prompt and friendly. They are attentive, but not intrusive. Drinks are refilled, they check back often, they make sure customers are happy. The atmosphere is also wonderful. We love the patio, but inside is good, too. The food is absolutely wonderful. The hardest thing is trying to decide what to get. They have something for everyone, including my picky family members and friends. We have had almost everything on the menu, and it has always been good. Our kids love it, and we always take out-of-town visitors here as well. It  is a favorite. We have never once had anyone receive bad service or bad food here, and we've been coming since the week they opened. We appreciate the consistently good service and good food."}
{"text":"I'm a Phoenix native who frequented the Cajun restaurant that occupied the location before Grassroots.  I moved away and have come back to find a new restaurant in it's place!!  I was impressed with the renovations made to the location - it was clean, stylish and inviting.  The only problem I had was with the parking.  It's no fault of Grassroots that the construction was going on, but it was way too difficult to find parking.  It was worth the wait though.  Make sure to have a plan before showing up!  I ordered the Grilled Angus Burger sans Mayo with the Pork Belly added on, fries, and a side order of the Southern Baked Beans.  The burger was cooked well, and the accouterments we fresh.  My only concern was that I asked for no Mayo, but there was a glob of it inside the to-go dish.  The fries tasted like they were cooked in fresh fryer grease (a good thing!!).  The beans were....interesting.  They were a bit too \"sour\" for my liking.  It tasted as if they added some type of soda pop or a lot of un ripe tomatoes to the base.  They were good, but nothing I would rave about.  The to-go process was simple and quick, and the staff were very friendly.  I really like the gentlemen who was working the bar - he was helpful and very kind.  Overall, it's a good place to try if you're looking for something new, but not a Must Have in the Phoenix Restaurant scene."}
{"text":"I love this location, great selection of cocktails and delicious eats. The patio is perfect this time of year too! Prosciutto wrapped asparagus is my bff."}
{"text":"Holy Delicious Food Batman!! Headed over to Grassroots on a whim while in town. Stopped in on a Tuesday with the Husband and kids (13 & 8 - both kids are super adventurous eaters so I had no worries). It was busy, but they got us in on a high top in the bar. I know I'm going to love a place when the menu starts to blur because every single thing looks amazing!   We started with the Pork Belly (my husbands favorite food on the planet). Pork Belly with candied prosciutto.  It was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. Could have stopped there and been perfectly happy....but why??  We ordered short ribs (husband), shrimp and grits (me), seared ahi (Big), and chicken with hearts of romaine (Little). All of them were absolutely spectacular. The short ribs were melty and delicious and fabulous. The BBQ sauce was heavenly and the meat was ridiculously tender. The shrimp and grits were nothing short of amazing. I could have just done the bowl of jalapeño cheese grits on its own without the shrimp...  The Ahi was Devine. The agave ponzu was sweet and delicious and I'd like a bottle of it to use at home... Or to drink, whichever.... The hearts of romaine was yummy and Little cleaned her plate.   We finished off the meal (already stuffed...) with a banana split that was creamy gelato topped with candied pecans. Just yummy and wonderful. Can't wait to get back to Scottsdale to enjoy this place again. Just a GREAT, GREAT meal!!"}
{"text":"Been a long time fan of this place and once again, today was no exception. Our waitress was friendly, helpful, and quick. There was hardly a wait for our food and had there been one, the food would have been well worth it. The food is always good, even when I get it to-go, and their options are healthy. I got the salmon and chopped salad and would definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"What a great find!!  How can't a place with wine on tap be great?!  The atmosphere is really neat and the service from the bartender was very engaging.  Although I didn't eat on my last visit, the menu selections were enough to make me want to go back.   They had a nice wine selection and cocktail and beer selections for everyone.  I can't comment enough on the great decor - it is amazing to me as I knew how the place looked before it was renovated for this concept.  It's so open and airy!     I was happy to find out that this fellow that owns this place is a relative (son I think but I don't want to start rumors) of the folks who own Wally's American Pub - one of my favorite places to go when I lived in Arcadia.  I really like to keep it local whenever possible!"}
{"text":"If you've a hankering for southern cooking, but you want a cook with more skills than tossing a slab of meat into a smoker, try Grassroots Kitchen.  They walk the line between fine dining and comfort food better than anyplace else I've been to.  Its really good -- but it's not great.  Take the BBQ brisket, for example.  The platter has thick slices of meet (about 1/4 inch thick!) which is just too thick for brisket -- it becomes chewy.  But the spicing, flavor, and thin layer of fat was perfect.  I enjoyed it despite wearing out my mandibles.  The blackened redfish was perfectly cooked but somewhat underspiced, at least by my standards which equates blackened with spicy.  The sides were all good but not great: beans-nothing special, grits-where were those jalapenos?, etc.  Best dish was the soup - a beef chili that had amazing flavor.  I ordered only a cup and wanted more.  Pricing is also between fine dining and comfort food.  I'm pretty sure you will enjoy your experience here, if you can get a reservation."}
{"text":"great everything, but didn't have reservations, so \"dropping in\" not advised."}
{"text":"We must have been on camera bc last night felt like a joke! We had a party of 15 celebrating my boyfriends birthday and the entire experience felt like they were pranking us. It started by having to ask 5x to 3 different servers for one bud light. And when we finally got the server to listen; we asked for 3 and he brought us 2. Then after that, we didn't get served our entree until everyone in our party was done eating and the manager had to get involved. When we finally got our meal, the short rib was dry... such a bummer. We had to wait another lifetime for our dessert and checks. And to top it off, half of our checks were charged incorrectly. They tried to rectify the situation by giving us $12 off. It definitely did not make up for the terrible experience my boyfriend and I had. Don't think we'll be back to this location again."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday happy hour after work with a few friends. We got some drinks & a few items on the HH menu. For the price, I particularly enjoyed the chicken wings and the pork belly that came with the pigly wiggly.   We were having a good time catching up and at about 2 hours, we felt that the staff was trying to push us out. I'd understand if it was a busy time, but there was absolutely no line so it was rude for them to pressure us into leaving. I needed a water refill & when another/different waiter came to supposedly grab my water, it never came back. We felt the pressure from several staff, not just 1-2, so at this point we just left.  Step up your customer service game, y'all. I probably will never come back here. There are lots of other HH places around the area that I do not think it's worth risking another visit here."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the menu was very creative. Had a nice and chill ambiance. The food felt healthy too, which I enjoy, but had great flavor."}
{"text":"I went for a lunch with a couple of customers, they suggested it. I loved the concept is fresh and the place is nice. I loved the full service bar and the sitting out side. The menu is simple but offers a lot of good options. Service is as friendly as it can be and service is very good. I ordered the salmon with asparagus, it is organic and it was cooked to perfection, melted in my mouth. the asparagus were the big thick ones and also were cooked to perfection, crunchy but soft. My customers ordered a salad, not sure which but looked amazing and plentiful and the Tuna sandwich and also looked amazing. I also tried the lemonade, is it freshly made with real lemons, also fantastic. I will definitely will be back, I have to try so many other option on the menu!! This will definitely become a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"really REALLY enjoyed this place. We got the smoked salmon for a starter, I got the shrimp and grits and the wife got a salad. Ended on key lime pie. Every bite was perfect and the quality was top notch. THANK YOU FOR BEING SO AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I rarely post a review unless it's something spectacular. We ordered spit fire chicken to split and recommended an appetizer, tuna poke. Both were amazing. The chicken offered a unique light but very tasty tender chicken and the ozo was oh so good. Tuna Poke was probably the best I have tasted. It was fresh light but full of flavor. Finally kudos to our bartender, Dillon. He was informative, friendly and completed our Grasroot experience."}
{"text":"Three stars because the food is good, when you can actually get served. Overpriced, def overpriced but tastes good.   On my most recent visit I sat at the bar with my boyfriend. We went in for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We never got any food, we were never asked if we wanted any food. The bartender, some girl with Little Mermaid red hair, was too busy flirty with the older gentlemen at the bar. After sitting for 20 minutes without so much as a greeting we flagged her over. I don't come here too often and can't remember the wine on the menu I like. I'm certain there is one I really don't like so I asked if I could try a taste of two. She was instantly annoyed, the look was apparent on her face. She brought over two tastes and left, not to return for another 13 minutes; at this point, I was timing. We ordered drinks, she brought them and then left the bar. She was then gone, just completely absent.   We had to flag her down one of the servers to get the tab, paid and walked out. The service was terrible. You'd get better service(and food!) at a Taco Bell or McDonalds."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. We took my mom here for a birthday lunch on Sunday around 1:30 and we had our pick of seats. We were shown a great booth although the outdoor seating would have been great too (mom wanted to sit inside).   Cheryl was our server and was super friendly and attentive. We ordered the grilled cheese for my 9 year old, the cheeseburger for my 12 year old, the blackened fish sandwich and the brussel sprouts.   Everything was fabulous. The brussel sprouts take you to another level of consciousness they are that good. The fish was perfectly done and flavored. The only heads up here is that the grilled cheese is not your most kid friendly version and while I loved it, the sharper cheddar cheese was not his favorite.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here.  LOVE the food!  The shrimp and grits and scallops were so good.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"I ate a delicious meal last night at Grassroots, but the highlight of my evening was our smiling server, Taylor. I was torn between several menu items, and her suggestions were great (she loves salads and I love salads -- so I got the Waldorf). At some point towards the end of our meal, their computers stopped working. It was pretty frustrating (for everyone), but Taylor didn't make us feel inconvenienced at all. I could talk more about the meal, but Taylor was so nice. Thanks Taylor!  I look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant in the whole world.  The manager has no respect for his customers.  I couldn't believe what  he told my parents when they complained about the loud music and airconditioning.  He told them that he didn't care, and he doesn't need their business.  I can't believe someone managing in the food industry would talk to my 70 year old parents that way. Shame on them."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour! After a hike haha. Besides the delicious fries we ordered I haven't had the chance to try some of the other foods but it looked and smelled awesome. I had the white wine sangria and it was great. Not too heavy on the alcohol and not too sweet. Very refreshing drink.  They have a nice bar area in the middle of the restaurant but also a patio with tables to enjoy the sunlight. Very nice place overall and I am anxious to come back and try their food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I chose GRs this past Friday, of course based on the Yelp fam and it did not disappoint. The place was buzzing. Paige greeted us at the door (heyyy) and we decided to sit at the bar which was superrrr comfy.. the chairs...Just sayin, my azzzz was so happy in that chair. Seth, Megan and Sara were working the bar area, I mean wurking it....Yezzzz honey. They were awesome!   Ok on to the food. We started with the cheese and meat platter(I forgot the name) which was yum. Entree I did a burger with baked beans (which were amaze balls )and my friend had the lobster bisque (prefers hers thicker but said it was really good) and the Hawaiian bread BBQ chicken sliders. We both thoroughly enjoyed every bite (damn that was a lot of food folks). Seth made us a couple of mean white sangrias, I was speaking fluent Spanish after that one. We begrudgingly forced ourselves to order the house made brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert and it was yummm. We only made it through about 3 bites each and then we threw in the towel.   All in all great food, cool vibe and awesome service. Definitely worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent!  We ordered Salmon Dip, Burrata and Hawaiian Sliders on the social hour menu and Blackened Fish sandwich and Portobello sandwich on the regular menu. Everything was delicious!. so was dirty Titos martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives. Our server Austin was super friendly, honest and knowledgeable. Would be back there in no time!"}
{"text":"Food and service are always great. It's a popular spot so get there early and call ahead for large parties. I had a business lunch today and they accommodated us (8 people) with 2 servers and a high top family table. Drink refills were constantly at the top and my business guests all left with a smile and bragging about the food. I'm not a grits person but their jalapeño cheese grits are outstanding. Highly recommend for business or couples."}
{"text":"Our first time! We loved it! Our server Marina was very good. We ordered the blackened fish sandwich. It was really good! We will be back. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Food is made well with attention to detail.  Lemonade is very tarte.  A little on the expensive side but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous. From the alcoholic beverages, appetizers, salads, entrees, and finally ending with desert. Definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Love this hidden spot! The food is amazing and the servers are too. Definitely worth checking out :). It would be amazing if there were blinds or window shades during sun down because that is miserable. The sun shines right into your eyes :("}
{"text":"My husband and I love to cook so we were very impressed with Grassroots; the food as well as the service.  I had the shrimp po-boy and he had the house special - the bacon, lettuce and tomato.    The bacon was the smokiest and most flavorful we have ever had, and the green tomato was vibrant and fresh.  The layer of each food item was separate and distinct, but melded into a wonderful taste experience.   The staff was very competent and we did not feel rushed. It seems like more of a team approach to serving, but it was obvious the team members like each other and were working cooperatively.    Special occasions or otherwise, this establishment is worth the trip and if prices are kept to a reasonable level, it will be a Phoenix destination for a long time."}
{"text":"Great dinner with good company. Shared the Dad's Grocery Bag Appetizer and had the Blackened Red Fish as my main. Washed everything down with some yummy dirty martinis. They let me sub some sautéed Swiss chard instead of the dirty orzo for those that are laying off the carbs. No complaints on the service. I enjoyed the cozy and quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"A cool atmosphere with great food. I can speak for the chopped salad, huge smoked salmon, chicken breast, baby back ribs, coleslaw, dirty orzo, and short ribs. All top notch. I would give it 5 stars if they removed the bone from the bottom of the chicken breast. Go here, not whatever else you are looking at right now!"}
{"text":"Traveling from New York and came in after a long hike. All of the staff were extremely friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. The special was a salmon burger, easily the best I've ever had. Even the bread was delicious. On top of that, when they found out we were visiting from out of town they treated us to a slice of their key lime pie which was out of this world. A must stop for anyone visiting Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants my wife and I went to after moving to Phoenix. We asked the waiter for the best thing on the menu. He was adamant about the short rib. It was absolutely delicious. Since that time I've tried the chicken/rib combo. The ribs were good but the chicken was dry. I recommend getting the short rib every time. You wont regret it. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was fantastic. Great choice for restaurant week! Try the short ribs they are tender and flavorful without being to aggressive and the coconut custard pie will take you right back to your grandmas Sunday table!"}
{"text":"Good, yes. 5 stars? Not there yet.  I came in with my family and boyfriend for a birthday celebration on a Saturday night. We had reservations and our table was ready right when we walked in. We were led to the back on the restaurant where they have several booths along the wall. The table was perfect for our group.   Our group started with the burrata. It was good... but too cold. I read another review that mentioned this was an issue for them as well, and looks like it hasn't been solved. All of the burrata was edible, but it was just too cold and not quite as palatable as it should be. For our entrees, our group had the scallop special, the miso salmon and the short ribs. The salmon was just all right. If I was writing this review based on just the salmon, it would get 3 stars. There just wasn't anything exciting about it. The scallops with cheddar and bacon grits really stood out, as did the short ribs. Overall, I would definitely recommend those dishes again. Our group also had the brownie for dessert, which is HUGE. Definitely enough to go around.   As far as cocktails/beer/wine are concerned, we all ordered the Tito's Dirty Martini. Hard to mess that up, and thankfully, Grassroots did a great job on them. The wine list is okay, I wish there was more variety to choose from by the glass. However, I understand it is difficult to offer a lot of wine by the glass if that is not the main focus of the restaurant.   Other than the food just being 3-4 stars, the other thing that bothered me was I felt that our service was rushed. Our server was wonderful and friendly, but definitely wanted to go home for the night. Perhaps this just isn't the place to go and hang out with a leisurely meal. Now I know better."}
{"text":"If this review was just rated on the food alone, this place would be 4+ stars. The tuna poke appetizer was very good, perfectly seasoned. I had the shrimp and grits which were very tasty. Hubby had the ribs and chicken combo, which was also very good.   The two big problems we had were that our salads and entrees came out at exactly the same time. And the waitress didn't even bother apologizing for it.  The next one is a deal breaker for us. They apparently don't have a back door, so they have to bring the garbage out through the restaurant! During dining hours! And again, no attempt at covering up the fact that it was garbage. Ruined what would have otherwise been a very good meal.   Will we go back? Maybe, but definitely not this location, we'll try Scottsdale next time."}
{"text":"First visit. Every aspect deserves five stars... The food, drinks and the service (thanks Austin) were superb. Note: it's not fine dining.  We'll be making the 56 mile RT again very soon.  P.S.  Be sure to leave room for the brownie a la mode"}
{"text":"This place is really cute inside and excellent location.  Only reason I give 4 stars is the waitress messed up my salad order.  I do like the healthier options they offer."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Even better food and drinks. Definitely moving to the top of my list when it comes to the camelback corridor.  Recommendation: Don't miss out on the smoked salmon, its awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! I'm not a big carnivore and I had lots of yummy options. My salad and the poke appetizer were awesome, but I have to say, my husband's jalapeño grits stole the show... Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"So good!! Last time I was there I had their daily special which was an\"Omega-3 burger\" which was a salmon burger with avocado. It was perfectly cooked. Love the outdoor patio and overall vibe. We almost went to check out their little dessert shop next door but instead we ordered the toffee brownie which was HUGE but so so delicious. I definitely overate but it was so worth it."}
{"text":"Decidedly ok.  I suspect a bit over hyped.  A friend and I split the Waldorf chicken salad and the pork  braise with a sideof beans.   The salad was good, but nothing special, you can get something similar elsewhere.   The pork braise was good, but the sauce was salty.   The side of jalapeño grits was very one dimensional and not as creamy as I expect grits to be.  It tasted like the grits needed salt too.  Although of you ate the grits and pork together the salt balanced each other out.   The restaurant is cute and stylish.  You will enjoy the ambiance.  Our server was only ok.   Cute place with ok food and service is three stars."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Sunday, June 22, 2014.  Our experience was horrible.  We ordered a Chicken Waldorf salad and brisket.  The salad was overdressed and soggy, as if it had been sitting in a bag.  Neither crisp nor fresh.  The chicken on the salad tasted old and mealy-- not fresh.  The brisket was chewy and flavorless.  We had two bites of each dish and asked for the check.  Our server, a nice enough young woman, was training another new staff member, another nice young lady.  Our server saw that we ate virtually non of our food and asked what was wrong.  We told her we did not like the food.  She did no further investigation as to what our specific thoughts were.    No manager came over to address what our concerns might be;  so we paid the full bill and left, unhappy and hungry.  We will never be back.  And we will tell our friends about our experience when asked-- which is a lot."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers and had the brisket sandwich. It was so good!! Delicious food, great service, cute environment. They refill your glasses with mason jars. The poke tuna app was fantastic too. Almost got dessert, but maybe next time ;)"}
{"text":"No clue what the food is like. Came in to a quiet empty restaurant, got seated quickly and then waited for 15 minutes and not a person asked if I wanted a drink. They even light candles on the adjoining tables with no regard to me being there. My recommendation is if you have a lot of free time and want to sit, go here."}
{"text":"THE RIBS.... no bones, huge hunks of meat, smokey savory sweetness, no knife needed. And with GRITS, I LOVE grits!! With HUGE perfectly-grilled asparagus spears. Tried my friend's sautéed chard, it was done perfectly.  The desserts were good & HUGE, 4 of us didn't completely eat 2 desserts. But we were pretty full from the generous dinner portions.   Nice, easy service, didn't catch his name but he did everything needed.  It is nice inside, soothing but by no means a snoozer place. The bar is in the middle, looks like a nice after-work place to me. I saw a patio too, always a plus in the right weather. If I lived nearby, I'd be here often..."}
{"text":"After a long day working, the last thing I wanted to do was cook!  So we decided to go to our go to place, Grassroots.  We have always loved our experience there.  Last night was off, not it's usual wonderful.  From the server not remebering our glass of wine (she actually put down the check and then rememebered that we were still waiting for the glass we ordered), to waiting for coffee to come with our dessert, to the kennel cough diner in the booth next to us it just was not up to our usual quality.  The server didn't even bother to discuss with us why anything was late, or make anytype of assistance to make it better.  Even the filet I had had a cold center (not cool, but almost frozen cold).  I think it will be a while before we go back.  Funny thing, not even a manager came by to ask how our meal was.  Disappointing to say the least!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place!  Great service, Vanessa was our very nice and attentive server. Great layout and ambience of the restaurant. Awesome food!   My husband and I came here for dinner on a Monday night, the place was pretty full. I liked the fact that they have outdoor areas for dining, a big bar area with TVs, as well as tables for seating inside. The big roll up garage type doors add to the decor but also make the outside and inside areas cohesive!   We enjoyed all the food we tried from start to finish. All the ingredients were fresh and all the dishes were well prepared. Loved how everything was simple and to the point and not overly dressed up like some restaurants can get.   Starters:  -House-made smoked salmon: When it says for sharing, you definitely want to share this one. The portion of the fish was large, I thought it was an entree. Perfectly smoked.  -Red beans and rice soup: Great flavor profile for a soup with simple ingredients.  -Farmer's vegetable chop: Nice and crisp, perfect for a warm night. All the ingredients inside of the salad complemented each other very well.  Entrees: -Topher's Braised Short Ribs: The meat was tender.  -'Roti' & Rib Combo: Both the chicken and ribs were cooked perfectly. The chicken was nice and juicy and the rib meat was falling off of the bone.   Desserts: (Definitely do not pass up on dessert!) -Key Lime Pie: Since I am a fan of this type of pie, I had to get it. The texture was nice and smooth. Loved how it was not too tart and not too sweet. The bite of the crust finished the pie perfectly.  -Coconut Cream Pie: (One of the best I have had, so much so we tried to come back the next day but they sold out during lunch service)  The reason why I loved this pie was because it wasn't your ordinary coconut cream pie where it's super fluffy. The filling was more dense almost like a thin layer of thicker cheesecake but still smooth and packed with coconut flavor. The thicker more caramelized crust and toasted coconut on top completed this awesome pie! *Seems like they change their featured pies...not sure if it's weekly or monthly.   When we are in town visiting Arizona again, we will definitely come back and eat at this restaurant.   Restrooms: Separate restrooms for men and women. The women's restroom has two stalls, it was clean and stocked. I enjoyed looking at the Rolling Stones magazine covers that they hung up as the decor."}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp and cant wait to return. Excellent service from our waitress Rebecca and the food was phenomenal!!!  Truly enjoyed the outdoor dining.  Everyone in our group of 6 enjoyed their meals. Already looking forward to our next visit to Scottsdale to eat here again."}
{"text":"I loved my experience here. My little sister and I dropped in here for a spur of the moment dinner. It was Friday evening, around 6:30 so of course it was pretty busy. There was a wait for the patio, which was unfortunate, but we were starving and took the available indoor table.   The inside is dimly lit and the colors are very calming and the ambiance is all around comfortable and welcoming. The staff was very attentive and nice without being too in-your-face.   I ordered the chopped veggie salad which was AMAZING. It was an unusual salad and I'm pretty certain I will get it again on my next visit cause it was that good. My sister had the grilled salmon with which came with a salad. She gave me a nibble of the salmon and it was perfect.   We topped it off with sharing the banana split. Sooo delicious and definitely big enough to split. In fact, we didn't finish it.   Overall, love this place and the convenient location. Nice place to have dinner and I can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"I have to say,  I am quite disappointed in this restaurant. I am a frequent guest at Wally's. I love it and have introduced many friends and family members there.  Unfortunately,  I will not be recommending this place to anyone.  They do not seem to understand the concept of customer service.  While dining we were told \"no,\" way more than yes by our waitress.  The food was okay,  but certainly nothing to write home about. We waited a long time just to get our drinks refilled,  and the place wasn't even busy. On a lighter note,  the ambiance is cute, but there were a lot if fly's buzzing around and hanging out on our food,  which is never a good thing. Overall, there are a lot of dining options in Scottsdale,  I would  recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I like this place in part because it's very close to my home. They have a good happy hour, not a great happy hour. They used to have a few more food options that they no longer have. I hope they expand the options in the future"}
{"text":"I love Grassroots - their Happy Hour is great. The HH menu is short, but the flavor is PHENOMENAL! And it's a good bargain. The burrata is excellent, I highly recommend it. So are the sliders - Hawaiian sweet roll sliders with slow-roasted brisket. The homemade pickle on the slider makes it worth dreaming of.   The bar is very large - a U-shape, and well stocked. I always order wine, so can't speak to any cocktails or beer they serve. But I always find a glass of wine I like and want, and they don't forget me when my glass is empty. :-)  Off the HH menu, my fav dish is the bbq brisket plate with grits, pickles, baked beans and cornbread. I'm from the South, and have been extremely disappointed in what some restaurants call cornbread, or even biscuits, for that matter. But Grassroots' cornbread is very good.  The service is always good/above average - I've never felt like I was forgotten or overlooked. And the waitstaff personalities are collectively warm and accommodating.   This has a neighborhood restaurant feel to it - there's nothing luxurious about it like eating at our resort restaurants, but it's not supposed to be. It's excellent in giving you comfort food in a modern, open, airy, and lively atmosphere.  Because it's open & airy, it isn't a restaurant to go with a book - it's a bit loud.   There is also good patio seating!"}
{"text":"I went to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for dinner with a friend this week because we wanted to try something a little different, and after looking at the menu, I decided to give this place a try.  It's located next to one of my favorite coffee shops (The Village Roastery), and has a beautiful heated patio which is where we sat. The restaurant itself if very nice; it has a great ambiance to it.   I ordered a Kona beer, the shrimp poboy, and jalapeno & cheese grits. Hooooly crap, I kid you not, I think I could die in a vat of those grits. They were heavenly! You wouldn't expect a Grassroots to have such a southern/creole vibe to it, but it totally works.   Our waitress was very sweet, service was prompt and friendly. The only drawback is that the prices are a little high, but you do get large portions. It would be really fun to come for their social hour with a group of friends."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The Key Lime Pie and Coconut Cream Pie pushed my reviews up. The Coconut Cream pie is the best I've ever had. YUM!!! Even my husband that isn't crazy about Coconut Cream pie LOVES it!  Also, I love their Coleslaw!"}
{"text":"Walked by this restaurant tons of times and finally tried it last night for my birthday.  Love the indoor/outdoor feel and the ambiance. Food was delicious - Angus burger and jalapeño cheddar grits. Hot and cooked to perfection and flavorful.. Service was friendly and timely. Dessert was to die for - toffee brownie w/ice cream! Will definitely go back in the near future."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. ....had the blackened fish sandwich and it was absolutely amazing. ...I will be back!"}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere, comfortably classy without being pretentious.  The barrel aged negroni was the right way to start my meal.  The trout I had was excellent, my wife's brisket was too.  The coconut cream pie took the cake.  It's just so creamy.  Top it off with excellent attentive service, and you have a recipe for success."}
{"text":"We go to Grassroots a lot.  Always great food and menu and service.  Our son visited from NYC and loved it.  My wife likes the trout and I go for the brisket or chicken.  The sides are fab and the baked beans are the best and Baked potato is done perfectly.  On several occasions I have seen the  owner personally checking out what is going on.  Well done!"}
{"text":"We have supported the \"Wallys Family Restaurants\" for years in this Valley. We love all of them with the exception now of Grassroots on Hayden. I go there all the time and recently a hostess named Angie provided \"0\" restaurant etiquitte and NO I cannot attitude. This last time I went in with my 94yr. old Mom and a very good friend visiting carrying full time portable oxygen. With 5 tables available she said we had to wait. Not a problem.....but  a lady in front of us in the bathroom came out and was seated without the rest of her party for a good 15min. We were never offered seating to wait until I said something. I then went next door to the sister property and they had availability.When I went to get my guests, they were getting ready to seat my ppl. in a booth that my Mom who was in a walker had to climb up into and my friend with oxygen had to climb as well and slide around. What would you think. On top of it this young sassy hostess was rude and certainly did NOT know how to handle  ADA compliant guest(s) Someone needs to teach her and some of the wait staff procedures. I have been a meeting planner and F/B person for 20+ years. We were very glad to go next door, have a great seat, super hostess that was totally on it and and an excellent waitress. I am not a complainer knowing this business very well. I just was compelled as this put me over the top with the crappy attitude some staffing can have. She was more concerned with her short outfit pulling it down as she walked than she was accommodating loyal repeat guests. You will not see me there for a long time and will surely not bring my Corporate Group Business either. .........Train staff!!!"}
{"text":"But, when a weekly customer 2-yrs now, is told the asparagus wasn't cooked properly by grill man..........some concession should be made on the bill!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. The food is original. The roasted chicken was delicious . So was the angus burger and ahi salad. Music was a bit too loud. Especially for lunch."}
{"text":"The food, the ambiance, the staff were amazing. I had the pork chop and it was so much food. They brought us the key lime pie and the brownie and they both were so delicious. I will be coming back here often. PS, the appetizer and the dessert were free."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food. Cheese, wings, nuts. Good beer. Great service. We were looking for a place to have a beer and snack. This was perfect"}
{"text":"I just loved this place. The Brussels sprouts are very good, I had the veggie of the day (oven roasted broccoli with feta and champagne vinaigrette that day) and it was just amazing! The shrimp and grits are the best grits I've ever had. We were with a group of six and all ordered different things and each of us loved our food."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for a quick lunch. They focus on Southern cuisine but they definitely have something for everyone. The service is mediocre (a little slow) but I've never had a problem worth mentioning.  I've tried a ton of their appetizers, sandwiches and entrees and everything is great.  I'd highly recommend the Southern Shrimp & Grits, very fresh shrimp and sauteed vegetables on a plate of their jalapeno and cheddar grits."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Angie the server was fantastic. Food was excellent had the short ribs. It's got a  really cool fib"}
{"text":"Great food and service!! The server, Bryan, was very attentive and polite. He offered suggestions to the choices in the menu that were great choices."}
{"text":"You know how you've passed by a place and it just there and you would never think to try it?? Well I'm glad I did try Grassroots. I loved the open atmosphere of the restaurant. Really cool vibe. The hidden treasure is the amazing food. This gets an OMG so delicious. We started with two appetizers. The tuna poke and the wings both absolutely delicious especially the poke. The best I've ever tasted. It left me wanting more. For my entree I had the blackened red fish with a dirty orzo. The fish was cooked perfectly. My friends had the braised short ribs with jalapeño grits. The grits were smooth and creamy and no spicy at all. The short ribs were in a delicious gravy. We also had at out table the chicken sandwich and the shredded short rib sandwich which my friends said was also delicious. To top off the meal we had the brownie with toffee pieces and a caramel drizzle with a scope of vanilla ice cream that we shared. What a perfectly delicious meal. I very highly recommend Grassroots. Service with a smile and the food to back it up."}
{"text":"Well, this place obviously has plenty of great reviews already, but I'll throw my 2 cents in as well.  Happened to try this place out on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised. The fish sandwich was very good, and the jalapeno cheddar grits that I chose as the side REALLY had me hooked. Combined with the Prosciutto-wrapped asparagus app, and we knew we were coming back. On our return visit we went for the shrimp & grits entree to split, and an appetizer sampler from their happy hour menu that had a couple bbq ribs, pork belly, and a couple other items. Again, everything was amazing. (also, they have some great cocktails that are well priced at $6 each if you get there for HH. if it's not happy hour, i suggest splitting a carafe of Sangria.)  I will say, this place can be expensive if you get carried away (it's hard not to) or go for one of the higher-priced entrees, but there are plenty of well-priced options. Also, everything I've tasted has exceeded expectations and justified the price."}
{"text":"Highly recommend it. Get yourself a refreshing beverage like the woodchuck pear cider from Vermont or the Georgia iced tea. Start with the 85259 creamy burrata. Then move on to the Carolina Baby Back which are fall of the bone delicious. Then finish it off with the Chocolate Toffee Brownie and you will leave satisfied.     We tried a good portion of the menu and had no complaints. Make sure you try this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this place over a dozen times - I have tried everything on the menu and EVERYTHING has been amazing.  Seriously, have you ever been to a place that everything on the menu is not just good but amazing?  If not, go to Grassroots - the absolute better than best, I mean it.  Go now!"}
{"text":"Went here with 2 of my work colleagues, we are from out of town. I had the brisket, with grits and beans, and added a side of fries. It was amazing. Everyone I was with enjoyed their meals. The service was very pleasant! We enjoyed it a LOT."}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night. Food was very good. I had the ribs and chicken and my wife had the shrimp po boy. Both were excellent. My only complaint would be that the bartenders were so busy serving drinks for the rest of the restaurant that their attention to us at the bar was not that great."}
{"text":"Asked the front desk receptionist at my hotel where her favorite restaurant within the 5 mile radius of the free hotel shuttle is.  She mentioned a few options and that this was her favorite.    I looked online and they showed they had gluten free options so I was in.  Turned out to be a good choice!  They have quite a few options and even offer a gluten free bun.  I got the brisket and jalapeño grits with baked beans.  The waitress said the grits weren't spicy and she was right which was good because I don't like spicy food.  The grits were delicious! The brisket was good, but a bit dry.  I've definitely had better and that's why I can't give this 5 stars.  Overall it was a good meal and I would return."}
{"text":"I found Grassroots because I was hungry on a Sunday at 8pm and they were still open. I'm so glad I found them. The food was wonderful, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the music was great too. The whole environment was welcoming and well designed. I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Ate last night there. This place is relaxing and a great community hangout. The drinks are good and food is always delish. We try different things and always love it. Ribs, Salads, Salmon and appetizers. Service is always good. Patio is enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a restaurant.  We visited twice during our week vacation to Scottsdale.  Everything was amazing, especially short ribs and pork ribs!!"}
{"text":"Probably the freshest, most tasty Ahi tuna I've had.  Excellent atmosphere and attentive staff.  Oh, did I mention they have Abita Purple Haze on tap?  Come spend some time at this gem!"}
{"text":"Oh wow!! The reviewers do not lie. I am still sitting here, but couldn't wait to share. This place is truly superb; the best fish sandwich I've ever had. My husband got the vegetable plate, and I couldn't stop stealing bites. We were stuffed, but talked into the key lime pie. Please, just come here. There is absolutely no way you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"The raw onions in the Waldorf salad was a little too intense for me but their Brussels sprouts were wonderful!"}
{"text":"I lived a bike ride away from the location in Scottsdale and was so sad to move.  Well I moved to the Biltmore and I'm again just a bike ride away thanks to the new location!  Dad's grocery bag is My fave! The burger is really good as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after seeing the great ratings online and I'm so happy that we did! Service and food were fantastic, Christina was our server and she was very accommodating. We will be back next time we're are in town."}
{"text":"I love Grassroots Scottsdale, so I was thrilled when a second location opened closer to home. Love the decor, the food and the people/service. I have yet to have anything less than a perfect experience at both locations.   Tip: Order the Tuna Poke and the Burrata apps, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Grassroots - the big booths, the menu, and the staff. Our latest outing we had Marina Joy as our waitress, and she is the best! She was very quirky. I've never considered phoning a restaurant to request a waitress, but I would for Marina. I am in love with the cole slaw here, and their white sangria pitcher is amazing!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday night and the place was moderately busy. Our server was great - he gave us lots of time to hang out/talk but was always around is we needed anything at all. Two of us ordered a pitcher of white sangria (strong and delish!) and we shared a Dad's Grocery Bag between the three of us. The best was yummy (but would be nicer if it was actually sliced all the way through - we kind of mangled it), the meats and cheeses were too notch and the olives and nuts were a nice addition. For dinner two of us ordered the brisket and one ordered the chopped salad. The brisket and jalapeño grits, particularly when eaten together, were AWESOME. The chopped salad was also crazy good! For dessert we shared slices of coconut cream and key lime pie. Both were 100% perfect."}
{"text":"Been going there since they opened. Food has become inconsistent, wine pours are short  &pricy, what passes for background music is nothing but noise. Owner needs to spend more time here & get his act together."}
{"text":"Nom!  Picked this place to eat on the eve of my man's birthday and was very impressed!  Great variety in the menu - everything from comfort food to omega-3 power plates.  We started off with the prosciutto-wrapped asparagus - it's worth the twelve or so dollars.. the asparagus spears are HUGE. With a fabulous grilled char on the asparagus and prosciutto and maple syrup for dipping, what wasn't to love?  I ordered the cobb salad - a tad bit too much dressing but otherwise delicious. Lots of yummy flavors; bleu cheese, onion, cherry tomatoes tossed with a creamy garlic dressing.   My fiance went with the brisket (savory and succulent) and jalapeno grits (OMG - party in my mouth).  Great service. We ordered the banana split for dessert and blue cheese stuff olives to-go for me (my secret indulgence).  We will definitely be back. Thank you Grassroots :)"}
{"text":"Fresh menu and great service. Try the jalapeño cheese grits! Hubby loved the chicken salad and slaw which had a nice sesame dressing. Nicer atmosphere but still casual. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Easter: I made reservations ahead and updated them with a total of 8. They had not read my note and said they could not give us the patio. They did not offer other options but seated 8 in a booth for a maximum of 6. Love the food and the servers but really dislike the hostesses. Second time and second issue with getting a table for the number of people you have."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been here. Lauren our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. She was amazing with the wine selection. Right on target. She painted each meal as If she was an artist. The chicken was moist. The salmon perfectly cooked. The salads and vegetables were made to perfection. This is a must eat restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh  The sliders are ok and the burrata  Fishiest salmon dish ever. All 6 people hated it.  Service was blah"}
{"text":"Jalapeños cheddar grits are amazing!! Must try. Bacon beans were delicious too. I had the Cardiff Salad I believe.. Poached shrimp, avocado, corn, radish topped with a Louie dressing. I ordered more dressing because it was really light but overall delicious. One of the best bloody Mary's I have ever had. We also had a grapefruit martini on the rock, amazing! Loved the atmosphere and happy to go back and try their happy hour."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible and the service was even better. The Brussel sprout appetizer is heavenly. I don't even like Brussel sprouts but could eat an entire plate of these! My filet was cooked to perfection. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Me and my son had a great veggie salad with tons of diversity but no leaves which was different for a change.     The brisket sandwich was delicious.  I couldn't finish it after the large salad but I sure wanted to.  Lots of rich flavor!  My son had shrimp and grits and he reported they were excellent as well.  Staff was friendly, and the kitchen is on display (which always says a lot about a restaurant)  We enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"You've got to eat here!  The food was absolutely delicious.  I had the Roti & Rib combo, rotisserie chicken breast,  1/2 rack of ribs, tangy slaw (with a hint of sesame oil oh so yummy) and jalopeno grits that were not spicy at all and were delicious with great jalopeno flavor. Don't let the price deter you; good food is worth the price."}
{"text":"I need another visit before I really know.  I went for happy hour and tried the Piggly Wiggly (a lovely nod to my Midwest upbringing)    The asparagus was okay, the prosciutto rather salty.  The ribs were tender but not much flavor.  the port belly was really tough and dried out.   Whatever sauce was served with it was too salty.  I could not figure out why the crusty bread.   it did not go with anything.   At least with a soft bread I could have put some of the meat in it.  It felt completely disjointed and just things put on a plate.    Service was wonderful, ambiance delightful.    It really calls for a return visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. The food is always fabulous and fresh and creative. The menu is constantly evolving. Tonight we dined on prosciutto-wrapped asparagus with maple syrup drizzle, and dessert was a decadent brownie toffee concoction. Great music and vibe, delicious food, attentive service: I love this place!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Had a great martini, chicken with sausage rice, beautiful half salad, and finished it off with great coffee and a wonderfully decadent brownie topped with ice cream.  A fabulous lunch.  Crowded but not noisy!"}
{"text":"Yelp hasn't disappointed me yet. Excellent dinner here. Great atmosphere, tasty food and attentive service. I had brisket and hubby had ribs."}
{"text":"Great menu. Great service. Very clean atmosphere. Prices were affordable & wine on tap is awesome. Our server Michael was attentive, personable & very knowledgable. We came in right before the kitchen closed but he didn't  rush us. It was a very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Came here with a friend for happy hour (or \"social hour\" as they call it) on a Saturday. At 3pm, the place was fairly empty. We got ourselves a booth. We ordered the piggly wiggly [$9] and the wings [$5] from the happy hour menu. We also ordered a side of shoestring fries.  The wings came out and they were nice and small and crispy pieces. I would order these again, esp for the price and utaste. The piggly wiggly came out and it was a half size set of ribs, two pieces of pork belly, four pieces of toasted bread w/ homemade jam, and two bacon wrapped asparagus. The pork belly melted in your mouth.  I would definitely come back again! The total for the three dishes was $20. The service was great and at that time, it was quite nice since it wasn't packed.  At the end of the meal, we received two coupons for two free scoops of ice cream at Sweet Provisions. When we went next door to claim our free desserts, we were able to use the ice cream coupon for a bar."}
{"text":"If you can get past the bitchy receptionist, the food is fairly decent. Let me preface my statement; we met a couple of friends here for an early dinner on a Sunday late afternoon with our 5 month old. The receptionist tried to insist that we sit in a booth that logistically would not have worked with the baby carrier and comfortably facilitate four adults. If you have kids, you understand what I'm talking about. I nearly got into an argument with the TWIT that we needed the extra space for comfort and basically had to just walk over to one of their crescent booth tables and plop our stuff down. A place of this caliber really should make better strides at hiring staff that possess a little common sense. Moving on.... the food is great, the atmosphere is nice. Our waitress was pleasant, she didn't go out of her way to make us feel overly comfortable or welcomed. I think next time we decide to go out we'll think of another location merely because of the sub par overall service we received. Don't these people realize that the consumer ALWAYS wins...?"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place through Yelp. What a great find! Our dinner was outstanding. I had the Rosti and Ribs combo and my lady had the Farmers Vegetable Chop salad. They have an excellent beer selection and their desserts were killer - key lime pie and coconut cream pie. Our waiter, Marina Joy, was a delight and was always available for our every need.  One of the services we enjoyed was that every employee in the restaurant offered service to you even if you were not at their table. If you needed a drink refill or a dirty plate removed, a waiter took care of you. I had the opportunity to visit with the owner a bit and was impressed with his restaurant experience and customer service attitude. He also owns the nearby Twisted Grove Parlor. If we lived in the area, this would be near the top of our go-to places."}
{"text":"It's family owned, fantastic customer service from all wait staff and bartenders, and everything on the menu we've had is wonderful! It's the kind of place where, you can also eat at the bar, and the people around you are friendly and often are repeat customers. There's young and old that go here.  Last Saturday night, while eating at the bar, the bartender briefly forgot about my 2nd draught beer, and felt bad enough to where he apologized and said that one was on him. That's good old fashion customer service that'll keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and was really impressed! Very good happy hour menu! The smoked salmon dip is a MUST! Can't wait to go back and try more on their menu. Service was also great and really fast."}
{"text":"We decided to try Grassroots last night for an early Sunday dinner.  It was a great choice. I started with the Club salad. It was filled with nice chucks of bacon, and had a great garlicky dressing. My wife had the Farmers salad, and enjoyed it as well. For an entree, I had the shrimp and jalapeño grits. I'm not usually a shrimp guy, but thought I would give it a try. The shrimp was tangy and tasty, and the grits had a great kick. My wife had the evening's special, the blackened Halibut with a cold orzo. I tasted it too, and it was yummy. Overall, an excellent meal. The staff was welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"A good local hangout slightly above average food.  Have met friends here several times and everything is fine. It is more convenient than anything"}
{"text":"Been back many, many times.  The roasted asparagus continues to be a favorite.  And I have discovered a perfect grapefruit martini (well, I discovered 2 of them last night!).  I took my colleague and she also tried a grapefruit martini and then got a second one :-)  Always nice service and I see that they have contained the patio with heaters for the \"winter\"."}
{"text":"What a great find!  I live close by and decided to stop in for lunch.  The Chicken Walnut Salad sandwich was incredible...very tasty.  Huge sandwich!  The Ahi Tuna Salad was delightful, with a yummy miso vinaigrette and crunchy wasabi peas.  I will definitely go back to try dinner!"}
{"text":"I tried Grassroots last weekend - convenient location, friendly little spot, and great decor. Loved the ice-cold water, with no ice. I have this thing about worrying ice is always dirty. Anyhow, the ribs and shoestring fries were super good. I had a taste of the roasted chicken and it was also pretty good. Very moist and tender. I definitely want to go back and try more. A little on the higher end of price range, but nothing at all unreasonable for the quality of food. I always love when things are locally sourced as well, makes the eating feel so much cleaner."}
{"text":"Amazing, original, and very fresh food. Menu is very creative. We had the tuna poke appetizer, smoked brisket sandwich and ahi tuna sandwich and all was so incredibly yummy. The fries rival any truffle fries anywhere. Above the great food was very attentive and kind service. Our waiter, Dillon, was so helpful, quick, friendly and attentive. He anticipated what we needed throughout our meal. One thing I cannot stand when I choose to spend money at a restaurant is when the wait staff act like you are a bother to them. We tip based on service, but also on attitude. I really appreciate someone who looks you in the eye and doesn't just take your order as if roiling their eyes because they just got another table. Great job, Dillon. We would definitely come back for the food, but will also hopefully be there when Dillon is too!"}
{"text":"On our last night of vacation we decided to check out the Grassroots Kitchen. We sat at a high top table, inside cause it was a little chilly out. But the restaurant is so open we felt like we were outside!  Super comfortable environment!  They had a few tv's playing monday night football, but the Tv's did not distract from the elegance of the place!   Ash had a big old burger, which looked and smelled amazing! I had the portabello sandwich which was almost like a melt, minus the cheese.. But I dug the toasted bread and the fries were fantastic as well!   Prices were good, service was great, and they even had Pumpkin Pie for desert which I pretty much forced Ashley to get just so I could smell it!  It was topped with fresh whipped cream and cinnamon!  Looked amazing!  This is a good spot!    I dug the bathrooms with classic Rolling Stone Magazine's in Frames but I could have done without the one with 9/11 on the cover!   TOTAL Bummer while washing my hands!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place excellent food excellent staff recommend the braised ribs and prime rib"}
{"text":"The BBQ ribs were very moist and  delicious! The brownie dessert was very tasty as well. Although, the coleslaw was a bit odd, and had a strong peanut flavor! Overall, very good dinner!"}
{"text":"Some days service great some times not. food great always"}
{"text":"We were in a middle of a move so had to stay a couple nights at the Talking Stick. We seldom get down here to eat/hang out so we wanted to take advantage.  Seen the previous reviews for this place and had to check it out. Glad we did and I will be back. Great food with a bonus of it being clean/healthy eating. Loved the environment."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to realize that the best seat in the house is at the bar, not only cause you're closer to the gates of heaven (i.e. the bartender), but you are almost always guaranteed the best service.  Maybe it's because the bartenders have a special way of dealing with folks but you also learn so much about the establishment.    As for the food, we ordered a relatively new menu item called sea smoke salad - salmon with orzo, arugula, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and a bunch of other heavenly things.  It was light yet satisfying! We also ordered the shrimp po'boy and in lieu of fries, we opted for the jalapeño cheddar grits---yummm!   I wish we lived closer so we can try the rest of all this good stuff! Stop by...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The blackend fish sandwich, and stepford wife bartendar are unbelievable.  Instead of fries, diverisfy and try the slaw or grits. Tip:  If you're hunting for elk, hang your tree stand higher than eye level..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick, healthy lunch and had the cutest server ever. She was super friendly and let us know all about their specials! We had the fresh Burrata to start which is a must have when you dine here!  We also ordered salads which are always delish, along with their special tri-colored cauliflower and the Brussels Sprouts.  The presentation was mouth watering, however the Brussels were a bit over charred along with the garlic so it was a tad bitter and would have loved some more bacon.  Everything else including the service was exceptional! I love this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I had Ganelle as our server the other night and this was probably one of the best customer service we've had in a very long time! She had great recommendations and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After a long day of holiday shopping we found ourselves at Grassroots Kitchen and Tap.  It was still early, so the place was quiet and had open seating.  It was a no brainier for me: the Shrimp Po' Boy. After several trips to NOLA I've become a big fan of this simple yet delicious sandwich.  Man, Grassroots did not disappoint, it was mouth watering!!  All the elements were spot on!  The perfectly fried shrimp, the right consistency baguette, delicious pickle slices and that amazingly delicious nola remoulade!! The french fries were also delicious and the extra side of remoulade for dipping was the icing on the cake!! A tasty and amazing sauce can take great food and elevate it to the next level, that's what this remoulade did for me!  I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually start with the service. Like a good umpire, if he's doing his job right you shouldn't notice him, right? Well sometimes the service is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable, they can and should be part of the experience. So Kudos to the team and their leaders. I like pig and their pork belly is a true joy. Shrimp and grits is the way you get it in Charleston, very creamy and spicy. They're proud of their key lime pie, and should be. It is a favorite dish of ours, and now theirs is at the top of our list. Not cheap, but good value. We think it noses out Southern Rail in the same market niche."}
{"text":"Nice laid back atmosphere,  covered patio nice, happy hour wings brings a huge bowl, h hr smoked brisket sliders very good, entree smoked salmon is a large chunk of protein that is just great, and the blackened fish sand is nice and moist, to top things off we had the coconut cream pie wow!"}
{"text":"Great service great food.  Pork Belly.   Again I say PORK BELLY. I had the chicken it was the best I have had.  My wife had brisket sandwich, all together an amazing experience. You don't know what good is until you try it."}
{"text":"Great service from Taylor and recommendation to try the Omega Salmon Sandwich.  Awesome flavor and salmon was delicious.  Look forward to trying another special soon!"}
{"text":"The food was deliciously and service was great!  There were 9 of us so they put 2 servers on our table.  Everyone loved their food!  I had the ribs and chicken combo which was delicious!  The sides were amazing too!  I had the orzo and the beans.  There was 3 of us celebrating birthdays and they comped us 2 desserts for the table which we got the brownies.  They were huge and delicious!  We all split them and still had leftovers..."}
{"text":"Great salads and sandwiches. They offer two sizes for salads and soups so you can create your own soup/salad combo. Children's menu isn't printed but the server will run through the choices and make adjustments as needed.   As great as the food was, the service was average. It seems from other reviews that this is a familiar pattern. Fortunately the cooks and chef are great."}
{"text":"Basically a Chilis.  The service was eh.   Only two tables of people in here and it took 15 min to get service.  It smelled like cleaner.    It was freezing inside.  But the food was great!  All the beef dishes are excellent.  Just stick with that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner and was quite impressed with our dinners. The staff was friendly, helpful and welcoming, especially our waiter Mark. He recommended the swordfish with a citrus and butter sauce special served with a cauliflower, white raisin, walnut, scallions and honey mustard sauce. It was cooked perfectly and very tasty. My daughter had the Waldorf chicken salad. Prepared lovely and chicken was tender and tasty. Nice dressing."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, a must try spot!! Fresh oj or lemonade for $3, beer for $5, add chicken to a salad for only $2, and all the ingredients are farm fresh New Orleans style. Lot's of flavor, I had the portobello mushroom burger and it came on this great focaccia bread and was cut in quarters so easy to eat. The brisket sliders are also quite good but a tiny bit heavy on the bbq sauce for me."}
{"text":"WOW! ! What a great first time dining experience. Everything from the time I walked into the restaurant was perfect! ! My waiter was spot on with great service and my meal was awesome.  I had the Carolina ribs, I can honestly say they were the best I ever had. Then the manager was nice enough to treat our table to free deserts, I had the home made key lime pie that was as good as I ever had.  I'll be back, thanks for the great meal!#"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend on a weeknight and noticed it wasn't busy at all, there were maybe three other groups there. The waitress was very attentive and pleasant. When our first appetizer came out the bread was black and I had a really hard time biting into it. The jam that came with the burrata also wasn't for me, I don't think it paired well at all with the cheese and arugula. Being that it wasn't a very busy night you'd think they could afford to not burn bread or at least start over. The salad I got was mediocre at best, my friend got the shrimp salad and said she did like hers. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the cocktail and key lime pie. Overall not a bad experience but for the price I would of expected better tasting food. There are so many restaurants in Phoenix you'd think places like this would want to step up their game."}
{"text":"First time in Arizona and we thought we would try! Very good, nice and open! Server was friendly! Wish we had this place where I live!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I like be feeling good about what I eat and this place made it easy. My husband and I were in town from California and this restaurant made us feel right at home."}
{"text":"Happy hour.  Social Hour.  My happy time.   No matter what you call it, Grassroots nails it!  Outdoor patio area to enjoy beautiful Arizona days?  Yes!  A pound and a half of chicken wings for $5?  Yes!  Sazeracs on special?  Yes!  A dish of pork heaven -- pork belly, pork ribs... pork pork and more pork?  Yes!  Oh lord, this is what Happy Hours are made of!  So now I am eager to come back and try the rest of the menu.  Will update my review at that time, but in the meantime, will definitely be back for more HH!  *****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"Very interesting menu; Good Food, but fare is overpriced."}
{"text":"Had a delicous blackened fish sandwich with slaw that came recommended by the very friendly bartender. The ambiance was nice and the selection of southern food was great."}
{"text":"Had the spitfire chicken, it was pretty good. Brownie was amazing and the beer and atmosphere is really good."}
{"text":"I had the grilled portobello with a side of asparagus and while it was okay, the bread did not taste fresh. Plenty of different beers to choose from and the staff was great. May check out again when in area."}
{"text":"Love it! I've \"introduced\" so many friends, business acquaintances to this restaurant and everyone has loved it. It can get busy so I've been door dashing it more lately. The farmers chopped salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"Decided to try this after finishing a long 2 day conference.  Very nice atmosphere... lively crowd, bit relaxed.  Great bar area, hightops and low, plus outside seating area.  My wife and I both had excellent lobster bisque appetizer cups, and shared the BBQ brisket, with sides of grilled asparagus and show string fries.  All was excellent.  Brisket was a somewhat dense meat w/ a thick layer of fat along the short slices of meat, so if you want a lean meat, this would not be for you, but is was tasty!! Nice sweet BBQ sauce.  Loved the grilled, giant asparagus.  And a really nice craft beer menu, with several of my favorites, O'Dells 90 Shilling Irish Ale.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. Undercooked, tough filet and rock hard, cold baked potato.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Since I have been off of work this past week, I have been trying to be good and going to hot yoga.... now, the only problem is my studio is right next to this place. Day after day I was tempted by their delicious barbeque -y smells wafting in my direction. Today, the husband and I went for happy hour. Very happy we did. The happy hour menu was good, food items under 10$ with large portion sizes. We split the piggly wiggly and the brisket sliders. The sliders were great, shredded brisket, bbq sauce, and a pickle... can't beat it... also, they were not cheap with the meat because of happy hour, the brisket was falling out of the buns. The piggly wiggly was a nice way to try a bunch of their offerings as it consists of pork belly, asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and some baby back ribs with bread and a spicy jam. I thought the pork belly was the weakest showing, with it having a lot of unrendered fat, but the meaty parts were good and that is kind of just the nature of pork belly, the asparagus was really good and had a tasty crumb on top of it, and the ribs were great, fall off the bone tender, and full of smokey flavor. We also got a couple of drinks... I got the gimlet, which was a tasty gin drink with basil and cucumber. The husband got a manhattan (his signature drink), but he thought it was just ok. The tab was 30$ after everything, so a pretty good deal. I would certainly recommend this place for happy hour."}
{"text":"The husband and I met my dad here for dinner tonight. I was excited to eat here after having gone to their new location a couple weeks ago. I would say that this location wasn't as good as the other. It wasn't bad, but the food did taste different. We had the sweet roll sliders with brisket which was much different than the other location. The brisket was sliced instead of chopped into smaller pieces and it was less saucy. It was still good, just different. We also got the happy hour wings, which were tiny and not very flavorful, the jalapeno grits which were not very flavorful either. We also had the waldorf salad which was really delicious and fresh. I would definitely get that again."}
{"text":"Honestly the best place I've eaten in Phoenix in a long long time. The food was off the hook. Had the appetizer of park belly with fresh tomato jam on toast pointes....delish. Shared the Waldorf salad with the pulled chicken....so many flavors...amazing. I will be back soon.  Service was terrific too."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the breadth of menu items at this energetic spot. You can choose from a variety of interesting sides to compliment your meal. I indulged in the Cajun Fish Sandwich with Dirty Orzo as my side. The fish was perfectly prepared with just the right amount of spice and paired with a zesty remoulade on a Brioche like bun. The Orzo made me feel like I was in N'Awlins. So many delicious lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"Total accident that we stumbled across this place. Amazing. Fantastic menu. As good as the food is, the service and hospitality are even better."}
{"text":"I have to give it one star...but I'd give it negative stars if I could.  I used to love this place...I brought many different friends there many different times and I am ashamed I did. Reason being for my review(and I've never 'yelped' before), my friends were treated awful there and not by just a server the manager/OWNER. I won't go into the details of the story; I will just sum it up.  Food was poorly prepared, brought to the attention of rude, incompetent server and then enter manager/OWNER. You'd think or hope he would be the one to save this situation but in fact he made it worse for my friends and him in the end because everyone we know will never give him our business or a second chance. He was rude, unwilling to fix or admit a situation, caused a situation that other patrons witnessed. Good luck"}
{"text":"My family and I just visited this wonderful place for dinner.  Very good vibe, amazing food, our server Marina was attentive, knowledgeable of the menu and the wine.  She was very eloquent and welcoming.  She conversed with us when appropriate.  The food was a wonderful addition to her exceptional service.  We will definitely tell others.  Thank you for a very nice evening with my family."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Grassroots!!  Consistently great service - the entire team is great.  Our friends from Chicago loved it.  Danny and Chuck are pure awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Sashimi Ahi Tuna Salad ...Perfection!!!! Wow! Wonderful food and great service! Domingo is awesome!"}
{"text":"Luckily for me it was a slow day, so we had exceptional service and no waiting.  I ordered the shrimp and grits. The grits were really cheesy and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I'll definitely be coming back here again to try something new."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my hubby for a celebratory drink and light dinner. The Georgia Iced Tea and Grassroots Gimlet were both really good - flavorful and refreshing. Gimlet was unusual and I will definitely get one again next time!  My husband got the Angus Burger (juicy and perfectly cooked), and my Smoked Brisket Baguette was delicious - perfect balance of sweet bbq and tangy coleslaw. We found the sides selections to be more creative than most places, and we enjoyed the pork-belly baked beans and the sauteed chard (a lovely big veggie serving).  The wait staff was friendly and helpful.  We'll be going here again, as it's very close to the OdySea Aquarium/Butterfly Wonderland!"}
{"text":"A great local neighborhood restaurant. Wait staff very friendly and helpful. The dishes we ordered were delicious, plating and taste. Nice selection of beers and wine  on tap. The best for last, the homemade KeyLime pie!"}
{"text":"First time yelp user ... I was introduced to the app while in San Antonio TX, on a business trip last week. Today I walked into my favorite barbershop and they were very busy so I decided to go eat lunch first. That's when I remembered Yelp!   Grassroots was across the street and had great reviews (I never would have thought to try this place, but I'm so very glad I did!) I had the \"Southern Shrimp & Grits\" and my Fiancée had the \"Root's BBQ Brisket\" both dishes were masterfully presented and the flavors ... Jalapeno Grits??! ... Mind = blown!   Thank you, I will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was a solid 4/5 at Grassroots Kitchen but the service did not quite match the food.   I also would not come here with vegetarians since they don't have many options (there was one mushroom sandwich, and one hot entree consisting of veggies and cheese). On the other hand, the meat eaters were pretty happy. We tried the pork belly appetizer, poke, prosciutto wrapped asparagus, redfish, salmon, short ribs, and seared ahi salad.   As for service, the servers were friendly but we had to really try to catch the attention of the server a few times to order, get drinks, and then the check. The one thing that brought our experience down though was the bug in one of the drinks. While the staff were understanding in taking it off the bill, it was an unpleasant surprise and really made us question the rest of our meals, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Waaaay overpriced for mediocre food. The restaurant  itself smells like an old house. We ordered a blackened fish sandwich, blackened fish plate, hamburger, salad, brisket sandwich,a beer, and waters (didn't even have ice in the water) at 1:00 pm for $119. None of us even finished our food because the taste definitely lacked. The fish got good reviews from those of us who had it. Also, the same exact piece of fish is used for the fish sandwich that was used in the Blackened fish plate, but the plate was almost $10 more than the sandwich, and came with dirty orzo which definitely want worth almost $10 more. The bathroom looked like it was minimally cleaned. It was kind of gross. Would never go here again. Could have had a really nice lunch elsewhere for the cost."}
{"text":"Only been here a couple times.  Best Short Rib I've ever had.  Sat at the bar both times and the service was on point and friendly.  Will be back navigate thru more of the menu in the near future!"}
{"text":"Grassroots really has it going on! We had sharing deal called poke something! Loved it. BBQ brisket was fab. Shannon didn't refill my water but she got a great tip anyway. What war had a flag that says Don't tread on me ?  No one knew even though it is in a huge frame prominantly displayed. Maybe I'll tell some day!"}
{"text":"Loved the patio seating.  Highly recommend both the CHARRED BRUSSELS SPROUTS and  COMMON GROUND BURRATA to start.  We had the BLACKENED RED FISH, ROOT'S BBQ BRISKET and GRILLED MISO SALMON.  All were wonderful.  Accompanying side dishes were delicious.  Do not skip the Coconut Cream Pie to finish.  Worth. Every. Single. Calorie.  Definitely returning and recommending."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant several times in the past receiving a not so warm reception. Service has consistently been slow but we thought we would give it one more try at lunch.   We entered the restaurant and the hostess was sitting at a table and munching on something. She did come over and take us to a table. We sat there for a good 20 minutes while wait staff were either bussing a table or talking. We did notice one waitress was waiting on a table on the outside patio.   Finally, we decided this wasn't working. We rose and there was another hostess? at the hostess station and a wait staff? girl as we walked by, I looked at both of them and said, \"We are leaving, we can't get waited on.\"  They looked at both myself and my husband with a discerning look like who cares. I immediately called Wally's Restaurant knowing who owned Grassroots, along with several other restaurants in his possession. I decided to call them because obviously there was no credible manager at Grassroots that day since it appeared no one was interested in our business. I left a message for the owner to call me and have never heard a word back.   What a shame that this establishment could care less about their customers. Since we are business owners, we thought they would be interested in our experience. Guess not.   Too many other great restaurants in the valley to choose from. Good luck. We won't return. Ever."}
{"text":"Grassroots has become one of my favorite spots.  The first time I dined here I had the Farmer's Chop salad.  I returned twice to have the same delicious meal.  Yesterday I met a friend for happy hour and decided to sample something new, so I ordered the Piggly Wiggly happy hour plate for $9.  Tender crisp, fat and tasty asparagus spears were wrapped in crispy prosciutto sitting on a slightly sweet reduction.  Pork Belly came with a very delicious tomato jam that made me overlook the slightly chewy texture of the belly.  The mini rack of back ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender.  I didn't eat the 4 slices of crisped bread because I asked for a side of bread that I preferred (very fresh ciabatta drizzled with EVOO).  I added the vegetable du jour:  broccoli (roasted? not sure about that) with feta on a puddle of champagne vinaigrette reduction.  There is a decent selection of craft beer on tap, and I ordered an extra hoppy one I hadn't tried before (don't recall the name).  The service was friendly, non-intrusive, and professional."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while and was looking forward to my favorite meal (Farmer's Chop Salad).  I started with a Bloody Mary which was just...okay.  I ordered a side of fries with my salad.  The fries were great; the salad was disappointing.  I can't put my finger on what was missing, but it just didn't measure up to previous times.  The ingredients seemed different and the dressing was flat.  Key Lime pie (from their bakery next door) was outstanding.  The service was polite/friendly.  This was a very average experience.  Overall I have had better experiences at the Camelback location."}
{"text":"Everything perfect.  Wish I didn't need to say more.  We stop in without a reservation. Was told there would be a 30 minute wait. Unless we wanted to sit outside. During the heat wave. But with the misting devices it was quite comfortable. The service was Beyond excellent. The food was so enjoyable from the dirty Orzo. Up to the ribs chicken and salmon. This slaw was so refreshing.  And the drinks were on sale. My wife loved the sangria. I highly suggest stopping here for a meal but make reservations first."}
{"text":"First time & we enjoyed every bite. We noticed that all the employees seem to enjoy working here.  Our server Marina, just could not have been better.  She was happy to explain all the items we asked about on the menu & encouraged us to try some new things.  The shrimp Po boy was the best we have ever had.  I'm not in the habit to give 5 stars but this experience here was excellent."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the Phoenix area. It has a diverse and friendly menu, from salads to steaks to mac n cheese and delicious dessert pies. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We just had a delightful evening dining at Grassroots and much of that pleasurable visit had to do with our conscientious server, Aiden.  The food was described and served tastefully and Aiden was most attentive with drink refills, requests for anything beyond the end of our meal and at no time hurried us , in spite of the fact that our visit lasted nearly two hours.  Thank you, Grassroots! See again soon!"}
{"text":"After our drive back from Sedona...my BF suggested coming here for Happy Hour and boy...am I glad I did! The food was great and the service was even better! The HH portion were pretty big. When I told the waitress it was my first time here and how much I loved the food...she surprised me with a key lime pie to take home. We even got to meet the owner...she was so sweet! (I won't hold it against her that she went to USC! J/p!)...she offered me a complimentary voucher to get a scoop of ice cream next door on National Ice Cream Day! Can't wait to come back or try their other restaurant Twisted Grove Parlor & Bar! So if you're looking for great food and service...gotta try them out when you're in town."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive, prompt service---our ice tea was never low!  Brisket sandwich melted in my mouth with fabulous flavor, grits & swiss chard were off the charts great.  4 of us shared the toffee brownie----it is a MUST HAVE!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way into Whole Foods, and such a treat! Seated in one of their comfy booths and anxious to try what appears to be a plethora of healthy menu items, and we were not disappointed.  Drinks were healthy, too...healthy pours, that is!  The show stopper was the brownie sundae, with fresh caramel topping and plenty of sweet vanilla ice cream atop a very generous cut of warm, gooie brownie...Soo delicsh!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was lousy. Our waitress definitely had an attitude. Although I have some dietary issues, no changes were allowed to the menu. It took several passes with the waitress so I could choose something that would not instigate a health issue. Atmosphere is nice, but if you don't have reservations you are seated by the kitchen. Worth visiting, but don't dare question the chef's palate."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere and excellent food make this spot much more than a good neighborhood haunt. One of the best in the North Scottsdale area. Nice outside patio, although it does open onto Hayden Road. On the noisy side, so not for intimate dining.Don't miss the key lime pie for dessert."}
{"text":"This place, located in an unassuming shopping mall, was amazing, to say the least.  I was celebrating my best friend's birthday and they managed to accommodate 20+ people. She's a popular lady (and no she does not poop out at parties!) so it was wonderful that they could fit everyone in and they did all of it with grace.  We had great service; food came out promptly, as did most drinks, and they were very attentive, as large groups of people almost never have anything ready to say at the same time.  The food though was absolutely wonderful. My soulmate had the petite filet and grilled jumbo asparagus. The steak was cooked per-fect-ly. I told them medium/medium rare and it was just right. I ordered the seared ahi with dad's slaw and heirloom salad. I swapped the bleu on the salad for goat cheese though, since bleu, in my opinion, is WAY too strong for the soft deliciousness of heirlooms. And everything was perfect. The ahi had a tangy brown sauce on it that paired really well with the fish.  The prices are reasonable for the absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked food, as well as for the drinks.  If I'm ever back in the Phoenix area, I will absolutely come here."}
{"text":"Let me just tell you... this place is FANTASTIC. My husband and I brought his parents here on Saturday night to celebrate my father-in-law's birthday. I made a reservation for 6:45 thinking there'd be a huge wait at that time but they seemed to be busy without being completely full, which was nice. We were seated out on the patio which was lovely until I later realized the mosquitoes had their own dinner plans and my leg was the main course.  ANYWAY.  I'd like to shout out to our server Sarah B. for being the best. And I'm not just saying the best like, \"yeah she was cool,\" but she really was THE BEST. My FIL joked before dinner that he had a \"dietary restriction\" that he just HAD to have key lime pie for dessert. She said she was sure she could make that happen, then after we finished our meals, told us that for the first time in her 4 years working there, they were ALMOST out of key lime pie... she threatened everyone else that if they touched the last piece of key lime pie they'd be in trouble. So she went to great lengths to make my FIL happy!  Enough yammering. Onto dinner!  - Pork Belly appetizer: with pancetta (because what more could you want with pork than more pork?) and a sweet and spicy tomato jam. YUM. - Miso Glazed Tuna: this was mine and I ate the ENTIRE thing, including the slaw and heirloom tomato salad (sub goat cheese for bleu because bleu and tomatoes do not go together in my world). I could bathe in that slaw.  - Salmon and a cobb salad: my husband's. He loved it. Salmon was cooked perfectly but he said the cobb stole the show. - Blackened Swordfish: MIL got the special and lerrrved it. - Hoisin Glazed Short Ribs: holy. motherfracking MOLY guys. FIL got this with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I was in love with my meal but this was just ridonkulously good. Almost wanted to send mine back just to have his. - Bottle o' Wine: Russian River pinot noir. I know... I go to Arizona just to drink California wine, but whatever, it's in my blood.  We also had coffee and a toffee brownie sundae for dessert and it was all just as good as the rest. So SO sooooo yummy. Damn. I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a post movie dinner and left with a new destination for some great dining.   Atmosphere - We sat out on the patio but would have felt comfortable inside as well. There are TV's around the bar if you want to keep up on sports and the music volume was at a perfect level.  Service - A highlight. Great service by our waitress but they work as a team so anyone would pick up an empty dish or run some food. All were helpful with any questions and pleasant.   Food - Everything we tried on this visit was outstanding and there is more on the menu that we want to try. Started with apps from the Social Hour menu Piggly Wiggly - an trial of the ribs (outstanding), prosciutto wrapped asparagus (cooked to a perfect char) and the highlight was the fried pork belly that was accompanied by the a candied pancetta & maple glaze ; Common Ground Burrata - a great place of toast, burrata, spicy tomato jam and green, it was great. Off the menu we had the braised short ribs which were cooked perfectly, a good serving and a reduced au jus that added great flavor along with the Charred Brussels Sprouts that came in a great presentation with bacon & balsamic. The Brussels Sprouts are a dish to go back for.  We've walked past this restaurant a few times, and now glad we stopped in because we'll be back, very soon."}
{"text":"Still think the food here is great! But I'm updating to note that I would not recommend this restaurant for groups larger than 8.  Most (if not all) of the tables in the dining area are bolted to the floor, so it's not possible to push tables together to accomodate a big group.  The best they can do is seat you at the two high-top tables next to each other -- but there is a big clunky pole in between the tables which makes interaction between the two tables really difficult.  It's possible they could accomodate a big group on the patio, but they did not have misters on that day and there was no way I was sitting out in that heat! :P"}
{"text":"Great restaurant great service friendly atmosphere. Good variety on the menu plus a good happy hour. Is a cousin of Wally's pub same owners. Definitely worth checking out. Had the burger and fries which were excellent and my buddy had the brisket sandwich which was excellent as well."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! Excellent food and a great atmosphere. The Club salad is amazing. The ribs are fall off the bone and brisket sandwich is delicious! McCormick Ranch is lucky to have Grassroots here! I read an earlier post that received a one star rating, which could not be farther from the truth! the owner prides himself on making sure the patrons have a pleasurable dining experience. They have a great bar to gather at, but they do not and will NOT tolerate drunken and obnoxious behavior.  I appreciate this, because as someone who enjoys having a great meal and drink, I do not appreciate sloppy and loud drunk people around me ruining my dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here for an interview lunch and wasn't disappointed!  I didn't even realize that we had a Southern-style restaurant right around the corner from our place.  The entrees are quite pricey, but I got the feeling that most people in the restaurant were eating on their companies' dimes - tons of fancy-looking people in suits on their lunch breaks.    I took Yelp's advice to heart and ordered the Shrimp&Grits.  I ran off to a dentist appointment immediately after the meal, so I'm pretty sure this was the worst thing I could have ordered.  My dental hygienist may have intentionally been more painful than normal to torture me for forcing her to deal with my garlic breath while she struggled to remove the tiny grit-particles from my teeth.  I really liked the iced tea, which was refilled multiple times from a mason jar.  The burrata was delicious.  I could have eaten that entire thing as a meal.  All in all, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"So what if I've sold my soul for the piggly wiggly appetizer plate? I love it and I will get it again and again and again. I discovered this amazing pork appetizer after work when I was making a quick Traders Joe's run but was too hungry to wait till I got home. I've sat up at the bar for most of my recent trips and have had the same bartender more than once. She was very attentive and recognized I hadn't been there before so gave a fair breakdown of the entire menu. It also seems like they have a handful of regulars who she knew by name and also what they order. It was late May so not exactly gumbo weather but I was excited to try it after learning that only makes it once a week. Back to the piggly wiggly though. Steroid pumped asparagus wrapped in prosciutto slightly salted. Some small cuts of pork belly with what almost seemed like huge bacon bits in a sweet maple type sauce. To top it all off was a generous serving of ribs with a sauce that allows  you to appreciate the meat and know that it did not come from any type of bottle . This appetizer plate also had some bread/toast and some jam. I usually end up with a pieces of toast and jam left but I'm sure If I chose to share it would all get finished.   I've only had dinner a few times here and its been a while. My guess is I had the chicken rib combo platter but its been a while. From the menu it also seems like the desserts are rather popular and they have a handful of homemade items that can be ordered to go. I'll probably update this review when I stay for a full dinner again but in the meantime long live the piggly wiggly!    ..... Just discovered the barrel aged cocktails # mind blown"}
{"text":"Hmmm, no Yelp listing yet, so I added it and I'll be the first! :)  I was heading to Cyprus Grill for lunch when I noticed that Grassroots had opened, so we decided to come here instead. (It's located in the old Baby Kay's in Town and Country.) It is nicely decorated, light and airy on the inside, and they had the windows open to the breezeway, which was nice.  Everyone who worked there was very attentive and polite.  I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and my friend ordered the Lobster Bisque to start, and the Romaine salad with chicken added for her meal.  My Po Boy was really good!  The shrimp were perfectly seasoned and fried.  It normally comes with fries, but you can substitute for any of the sides, so I ordered it with the Sautéed Chard -- very good!  My friend loved her Lobster Bisque and her salad.  My only \"complaint\" or suggestion, is to make sure they clean off the menus after each customer uses them.  The menu I had already had some food particles on it and the restaurant just opened.  But I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Green iced tea is amazing! I had the short ribs- sooooo good! Grits were ok as a side- nothing fantastic. Also, miso salmon with asparagus was super fresh and good. Kids menu is verbal, but really good- comes with grilled asparagus (which I inhaled), fries and grilled cheese - they have other options, too. Fries are delicious. I topped it off with the toffee brownie dessert- save room for this beauty!! Wow! So insanely good! Coming back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place was very good! The service was quite good and the food came out super quickly! We came on a weekend, so the place was pretty busy but we had a reservation so there was no wait time. Atmosphere: The restaurant was buzzing with conversation and the interior of the restaurant was well designed. I really liked how they gave us mason jars of water - I'm a sucker for drinking out of jars! Food: For appetizers, we got the burrata and the tuna poke. The burrata was great and the tomato jam that accompanied it was very good, although it was a bit sweet and did overpower the cheese a little bit. The poke was also good and well seasoned, but a little too sweet for my tastes. They also should've served more wonton crisps with it! For the entree, I got the shrimp and grits, which was excellent! I wish I hadn't eaten so much of the appetizers though because the portion was huge! There is a decent amount of shrimp, not too much, but the grits portion was huge and came with not one, but two pieces of focaccia. Talk about carbs on carbs! My family had the braised beef, the short ribs, and the pork belly. The braised beef and the short ribs were very similar in taste, but both were excellent! I found myself wishing I had ordered one of them instead of the shrimp. My brother said the pork belly was awesome, so I'll take his word for it! We didn't have any room for dessert, so I can't offer any advice on that! Overall, it was a good experience, especially if you like Southern cuisine!"}
{"text":"Lived is Scottsdale forever and just discovered Grass Roots. So far, been back 3 times. Especially like the BBQ ribs and brisket and the wings. Great service. Friendly staff. Lots lf competition in Scottsdale but this is on our shortlist."}
{"text":"The food and service here are quite good deserving of 4 stars.  Where they fail, and this is a big one for me, is that ll their iced teas are flavored.  Why do restaurants feel it is necessary to serve flavored teas?  If I wanted artificial or added flavor, I would have ordered a soda."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some early dinner and a beer, after driving by. Really glad we did- our meal was incredible. It's not a big place, but it has a fun atmosphere, decent sized bar, and lots of patio seating, which is nice starting this time of year. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal. Not a huge beer menu, but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint, $10/pitcher).   A smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that. Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better.   I got the burger, my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves. Both were very tasty. The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings. I like a burger topped with a few things, but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it.   The brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night. Great flavor in the meat, tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture. The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality.   We had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu, too. It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you. Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain, served with grilled asparagus and fries. We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries, which they easily accommodated, and she plowed through the hole thing. Minus the asparagus- but that's on her, not Grassroots :)"}
{"text":"The food was average. I ordered the NY steak & it wasn't that flavorful and didn't seem to be a good quality cut of meat. On the bright side the wine was good, the staff was nice & the side dishes were decent. The atmosphere was probably the best thing about the place. I might go back sometime to have a glass of wine, but I'm not interested in going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great concept & execution. They say the apple doesn't fall to far from the tree & the connection to Wally's is very clear but updated & refined. This blows away comp like lgoNo! & sam fox. Nice job Chris!"}
{"text":"The tuna poke is excellent! I haven't had anything from the menu that wasn't good. They also make a great white sangria."}
{"text":"Very nice. Stopped in one afternoon for a couple beers. We also had the burrata as an appetizer. The arugula was fresh and bitter, the burrata was creamy and decadent, the tomato jam was sweet and tasty, and the bread was crispy and delicious. All together, it was a perfect combination. It was a great accompaniment to our drinks.  Service was good. I wish we were hungrier because the menu looked great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like Grassroots for several reasons:  1. Good service. Everyone is nice, attentive, and the recommendations are usually very good. 2. Happy hour, or as they like to call it, social hour, features several good appetizers and drinks at reasonable prices. Some happy hours don't really seem like a good deal but Grassroots does a nice job. 3. Lots of tasty, light beers on tap that go well with the year round warm to hot Phoenix weather. 4. Burrata is yummay and I love the accompanying sweet tomato chutney. The sliders are actually really good and the beef is moist and tender.  Give it a go. There's something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"We just happened to be traveling and passing through and needed lunch before we hit the airport. The reviews looked promising so my lady and I decided to check it out. Everything was wonderful, from the pork belly appetizer, our main courses, and the drinks. And a big thanks to Kate who was helping out with our needs and recommendations of how to kill time before our flight."}
{"text":"Fantastic visit here for a birthday celebration with my grown kids. Patio was perfect. We each enjoyed our meal choices. Brisket sandwich, roasted veggie plate, and my favorite seared scallops served over grits. Wonderful flavors! Fresh and tasty. The caramel brownie desert was happily devoured even as stuffed aa we were from our entrees."}
{"text":"its good enough to back again - seafood is fresh and tasty. Aircondiyioning works, nice clwan bathrooms, great wait staff uniforms, easy parking , cosy . reasonably priced. we tried it based on yelp review n it was good"}
{"text":"Oh those chicken wings... worth the detour on my way home from work! Whether having lunch, happy hour or dinner (take out ) this place is awesome and the service amazing! Best of all is that for years the quality of the food or service hasn't gone down but up!"}
{"text":"On vacation from San Diego,  wanted to treat our babysitter who is attending Grand Canyon University,  the lace we tried was closed for a summer break,  so quickly switched it up to here.   Glad we did.   We had the pork belly app,  we all liked it a lot,  very unique with the spicy tomato jam.   I had the Mississippi salmon,  it was probably the best cooked salmon I have had,  not dry and not raw,  just the perfect middle.   Our guest had the portobello sandwich,  which was huge and very good.   Daughter had a hamburger,  which she loved,  she is picky.   The fries are the skinny ones with the perfect texture,  I kept getting in trouble for stealing them.   My husband had the brisket,  very good as well,  and too much even for him.   He said the jalapeño cheddar grits were super good too.   For dessert they brought and comped for my daughters b-day the Toffee Brownie,  which like the salmon was cooked to perfection, and even though giant in size somehow disappeared off the plate.   Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. I went for lunch and started off with the pork belly appetizer. It was prepared perfectly and it was very filling.  For my entree, I had the Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna sandwich with asparagus. The Ahi Tuna is prepared rare and tasted amazing. The asparagus was grilled and crunchy with a perfect amount of sea salt.   Great place to go for lunch. Ample seating both inside and the outside patio. Great service too."}
{"text":"Every aspect of our experience was beyond delightful.  Our server was a joy, knew her menu, and read us perfectly. Her suggestions, based on our initial interests, created a perfect meal!  The food was cooked to perfection, and served timely. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. I ordered the rainbow trout, it was bland, salty and just not great. My friend got the spit fire chicken, chicken was good moist and had flavor. The grits on the hand was blah and not good. Asparagus was great. The atmosphere was nice, the place was super cute. Friendly great staff. I'll comeback just to try other things. Not a very large menu but worth another shot."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Poke. All our choices were flavorful and fresh.  Service was outstanding from start to finish. Kid friendly in a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre.  I had the roasted chicken and another person  in our party had the shrimp po\"boy.  The service was terrible, and our server really never checked back with us about how our meal was.  The Henry and Paul Martin's  food and service is much better for very comparable prices."}
{"text":"Poke with shrimp and awesome smokey smoked salmon. Will have to come back and work through the rest of the menu. Great service!"}
{"text":"The brisket here was actually fairly thick cut with a layer of fat on them. I thought it was pretty unique, and it was pretty flavorful and smoky. The sides here were pretty unique and worth checking out - my order came with jalapeño cheddar grits (pretty good!) and pork belly baked beans (even better!). I really enjoyed both sides and was pretty satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"I loved this place! When we got there, the wait was about 15 minutes, which makes sense because we didn't have a reservation and it was Friday night. It was hard to choose what to eat because I'm a veggiterean who hates salads. Luckily, there is some seafood I eat, and shrimp is on top of that list. The shrimp was amazing! Our waiter was also very kind. The food was very filling- the most I've ate in days! I decided to get the root beer float while my sister got the brownie and my mom the the pecan pie. We all loved our deserts! The waiter even paid for the brownie for us because it was our first time there! I recommend this place! The ambiance reminded me of a romantic picnic in a forest!"}
{"text":"Food: A-  why? A little pricey, still very good, not incredible  Service: B --the weird aprons and shirts. Multiple experiences with awkward looking waiters covered in stains Happy hour: A-  would be an A+ (great deal) except there is no happy hour menu. Need to pull it up online.   Would recommend to friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. A little pricey but pretty good. BBQ sandwhich was really good and cole slaw was as well. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch. They had my favorite kind of fries--skinny and crunchy without being too hard or burnt. I got the portobello mushroom sandwich, which tasted great with lots of flavors. The bf ordered the brisket, which he enjoyed.   Our waters were constantly refilled, and service was wonderful overall. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away, host and server were friendly! Food was good- we had a burger and a smoked brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant. The food and service were wonderful. We ended up here because of a bad experience at another locale on New Year's Day. Boy or boy, we were so glad we came to Grassroots Kitchen and Tap. The decor is lovely, the service was outstanding, and the food was Deeeeeeelish. They sure know how to treat you right. I also, loved the music they were playing.  I had the Chicken Salad sandwich with their specialty Cole Slaw. It was all great! My friend had a hamburger. He mentioned it was outstanding. He wanted it cooked a certain way and they did not fail to please. Not only did it get cooked correctly the chef and server made a point of getting it right and checking up with us to see how they did. I was very impressed. They know food here.  Sadly, I did not get a chance to try that burger. I almost swiped it off my buddies plate. Ha, I will have to go back and try it since I am a sucker for a great burger. Other friends had fish meals and they said all was yummy! The fries by the way are tasty here. I did swipe a few of those. Shhhhh, don't tell. They are cooked to perfection too. My other friend called them crack on a plate. Brawha!  Thank you Grassroots for a lovely holiday get together with my NY Peeps."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great and the food was delicious! I can't say we loved the hipster vibe or the incredibly RUDE drink server guy, but we may go back for the food."}
{"text":"I had the Portabello sandwich with shoestring potato fries. The atmosphere was pleasant, portions were large, and the staff was very accommodating and friendly. The food was good, but nothing particularly special."}
{"text":"Still haven't had a full dinner here but love, love the drinks and apps. Great happy hour. We love the cheese plate and the pork appetizer. Great atmosphere and really good apps. We definitely need to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Grassroots this afternoon and it was so delightful! The atmosphere , the food, the service... all of it was amazing! We had the tuna poke, Cardiff salad, and the miso salmon. Every bite was so good! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Grassroots is soo good! First off, looove the Happy Hour 7 days a week!  It has all of their specialty drinks, plus beer and wine on the list! The salmon dip and Tuna Poke is delish! Highly recommend!  Every time we go the service is attentive and nice,  never have had an issue getting a table.  Dogs are allowed on the patio and they even bring them a water bowl. The only downside is that we recently moved to the Gilbert area and so we don't go as often!  I hope they build one out in this area, we'd be so excited!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! They opened in Phoenix roughly 6 month ago and we have easily made this one of our favorite spots!  Their Happy Hour is every day 3-6 with great drink and apps options!  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience from start to finish! Inviting atmosphere and friendly service.  Smoked salmon appetizer was savory perfection.  Chopped salad was a fun twist with excellent flavors, not your average salad. The shrimp and grits are amazing with a touch of spice, the best I've ever had.  I am excited to have such a great new go to spot in the Camelback corridor. I will definitely be back again and again!"}
