{"text":"I give it a two because the drinks from 168 are all pretty consistent. But if I could I would give it a one for customer service. Service is terrible. Even the to-go, the server ignores you for 10minutes serving other customers before coming to you to take your order. They talk in a very rude manner and give you cut-eye while they are waiting for you to pay. I think this is also due to the fact that there was only one server and she wanted to attend to other customers waiting..? and also apparently the manager isn't even there."}
{"text":"0 service. If you just wanna drop by for a drink take out. then sure it's fine. Don't expect any service or smile from any of the waiters or waitresses"}
{"text":"We ordered avocado smoothies, gave us taro smoothies.  Told the server that it wasnt our order. The another server came and confirmed it. After few minutes, same server and the cashier came back to us and asked us if we we're that we want the avocado cause the taro is much cheaper. -.-  The made a drink and gave it to us but it wasnt a smoothie. There was no milk in the drink which made it an unsweetend slush. We complaind again and they said that they'll remake it. When they got back with the remade drink, we tried it and it tasted like 10% avocado, 5% ice and 85% milk. Oh, they also prioritized the \"to go\" orders more.    Overall, theyre customer service sucks"}
{"text":"This place only gets 5 stars because it's the best Tea Shop 168 location, not because it's better than some of the independent tea/coffee shops I've reviewed. It might be because it's a newer location, but this location is a lot less crowded than the other ones.  It's very clean and the service was great/friendly all three times I've been so far. They also have free Wi-fi, which is pretty awesome, though I really wouldn't recommend studying here, the music is way too loud for that. Their bubble teas are good, and their presentation for ice cream was wow-ing. This location also serves hot tea in a clear pot (the fruit tea is really sweet but yummy), cakes, crepes, waffles, funnel cakes, condensed milk toast (in several flavors ex: green tea, taro, etc..), burgers and fries with different toppings. Yes, I said burgers and fries at Tea Shop 168, although I haven't tried it yet.  Updated March 10 2011:  I decided to give this place 5 stars instead of 4 because I found myself coming back to this location several times after I wrote my initial review. The service was very impressive every time I went back *thumbs up*. The fact that they're open until 2AM even on Mondays is amazing. Oh and unlike certain larger bubble tea places in Richmond Hill (won't name any names) where the employees look like annoyed zombies, the employees here were still energetic, friendly, and fully alert at 2 in the morning. Lastly, If you're trying to stay up to study/work, I highly recommend the Peach Black Tea (which also happens to be one of the cheapest item on the menu, double win!)."}
{"text":"Ever wanted a funnel cake in the dead of winter, and knew you weren't going to satisfy that craving till next summer when Wonderland opens up or the next fair rolls into town?   Probably you have because everyone loves funnel cake. Moist fried dough covered in rich creamy ice cream drizzled with fresh strawberries and chocolate sauce.....  Imagine my delight when I discovered Tea Shop 168 / Dessert 168. It's a new brand of the 168 franchise that offers bubble tea along with various desserts. I was there for bubble tea originally and found out that they also had funnel cakes on the menu. Initially I wanted to order one right away, where else could you get one in November? I then thought, \"Ok, why is there funnel cake at a tea shop, how good could it be\"? Despite this, I ordered a funnel cake with vanilla ice cream and strawberry sauce. They have other fruits you can choose but I think funnel cakes with strawberries are the best combo.  My funnel cake comes out, I check the batter, it's fluffy and golden.....perfect. I can't stand burnt or dark brown. Its even better then Wonderland's version. It's not oily which funnel cakes can be at times, it's more cakey and not overly sweet which is a good thing. The ice cream that came with it went well with the funnel cake, the strawberry sauce was too sweet for my liking but still was ok as long as you didn't get a lot on your fork. Now I can have funnel cake whenever I like, but I don't have to pay park admission to get it."}
{"text":"Sorry I really don't want to bad mouth any restaurants and its usually compliments that I give but this time, I gotta say the food in this place taste like crap. I ordered fried chicken with rice (seems like a simple entree eh) but half of the fried chicken is flour powder and they use the cheapest rice that has the ugliest texture. It does not taste like normal steamed rice at all (I know this cause I eat rice everyday) and the rice is cold... Alright I'll say some good stuff, the drinks are alright but a lot sweetener in it. So if ir coming in just to chill and get a drink or desert, great! But dinner or lunch, I suggest not."}
{"text":"Service was quick and drinks were decent. Our group ordered hot teas and a waffle dessert. Drinks were good, however knocked off one star for the dessert.  The brownies in the dessert tasted old and it was gross, kinda ruined the dessert unfortunately."}
{"text":"Consistency is what defines the quality of the drinks here, they are always refreshing when the right flavours are picked. On our last visit here, my girlfriend and I both had Italian sodas, she had the passion fruit soda while I had the strawberry banana. The drinks were on point.  Over the years this chain and particularly this location has had several deals that got customers to revisit but were discontinued unexpectedly. One specific deal was a post secondary student discount of 10-15% that was offered for a while. This discount eventually became a take out discount and then was shortly discontinued. The reason I bring this up is because we had a stamp card in which we had to collect 8 drinks in order to get a free drink. We had filled out the card over the times that we've visited only to find out that they've changed it to take out orders. Suffice to say, this was another promotion we were disappointed in."}
{"text":"Ordered mango slush.  Cost $7.xx.  Drinks has mango dices with mango slush.  Wished they put less ice since it was winter (in Canada, Toronto).   The drink is pretty yummy consider mango is not in season.  First impression was place pretty clean, though groomy at the same time.  I will come back, just because this is the only one on that side of the street (yes I am too lazy to cross to centerpoint mall)"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for their takeout special for $1.99. You can't get it for the same price if you sit in. It's super delicious, but the rest of the drinks are expensive and powdery."}
{"text":"Tasty, but we arrived at 1:30am at the end of a friend's birthday because the place was supposedly open till 3am. They were already locking and we could only order slushies (not even Nutella bread). We got sent out at 2am on the dot. Huge bummer."}
{"text":"Pretty meh experience. This was the most convenient bubble tea spot to our hotel. Unfortunately, convenience was the only bright point. The staff was not the most friendly and seemingly not eager to get our business.  I think the person making the drinks was overwhelmed and we were told it would be 8 minutes for drinks to be made (not a problem), but almost with an attitude like you should go somewhere else.   Drinks were just okay and tapioca balls were on the chewier side. My mango slush tasted somewhat watered down and skimpy on real mango. Pricing-wise, a bit higher than average (maybe $0.50 or so), with a small bubble tea being around $5.50."}
{"text":"The crispy chicken here is a good choice of snack while studying. Love the environment!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their \"takeout special\" for $2.10, after tax. It's basically an original milk tea with tapioca, but it tastes awesome! I like to ask for it to be less sweet, so note that it's an option if you like that too.  It's becoming a competitive BBT market here in Richmond Hill/Markham with the emergence of fancier places like Chatime and Sharetea, but I'm glad I can still count on Teashop 168 to take it back to basics.  Oh, and did I mention it's only $2.10?  Worth."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around midnight and it wasn't too busy.  Pros: - WiFi - Seating - Good tasting items  Cons: - Pricey for what's offered"}
{"text":"Frankly, Tea Shop 168  is one of my least favourite bubble tea joints in Toronto, using cheap powders that taste like the ones you can purchase from T&T. Further, the tapioca is never cooked properly (either over or under) and is either too sweet or not sweet enough. I am confident that those who have tried bubble tea from Taipei would similarly denounce Tea Shop 168 's beverages."}
{"text":"My friends and I like to come here to grab some food and drinks and to play games. They have a few games on the side. It's a very spacious restaurant and there's a lot of variety in their menu. Food and drink prices are good. The food can be a bit salty, but overall, the taste is good. There needs to be more servers though, since I find the same person serving the floor is also working take-out, which gets very busy. Overall, a good place to come and chill with friends if you're looking for a more casual place."}
{"text":"I really like it here! Only one thing missing is that I kind I assumed the would serve Chinese desserts for some reason. No sure why bc typically bubble tea places don't do that.   But they totally made up for it for allowing us to play SETTLERS on a Saturday night. It was quiet and empty. Only a handful of tables including some kids playing cards.   Bubble tea was good but really sweet.  The staff was nice and didn't bug us too much, actually at all !   Looking for a place to gather? This is great! Also free wifi."}
{"text":"Coconut mango slushy with tapioca .... The best everrrr! Oh and the taro smoothie is good as well. Parking is a disaster ... You can never find a parking spot"}
{"text":"Visited late on a Saturday night with 2 friends for a late bite and some bubble tea. They were featuring mango as the bubble tea flavour of the month, so I tried the mango coconut flavour and it was amazing! It had real mango pieces on the top and bottom of the slush, and I have been dreaming about it ever since. My friends ate some of the fried chicken and rice and it received rave reviews. We finished off with the toast and it was really yummy! The staff there were also super friendly and helpful. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"I always drop by here after work because I'm nearby, and I can't say I've ever been disappointed (by this location). The staff are always friendly, there's free WiFi and a nice and comfy sitting area which is great for spending time with friends or studying.  The choices of teas are seemingly endless. You can get green tea or black tea, hot or cold, regular or milk tea, slushies, and all can be flavoured with dozens of fruity, floral, and nutty flavours. And you can't forget about the tapioca! Always fresh, and you can opt to not have it or choose aloe, grass jelly, etc. Instead.  We recently started trying their soups and they're so good. I usually get the crispy chicken with instant noodles, and for under $10 its quite filling! You can choose to have it with handmade noodles for a small uocharge, or get it with udon as it comes unmodified. My boyfriend also tried the tako yaki (fried octopus balls) and it was awesome. It took a bit longer to arrive but when it did, there were some sort of flakes sprinkled on top (pictured) and they were actually MOVING from the heat!!! At first we thought it was still alive but it definitely wasn't haha (we've all watched too many YouTube videos about the dancing octopus dish).  The takeout special is also crazy good. Plain sweetened black milk tea with tapioca for $1.99? Yes please!"}
{"text":"I like that they're open super late. The place isn't bad but it's a huge shame they renovated. I don't understand why they'd close down for more than a month to demolish the separating wall that defined this location throughout the years and added a sense of coziness once you were inside. They also took down the booths and made almost the whole, empty restaurant tables only. Stupid move in my opinion, the booths were great. The teas are okay, I had many problems with this particular location because I usually just pop in to get the take out special (black milk tea with tapioca for $1.99) and they insisted that they never do that, but I get it all the time at other locations. The food we usually get also tastes a bit funny here, and not in a good way. I definitely go out of my way to avoid this location unfortunately..."}
{"text":"This location is very close to where I live and has ample parking, so convenience is definitely a plus. I used to come with friends to get drinks and play the board games they have in the store, but now I just come for their take-out deal - $2.50 got a regular milk tea with tapioca, and an extra dollar if you want to upsize (not worth the upsize). Their regular milk tea is actually really good because it tastes like caramel and their tapioca is always soft, chewy, and sweet.  The downside is their food. It's definitely overpriced for such small portions. Their crepes/waffles are simple and plain, and for $10 each.  While this is not the best bubble tea in the area, it's the best bang for your buck if you just want to satisfy that craving. And they're open until 2am!"}
{"text":"Summary: reliance on powder-drinks and overcharge on sit-ins makes it seemingly destined to be a casualty of the oversaturated bubbletea market, but it's takeout deal and shorter line ups makes it a better for those impatient and thirsty than competitors!   Top Must-Get: takeout $1.99 Top Regret: sit-in (more than double the price!)  We were thirsty, craving something sweet, and knew from prior experience that Chatime had insane lineups around this time. We looked elsewhere in the plaza, and voila, Tea Shop 168.  A few years ago, Tea Shop 168 seemed like the king of bubble tea. How much has changed now. It was like a ghost town on a Sunday afternoon around 3 pm - completely empty. And while I was glad there was no line up (the previous week, we waited nearly ten minutes in line at Chatime), it was also a moment where you go \"but is there a reason nobody is here...?\"  We did not hang out here, but it actually looked very comfortable, with spacious tables and seating... I imagine they get filled up more on say, a Friday night.  In my few times here, I did find that the fruit drinks seem extremely \"powder\"-based, which is a turn off (except the bananas... they had a lot of those on the counter!). However, their regular milk tea - you can't really go wrong with that, especially for the $1.99 takeout special.  As long as their promotion remains, it is a great grab-and-go drink spot!"}
{"text":"Decent price, tastes good. Decent selection of drinks. Has board games available. The fresh mango smoothie is pretty good and a fair price."}
{"text":"We came in when there was still 20 min left until closing, but they had already turned off the lights and were closing. At first they told us they were sorry and were turning us away, but then when we mentioned that we called them earlier to make sure they closed at 2am they gave us free smoothies!! I thought what they did was professional, and I will be coming back because they had done that."}
{"text":"I just came back from there, I saw something very disgusting.  One of the customers tried and didn't like their bubble tea, they gave back their bubble tea cup to the employee who made their bubble tea, the employee used the same metal spoon he uses to make everyone's bubble tea with, and took out the content of their bubble tea from their cup leaving the tapioca in there, then he replaced it with another bubble tea.  After that, he used the same unwashed spoon to make the next customers bubble tea, this all happened in front of me while I was in the line already waiting and I had already waited about 20 mins, and when I saw this I got disgusted and left.  What is that customer is sick or has a contagious disease! What if that customer has HIV with an open soar in his mouth, Then what???  I will now contact the Ministry of Health and report this, I bet you that the ministry of health won't do anything to them."}
{"text":"The avocado smoothie was not full or filling. There was waaaaayyyy too much sugar and it completely overpowered all of the avocado that it felt as if I was drinking a slushie. The texture was smooth, which was good. They also use real avocados which is a plus. But the service here was also v slow. Next time, I will either ask for either less sugar or go the extra mile and make that trip to pmall to get that avo goodness."}
{"text":"Worst I've ever had. Mango slush had way too much ice not enough mango; probably why it taste like it was watered down. Def won't be back. I had a full stamp card that can be redeemed for a free drink but that was apparently \"expired\" since they went on to the points card system. It would make sense to honour whatever cards customers have left..."}
{"text":"REVIEW OF BUBBLE TEA ONLY: A little pricey for bubble tea in my opinion ($5.65 for a small Almond Milk Tea with tapioca pearls) otherwise I'd  give this place a four stars. My drink was delicious but the pearls were soft (not a deal breaker for me). Large, clean, bright spacious dining area. Staff are pleasant and service fast: no line up on boxing day. Open till the wee hours of the morning."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a long time.  I'm not in this neighbourhood often, but when I'm around I like to pick up a bubble tea.  It's the same as I remember it.  They use the plastic cups with the plastic sealed cover which is nice.  The milk green tea was just right...not too sweet.    The experience is pretty consistent here.  It's worth dropping in.  I like the fruit green teas also.  My favourite flavours being grape and blueberry, and almost always with tapioca."}
{"text":"Inside decor is so nice and clean. Great for groups- they even have couches and tables! You could go here to study with a small group of friends and get some bubble tea while you're at it.   I ordered the red and white waffle- $9.46 tax included. They only take debit or cash! Waiting time was around 20 minutes because they had to warm the machine. Waffle is 4/5. Nice and warm, strawberries are fresh, ice cream is good."}
{"text":"The staff here is really friendly! The downside is that the drinks are pricey but taste kind of meh. There was plenty of seating and plugs to charge your phone or your laptop which is a plus. Unfortunately, the place kind of had an odd smell to it too and the bathrooms weren't very clean."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there is still a place open at 9pm on a Sunday to hang out and get some snacks and bubble tea. The place is located at a plaza near Hwy7/Leslie with an abundance of bubble tea shops, talk about competition.   This is actually my first time visiting 168 Tea Shop and I find the prices to be a little more expensive than other bubble tea shops. For milk tea, a small is $4.49 and a large is $5.19 and toppings are $0.5 extra. I got a caramel pudding flavoured milk tea with tapioca and the bill came up to around $6.50, so yeah, quite pricey for a beverage. The flavour was alright, not particularly great, and I did find it to be too sweet at regular sugar level. There were pudding bits in the milk tea which was a nice touch to the flavour.    When I left I saw that they have a $1.99 take out special, which you get a small regular milk tea with tapioca. Darn, should have gotten it :("}
{"text":"Understanding that this is a chain and the service really varies by location, in short this was one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. So here's how the story goes...  I came in looking to grab some dessert. Browsing through the menu there was a picture of a waffle with strawberries, brownies, vanilla ice cream w/ chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Looking very enticing, none of the descriptions seemed to match the picture so I asked the cashier which item on the menu was the picture representing. She took a guess and ended up saying she wasn't too sure.  So I said ok... I'll get the one in the picture. Note at this point there's no debate around whether or not I'd be getting what I ordered.  After a bit, she comes back with the dessert without the strawberries. So I go back and say that the dessert is missing the strawberries. You know what she says next???... \"Oh that picture is just for REFERENCE\"... WTF. We go back and forth a couple times, where I say \"well I specifically ordered what was in the picture\" and she says \"well the picture is for reference\". I seriously question what is going through her mind when she gives such a nonsensical answer.  For anybody who goes to this store, feel free to use my story and say \"I thought the price was just for reference\"."}
{"text":"Came here to satisfy my sweet tooth.  Got a large black milk tea with egg pudding for $6. Tasted good but a little on the sweet side. Good amount of egg pudding which was silky smooth.   Also got a small coffee slush for $4.49 - Tasted just as good as a Tim Horton's ice cap and a step above I would say.   Also tried the funnel cake for $8.50 - got the Red N White flavour which comes with the standard vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries. To be a little different they also added some white chocolate chips. Didn't really like the white chocolate chips that were added though. The deep fried batter was crunchy for the most part but I found it heavy and thick. Only comes with one scoop of ice cream which is not enough for all the fried batter it comes with. I would recommend getting the funnel cake at Honey B Hives instead which is only $6.99 and the batter is much lighter and airy but still with big crunch. Plus they give you three scoops of ice cream. Its cheaper and you get more with better quality."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday afternoon and it was quite empty. Lots of space and clean tables to work in if you plan to stay for a while. I ordered the curry fish balls which were pretty good - standard taste that I was expecting. Good place for snacks at a decent price and area to sit in to work or catch up with friends. I'll come back again and try out the drinks and other snacks."}
{"text":"If you're looking for bubble tea in the area and one that's opened late night, come here. Quality is not the greatest neither is the service. When they get busy and overwhelmed it may take quite sometime for the drinks to come out because they tend to the take out orders first.  It's more of a place to grab a quick fix for bubble tea not come here for the quality.   ****THEY ONLY TAKE DEBIT OR CASH!!********"}
{"text":"The location is great, that little corner on Steeles really needed something new to counter balance the boringness of the whole plaza or should I say the whole area? The teas here are great, smooth and milky for me please. I also love that they offer more food items than other similar establishments. Having a waffle with fresh fruits at 1 am after 4 hours of movies, washing it down with warm green milk tea and perfectly cooked tapioca, am I in heaven?  The decor is funky white and limy green and the music is always top40, which keeps everyone chatty and energized, wifi is a definite plus.  And although it certainly was not a real French waffle (I would not want you to expect it to be so), the fact that it wasn't breakfast time and that I was not in France made my taste buds oblivious to the reality, hence 5 stars."}
{"text":"Our groups go-to uptown bubble tea location.  Tons of parking spots (which is important since we all drive to meet up) and super easy to get to.  They've got a ton of tables of all sizes and have never had a problem seating our group of 8 at peak times. Service is always quick and they never pester you to leave, which i like at a tea shop.  They've got a table with some cards and board games, but most (nearly all) are missing pieces or cards, so bring your own if you're into that sort of thing. They have a policy where everyone has to order something if you're loitering, but it's never been enforced with us. A couple TV's play random stations (usually sports games if they're on).  Sound is always k-pop or random top-40.  They're a dessert shop, not a restaurant so don't expect much from their food.  We've tried their \"real\" food a few times and it's been pretty meh! The desserts we've tried have all been huge portions and delicious, although definitely loaded with sugar.  The drink quality is pretty average to be honest; it tastes the same as all bubble tea places i've been to (how different can powder+water/milk taste anyways?). Their drinks are consistent, and if you've been to a 168 you know exactly what you're getting."}
{"text":"I love this place because of the take out special.  You walk up, ask for a takeout special and it's $2.10 for a small bbt :) (but you physically need to leave the place after because.. take out special..LOL)   Also they just renovated and it looks really amazing. When the renovation smell is gone, I'd love to come here and study.   PS: free wifi"}
{"text":"Just like any tea shop, usually busy, good food and drinks. Great place to hang out and chill!"}
{"text":"I'm always surprised to hear people say they don't drink bubble tea. There are so many flavours and textures how can you not? I'm convinced there is something for everyone. This location is no exception! My aunt introduced me to this location when she let me try her fresh watermelon juice bubble tea. CAN YOU SAY REFRESHING!?!?!?! I had to go buy my own. They actually blend fresh chunks of watermelon. Then you slurp it up with sweet tapioca balls. BLISS! I also discovered that they make a mean pina colada and sprinkle coconut flakes on top. Whoever thought of that needs a raise. They are always coming up with new flavours last time I was in  they had different mango combination with chunks of mango on top (still need to try this). I've only tried their beef brisket soup and fried chicken which were both good. The only thing negative I have to say about this place is the wait times are bit too long. I've waited up to 30 minutes for an order but obviously I still come back because the drinks are good"}
{"text":"I have to say I will be quite biased with my review for Tea 168. I am NOT a fan of bubble tea or anything that is so sweet with artificial flavour when you can no longer call it a tea but a form of liquid sugar.  If I just rate Tea168 for it's tea, I would have given it 2*. But extra star is for the environment and the free WIFI access. The nice plushy sofa makes it so inviting to be a place to hang out and with free WIFI you can also post on yelp too!  I ordered the Winter Takeout specials milk tea $1.99 each with 16 different flavours to choose from includes seasame, papaya, peanut, coffee, banana, malt, coconut... I ordered Sesame Milk Tea with less sugar and it still tasted super sweet!! Maybe I am getting old.. Maybe the young people loves things that are super sweet...  Next time I might have to order with NO sugar!  So be warned. If you want to be a constant sugar high, packed on 500+ calories from drinking a milk tea.. go ahead..."}
{"text":"In my quest for good bubble tea in Ontario, my friend took me to this place right off the highway.   My first impression was that it was large. I mean, seriously. I'm used to intimate tea shops that provide for some cozy mingling amongst friends, but my friend informed me that this was the place to be at night (we were there early evening so it wasn't exactly bustling.)   I ordered a lychee rose tea with tapioca pearls, and honestly I'm surprised at the price of bubble tea in these parts. In Vancouver my drink would rarely surpass $5 and it's size is the equivalent to what is considered a 'large' in Toronto. Here a regular size still clocks in at about $4 - too much for poor little me.  But back on topic - my drink was on the sweet side but so far it's the best bubble tea I've had so far in Ontario, which is saying alot. Overall, it's a nice place; there's a large selection of teas, calpis, and smoothies, plus food items like appies, toasts, and desserts, all for a decent price. I can definitely see this being a great hangout place at night, as there's ample space set up on the patio and indoors for groups. I'd like to come back and try the place out at night."}
{"text":"First time I went to this location had a pretty good time. Second time was terrible first of all the service is so slow I waited 20 minutes before I was greeted. So I ordered the 'Sundae' which was very pathetic it was basically a scoop of freezer burnt ice cream with a bit of caramel and a dusting of peanuts the presentation was nice as you can see in the picture but the ice cream was terrible. My girlfriend got the crepe she got a crepe with dark chocolate chips but the chips were not dark chocolate.  Further frustrating the experience I received my sundae a full 10 minutes before my girlfriend received her crepe when I got the sundae I took a few bites and returned it the staff was nice which is why I'm giving this location 2 stars instead of one. All of this being said I will likely not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Right on the border of Toronto and not-Toronto, this is one of many locations of the 168 chain. Prices are about what you'd expect, that is to say, wildly overpriced. Some of their drinks use real fruit, but the vast majority rely on chalky flavour powders - try and stay away from those if you can. They recently introduced a mango menu, featuring drinks with actual diced mango -- these are consistently good, if not especially innovative. Showing a student card when getting take-out nets you a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Tea 168 is in short, Canada's verison of Quickly for Northern California USA (amongst other worldly locations).  The business name itself is as the Brits would say, taking the piss (ie pulling one's leg and more), perhaps not quite literally, into the tea. Where Quickly is often made fun of as the $tarbuck$ (or Quickbux) of tapioca milk tea (ahem pardonez moi, \"BUBBLE TEA\" for you Canadians), Tea 168 is less subtle with its mi$$ion vi$ion, and more in your fa$e.   How so? Well for $tarter$, 168 is pronounced Yut Luk Baht in Cantonese, or Yi Liu Bah in Mandarin. If you twist the pronounciation a bit, it sounds like Yut Loh Faht in Cantonese, or Yi Lu Fah in Mandarin.  Bottom line? Tea One $IX EIGHT is getting riche$ from you A$N bitche$. OK that was quite tongue in cheek, but I think it is even more bold for this tea $hop!  Props to TS168 for being such a successful franchise.   Their website: http://www.teashop168.ca/publicMainMenu.asp  They must be doing something right.   But back in 2003 I remember getting a honey green tea drink at this location (Commerce Gate outdoor plaza), and I'd have to say the competition did it better (who were not a chain at the time, but I'm curious if TS168 put them out of business?)  I have a thing about being able to taste the natural flavors of the tea (and letting that shine) and of course using good quality honey. Sadly most of the time these tapioca tea factories end up churning a perfect cup of WATTE (pronounced wah-tay, like a latte which is milk with a shot of coffee, but the wah-tay is water with a shot of tea). Their tapioca milk tea sadly isn't that much better. Decent for a quick fix, but then again, it is just a fix.                            *Maybe all you want is a cuppa this*                                                   \ \                                                   \ \                                                    \ \                                                                \ \                                          ===== \ \======= bubbles!  ---------------   | oooo \ \ ooooo  |                                           | ~~~ ~ \ \~~~~~  |                                           |              \ \            |                                           |               \ \           |                                           |                \ \          |                                    /      |   O  O O  \ \   O   | BALLS!
