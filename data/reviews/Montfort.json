{"text":"Well I have eaten many times at the Montfort in Milton and have always enjoyed the food. The pork shashlik is to die for. Stopped in for lunch at this location and tried the chicken shwarma dinner with a french onion soup appetizer. First being an open kitchen the cooks are normally dressed in white chefs uniforms. The second chef was dressed in whites but the main chef looked like he just broke out of jail. They served both my soup and my main dish at the same time. I hate that what do you let get cold the soup or your food. The soup was the worst I have ever tasted it was like mush or puried onion with no taste. The bread in the soup was grilled or should I say burned which was all I could taste. And to top it off they used cheddar cheese for the topping, who uses cheddar cheese for french onion soup. The main dish was ok, the chicken was great tasting the fries were frozen fries (what more can I say) and the salad was crappy. To finish the waitress was overly efficient by giving me my bill half way through my meal. I guess I didn't want anything else. And she called everyone sweetie constantly have some respect and call people with some professionalism. Wont go back to this location Milton here I come it's worth the drive. Pork Shaslik mmmmmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very quiet with only two small families. We found it dirty and noticed people waiting to be seated were leaving because the staff were too busy eating from the food prep area or putting on make- up. Terrible service. The staff were unfamiliar with the food and blamed the inexperienced chief. The sauces were all watered down and some were fermented. My other half was sick from food poisoning, is still in the hospital, and noticed mouse droppings near the food preparation area. The staff can't stand working for Montfort's because they blame head office for telling them to skim on all meals to save money."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mediterranean food. The baba ghanoush was delicious. Ambience is lacking. I usually just call ahead and pick up."}
{"text":"It's far from perfect but there's always a crowd. During lunch rush it's a crowd of teenagers just trying to get a cheap meal and there's nothing wrong with that, but service does slow down because of it. The food isn't bad. I especially like the pineapple  chicken shawarma(crazy mix right!). The staff is fairly nice and it's easy to order for pick up."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Was a bit worried when there was only 4 other people in the restaurant at 12. Had the falafel sandwich and the shawarma sandwich. Both were good, but the portions were pretty small. 

Probably won't be back because I like Pita and Grill on Dundas better, but this place has lots of variety so if you work in the area it might be worth a try or two."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't been here sooner. I came here for lunch the other day, and ate on the patio.

I had the Lamb Shaslik, which was awesome. The lamb was cooked perfectly and nicely spiced. I wished there was more. I liked that it it didn't have that strong lamb taste, that some lamb has. The dish comes with peppers, onions, pita, iceberg salad, and fries. The garlic sauce that comes with the dish is great too.

All this for $12 dollars you can't go wrong. If you get the chicken instead of lamb you will pay about $10. I'd definitely be back."}
