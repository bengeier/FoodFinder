{"text":"It's a great little King St. West resto-bar right at Portland, which is a hot spot for after work traffic as well as the nightlife crowd that have outgrown the club district but still love to go out. So KiWe has the benefit of being able to cater to the lunch crowd, the after work drinks suits and the night time dinner or cocktails before dancing. It's got a decent menu and a patio and the service is decent. In a neighborhood where there's just a handful of restaurants, it's a great addition."}
{"text":"OK so l went again to KIWE and this time it was for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. Dinner was great no complains there the only issue that I have & I can't seem to shake off is the $18.00 Cake Surcharge that we had to pay on our bill after we spent a whole lot of $$$ in this joint.  So I have done my own calculation breakdown to try to justify this Surcharge Store Cake in Fridge while customers are eating------$5.00 Place Plates on Table while customers are waiting - $5.00 Place Forks & Spoons while customers are waiting - $5.00 Place 3 Candles on Birthday Cake-------------------------$3.00 Total-----------------------------------------------------------------$18.00  Interesting isn't it?"}
{"text":"One of the shi shi places for the later evening jaunt after Bay Street digs like Ki and Bymark wind down.  Food is pretty good but come dressed up (especially if you're one of the ladies); otherwise, you may feel out of place.  +s: People watching, short skirts, cool atmosphere. -s: Attitude"}
{"text":"Went to Kiwe for the first time. The place has a great ambiance with pretty good food although a bit pricey for what it is. We started with the cheese platter which was fantastic. I had the shrimp capellini which was very good.  The service was also excellent. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink, get an appe, and mingle amongst fellow neighbors.   If you live in King West, this spot is a must."}
{"text":"I'm a king west local and have enjoyed a lunch at Kiwe about a year ago, so when told a group (18 ppl) dinner for a friend's 26th birthday was at this restaurant I was expecting a great time. I was WRONG.   Although we made reservation a week in advance and had a pre-fix menu ($48 each, 3 courses), and there were only 2-3 other tables at the restaurant while we were there the service was BEYOND slow. It took 3.5 hours in total from start to finish. I understand with large groups timing is difficult but 20 minutes to take drink orders for only half the group, another 15 to get drinks, and another 15 minutes for waters to be refilled was PAINFUL.  The food itself was mediocre, \"spicy shrimp\" was 3 small luke warm shrimp devoid of any notable seasoning. The salad ordered by others had no dressing at all. Salmon for main course was okay.   The bottle of red my boyfriend ordered arrived at the table literally WARM. The bottle of white ordered by another couple arrived barely chilled. We had to ask for ice buckets for BOTH the bottles several times. Of the limited beer options, we were also delivered barely chilled beer which the server admitted was \"pretty warm\" so he took it back. The returned and never consumed beer did appear on the bill at the end of the night and we had to contest this as well.  At the end of the night the server had split the bills between our 2 tables, but we were then left with 9 or so couples and 2 bills for about $1,000 each. When told that we would need to split the bills the server looked at me and seemed baffled that we didn't tell him the bills would be split at the start of the night. The manager was required. I ended up literally writing out each bill for the server to properly break down.  Auto grat was a joke! I understand that large groups often have the gratuity automatically applied. For good service where there is personality, professionalism and quality food I will happily tip 20%. This was NOT deserving of such a tip. When we spoke to the manager on the way out commenting that the staff was limited and service slow, he shrugged and said it was because we were a large group. If they had planned properly the server would not have had to act as bar tender and table runner for the entire restaurant. It was a joke.  The decor is quite nice, but sadly I never plan on returning to KiWe again."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here for dinner, and I had the opportunity to meet with the chef who was very friendly. The calamari was so delicious I could not shy away from letting him know (Calamari with Capers,olives,garlic brown butter,greens,taro crisps) it was really out of this world, the best I ever had hands down. Red wine, sparkling water, dessert, appetizers and braised beef and fish, everything was great. We went on a wednesday and it was nice and quiet, just the way I like it, but apparently Thursdays bring on the fun vibe."}
{"text":"Service is below par. Forgetful and inattentive wait staff. Manager was no better. Booths are good for intimate dinners for two or four.    Music is too clubby. Duck consomm√© was savory and satisfying for the ummami."}
{"text":"Blah,  Okay out with friends the evening before New Years.  A good pal \"booked\" us in for our dinner here.  The place was DEAD which was fine but whats with really crap service when its DEAD? Seriously as Melissa M said, \" Forgetful and inattentive wait staff.\"  We had drinks at the bar area before deciding to stay. (should have seen the red flag here) We asked the bar tender \"is the food good\"?, her response... \"I don't know\" lmao!   Okay.. we ordered \"share\" apps right off the hop.. West and East coast Oysters, olive mixture and the Artisanal Cheese platter. 25 minutes after placing this order we find out the don't have any east coast oysters!?!   The apps are \"fine\" nothing exciting or mind blowing. (small portions)  The mains were \"average\" and honestly not worth the price or the sad service you have to put with in order to finally get them!   I would need some serious convincing to go back, so I would rather spend the money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I feel like I have a lot of high expectations from king west restaurants, and this was nothing extraordinary. The food was good not great, service was good, and over all it didn't live up to what I initially thought. I would go back again and try some other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Had booked the whole back of the resto. Six of us arrived first. Nice vibe, good atmosphere. We ordered drinks,appies and mains. Appies came approx 1.5 hrs after ordering. My Cajun shrimp were just tomatoey, no spice all (3 others said the same of their orders). A colleagues salad was just plain green leafs. Dim mood lighting did not help. About 15 more people from the our group now here. Had to ask waitress to take away empty glasses that were piling up now... My Wellington county steak; tasted good! ( was not asked how I'd like it cooked). Desserts were nothing special.  Overall, service was below average for a \"trendy\" place. Food average. Rating not high as expectations were for an above average experience."}
{"text":"the restaurant is trendy and the service is okay.  our waiter did not tell us that all the steaks prepared there are medium rare which i found odd.    i had the spicy shrimp and the steak, both were good but the service was mediocre"}
{"text":"Kiwe Kitchen is located on the corner of King and Portland in a busy, bar-heavy area where competition is fierce and the nightlife is always hot.   I went here for a drink a couple of weeks ago and I had a really good time. As I was attempting to squeeze every last minute out of patio season, I had some drinks outside and really enjoyed the experience. Kiwe isn't huge but it does have a very comfortable patio. The inside of the bar is nice, but also small and when I got there it was pretty packed. For a certain type of night, this place is great - it's small, intimate and dark - but if you wanted to party super hard, Bier Markt across the street is probably a safer bet.   Once patio season is officially over, I don't know if I head here again, as space is tight and the place seems to get pretty busy. But for now, until it starts to snow, this is a great place to check out."}
{"text":"Oh, Kiwe, Kiwe, Kiwe, How I would so love to give your pretentious little hut a stellar review.  However, not today, my friend, not today.  Note - I'm not reviewing the drinks or the eats - I didn't make it that far, as the service was so abhorrent I ended up leaving.  Went there last night with a friend for a drink or two.  Saving a long story, after bypassing the tiny gatekeeper of a hostess and securing a table in the back room, we were met with disdain by waitstaff.  Dishes were angrily cleared from the table in a clatter, and the cocktail menu was flicked at my friend, much like cards at a blackjack table.  17 seconds later, our waiter returned to demand if we needed more time with the menu.   WTF?  Did I roll into your digs with a grocery cart full of garbage?  Was this a private event?  Did I sit and order water for 2 hours, leaving a 3cent tip and a mess to clean up?  Really, Kiwe?  Really?  We left shortly after this drama and went to The Wellington.   Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"nicely decorated place. very modern. I had some pizza and they were so thin and delicious. will come again."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Nothing special.  Set-up looks exactly as ... well... kitchen. Looks kind of trendy I guess.. I thought it looked kind of funny because all it is is a rectangular room with whole bunch of tables cramped close together and you can perfectly hear at least 4 conversations around you... not including your own... I liked the bar scene there - the bartenders are always super-friendly! and the crowd is nice and social! Great place to go before hitting a club in the area!  I would never eat there again though!"}
{"text":"Was there for a long dinner on the patio last Saturday night and it was AMAZING...  The waitress was SO cute and helpful, she made it a great night.  I loved the pasta dish my date ordered - it was amazing and they had a great selection of wines.  My only thought was the wine was a bit warm and I would have loved a few menu options that sounded good (I can't do gluten and it was a lot of pasta and pizzas).  That said, it was a lovely dining experience.."}
{"text":"We went to KiWe Kitchen for some beverages and drinks. The ambiance was pleasant and the servers were nice. We had an assortment of martinis and beers and they seemed to do a good job on those items.   The desserts, a tiramisu and a chocolate tort, were not bad and worth trying. It might be a place to try for dinner and the restaurant was busy during the 9:00pm hour.  Its just an A-OK for now! Good luck."}
{"text":"I've walked by this resto a million times and I finally decided to give it a try. I had not heard much about it, and it seemed like one of those overpriced, trendy king st w restos.  Well, it is trendy, and a bit overpriced for what you get, but it's not out of line with other restos in the area. Pastas run about $14 - $18, and entrees between $19 - $25. The food was surprisingly good. We had the rigatoni (dubbed the \"Chef's Rigatoni\"), which is supposed to be the most popular dish there. I had the sea bream, which was grilled well with a nice crispy skin. It was served with some crisp green beans and potato salad - perfect for a warm summer day.  I enjoyed my seat on the patio, though it was a bit too noisy with the surrounding traffic. It also doesn't get too much sun. The patio furniture is a pleasing turquoise and dark brown color scheme, though up close it looks a bit dirty.  The service was just fine. We never felt like we had to wait long for service, but she didn't hover uncomfortably either.  Overall, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food was like a cheap pub dinner and the waiter made me feel like I'd shat on his mothers wedding picture. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Swung by Kiwe for a couple drinks before heading to a few of the clubs on King St, and was pleasantly surprised by the prompt and friendly service for a bar that was fairly busy on one of the first warm Saturday night's of the year. I'm looking forward to heading back to Kiwe to take a run at their menu!"}
