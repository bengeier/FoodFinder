{"text":"I work down the street from Il Paesano and this is our go-to place for pizza, panzerotti, any thing Italian. Take out, delivery, or dine-in. If you dine-in and order a pizza, you'll walk out with a full belly and a new appreciation for what pizza should be."}
{"text":"I must admit, in a world full of franchises and chains I have a soft spot for family businesses. They are pillars and true staples in the neighborhood that are able to survive and flourish despite existing in a world engulfed by commercialism.  This being said, there needs to be substance in order for this to be a reality and Il Paesano hits the spot.   I have ordered delivery from Il Paesano on multiple ocassions and on a slow Sunday night felt like Italian so decided to give the restaurant a shot.   The outside of the restaurant is not impressive. Nestled outside a small strip mall on Browns line with your typical lineup of convenience store, laundromat and hair salon. 1970-80 urban planning at its finest! I must admit, if I had not seen their website I probably would not have guessed that they have tables inside.   Upon entry was pleasantly surprised by how cozy it felt. Yes it is small but has a charm that is scarce nowadays. A place that feels warm, a place where you can actually have a conversation.  This was my first impression, my second impression was that the restaurant has a damp smell, similar to what you'd expect from a basement of a house built in the 70's. You can't win it all, but the environment is not where Il Paesano excels.    From start to finish was waited on by an attentive waiter who was cognizant of what was going on, friendly, yet not in a desperate sort of way.  Very rarely do I notice good service as it is something that I expect, but let's just say it was good enough for me to put it in this review.  The food is nothing groundbreaking but what they have done is taken classic italian rustic dishes and made them well. I ordered a pizza and cheese ravioli with meat sauce and was impressed by the acidity of the sauce, just hits the corners at the back of the tongue and the consistency and freshness of the toppings was good.  Not to say that the pizza is authentic Italian but if you are a fan of Pizza Pizza and some of the other chains, you might not enjoy the pizza as they do not cook the peperoni to a crisp.  I rather like this as it keeps the saltiness at bay and gives the pizza a fresher taste.   In summary, Il Paesano has been in business since 1959 and I understand why. They have stuck to what they do well by providing classic Italian food in a convenient package away from the inconveniences that you would expect from Italian restaurants in the city. They provide good service and good food at very reasonable prices to solidify their place in the neighbourhood.  True comfort without the gimmicks."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. He's only eaten in once but guaranteed there are least  two  deliveries  a week to our door. Their pizza has ruined all other take out/delivery pizza for me. It's always perfect.  We're slowly making our way through the pastas. The servings are so generous and it's fun trying something new in each order! So far the ravioli is our winner! So happy to have such a great local place."}
{"text":"great food will eat here when ever im in the area. gotta love that home made sauce they make. had the pizza an that thin crust an sauce was unbelievable."}
{"text":"The pizza is always so good and fresh! Definitely my favourite place to grab a slice!"}
{"text":"I'm a twelve-year customer. Hands down, no question, the best pizza in the area! A huge bonus is the friendly and happy service provided by the delivery drivers. Ordering pizza from anywhere else is a mistake."}
{"text":"We tried Il Paesano as a result of first reviewer Mike and its proximity a week or so ago.   Good pizza place - they are celebrating their 50th anniversary. Nice! The place is both a pizza joint AND a nice Italian restaurant. When we picked up our pizza the tables were filled with well dressed individuals. I'm curious about their their non-pizza dishes.   Pizza is yummy. The sauce is super tasty - best part of the pizza. They skimp on the cheese (which I am sure you could ask for more cheese) and the dough is a bit too chewy for me (note these are the only reasons for the one less star. So for some this may be a 5 depending on how you like your pizza). I'd easily go to this place again if it were closer than Milano's.   Its cheaper to walk-in/pick-up than it is to have it delivered. It maybe nice to just eat in with the lovely warm setting..."}
{"text":"By far the best panzerotti in the world. This is the SECRET!!!  I order a fresh made panzerotti. With pepperoni mushrooms and green olives. I get home.  I wrap it in plastic saran wrap. Let it sit for 2 hours at room temperature.  The green olives naturally mature and turn the bread into a salty masterpiece.  I then warm in microwave for 1 minute. Try this and YOUR WELCOME for customizing the best panzerotti in Toronto. The taste is out of this world. Click FUNNY on this review if you tryed this method. And its the best thing you have ever tasted!!!"}
{"text":"Great traditional pizza, with great cost/benefit. Their medium size is the same as large size in other places and the service is fast. For sure I will keep my patronage to Il Paesano!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered pizza and garlic bread. Both were undercooked and soggy. Bread was toasted on the outer corners but inside wasn't toasted. Pizza wasn't made as ordered. Called to let them know. The fixed the pizza but didn't offer to remake the garlic bread. Gentlemen I spoke to seemed a bit rude and short with me which made me feel uncomfortable giving my full opinion on the dinner. The pizza both times had a but if a funny taste and crust was still undercooked. There are many other great pizza places so spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've had pizza from here twice now and it was okay. The crust is a good level of thickness, they use a good amount of cheese, and the pepperoni is good. All those individual goods do not, for some reason, add up to a really great pizza. Maybe it comes down to the sauce not being anything special or just a lack of overall seasoning, I'm not sure. I'd eat here again but mainly for convenience or because that's where other people want to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and pasta ever!!!!!!! Just moved into the area and we have always been passing this restaurant. Today I finally walked in and order a mini cheese pizza and gnocchi in tomatoes sauces. The area is clean and has a welcome feel to it. The staff was super friendly. You can dine in or take out. Prices aren't cheap but not expensive, just right in the middle where you know your paying for top quality ingredients. The kids love the pizza and actually ate it all, they are picky eaters so that's a big shock to me. My gnocchi brought me back to my grandmother's cooking and i enjoyed every minute of it. Forsure Homemade!!!! It also came with Parmesan and bread. So I did what my dad always does and cleaned the plate off that still had some left over sauce with the bread and ate it all, it was delicious!!!!! A must try!!!! I think I found my new pizza family."}
{"text":"We've been ordering pizza from this amazing old school pizzeria for over 18 years.   They have always been excellent, and we have had a staple style that we have been ordering forever. Tonight we tried something different. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, salami, shrimp, mushrooms, onions and pineapple. Wow. Simply wow. One of the best pizzas we've ever had. Imagine being able to serve a wow after being in business since 1959! Highly recommended. : )"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is that the delivery is pretty fast, pizza quality is good when you eat it while it is still hot. However once it gets cold it doesn't taste that good.   Price is on par with other similar places."}
{"text":"So happy I finally tried this place.   Good ingredients and very tasty crust. Almost as good as NYC pizza!  Delivery was prompt and friendly.   Knowing that they are a family business will order again but try the pasta this time!"}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time for dinner!  Omigosh - it's definitely a hidden gem!  Friendly and helpful service, delicious food and very old school, vintage Italian ambiance.  I think it's run by a family - and you can just feel the warmth and authentic family vibe of the whole place.  We got the pizza (which you can customize with whatever toppings) and the meat tortellini Alfredo.  Both were amazing - cooked to perfection.  I usually don't even eat crusts and I ate all of it!  And best of all - great prices and big portions!!  Would definitely recommend anyone to come here!  It seems like B Line condos are taking over soon (damn developers!!!!) - so hopefully this little spot won't shut down completely and will only move to another location nearby."}
{"text":"Well I have only had four things off there menu  1) panzo I have to say it's really good but some times you get half a cup of sauce, sometimes you get a full and sometimes you get too. It's $1.25 more for meat sauce.   2) veal not a big fan of. It's just like frozen kinda of like the McChicken from Wendy's   3) pizza by far the best thing. Best pizza I had in a long time.   4) slices they slices are amazing as well. Pretty big. For what you pay for you get your money.   I've always had fast delivery. Never had an issue with them."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Toronto from the United States.  When I arrived, I asked 3 locals what pizza they recommended.  All 3 of them suggested this place. The pizza was good and it arrived to my hotel (Hilton Toronto Airport) within 30 minutes.  Great service, friendly staff, and good food."}
{"text":"Deceiving from the outside, it looks like an old school take-away joint in a strip plaza but once you get inside it's actually a pretty fancy looking Italian restaurants - can't judge books people. You just can't.  My friend had been raving about their pizza so I was in, until I saw Panzo/Calzones on the menu (insert love in the eyes emoji here).  I ordered a calzone, baked, with about 6-7 toppings inside. The topping selection was very basic, with few gourmet toppings to offer really, but still it's pizza so it's not bad... just shades of great!  I'm used to a wide flat panzo typically. This was more akin to a stromboli (a panzo in a \"roll\" of sorts. The crisp on the outside was lovely, and the real winner here is their sauce. Wow! I took a mouthful of it by spoon even after I finished my meal - Yeah that good!  Price point was very fair as well, clocking in around $40 for two panzos, two drinks and two capuccinos. Not a bad lunch for two! I'll be back!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Maybe this place was good back in the day...not so much today.   I passed by once for a slice after reading all these reviews.  Seriously, everyone's saying its the best pizza in Etobicoke.  So, I grab a pepperoni slice.  Dried up slice.  Nothing special.    A couple of months later I ordered delivery.  It's not the worst pizza I've had, but it's still on the lower end of the scale.  Nothing near what these reviews are saying.  They best thing they do is deliver your pizza quickly.  If you're in need of a pizza within 25 minutes, order il Paesano's."}
{"text":"We dined in for the first time (have ordered delivery in the past). Veal parm dinner was delicious, and so was the pizza. My only complaint is that it took 45 minutes for the food to come out. Not sure if this is normal or a one-off, but will certainly give them another shot."}
{"text":"Two Pizzas ordered and I could have bought dough myself if I wanted , both were absent of ingredients . With wood oven Pizza places and soon to be coal fired .. opening up everyday ... won't be back .., Very very disappointed .."}
{"text":"Walked in while I was moving to the area for takeout, and I'm pretty impressed. I ordered two larges, and they had them out in about 20 minutes. It came to around $40 with a minor tip.  This joint is simple but you can tell the pizza is legitimate once you step inside. The dough to topping ratio is exactly how I like it (I hate thick dough!).  I'm pretty sure the owner took my order, and he was incredibly kind and helpful in doing so.  A very solid 4/5. Definitely better than chain pizza and some other local competitors."}
{"text":"They have been in that hole in the wall on Brown's Line so long, I think they must have started out selling pizza to the Hurons. The food is awesome. My only complaint is that I still haven't convinced them to put penna alla vodka on the menu! But it will happen eventually. I'm on a mission. lol"}
{"text":"Super fast friendly delivery!! Love their pizza!!! and the sauce for the ponzos is amazing- you can tell its homemade!!"}
{"text":"The local go to in my new hood. Fast delivery, good quality and they don't skimp on size. If you're looking for thin crust hipstery pizza this ain't your place but if you're looking for a solid pie that won't blow the bank, don't dial 9671111 call IL paesano. .. I've been back multiple times and I'm sure I'll be calling them again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 16\" size Pepperoni Pizza with onions, black olives and green pepper toppings. The pizza was soft with a good amount of cheese. You can smell the perfectly well baked toppings. In addition, we shared a Caesar salad and some garlic breads. We couldn't finish the pizza, so the waiter packed the leftover. Fell in love with the design of the box."}
{"text":"I like this place alot, although on occasion have got a couple of sub-par pizzas.  Most of the time they are great though and always deserve another chance if we didn't like the pizza we got.  Seems to be a weekend vs. weeknight thing.  Overall though, great pizza and super speedy delivery."}
{"text":"This place is great and always open late. Their pizzas are delicious and fresh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're still ordering from Pizza Pizza, you deserve to switch to something other than cardboard and fake pepperoni. Every pizza is always awesome, and has been for the 2 years we've been ordering from them."}
{"text":"Prior to dropping by about a month ago, I hadn't had Il Paesano in many a year, even though I'm only about a ten minute drive away! But I was dropping someone off in Long Branch, had the house to myself that night and with a hankering for pizza and fond memories of Il Paesano from days gone by, what could go wrong? Well, the classic case of the place that you once loved not being so great anymore for one.   I ordered my favourite pie (sundried tomato, onions and artichokes) and it was ready double-quick, which was nice...I was pretty hungry! However I must say that if it weren't for the fact that the 'za came with my own peculiar and none too common topping combination, I would swear that the thing had been sitting around for a couple of days. That's exactly how it tasted. Dry, stale and with that unfortunate cardboard-like consistency. Seriously, not too good. I don't get the raves at all. Not from Yelp, not from the guy I dropped off (I mentioned it to him later on and he said it was great).  So who knows, maybe I caught them on an off night but it was pretty dreadful. Bad enough that I'm not willing to give it another go and bad enough that I wish I hadn't gone and was left with the pleasant memories I had. They say that they've been serving since 1959 which means they must be doing something right but to me it just tasted like that's how long my pizza had been sitting for. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"The very best pizza I have ever had!! Fresh, home made taste, delicious! Great prices, fun little restaurant to dine in, or tons of take out options! The chicken sandwich (with cheese) is also a fave! Friendly staff, really quick service, a real go-to place for me! Reliable, consistently tasty and never a disappointment. They even give out free slices of pizza on Halloween to trick-or-treaters!!!"}
{"text":"This place is right up the street from my house, but even if it wasn't I would still order from here. Best panzerotta. The sauce for the panzerottas is so good. The pizzas are cheap and super tasty. Thin crust. I order from here all the time. I have been to the restaurant as well. It's a very old school Italian eatery. The pizzas come out on those raised serving trays. All in all a great meal."}
{"text":"B E S T (PERIOD) Fantastic pizza and chicken sandwiches, terrific hours, great/quick service. One of the REAL perks of living in the west end.."}
{"text":"Pizza was disgusting way too well done and crunchy!!!! Also took an hour for delivery . Called and complained and they gave credit for next time as if that's going to happen...."}
{"text":"Great pizza delivered but the best part is the dine in restaurant. Small but old school charming. The panzerotti and marinara sauce is delicious! The waiter I have gotten each time I have been is very nice. My family raves about the fettuccine. It might not look like much from the outside but it really is a nice experience."}
{"text":"Figured I would try Il Paesano after hearing good things. Ended up going the pasta route and had the fettuccine alfredo. It was ok, nothing to rave about but was still tasty nonetheless. The service was really good and I would go back but I think I'll give the pizza a shot next time as it seem to be the most popular option."}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes, this is the best in the city. Free delivery and always fast and fresh."}
{"text":"I have to give Il Paesano a solid four stars since it's been a neighbourhood staple for years.  The service is incredibly friendly and, if you decide to order delivery, it's relatively swift.  It does very good business as you'll see the delivery vehicles all up and down the streets of south Etobicoke.  I hate to say this but, since a certain Mimico pizzeria opened its doors, it's been difficult for us to order from anywhere else.  Prior to the Mimico establishment, we would order pizza a lot from Il Paesano (and still do once in a while) and it was always consistently good - thin crust (sometimes a little dry), fresh toppings, good quality cheese, etc.  It doesn't have a lot of \"gourmet\" toppings but, as I said, what they do offer is always very fresh. We've ordered when we had guests and most of them raved about the pizza.  My friend's young son even had him drive out to the west end to get a pizza.  If you're looking for authentic Italian, I would shy away from the pasta dishes.  The lasagna is just some meat in between layers of pasta with a bunch of red sauce poured on top.  My husband said the sandwiches and the panzerotti are adequate, as he's had better elsewhere. It does have decent prices though and a lot of specials such as a large, three toping pizza for under $20.  Bottom line: good, long-standing Etobicoke restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful. This is our go-to for Italian. It's small, so you'll need a reservation during peek hours, but it's worth it. Their pizza is delicious, and they deliver. Portions are huge, and they always start you off with some really good garlic bread. The service is always wonderful and quick. It's cozy and quiet, and always smells great. The meat dishes come with a side of pasta or salad, and so far, everything we've ordered has been very good. It isn't Nonna's, but it's very, very yummy :)"}
{"text":"Updating my review and adding an additional star, thanks to a much more positive experience. I find that the customer service and food quality considerately improved this year, well be back."}
{"text":"Like others said before me, it is so nice to still find some wonderful family owned restaurants in the city.   This place is definitely worth the trip, and they are open late!   Went there with my boyfriend for a late dinner and we were so happy. The waiter was super attentive and pleasant to us. He made some suggestions of what to eat on the menu and we were very pleased.   We had the Caesar salad, homemade garlic bread, meat pizza and boy, we ate well. You can tell everything is made in the kitchen.   I love the vintage decor, makes you feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Because I no longer live in Toronto, I MISS Il Paesano so much that the words 'Il Paesono' make me salivate.   So, one of the first places I go to eat when I get to Toronto is Il Paesano Pizzeria!  Their pizza is akin to New York pizza...thin crusty, juicy, with GREAT pepperoni.  YUMMY!  Will be there next week, can hardly wait!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after the pizza joint we had planned to go to was too busy. So happy we did. Restaurant has been around since 1959 and we could see why. Good, standard, old school Italian pizza and pasta. Not at all pretentious. Service was super friendly and efficient. Place was busy the entire time we were there. Food was delicious. Home cooked. Gorgonzola gnocchi was creamy, rigatoni and meatballs like grandma used to make and pizza was exactly what non-chain restaurant pizza is - Just plain good.  Kids want to make it a tradition to go back every Friday night."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Has to be one of the best, if not the best pizza in Toronto. Consistent quality pizza and quick delivery every time. Big bonus that they have delivery available til 3 AM...atleast on weekends."}
{"text":"No debit.  They do take: Cash,  Visa, MasterCard or American Express.  I came here because it was on my way back home after work, and I had used my trusty Yelp app to help me locate the nearest highest rated, and not too expensive food joint around ($$). Didn't want to sit in, just wanted something I could pick up and take-out real quick as I had plans after work and was trying to just 'grab and go'.  Anyway, I saw the reviews and people raving about the panzerotti's - so I ordered one, and the lady taking my order seemed a bit snippy and curt, I guess she is not used to Il Paesano newbies - such as myself. I waited a good 15-20 minutes and my food was ready for take-out. I was a little shocked at how huge each order was. I got my big box with a massive panzerotti & a small styrofoam container with tomato sauce. At first I thought it was too much tomato sauce, but I ended up using it all.   Overall, the food was okay. The panzerotti was huge, I think maybe they should tell you - especially if you look confused or like a newb. There was tons of cheese in mine, but I think they skimped out with the mushroom and pepperoni. I definitely don't think it was worth the five star rating, so i assume it must be people from the area who have grown up with this mom and pop shop and rate it so due mainly to the nostalgia it brings them. Or maybe I just should have tried to order a pizza. Who knows... my fiancee said he would return for another panzerotti, he liked it. I on the other hand, wasn't too impressed and would probably prefer trying something else in the area."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are freakin awesome!! Hubby and I always resort to the veal and chicken. Fresh to order , large buns, fresh ingredients. We tried their wings...wow!   Very fast delivery!  A little steep in price but worth it! Definitely a \"once a week\" meal!  2 sandwiches and 10 wings - $32.00"}
{"text":"Quick service.  Had a really good slice! I would recommend."}
{"text":"Best pizza I had in a very very long time. Very tasty and everything tasted fresh. They made it just like I ordered it and we devoured it. Never seen my kids finish their pizzas end to end.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I hope that the chicken sandwich I got yesterday was just part of a bad batch and not a representation of what they are now doing at Il Paesano.  I've ordered delivery from these guys for the better part of a decade and everything has always been fresh, quick and never soggy. Although they still deliver at lightning speed, my sandwich was meh at best. The bread was hella soggy, and the chicken was super thin and a bit dry.  Since I've ordered the same thing from there forever I know they can do better and have done better) so I am gonna give Il Paesano the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"This is my favourite take-out / delivery pizza place so we decided to try something else on the menu and actually sit down and try the food.  An order of veal scaloppini with a mushroom and green pepper sauce got us 3 pieces of veal, a bowl of pasta and a basket of garlic bread. The sauce is something you should probably order by the glass when they ask you if you want something to drink..... yes ....it's that good. *ouch* I mean, it's not as good as my wife's.  Overall, it's a great little family run business with excellent service and a casual feel. We're definitely going back again.  Tip: if you are ordering the pizza to go, reheat the slices in a pan. The crust gets really crispy."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, never tried here before.  Pizza was good...and fast delivery.   Light on the sauce however."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such good reviews but it is pretty bad. Maybe they do delivery better than sit in.  Food -- pizza was best thing we had and that was mediocre. Soup and pastas (and especially the pasta sauce) tasted like it came out of a can. I do not recommend any of the pastas.  Service -- If I got a dollar for the number of times the waiter had to say sorry to us other tables, we would have got our five meals paid for. Just get it right man--it's a tiny restaurant, it can't be that hard. And food was soooo slow in coming.  Overall just a poor place to eat. I felt the need to make a review because this place unjustifiably has a high review."}
{"text":"was very impressed with the service of this place when i ordered pizza awhile ago, and further impressed with the quality of the pizza i had received, i would defiantly go back sooner rather then later, best place in the neighborhood"}
