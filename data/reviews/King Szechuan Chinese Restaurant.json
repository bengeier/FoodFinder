{"text":"This is my local Chinese restaurant. The woman who runs the place knows service and has a gentle disposition. The food is really good for a take away style restaurant although they do not have a lot of authentic Chinese items. When ever I'm craving Chinese food, this place is fabulous. The decor and atmosphere is also fantastic...I love the duck chopstick holders. This is exactly what a Chinese restaurant should be..."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Been meaning to post this for a while. Ordered take away from here  for our New Years Eve meal and everything was incredible. This will be our go to for Chinese food going forward. Not greasy like all other Chinese restaurants tend to be and the flavours were well balanced and overall portions and presentation also well done. Also enjoyed the house made sauces."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant when I am in town.  It has a clean and crisp atmosphere with very authentic food.  They even have a Chinese menu with some dishes on it that are not available on the main menu.  And the price is very reasonable.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I started with the pork steamed dumplings. The portion is very small and the quality was so-so. I have eaten better eat T&T.

For my main dish, I wanted to order the half Peking duck. It was not available as I had to call 24 hours in advance to get one reserved. So I turned around and ordered the squid. Big mistake. It was extremely salty, and very fat (it was battered).

I will definitely note return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a new chinese restaurant in Oakville and I tried to see if this is better than any other chinese take outs in town, and for me, the food was great and better than others. Although the location is a bit far from my house,  I would take out from here going forward."}
{"text":"Growing up Chinese in Oakville, my family always had to drive out to Richmond Hill/Markham for good authentic Chinese food. When this place opened, we were blown away at how good everything was. The chef is from Szechuan and brings authentic dishes and flavors, and all the waiters and waitresses are super friendly. Definitely recommend eating in the restaurant (we see alot of people do takeout). 

Protip: ask for the Chinese menu if you want even more authentic dishes. The dandan noodle and beef pancake is a must try."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this new resto in our hood.  On a Saturday night it was half full and mainly with Asians.  Tells me Oakville is starved for decent Szechuan food!

The eat in menu does not seem to be anything like the take out menu in a good way.  There is a variety of Cantonese, Szechuan, and some Canadian Chinese food a la sweet and sour pork .

We ordered the hot and sour soup (you get choice of veggie only or including pork), Szechuan bean noodle, ma po tofu, and sweet and sour pork with pineapple.

Service is friendly and everything was tasty.  Definitely worth a trip back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 3 chances before writing this review. I am not sure if it is going thru growing pains or language barrier on part of the person taking the order or just sheer ineptitude. The first time i wanted vegetables with tofu and i was given all tofu and that to soft and gooey with no veggies. Ended up throwing it. 

Second time ordered mixed veggies with oyster sauce extra spicy. The sauce was so mild it barely had any taste. 

Third time i ordered mixed veggies in Szechuan sauce extra spicy with tofu. Ended up with a dish that was sweet and sour, not spicy and no tofu. Called up and provided the feedback. 

3 Strikes. I am done with this place."}
{"text":"Hot n sour soup with or without pork is amazing. Exceptional flavor from their curry dishes and orange beef. Spring rolls /egg rolls are not greasy and full of taste. 
Update: we've had several bad experiences since. Crispy beef was horrible and everything else we ordered was below average. I guess the chef quit."}
{"text":"Tried out King Szechuan and being Chinese, we ordered off the Chinese Schezhuan menu.  The dishes are quite good and I have to say the \"ma\" or heat is very hot for those spicey dishes - very Authentic.  We did have some non-spicy dishes - my 2 year old daugter had the sweet and sour fish which she loved (she ate so much) and their Jiaozi was really good.  Good to have a place in Oakville close to home without a longer trek.  Dishes were small however.   Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Just had a late lunch here with my mom and sister. Everything was amazing! This is REAL chinese food, not your hakka or dirty craving for chinese take out at 10pm on a friday night :P 

Everything was fresh and flavourful. Their hot and sour soup was different but delicious with a nice tang from the vinegar. Chicken corn soup was flavourful, a little salty but the perfect consistency. The veggie soup was just the same.

We had the beef, asparagus and onion as well as the spicy dry tofu. 
The beef was soft, flavourful, and perfect. Not too spicy but you can ask for chilly oil on the side. 

The tofu was crispy salty goodness.

Service was great, staff was helpful and kind.

Also the jasmine tea is amazing.

Definitely will be coming back to try something else.

Take the time to sit and eat! Too many people are always getting take out:P"}
{"text":"This was hugely disappointing. Food was excessively salty, flavourless and over priced. Basically the oakville version you would expect for Chinese food. 

I gave them a generous two stars as it was a clean restaurant and the service was decent. I will not be going back again. Time to go home and eat something else."}
{"text":"I wonder if the chef is amateur here. As an Asian, this was probably the worst tasting Chinese joint I've ever been to. Not quite sure why this place got high ratings. Hmm.
The mu-Shu beef was first mistaken and they gave us pork (we don't eat pork and accidentally chewed one ), and they only provided 4  or 5 tiny, super thin wraps, with NO sauce...flavour was...questionable(kinda tasted salt but that's about it) Beef was huge and chunky and barely had any  flavour and was  impossible to wrap in those minuscule thinly sliced wraps and we insisted the mu-Shu usually comes with a sauce but the waiter had this clueless expression like she has no idea. 

The egg drop soup was like drinking hot water. Tasteless.

Very disappointed, wasted about $50. (Yes very pricy as well)

Obviously will not be back and won't recommend anyone"}
