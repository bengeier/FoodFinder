{"text":"Worst chicken I've EVER had.  Thought that MAYBE I got a bad impression the first two times.  Thought I'd give it one more try.  Worst chicken I've ever had, bar none.  Way, way too much batter.  Again, chicken wasn't even warm.  I'd rather get fried chicken from Harris Teeter or Publix.  At least theirs TASTES good!  Even Food Lion has better chicken!  Never, ever, ever again.  I'd rather starve to death!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hell went on in this bojangles tonight. if I could give this hell hole zero stars I would! we waited in the drive through for about 10 minutes before someone actually came to the window. it was the manager asking \"umm what was your order?\" while 5 broads just stood around in background. when we finally did get our order we went home only to find chicken tenders straight from Satan's butthole. these things were so black and miscolored it was hard to believe they put them in a box and actually expected someone to eat them. The cheese on my sandwiches looked like it was freshly pulled out of the fridge, unwrapped from it's Kraft singles package and placed on the sandwhich. Other reviews were right about this poorly managed bojangles!"}
{"text":"Place was not busy but dirty. Mine and one other table occupied others empty. Most were dirty and chairs arrows all over. Crew was just standing around. Food was half done with what must have been leftover fried with almost almost no seasoning. I like Bojangles but drive on past this one"}
{"text":"If I could rate this negative I would. The managers were so rude to their employees right in front of me. People were just standing around and no one was working. No one there is friendly and mess up orders all the time. The food is usually cold and either flavorless or way over seasoned. The fries are always old and kept out too long. The dining room is usually messy with food all in the floor. Worst bojangles I've ever been to. I gave them many chances, but I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a Bojangles.  From the time we ordered until our meal was delivered was 30 minutes.  Two high school kids at the counter, one concerned and apologetic and one who didn't care.  The good guy (tall, dark, skinny) tried in vain to work with the manager to get us our order.  The manager on Thursday evening, Jan 14 shouldn't survive this review.  When you have 12 hostile customers at the counter, you'd better get your ass-istance out there."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am disappointed.  I love bojangles and would eat here a lot more being as its only a mile or two away from me, but each time the food is not fresh, the tea is nasty, and the service is slow.  I drive out of my way to the bojangles off of exit 90 to get decent food.  I don't know if it's the staff or the food prep but it's a major problem.  Wish they could get it together. It'd save me a lot of time"}
{"text":"Bojangles on SC-160. So, I decided I would come here for dinner today. They were not busy at all. No one in line inside except me. The young fellow working the register NEVER not one time greeted me or acknowledged me verbally.  Where is the TRAINING at for Customer Service skills.  Not cool and I refuse to spend money at places without the bare minimum of Customer Service is not extended. I'd rather drive an additional 6 miles up the road to KFC on Carowinds Blvd, where they ALWAYS take care of their customers. Bojangles thank you for nothing today!"}
{"text":"Never messed up my order before and everyone is always nice. Fabio is always a pleasure to deal with, very kind and personable."}
{"text":"I love Bojangles, and it is nice to have one close to home, BUT every single time I try to go to this location and either dine in or go through the drive-thru I have received horrible service. For some reason it always seems like they only have 2 people working, the line inside and out is wrapped around the building, and more times than not- the order is incorrect. I will now go out of my way to find a better equipped location to enjoy my chicken."}
{"text":"Always takes forever in this drive thru!!!  Even if you are the only one in line!  Don't know why we even try.  Waited in line for 30 minutes for 2 tender meals only to get up to the window and have them say \"pull up or will be another 4 minutes because we just started the chicken\".  The car in front of us pulled away before even getting to the window to pay.  Seriously don't know why we attempt to come here.  This is why you should go to Chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"They're always messing up. Can't get the order right, and make you wait for over half hour. I had to leave my car at the drive through and go in, since they forgot to give me half my order. Some of these workers should be fired immediately. They wasted too much of my valuable time."}
{"text":"The food is the usual fare. The poor rating is due to the very unclean restrooms. Both men and women restrooms were just plain dirty. There was no soap available to wash with. I wonder where staff wash their hands"}
{"text":"Stopped by this Bojangles for breakfast. 12 cars in drive thru so went in. 10 people waiting in line. Crew of about 5 only had one person that was actually productive.  When I finally got to the register the employee had no concern for me or my order. Right in the middle of my order he left and worked the drive thru. Another person took my order which I had to start over from the beginning. Worst experience ever. Never stopping here again"}
{"text":"When a chicken restaurant runs out of freshly cooked chicken at a fast food joint the manager needs to be fired! This restaurant is located in Monroe, NC off Hwy 74"}
{"text":"At 12:15 today they were out of most of their items on the menu. The floors were slick from being mopped with greasy mop water. The manager was to busy talking than being a manager. The girl at the register had a BAD  NOT CARING ATTITUDE.  My last eating there."}
{"text":"This is an older Bojangles. All the great food but a little difficult to get in and out of the parking lot due traffic etc."}
{"text":"Bojangles has always been our favorite \"greasy spoon\" for the occasional weekend breakfast when we are feeling too lazy to cook.  Unfortunately, while Bojangles is known throughout the South for their legendary biscuits, the Tega Cay location is better known in my household for their legendary order inaccuracy.  I've been here probably a dozen times, and would posit that my order has put together incorrectly on 75% of those occasions.  Today was the final straw.  After having to return to the drive thru window a second time to place a second order for the items that had mysteriously been left off the first, I was lucky enough to get the manager at the window.  When confronted by their mistake and their impressive streak of screwed up orders, she simply shrugged, smiled and said she was sorry and hoped that I had a \"nice day.\"  Ever seen the \"buh-bye\" airline episode on SNL?  I felt like I just lived it.  Too bad.  The biscuits really are amazing.  Lucky for me, there are other locations to choose from... that I will probably be visiting from here forward!"}
{"text":"Very clean Bojangles. The people were very friendly. They give you a number when you order and bring the food out to you. I've been here a few times and there's hardly ever a long wait before you actually get your food. The chicken was tasty as usual. The fries were very crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The biscuit was a little darker than I like, but still rather moist on the inside."}
{"text":"This is the worst bojangles in Charlotte. Always rude, disorganized and don't get me started on the food. The fries are Either cold or flash fried meaning they are cooked, not used so they get cold then get thrown back into the fryer to get them warm again which actually just makes them hard and greasy. The chicken tastes the same.  I've worked in food for years and it's not hard to be polite. I thought because of the area it was in that it would be a decent bojangles but I was sadly mistaken."}
{"text":"2.5ish? I mean are any of these actually good? Food is marginal at best. Staff is slow and could care less most of the time. Building is old and outdated."}
{"text":"This is my quick stop for busy days. Its filling, they are fast and always give out free samples. The place is clean and its not costly. Of all the fast food chicken chains they have the best biscuits!!!!"}
{"text":"The service needs some work at the location. The drive thru is always backed up because the probably keep messing people's orders up. They messed up my simple order today. Please work with your employees to train them better"}
{"text":"On our way home, we stopped into this Bojangles for a quick bite to eat. Outside, the location is very nice. The landscaping is beautiful and it looks like it would get a lot of business. However, there was only one other car in the parking lot during our visit.   Once inside, you could easily see the place isn't well kept. The drinks area had spills all over the counter, I couldn't even sit my cup down anywhere on it without the risk of getting it wet or sticky. The floor wasn't much better, even the chairs and tables had crumbs all over. At least the food was made to order and hot. One item was incorrect, a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit came without cheese. They ended up handing us a slice of cheese to add to the sandwich.   Overall, not the greatest Bojangles location I've experienced. On the upside, they sell Carowinds tickets. Would I go out of my way to come to this location again? No. Would I stop in if I'm passing by? Maybe by drive-thru."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the current special, Cajun Filet combo. I got the sandwich rather than the biscuit. As soon as I opened the wrapper, my Daughter noticed the same thing I noticed; it actually looked like the advertisement!   I don't know if I ever received a product from anywhere that actually looked like the studio version. It tasted great too.  We visit this location a couple times a month. Bathroom could usually use more attention as well as the dining area, but typically good service and product."}
{"text":"Got two Bojangler fish sandwiches.  First note always check your drive thru order before you leave the lot.  See photo.  I ordered both of these sandwiches with no cheese (who puts cheese on fish, personally no thanks!) and add extra tartar sauce.  Easy to see when you ask for something done special, that is too much for them to comprehend.  The lady repeated the order back correctly, however when I got home.... no cheese and no tartar!  I guess they thought since cheese wasn't wanted I may as well want it dry!  Not to mention the fish itself was \"old\", not fresh, very thin and and no flavor. I had this same sandwich when it was first introduced, it was good!  This time, barely a three star visit!"}
{"text":"It's Bojangles.  Building/facilities are old - never eat inside.  If I get drive thru the food and staff are okay."}
{"text":"Bo's...got have a steak biscuit to get the morning started right! Always consistently good.  The also do a good job with their coffee. This location is a little tricky to get out of if you go thru drive-thru. Sometimes it's better to use the back exit and go to the traffic light."}
