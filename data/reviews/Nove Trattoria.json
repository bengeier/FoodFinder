{"text":"Food is made with simple, fresh, delicious ingredients.  Service is friendly and attentive but not overbearing.  Prices are a tad high ($14-18 for a lunch entree ) - but great for a treat.  Will come back again (and again)."}
{"text":"This is a great local in the yonge and st. clair area. classic italian fare akin to cafe nervosa. They do pizza well, pasta well, salads well but I highly recommend the pasta it's always delicious. I don't know why my family doesn't like this place My boyfriend, my dad and friends all love it."}
{"text":"There are a few Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood but none as friendly, warm and DELICIOUS as this one. You can tell from the minute you walk in that this is a family-run restaurant with jovial staff and attentive customer service.   I've tried every appetizer on the menu and none have disappointed me. My absolute favourite appetizer is their Gamberetti (shrimp) with mixed greens.   As for mains, their steak and braised short ribs take your heart away. Fettuccine Della nonna is fabulous too!  Dessert has to be either the tiramisu, Panna cotta or the creme brûlée.   Nove is truly an amazing find and I will keep going back.   Make reservations on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the Yonge St. Claire area. Very friendly staff. Traditional menu prepared \"old school.\" the food is great. Service friendly but unpolished. Prices a tad high to be a \"regular\" neighborhood stop."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!  They re-serve discarded guest's pizza.  I ordered a pizza from them and it came cold and mysteriously covered in an insane amount of arugula, even though there was not supposed to be any on it.  When I uncovered the pizza from the ridiculous amount of leaves, one quarter had smoked chicken and onions, and the other 3 did not.  There was not supposed be either ingredient in my pizza.  I could easily see that the slices did not line up either.  I could also see footprints of toppings peeled off from the other slices.  Shortly after  my discovery the waiter came by to take the pizza away and said he would take it off the bill - without me actually even saying anything.    How could they knowingly serve me discarded pizzas??  These guys should be shut down for their shady business practices...not only are people getting ripped off, they could be getting sick from eating other people's thrown away pizzas!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and Melanzane Alla Parmigiana I could eat every day. Every.... single....  day! SO good! Cozy comfortable setting, which is so important when you want to relax over a good meal just like at home.  PHENOMENAL food, PHENOMENAL people. Open weekends. Raul S. is SO right - these guys will crack a smile outta anyone! If I had to pick one place in this neighbourhood to support it would be Nove Trattoria"}
{"text":"I'm Not too sure where all of these great reviews came from because my boyfriend and I went tonight and we were thoroughly unimpressed. We made reservations for 6:00pm, and when we arrived we were sat at a table near the door. All was fine until a couple walked in. The waiter then came over to us and informed us that we had to move because the couple who came in after preferred that particular table. So rude! We were then brought to a table in the back and were sat beside a huge, loud party. My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza each and one drink to share. The server completely forgot about our drink and when we reminded him he then laughed about it with another server. The pizza itself was mediocre at best. It was soggy and lacking in flavour. The chilli oil was the only thing that saved it. Also, You can see right into the kitchen and the female cook was dressed way inappropriately. Her stomach was out and the tag from her thong was sticking out from her pants! Unprofessional. The music was so loud you can't carry on a conversation and it was hotter than hell in there! The staff was extremely disorganized (running food to the wrong tables, forgetting things for tables) making the experience very awkward. You could feel the stress in the atmosphere. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Italian place in Toronto. Do I need to say more?   First the hosts always welcome you with a big smile and cheerful attention, even if you are having a bad day, those guys will inject you with a warm feeling that will make you forget the day, its like you are having lunch with your family at home.  The Raviolis are spectacular, needles to say, the Rose Sauce these guys make is mouth watering. The Sea Bass is amazing (a little bit pricey thou, but worth every dollar). Pizzas are delicious. Like, I haven't tried something that made me give them 4 stars.  If you are looking for the best Italian restaurant in Toronto, this might be your place."}
{"text":"The staff were really great and attentive. Great experience from that perspective. I met a friend after work on a Monday night and we got a table without needing a reservation and our food came quickly.   I ordered the pasta with tomato sauce and a variety of seafood. It wasn't bad, but it didn't excite me, either. The spaghetti was drowning in tomato sauce a bit. I only got one scallop, and the shrimp were chewy and slightly over cooked. I considered ordering the grilled calamari as my main and kind of wish I had - the seafood pasta only had a few small rings of calamari."}
{"text":"Great tasting Italian food. Always satisfying Pizza and Pasta. Expensive, but very tasty. You can customize any topping and pasta to your liking. If you are lucky, they will bring you, lovely lady, a heart shaped pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Italian food at a very fair price.  Staff is the best - so fun & friendly (love Grazia!!!).  Every time I come here I feel like I'm on vacation in Italy!  It's a tiny space so make sure you reserve in advance, particularly on the weekends.  Adoro questo posto!!!"}
{"text":"Back again on October 18th. First visit in over a year (I live in Indianapolis) while in town for business. Exactly as I remember. Everything was excellent. Service was outstanding and the food was prepared perfectly. Pink sauce with pasta was so fresh....amazing. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"One is greeted by an engaged if somewhat unctuous owner, (from a family of nine - Nove), who clearly takes pride in his small and worthwhile restaurant. Four of us ate very well, including two bottles of excellent Calabrian wine for $240 excluding tip.  The smoked salmon and aubergine starters were much better than you would normally expect. The latter being the owner's mother's recipe, the former being of good quality and plentiful. The veal was rich and the pasta was tasty. There were several choices of risotto and the mushroom one was full and top-quality. The seafood plate was a decent scattering of salmon, squid, scallops and shrimp.   All was prepared by four, young, enthusiastic chefs in the open kitchen.  Clearly many locals and friends of the restaurant return here and I will do the same."}
{"text":"The service here was great. Our waiter was very attentive and super friendly. I ordered the Penne and Salmon which was very yummy. It didn't come as expected (thought i'd receive a filet of salmon) but still very good. The bread was very strange. Seemed...plasticy? I dont know how to describe it but it was like nothing i've had before."}
{"text":"I write this review with hesitation because this is my favourite neighbourhood restaurant, and it's already always busy!! I'm so glad we discovered his hidden gem.  This place is amazing. The food is fresh and delicious. The service is warm, quick, and hospitable. You feel like you're in this warm Italian home and the hosts are doing such a good job taking care of you.   I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I go here enough to confidently say the grilled calamari, fettucine della nonna, and gnocchi are fantastic."}
{"text":"This little gem has become our go to spot for a cozy night out with great food. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Warm and wonderful customer service, i got the gnocchi and it was a decent portion for me. my boyfriend found his seafood spaghetti to be a small porand the location is very busy and small place but worth a try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, simple, Italian food, all made well. The place is cramped as they squeezed in a few too many tables, but have never had a bad meal in the many times we have been there."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing time here with two of my girlfriends. Amazing service, so friendly and kind, and not to mention the food was GREAT! Pizza has an unbelievable fresh and thin crust with great ingredients; pasta is great and you can customize as you'd like. The deserts are also delish! Pictures attached. Will return 10/10!"}
{"text":"A small and busy place! I came here for a date night and it's actually quite loud! Reservation highly recommended as the place is packed.  The focaccia served before the meal, is nice and spongey, though cold.   I ordered the Teresa pizza with Mozzarella, goat cheese, smoked chicken, spinach and sautéed eggplant. The chicken has a nice sweet flavour, almost like honey ham. The pizza has a nice crispy thin crust and fresh basil.  Service is okay; polite and present waiters."}
{"text":"Great experience. Delicious food, fantastic service.  Pizza and pasta to die for."}
{"text":"Expectations were built up as our friends told us this is a hidden gem and one of the best Italian meals in the city. However, I found it only satisfactory.   The food: We ordered an array of pastas and risottos. The Fettucine Della Nonna was the best dish on the table with a cream based sauce with al dente fettuccini pasta (just the way I like it), sautéed spinach, mushrooms and chicken. The chicken was rotisserie and was fairly tough and dry. I like my chicken tender and juicy, this was not it. They need to fix the chicken and this dish would be on point.   The risotto was lacking. I ordered a mushroom risotto and found it was over cooked, it didn't have that bite that a properly cooked risotto needs. Nove can take this dish to the best level with the addition of some truffle oil and rosemary.   The Service:  The service was below average as the waiter wasn't so happy to see a group with kids. At least pretend you're happy to serve us. The waiter didn't stop by and ask if we're enjoying our food. The owner did when we was bussing the other table.   Overall, I wouldn't come back, but the food was decent."}
{"text":"Delicious caesar salad and clam pasta. Tomato and bocconcini salad wasn't the best I've had, and the cocktails are hit or miss (I ordered a cosmo and I don't think they had all the ingredients necessary to make it!). But the atmosphere is cozy and the food is fairly consistently good. Will definitely go back and try some of the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here recently with a couple of work colleagues and really enjoyed it. We shared the grilled calamari to start, which was well-seasoned and very tender.   For my main, I ordered the pappardelle (recommended by one of my dining partners) and it was very enjoyable.   The space is small and quite noisy, but food and service were exceptional and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"It was an ok Italian place but the food is nothing special. The pasta dish was very dull and bland."}
{"text":"This place was incredible. Our waitress was so sweet and accommodated our party well! We picked 2 pizzas, veal, and seafood spaghetti. The salmon pizza was different than I've ever had before, but it truly hit the spot and complimented the special pizza of the night. The veal was cooked perfectly and was so tender! The veggies and potatoes were seasoned well and those alone were amazing. If you're looking for an intimate setting and fine Italian dining, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Nove e un dieci (o a meno un nove!)  Super friendly staff man the cozy restaurant on Yonge just south of St Clair. There are many places like this in the city but Nove is one step up from most.   Interior is a dimly lit narrow, classic table open kitchen look.  Their penne shrimp special was delicious, the penne, veggies and shrimp where done just right!  The demetrio pizza was also great, with super thin and slightly crispy crust, a healthy portion of each topping they hit pizza just right - exactly what you'd find in nappoli or Roma.  Miata salad was a bit light but nothing to complain of, they made us decafe lattes, perfect for an after dinner treat without keeping one up at night.  A large selection of sweets are available but we did not partake this round.  Overall well worth a visit."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Toronto for all kinds of food... Great staff, service and food of course! Always ask for the specials... I have been here over 50 times and only ordered off the actual menu a couple times"}
{"text":"Good food and great value!  Service was on point and provided for an enjoyable meal.  Family feel and traditional food like Nonna would make."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Nove Trattoria with work colleagues.  I ordered Pollo alla parmigiana.  I love chicken parm and this was delicious.  There was a light coating on the chicken and the chicken was really tender.  The tomato sauce was tasty.  The spaghetti was tossed in a garlic oil and was good.  It was a nice contrast to the tomato sauce and cheese.  I also had chocolate raspberry tartufo which was yummy.   The staff were friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"AWFUL EXPERIENCE! Walked in to be greeted by a man - which I believe to be the owner - in the rudest way possible! The curtains were closed and there seemed to be only one group of people at the restaurant. I walked in through the curtains and kindly asked if they were open, which his response was plain and dry \"what do you think?\". I say \"well, the curtains were shut, so I thought it could be a private event.\" He then yells at my mother who was standing by the door \"CLOSE THE DOOR!\". I was in complete shock with his rudeness, it ruined our night. I recently moved nearby and was really excited to try this place, but after that I'm never stepping foot inside it again."}
{"text":"Most authentic Italian place I've been to... Not pricy at all, with a casual and relaxing environment for chatting. Definitely coming back and would recommend to friends! My favourite is the daily special pizza with four different slices on a single pizza... The traditional tiramisu would be great with an espresso."}
{"text":"I have finally discovered this family style Italian gem in my own neighborhood.  It was well worth the wait!  The food and service are very traditional in every positive sense of that word.  Today I had the eggplant ragù, whole sea bass and the creme brûlée.  It was amazing as was the service.  We will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and the place was a cute and cozy Italian restaurant. She recommended it to me as a great place for pasta.  I ordered the smoked salmon penne (I forgot what the exact name is) but you can find it under the ingredients on the menu. I thought it was very tasty and a good portion size! It wasn't the best pasta I've ever tasted but it is high up there. The prices are decently priced (around $15+).   As for the service, they were very friendly and refilled our waters frequently!   I would come back to try their daily specials."}
{"text":"Fettuccine della Nonna ($15) is very tasty if you prefer creamy sauce as opposed to tomato sauce. The owner likes to stop by every table and chat with you. Really nice and friendly guy. The ambiance is simple and authentic. No frills Italian restaurant. If you're in the area and happen to be craving a pizza or pasta, you can't go wrong with Nove Trattoria."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Outstanding food. Great staff and service. This place does Italian WELL. It's a family-owned and operated restaurant and the hospitality reflects that."}
{"text":"I like this neighbourhood Italian restaurant and so do a lot of other people. Be warned the restaurant itself is very small and crowded, and can get really loud if it's full. The Vito pizza was delicious and is even tastier the next day. I always order the Fettucine della nonna which is the perfect portion and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"It was a very nice experience. The food is very good. The staff is super friendly. Service was fast. The place is cozy and romantic. You should get a reservation since I saw some people being sent away for lack of."}
{"text":"A co-worker recommended this place to me, so I decided to try it for lunch last Monday with another co-worker. It was pretty busy when we came and pretty much packed except for a few small tables. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted very warmly by the people working in the restaurant. You can tell the people there are legit Italian and are super super friendly. Bread is served \"Italian-style\" with olive oil and vinegar rather than butter. For my lunch, I ordered penne de golosone (penne in a rose sauce with smoked salmon, black olives and asparagus) and thought it was pretty good, although the salmon was just a tad on the salty side. I'm usually not a huge fan of olives, but I thought they complimented the dish well. I was very tempted to order a cappuccino or espresso after the meal, as I noticed they had a machine in the restaurant that also looked very legit. Would definitely come back if I'm in the area to try other things! Service was pretty attentive and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Once came for lunch and a table was brought from outside and made for us. Friendly service. Amazing pasta. Always check the specials they are amazing. Lattes and cappuccinos after are great. One of my favorite Italian places in the city. A small family feel of Italian food. Highly reccomend!"}
