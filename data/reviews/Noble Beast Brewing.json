{"text":"We were planning to go to Great Lakes but discovered they weren't open on Sundays. I've never been so happy to have to change plans. This was a great find in Cleveland. Amazing nachos, best hefe I've ever had, and Claudia our bartender was an absolute doll. Wish we were staying in Cleveland longer just so we could try more of their beers."}
{"text":"Solid beer, mostly on lighter side when I was there in the Summer (Disclaimer, I'm a year round Stout drinker). Outstanding food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Brew list and menu provide options but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Wonderful new brewery. Alt beer and saison are favorites. Very friendly, family run brewery where you can watch the brewing process."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice location near the lake in an old renovated building.  Food selection was good, definitely would recommend the Bavarian pretzel and the chips & dip.  Good selection of beers, really enjoyed the Pale Ale and IPA that were on tap.  Family friendly, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got the special, Roast Beef, and I was not disappointed.  The slow roasted roast beef in combination with the blue cheese, and pickled onions is a wonderful combination.  I highly recommend and look forward to the next item on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife, brother in law and his wife went to Noble Beast after an Indians game.  It was fantastic.  The place is charming, the food is good and the beer is second to none.  I had the burger and zesty fries and tried a few of the beers.  It was perfect.  (I hate to admit it but another time I came to NB, I had two in one sitting!)  Other folks in our party had Three Little pigs and the CLE corn dog.  Everyone loved what they got.  Every time I've been to Cleveland since then, I've tried to go back to try the beers on tap.  Best beer I've had, the guy that comes up with their beer is a master.    Long live the Noble Beast!"}
{"text":"Cleveland's new craft brewer has some fine beer/ale. I enjoyed the Kolsch ale, a German light beer. Not light like Lite, but German not dark beer. It is really good as agreed by my friend Bob who is a true beer drinker.   We had tasty wings for an appetizer and a \"Chivito\" beef ham and much more sandwich.  I could only eat half, so part goes home to my honey. It was yummy.   For dessert I got an \"Everything \" cookie. Could only eat a few bites of this new giant tasty delight. The rest goes home.  My wifey gets lucky again!"}
{"text":"Okay...great place!  This is my first time here. First and most importantly...the beers are great!  Buy with confidence. I sampled a few and all were winners of their style. I had the veggie sandwich and it was stellar. Bottom line, I'll be back frequent and often."}
{"text":"For all ages (babies to grandparents)... relaxing atmosphere, food is delicious (we got nachos, wings, three little pigs) and good beers!! I love the fact that they let you taste up to two kinds of beer!!!! Will be walking over there often now!!! :)"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday late afternoon, with nothing really going on in downtown. So we had the place to ourselves. But... it was a little confusing about how to order and what beer is actually available! Bar was staffed, but not with the \"best\" service industry people I have ever seen. They almost seemed bothered that we were there ordering food and drink!  We ignored the cold shoulder we received and started drinking! All was good... great deal on flights. And a couple things were out on tap, but overall we enjoyed.  Then something wonderful happened... I used the ladies room! They have it fully stocked for us!! Lotion, hairspray and some personal products too! NICE touch!  Best part of this place.... FOOD! Kitchen is killing it. We had nachos and fries and the CORN DOG! Ohh and the popcorn... all a must try and very reasonably priced.  Check this place out. Don't know if we will return. I didn't feel wanted or even have an \"experience \" there. To stay competitive here, you must deliver service behind the bar! Preferably with a SMILE!   Much Love!"}
{"text":"Holy wow!  This place is amazing. We have been touring Ohio tasting ohios best wings as a website bestinyourstate.com suggested. We came here just for the beer since we also love beer. We decided to try the wings even though it was not in the list. And. These were. Are the BEST wings we've had. Hands down. The best. Every flavor is fantastic. And their beer? Just as good. 5 stars. Keep up the great work! A huge shout out to James the chef/owner."}
{"text":"A class act in the microbrew scene. Unexpectedly delightful & thoughtful food with real culinary substance really sets apart this cool space and highlights the delicious, clean beers.   The house beer list was limited to about 5 taps when I was there, and that was perfect. Everything was super clean. The Altbier, in particular, was probably the closest thing I've had in the US that recalls the DÃ¼sseldorf brew for me. Lovely!  The space strikes just the right balance of chill, bright, hipster, and industrial. On a sunny day, it was just lovely to sit at the bar with the big bay windows open.   The small menu was such a wonderful surprise. The food is interesting, fresh, and delicious... everything that pub far normally isn't. We had a marvelous spring salad with fava beans and crisp asparagus in a light vinaigrette, and a vegetable flatbread sandwich that basically changed the way I think about vegetarian sandwiches. Just awesome.   Get it, Noble Beast! You nailed it!"}
{"text":"Disappointed,  Beer 2* Food 2* Atmosphere 5* ..... too many great brewpub in Cleveland  than to settle for average... Left to go to Masthead... When we left at 9 pm Friday there were few people left.... masthead almost full... Wish them well but beer must REALLY improve and food has interesting choices but all failed.... we tried wings (didn't finish)corndog bad, fried pickles bad, and something else equally forgettable"}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful atmosphere and a place to go to have a beer with a group of friends. This is not meant to be a sit down restaurant as it is first come first serve seating. The IPA beers were great and the food was very well cooked for a decent price. However the selection of the food is only bar and there's no is not a lot to choose from. Only one down point to the visit was that there were a ton of fruit flies and a they kept going over our wings and flew into our beers as well.  Even though the flies were a bummer I'd for sure still go back for a few drinks with friends!!"}
{"text":"I loooove the vibe in here. It's open and laid back. Every employee we encountered was incredibly friendly and chill and offered some great recommendations. I got a flight since it was my first time trying their beers and I can honestly say this is the first time (that I can remember) that I liked every single beer in my flight. Usually there are a few winners and 1 or 2 \"meh\"s, but I really enjoyed everything. I remember the \"say when\" saison and \"murder ballads\" porter were involved...   The food is good too! Which I feel is often a rarity at so many of these craft breweries popping up everywhere... they either offer sub-par bar food or have random rotating food trucks come in with limited menus. But Noble Beast has some impressive food options! We got the nachos and corndogs and they were the bomb. Also keep your eye out for the social media ticker counter behind the bar. It updates in real time and if you happen to be in the bar when it hits certain #s you get free stuff!"}
{"text":"First off, this is a pretty cool spot. It's large and spacious, located inside of a warehouse. It appears as if the beer you're drinking is brewed only a couple feet away from the tables you sit at.  The beer I had (a double ipa) was absolutely amazing, I could have drank a lot more of them if not for the menu. I'll eat practically anything you put infront of me, but I couldn't find one thing that looked appetizing on that menu. Also there only appeared to be two people working (a cook and a server/bartender) and it was relatively busy so I didn't want to bother with substitutes.   My advice, come for the beer, stay for the beer.. Maybe go elsewhere for the food?"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and a beer. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, which came with the bun a little burnt on the corners.   The chicken appeared to have a bit too much breaking around the edges.  The menu described it as spicy but there was very little hot sauce on it. After getting past that, the heart of the sandwich was very good. For a $12 chicken sandwich I just expected a bit more.   I've been a few times for beers and the selection is good for a small micro brewery.  I loved the Sibling/Noble beer."}
{"text":"Tried the IPA and the alt bier, both were very tasty. They had 5 of their brews and 5 other local brews on tap, which was great. Also got some chicken wings, and those were tasty. I sat at the bar, and the patron next to me got the corn dog and said it was great.   The only thing I didn't like was that when your food order is ready, the kitchen staff get on a mic and announce your name and order, in what sounds like an official wresting or MMA style (a la Bruce Buffer). It's all in good fun, and I get that, but I'd prefer to just get my food without all the fanfare."}
{"text":"Pretty cool newer brewery downtown, would give it a 4.5. Kind of a modern-industrial feel to the place. Always a few people here, and I've always been here at \"off times\" like early afternoons on Saturdays. Food wise 5/5. I had the CLE Corndog, a kielbasa corndog which was outstanding. Locally made kielbasa with housemade breading, excellent. Definitely would get this again any time I'm here. My fiance got a half tray of nachos for us to share which were solid. I really liked how it was served on an actual tray, so instead of a big mass of chips and toppings in the middle, everything is evenly spread out. They also had a nice hearty chip, which didn't become soggy and useless once it had some cheese on it. Both although more snacks than meals, I would not hesitate to order again. The big concern at any brewery is the beer which I would give 4/5. All of the beers I have tried here I have enjoyed, but nothing that was so outstanding to definitively draw me back. They also don't have a huge taplist yet, which I think will expand as the brewery grows, which is my biggest dislike here, in not having a ton of options. I will gladly come back here again, and hope as they become more established, that the taplist will grow as well."}
{"text":"An open, warehouse-style concept, good food and exceptionally knowledgeable staff make this local brewery perhaps more of a hidden gem in an area swamped by an influx of craft breweries. It's not one you want to miss!  Start with a flight to figure out your taste, and enjoy a wide variety of drafts. The food here is really good -- the chips and dip were delicious and made with an IPA French onion dip. Delicious! This place was super chill on a Sunday and the open windows towards the front allowed us to view a beautiful sunset over the lake.  Noble Beast offers a small but awesome dog-friendly patio in the back as well as brunch and dinner options. The beers are not super carbonated (a plus for my old lady stomach) and are poured carefully by the staff. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Visited Noble Beast Brewing last weekend and I found my new favorite bar/restaurant in Cleveland! Impressive beer selection and food menu! We intended to stop by for drinks and an appetizer prior to nearby dinner reservations. Yadda yadda yadda... Their dessert was pretty great too! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent brews. I had the veggie sandwich and my husband had the smoked pulled pork sandwich. Both were outstanding. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beers and a nice food menu. Bar food but very good. Friendly staff and nice environment.  Check out the wings, awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this new spot. The menu is limited but appears to be high end. The beers are tasty. The service is great. Definitely recommend on a sunny, warm Saturday"}
{"text":"This brewery is a hidden gem. Stop by on wing night for $0.75 wings. My favorite item on the menu is their chicken sandwich which is unfortunately only served during Lunch M-F due to its popularity and limited kitchen space? Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere is chill and the service is excellent.  The beer is refreshing. I ordered the kolsch and the ipa  The kolsch was crisp and refreshing while the ipa was slightly hoppy but satisfyingly great. The  food here is tasty. My husband ordered the meatball sub which was superb  and I ordered the burger which was also delicious.  We had the nachos too. We were hungry lol! The nachos were a little different with radishes and a white cheese sauce was out of this world! We will definitely be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yet another new brewery takes root in Cleveland. Luckily, it is a good one. Located just east of 9th on Lakeside, Noble Beast Brewing occupies a large, old brick building that is unassuming from the outside. Inside is the familiar open and industrial but cozy design. There is an upstairs deck for large groups and a small outside area if you want to sip outdoors. Another plus is the ample parking in an adjacent lot.   I can't comment on the food, but I sampled the Kolsch, Alt bier, Saison, and IPA. All were above average. Alt bier is a hard style to do well, and theirs was particularly good.   If there was one negative, the service was not great. There were only 12-15 customers at the time and neither of the two bartenders asked if we wanted another round after our empty glasses sat in front of us for at least 15 minutes. Also, it was annoyingly difficult to get their attention to cash out. Despite this, I would return based on the quality of the beers and recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Wow.  So I like to keep tabs on all the new breweries opening up in N.E. Ohio, and I'd been following the building of Noble Beast pretty eagerly.  Let me just say that in a town where many breweries are re-purposing industrial spaces, there's a tendency for some to turn out a bit soulless and homogenous, but right as I stepped through the door I could tell that Noble Beast hadn't fallen into that at all.    Design/Vibe:  My wife and I stopped in around 9:30pm on a Tuesday and we were welcomed in through a giant garage door that essentially made the place feel indoors and outdoors at the same time.  There are warm and cleverly hung bulbs throughout the place illuminating the tasteful accenting wood tones and colorful decorations to make the place pop (I.e. green bar stools, a rare 1970's motorcycle hanging from the ceiling and giant cutouts of Hops on the wall in the corner). Also the music was solid and inviting alternative/indie tunes at a perfect volume for the space and late night drinkers.  Food: Honestly I think that food is becoming a very important element in the success or failure of a brewery. Well, it just so happens that Noble Beast hired the former sous chef of Spice Kitchen in Gordon Square, and they could not have made a better move. The food was absolutely killer and makes this place he totally viable lunch and dinner spot in the downtown area as well.  We had the veggie sandwich with fries and a corn dog.  Would definitely recommend.  Lastly, the beer: All the brewing equipment is right there for you to see which always creates a cool aesthetic.  My wife and I had the Manchurian Grisette and the Say When Saison.  I don't have an educated enough understanding of exactly what flavors to look for in some of these less common beer styles, but I do know when my pallet is pleased and that was definitely the case here.  And I can only imagine that as the batches roll in, the product will only continue to improve!  Overall, this place quickly ascended to the top rankings of my favorite breweries in the Cleveland area.  Do yourself a favor and stop in often :)"}
{"text":"We made it for the Grand Opening and so glad we did, this craft beer and eatery is a gem. The atmosphere is fitting for suits or shorts . The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable of their product , and the food was delightful.  We will definitely be stopping back in the next time we visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"Noble Beast Brewing exemplifies everything a micro  brew should be. The space has plenty of bar seating along with tables for groups. The actual brewery aspect of the Noble Beast is within the seating area which adds to the ambience. When you are in the space look up and see the awesome sky light with cool hanging plant beds. The service was great and very helpful. Quick to pour a drink which is my favorite type of bar tender. The beer itself was great. The IPA was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. They also had a mango flavored beer that was very good as well. I did not look at the food menu but the food that came out of the kitchen looked great. The place is close to the lake and is a must stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Damn you Noble Beast. How the hell can I keep up if simply awesome craft beer joints like yours keep cropping up? A man has but one liver to sacrifice for the cause and mine is already spread thin. Alas, I must continue the fight. You wouldn't want it any other way. You and your pedigreed brewmaster, once a loyal subject of House Platform, now striking out on his own, building his own empire. His skills are known throughout the land, his talent with malt, water, hops and yeast the bedrock upon which legends are built.  Your hall is both welcoming and accommodating. During our visit, perhaps it was a Wednesday, 6ish, we found a animated crowd filling nearly every available space, glasses filled, cheeks rosy, embraced in your brand of hospitality. A bar built for a dozen plus thirsty patrons, wooden tables that would suit any mead hall and an elevated mezzanine fit for a revelry. Open, airy, the outside welcomed inside through large, open portals. And you were not ashamed to show your wares - bags of grain, stainless steel tanks glinting in the sunlight. A glory to behold. You pull up your skirt and flash a wry grin. You want us to see how your nectar is made. You relish in its natural state.  I opened the doors and allowed all of your children to play upon my lawn. Two saisons say you? How dare you! A kombucha saison alone would have done the trick, but a peppercorn rendition as well? Of course you did. Simply stunning. And then you unleashed an imperial IPA so cunning, so brilliantly balanced and filled with juicy tropical fruit notes - Evil Motives, indeed. Then came the Kapitan Altbier with its hints of caramel malt sweetness and sneaky bitter backend followed quickly by its lighter cousin, Catchweight Kolsch, light, spritzy, white bready deliciousness and made for multiples. Sure, I was aware of your \"guest taps\", I wanted to give them some love, too, but I just couldn't. Your house beers kept me for themselves. Maybe next time.  Not content to merely entertain our magenta-lobed innards, you've gone out of your way to bring on the sustenance. For you know all too well that those partaking of the drink must sate their hunger as well. Damn you again. A menu so deceptively short yet so bloated with culinary delights. When liquid bread fills my gullet you have my back. Salads, sandwiches, noshy-sized bites. And a chef and kitchen teeming with raw, unadulterated culinarian talents, the likes of which rarely show themselves in even the finest restaurants let alone a humble house of malty beverages. I wanted to try it all, but I did not, I could not.  I did select some carefully curated options - the soft pretzel with cheese sauce and honey beer mustard. Authentically Bavarian? While I cannot attest to its lineage I can simply say well done and more.  But then again, maybe you already knew of my unabashed proclivity toward the world of soft pretzels. Then the 3 Little Pigs paid my taste buds a visit. Your humor knows no bounds. While the bread brought with it some mandibular challenges and left behind some marks of battle on the roof of my mouth, I persevered. The trio of country ham, smoked ham and, oh yes, and bacon, well, they paid tasteful homage to the porcine sacrifice that preceded this sandwich's creation.  Not one to shy away from the Earth's more vegetal options, I was drawn into the Spring Bean Salad. Beans the size of a baby's fist, I tell you, and the crispy asparagus, spicy radish, and arugula? Of course you had to dress it in a beer vinaigrette. But I wasn't done yet. A Cleveland Corndog? A smoked kielbasa sourced from a local purveyor of meaty things enrobed in a crispy blanket of fried spent grain batter. More honey beer mustard. This tubular pig creation was just too damn good not to be the work of Mephistopheles himself.  Ah, Noble Beast, you are not merely a brewery. You are much more. You are a place where a weary soul can find refuge, if but for a short while, from the raging world outside. You are a home filled with artfully crafted beers that flow freely from tap to tongue. And you are a haven for the hungry, a rest stop on life's highway for the empty stomach. Damn you, and all of your greatness. For now I have yet another brewery to work into my already loaded drinking schedule."}
{"text":"The beer is fantastic and their already wonderful food menu is constantly improving. My only whimpering complaint is the service. I've sadly seen a few too many bartenders look at me standing at the bar with an empty glass that walked away, never to return and ask if they can help. I've also seen a manager have to remind a woman looking at her phone to help me since I was standing there... just a few feet away. Please don't let that stop you from coming here because it's truly worth the trip, but be patient!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer with very friendly staff. Food is simple but great. Will definitely be back to try the other beers."}
{"text":"Noble Beast is a casual laid back brewery in downtown Cleveland within walking distance of the Browns stadium and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. I really liked the environment here with visible brewery equipment, a giant bar, and lots of light. It's a good spot of a low key date or group outing. With both Noble Beast and rotating brews on tap, there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this place, except Bobby, but I'll get to that later.   My family and I were in town to watch the US Men's Soccer Tournament and we stayed at the Hilton downtown. Due to not so pleasant reviews of the hotels dining options, we looked elsewhere and despite the low number of reviews for Noble on Yelp, the menu intrigued us. We arrived on a Friday around 7:30 and although it was just about full to capacity, we were able to score a table for four. Upon entering, Anna told us that we had to order at the bar. I was very confused on how exactly the process worked, so I approached the bar and proceeded to get some of the rudest service in my life from Bobby. He was short with me, non explanatory of the process, and kind of snippy. He was so rude that I almost decided not to tip him, but due to the fact that I know tips are shared and everyone else seemed approachable and friendly, I did not want to punish them for his nastiness.   After figuring things out, we ordered: -CLE corndogs -Bavarian pretzels -Miso Honey, Gochujang, and Beer-B-Q wings When your food is ready, they call your name over a microphone. I have no idea why Bobby decided to bring our food to our table, but my guess was that he wanted to deliver another punch which is what he did when he slammed our trays on our table without a single word and just walked away. My fiancee is the most laid-back person you could ever meet, and he was ready to grab Bobby by his nasty beard and pour his beer in his face. I was on the verge of complaining when I took a bite of my food and....  OMFG....everything was ridiculously fantastic! I am NOT a wings fan and these blew my socks off! We were so blown away that we vowed to visit the next night and we did just that. Right after the game, we ran to Noble Beast to beat the crowd. In addition to another order of corndogs, we also ordered the buffalo and sesame arbol wings, chips and caramelized dip, kitchen sink cookies, and a cheesecake roll. For two nights in a row, we thanked the chefs and they were very gracious, humble, and thankful that we came back. Unfortunately, Booby was also there, but I acted as if he did not exist and I went straight to beautiful Anna to place our order. Anna was just as friendly and approachable as the night before and I was very grateful for her help.    Thanks guys for fresh made to order, wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Great brewery tucked away at the outskirts of the downtown area. I've been here a couple of times and had really good tasting beers both times.  The layout is cool but pretty standard for a brewery- exposed beer tanks in the back, polished concrete floors, large picnic benches for bigger groups. I tried the imperial cookies and milk stout that comes with a little cookie garnish. It was delicious!! The food here is also excellent. We had some wings and fries last time which were pretty tasty.  This is a great, casual place to hang out with good quality beer.  Will definitely hit up again!"}
{"text":"I can't give it 5 stars yet because our first experience here in November 2017 was not good. We decided to give it another shot based on the recommendations of some friends and this time I was very impressed with the meal I ordered and the 2 beers I had. The veggie sandwich is a mix of ingredients you wouldn't expect to work, but was absolutely fantastic. It definitely turned my perception of this place around, and I look forward to going back and getting it again."}
{"text":"We decided to try out a new brewery and had heard good things about noble beast.  Its a family friendly, and had several children running around.  We sat at the bar and ordered a couple of beers.  They only had 2 people working which didn't seem to be enough at some points.  After a beer we ordered some fries and a flight of beer.  Our fries took about a half hour to come out and had a very long hair intertwine in them.  I didn't say thing about the hair, I just stopped eating them, at this point the 2 people working were overwhelmed with food orders and drinks.    Overall don't think we will be going back, it's not really worth the drive across downtown (we live on the west side)  The food that came out looked good; but it sat the counter for a long time because they only had 2 people working.  I hate cold food!! The beers were okay nothing mind blowing.  It's sad because they have a cool building, and I had high hopes."}
{"text":"This place is very trendy. You walk into a big open space very industrial feeling and there is a bar and picnic tables. The menu was very limited and very particular. I felt I couldn't really find anything on the menu I'd like unless I altered it too much. I always feel bad asking for substitutes so we decided to try some beer and find somewhere else for lunch. I did have a kolsch which was very good."}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing Company, a well established Cleveland brewery on the near west side, has competition in Noble Beast. A small brewery right in downtown near Lake Erie has fantastic beer and good food. We had the burger special, bleu cheese burgers, that were cooked to perfection, medium rare here, and very tasty. I opted for coke slaw instead of fries and it was fresh, hand cut and delicious.   As good as the food is, the star here is the beer. Several beers were sampled and favorites were the fresh hopped beer (an IPA with an amazing citrus  aroma) and the best Alt beer I have ever tasted. They called it Kapistan Alt. Malty and hoppy, a work of art.   Staff were friendly and knowledgeable on the menu and beers. Later I learned that an owner was tending the bar and served us during a busy Friday lunch crowd.   If downtown for a sports event or show, give the Beast a try."}
{"text":"Came on a whim and super enjoyed this place, my husband loved the beer and the food was on point!"}
{"text":"We had our June supper club here and I must say Noble Beast is a pretty nice beer drinking space.   Getting here I did have to drive through a shady looking part of town where people were sleeping in doorways and groups of men were arrogantly/carelessly walking all over the streets. Once you get to the brewery though the fear you had for your safety is diminished. They have street parking, a paid lot, and the FBI is across the street. Inside is open and airy with a garage door at the front and back. This is incredibly helpful on warmer days when you need a little breeze to help with that back sweat. Decor had that popular casual industrial vibe with plenty of seating (although we came on a Wednesday evening and it was pretty full).   For service it's up to you. Just like Hatfield's or Masthead or even McDonald's, you order at the counter/bar, pay, and then pick up your food/drinks when staff calls your name. Napkins and silverware are on the tables or you can pick up more at a side counter. You bus your own table or if they have time someone will help take away dishes. But in general, no one waits on you so I think this is where we questioned if we should leave a tip or not. We all ended up leaving a little something to show our appreciation for them handling a bunch of orders at once, but I do not think a tip is obligatory in this instance just like it's not at similarly run businesses. If I am wrong and a jerk I apologize, please put up a tip etiquette sign for the clueless.   The owner is very personable and told us how he had experience at Fat Heads and Platform before opening up his own place (also the wife is super nice too and their baby is a cutie). They have four or five house beers on tap then a couple guest beers for you to choose from. I went with a flight and I want to say each beer in my flight was $2.50 and either 4 or 5 ounces. I'm not a huge beer fan so it all tasted just okay to me, but I am glad I got to try a variety and think everyone should do a flight!  As for food we all shared and got several things. I tried a bit of the meatball sub and thought it was pretty tasty. The bread had a firm crust but was soft on the inside and I liked the cheese curds on top. The soft pretzel was actually pretty hard but we were told that is usually not the case and it must have been a cooking mistake. The veggie sandwich got mixed reviews (one person really liked it, the other thought it was just okay), but I enjoyed the coleslaw that came with it. Several people liked the graham cracker crusted pickle chips, but I was not a fan plus that apple ketchup threw me off. Full tray of nachos $12 seemed to be a hit across the board (I kept tasting something slightly sweet/unique and it turns out they cook the meat with cinnamon sticks!). For dessert we got this cheesecake roll $6. It's like six slices of frozen cheesecake wrapped in oats that you dip in this very hot caramel bacon sauce. I loved the taste and the hot/cold textures.   All in all I would definitely come back here and I suggest you give them a try!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, very cool eclectic crowd enjoying good beer on Independence Day.  And honestly very crowded at1:30 on the 4th.  Open garage door looks out onto a sliver of the lake and the FBI building.   Beer (1 kolsch, 1 altbier) was very good.  Ordered the much reviewed corndog.   Solid choice.   Cleveland is rising - this place proves it.  Stop in for some good beer,  a nice vibe and good enough food.  I do like that they didn't try to create some different food menu experience.  Some simple things to eat while you enjoy good beer.  Drink on Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Definitely can't say enough good things about Noble Beast! One of my favorite breweries in Cleveland based on food, beer and atmosphere combined. The staff is always welcoming and friendly and the beers never disappoint. We enjoyed the menu and tried four different plates on our visit. I love the openness of the space and am always waiting to head back in for another brew!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on their first day open. Pouring some really good beers for having just opened. The IPA was pretty good. They had two saison options, one a fruitier kombucha and the other a peppercorn. They also had an altbier and a kolsch. They also had some good guest beers, like Jolly Pumpkin out of dexter, MI and NBB out of FoCo, CO.   Surprised also to see some beer enthusiasts there as well. Someone noticed my Libertine shirt out of SLO.   They also have food. We had a half order of nachos and they were perfect for the moment.  One recommendation. Find an alternative way to get the food to patrons. Someone yelling over the speakers every couple of minutes got annoying"}
{"text":"I have to admit. I was sceptical about dining here. Only because I'm not a huge beer drinker.   We started with a flight of all lf their in house draft beers. Out of the 8 we sampled, I actually liked them all.   With many restaurants there are usually a wait staff. However, that isn't the case with Noble beast. You order at the bar and the staff will bring you, your food. Not a huge fan of this approach. But, it seemed to work.   We were a large party. Roughly 14 to 17 people. The picnic table approach is both good and bad. There wasn't a lot of movable space.   We did order a few small plates.  The Nachos The pig popcorn Basket of fries Kitchen sink cookie.   Everything was delicious. The popcorn was good. But, A bit too messy to eat and enjoy. The Nachos were fantastic and so were the fries. The kitchen sink cookie was warm and packed with flavor.   The overall look of the place is great. It was very clean and the staff was awesome! I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"There are a lot of new breweries popping up in Cleveland but Noble Beast is a standout.  As Platform die-hards, my boyfriend and I set the bar high for this new spot, but we have been throughly impressed every time we come! Noble Beast quickly made it into our Top 5 list and we've placed it into heavy rotation in our weekend plans. The house beers are great and they also have a great guest list. The list is constantly changing, which is great and gives you reason to keep coming back. The food here is very good. We have ordered the nachos which were very good, but the MUST ORDER item on the menu here is the Veggie Sandwich. Do it. Trust me. It's so good.   Some of the OG bartenders from Platform came over to this place and it shows when it comes to the service here, which is fantastic. The vibe of this whole place is great. It's just very well done. Look forward to seeing this place succeed."}
{"text":"Love Noble Beast. Really well made beer across the board. Have not had one that I haven't enjoyed. And the food is great too. Special mention to the Pork Carnitas Nachos and Chicken Wings - super good!"}
{"text":"While in Cleveland stopped by for some beer from a gold medal winning brewer and was not disappointed! Being from NC we take our beer seriously. I had zero expectations for the food- just wanted some grease to go with good beer and friends. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. This place is the whole package. My only knock on it would be the sadness wafting over from the nearby Browns stadium."}
{"text":"Tucked away quietly on Lakeside Ave and 13th St. is downtown Cleveland's latest microbrewery. The brewer is asian so I had to show respect and go on opening day.  The interior is spacious and retains a fun/casual/industrial feel that is perfect for getting down and dirty with a few craft brews. The bar is longer than most with 15+ seats and there is 2nd floor with longer tables for large groups. There is also a small \"patio\" - it's more just an outdoor area for standing on a nice day.  The beers were solid. I got the Evil Motives IPA and the Kombucha saison. The IPA was well balanced and can be appreciated even by those not considered hopheads. The kombucha saison was a nice, low abv freshing tart brew that is great for summer. I did not order food but they have a kitchen as well.  Great addition to the local beer scene. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Beers were great, service not so much. No wait staff and 2 bartenders . Getting check to leave took forever.  Literally getting grey hairs waiting."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends last weekend for a birthday celebration. Wow. I thought CLE had too many breweries, but Noble Beast demonstrates perfectly what they're all aspiring to: great service, amazing beer, and great food. The wings were the best I've had in CLE, Boston, or PA (home, and the land of wings) - try the buffalo or garlic. Had a flight of beer and then couldn't stop drinking the \"CLE After Dark\" (don't worry, we Ubered).  Great addition to my favorite town to visit!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe inside. Picnic benches and chill music. Warehouse feel to the inside. The garage door stays open in the summer to let in a breeze and fresh air. Gets crowded but not overblown and not too noisy for a good convo.   They also have some good items that are good and some desserts. Option to sit at the bar too with a couple or large screen monitors with sports on. On a Saturday they show euro soccer."}
{"text":"After having this place bookmarked for months, I was finally able to experience this fairly new brewery in a less pretentious area of Cleveland.  I decided to get a flight of  beers since this was my first time and I wasn't too sure what to expect.  I am definitely coming back and getting a full size of The Widowmaker (Belgian Tripel) and Noble Sibling (Imperial IPA).  I'm so glad that all the hype wasn't for nothing, these beers were well done.  The corndog is a must for anyone who has a fondness for them.  The kielbasa was a smoky and savory delight covered in a semi sweet wrapping of batter fried  to perfection.  The dipping sauce and the sauerkraut it came with were an excellent complement.  At first, I thought $7 was a bit pricey for a corndog, but after tasting it, I understood why.  This is the brewery I would recommend to visitors."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and we had a great time. Truthfully, I didn't know what to expect. Their location on Lakeside feels kind of random, but I like it like that. We were here about noon, and to my surprise, I was able to snag one of the six-ish street meter spots.  I had the Catchweight KÃ¶lsch, which I HIGHLY recommend. It was so eerily satisfying in a way I can't even describe and truly reminded me of my days living in Germany. I also had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich - which was super surprising. It was definitely more upscale bar food, if that's even a thing. Well worth the lunch trip. Just be forewarned, everything is self-serve. Even if you grab a table, be prepared to walk up to the bar to order your drink and food (I wish they had a sign that said this. So many people wander in confused. If they do have a sign, it may need a better location). The food here puts many other breweries to shame in that department.  I just had a good feeling when I was here...like they care about what they're doing and the beer they serve. We were sort've in a time crunch, but I want to come back here soon for dinner. I bet the vibe here is really cool in the evening. I would've loved to try more beers or even a flight, but alas, I didn't want to return to work hammered by drinking too much at lunch. Next time!"}
{"text":"So it's taken me awhile to write a review for Noble Beast, not because I haven't wanted to, I just wanted to get it right. So here goes...  Noble Beast is hands down my favorite brewery in Cleveland. Why? Let me count the reasons:   1. The beer. Shaun is unbelievably dedicated to the craft of brewing and it shows in his beers. They are all perfectly balanced and very creative. My favorite is his Strawberry Grisette. It's just the right sour level and the faint strawberry notes make it crisp and refreshing. With a ABV under 4 it's easy to have a few!   2. The food. Noble Beast has elevated bar food at a completely affordable price. Almost every time I go I get the veggie sandwich. It's full of fresh veggies on warm, chewy,  grill bread. Delicious! Their wings are quite wonderful too. The miso honey ones are my go to and on Wednesdays they're $.75/a piece!   3. The atmosphere. Noble is located on Lakeside downtown across from Channel 3 and the FBI building. It's off the path from other downtown Cleveland bars/breweries so you find the crowd there tends to be more of the craft beer nerd type (my favorite kind of people). Most nights I've been there it is pretty chill and low-key. Tuesday's they do have trivia. They also have a small section of the brewery for hosting events. I can't forget to mention that the staff... they are all friendly, attentive, and super knowledgeable.   If you love craft beer and haven't been to Noble Beast I have one tip for you....GO THERE ASAP! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I discovered Noble Beast Brewing during a recent trip to Cleveland. I stopped in on a weekday late afternoon - around 5:00 pm. Folks were starting to filter in...  I sat at the bar and ordered a tasting flight:  666 Conducer (Belgian Strong Golden Ale)(8.0% ABV) Smoked Kellerbier (5.3% ABV) Evil Motives IPA (7.0% ABV) Sour Raspberry Grisette (4.6% ABV)  I enjoyed all four brews! Very nice and well executed! I was especially impressed with the Sour Raspberry Grisette! I love Sours and Raspberries - and this one was well done. It did not taste like cough syrup - as do so many attempts at \"beers with berries.\"  The barkeep was friendly and knowledgeable - and we had an enjoyable conversation about the art of craft brewing.  They also serve food here if you are hungry!  I will be visiting here again!  #NobleBeastBrewing"}
{"text":"Noble Beast is probably my favorite new brewery in Cleveland.  It's cozy, it's welcoming, with a lot of natural light. When I went one whole side of the joint was off limits, as it was still being constructed, but seriously I think that's why I like this place. They want the locals to enjoy their product, no matter what. The beer is fantastic, the food is legit. The best thing is it's just a walk away from my apartment, so it's so convenient, and located in a section of town that I think is the new up and coming neighborhood.  Get the corn dog, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great new (to us at least) spot. The food and the beers were very good. Try the mushroom egg rolls."}
{"text":"Very chill atmosphere. Not too much going on, it's a good mellow hang out spot. Simple concept with some surprisingly tasty food. It's a new place, only be opened for about 8 months so for what it's worth we thought it was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Secluded enough to beguile and breezy sweet in the summer gloaming, Noble Beast should be legendary shortly. A homespun wonder: its cozier than Masthead, more hardscrabble than Platform, and more exclusive than both combined. There's an interior bike rack (a rarity) that sets off the motorcycle theme (complete with a stoic Steve McQueen posing in the men's room). Plush hops hold court, just as they should, above the small raised dining room. Down below, the bearded blue-eyed barkeep is genial, gracious, and quick with suggestions. Marvel, dear reader, at the brewing tanks, gleaming and rotund, unapologetically claiming a good 2/3 of the bar-proper real estate. Then try the Dearly Departed, an extraordinary stout (and a steal at $3.50/10 oz.) that is perfectly smooth for those most balmy Cleveland evenings. Finally, dive into the veggie sandwich, a slightly soppy treat, heartily smeared in almond butter and garlic aioli (worlds better than it ought to be). Rest assured, this is the quintessential Andrew Bird inspired (?) brewery. Worth all the ballyhooing and then some."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for so long.  Finally, finally I got there. Great casual dining at picnic table style seating. I had their Murder Ballads Baltic Porter,,,, yum.  Smooth and malty.  I had to have another. For lunch, I switched to the Evil Motives IPA. It was perfect with my Apple Salad.  You order at the bar and the food is delivered to your table. My friend and I stayed quite awhile playing Scrabble and the place had a good crowd all day long. Street parking or there is a pay lot right next door. They also had several wines (interesting labels) and you eat right in front of the brew tanks. We watched one of their brewers working for a bit. The place is clean with nice restrooms. Not huge but not tiny either. Highly recommend; drink local."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on vacation in Cleveland and this place was 2 blocks from our hotel, near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I ordered the IPA, splendid! They had a roast beef sandwich as a special (Cold roast beef, but extremely tasty!) and we got the pretzel as well. I got the slaw on the side and it was super tasty, mayo based but not gloppy at all.  The pretzel was huge and I dipped it in the cheese sauce, but the spicy mustard was even better. My wife got yellow mustard and was a huge fan as well.  I got the American Stout for my second beer and it was a lot hoppier than a normal stout, but in a great way.  A fun atmosphere and the guys behind the bar were super cool. They had a great ice water dispenser nearby for my wife that does not drink and just a fun layout."}
{"text":"The Altbier at this place would make me come back again and again even if the bar was literally a flipped over barrel in an alley. It is my favorite craft beer honestly ever from any brewery. True to style - perfectly roasty and dark colored, yet light and refreshing to drink. I LOVE THIS BEER!  Thankfully that isn't necessary as the atmosphere is top notch as well. I love the feel of the place - cozy and welcoming while still being open and bright. Garage doors on both ends of the building open in the summer to enjoy our fleeting amazing weather and lake breezes.   I like the picnic table seating up front which puts you right in the heart of the brewery equipment itself, but also the separate raised area with more picnic tables in the back. We like to park it there on Sunday afternoons where we can bring the toddler and ply him with some snacks, books and puzzles and just enjoy a couple of pints together. Up in that area it doesn't bother anyone if the kid walks around a bit or is a little loud.   Other beers we've had here have also been good - I've enjoyed some of their recent forays in to the sour styles over the summer and early fall. They always have a couple of guest handles on rotation as well.   The food menu is small but everything we've had has been fresh and delicious. Nachos, sandwiches and especially the CLE Corn Dog is very good - fresh-made sausage and spent-grain batter is delicious and the little bit of kraut that comes with it was bomber too.   That Altbier tho.....get in there and try it! We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Chelsea is the best. Order the sampler beersbeers. Nachos are good. Music is good. Trivia is pretty fun too."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of beer but since I live in Cleveland I find myself at local breweries all the time.  This particular brewery did have Zombie Killer mead on their menu.  I happen to love that stuff but ofcourse they were out of the one day I show up.  The bartender was really invested in finding something to fit my taste.  Everything available was just too beer-y for me.  So I finally settled on a reisling wine (YES they have WINE!!).  It was the perfect amount of sweetness.  Food:  I had the mushroom eggrolls.  If you like mushrooms you can't go wrong with those.  My friend had the Chivito and he could only eat half of it.  So be prepared to have leftovers.  The one thing that will ensure that I return is the Kitchen Sink Cookie.  This cookie had everything you could want and some stuff you didnt think about in it.  It comes out warm and ready to devour.  It is big enough to share but honestly you won't want to.  Overall I had a nice experience at the brewery.  The ambiance was welcoming and would be great place to go after work with friends/coworkers.  Tip:  Get your own cookie!"}
{"text":"Update: Have been here a few times since my original posting. Love the atmosphere though seating is at a premium. Food always looks great though still have yet to try. Got the murder Porter this time, which I enjoyed. Need to try all their beer again though and obviously their food but have enjoyed the brews more and more each time I visit. Solid 4/4+ stars!"}
{"text":"Noble Beast Brewing is a great after work, happy hour spot. Located on Lakeside Blvd. the small brewery was packed. The bar offers great beers and a few select wines which can all be ordered by walking up to the bar...no servers here. They have a small but solid menu of handhelds and snacks. The fries were awesome and plentiful!  Food can be ordered and picked up at a different counter. I visited shortly after 5:00 on a Friday and it was packed!  The air smelled of beer and the crowd was loud and friendly. I'd definitely recommend Noble Beast Brewery for a great after work hang-out!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this little brewery. Their food is amazing, their beers are creative and tasty, they are nice people. I love the new edition of the players in the skylight, I can't wait to see what it looks like cascading down! The corn dog is great and you can't go wrong with the koelsch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Noble Beast recently for lunch. The place looked really cool inside. I ordered the three little pigs with fries and a Sprite. I checked out the beer list and I vowed to return to try some. I couldn't try any today because I was on my lunch break. A few minutes later, my sandwich was served.  The sandwich was tasty, but not amazing. The bread was tough to bite through and it was hard to chew. I think they need to revisit the bread. Otherwise, the sandwich was good. The fries were also good.  I'll try some other menu items along with the beer soon."}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday it a throw garage doors open garage type of brewery. I like that type of brewery but to be honest I did not like the beer so that pretty much kills it for me. But not a bad scene overall  and of course everyones taste is different so it is worth a shot."}
{"text":"Corn dogs. Beer.  Do you need anything else?! Go.  But really. The inside is welcoming and cozy and makes you want to stay all night. The staff is friendly and will tell you about any beer you have a question about.  The beer list may not be super long yet but they are all solid choices. And that is much better than throwing out 20 mediocre choices. I applaud them for that.   The atmosphere can make a non beer person feel totally at home. There's no stuffiness about it."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of breweries and especially the beers. There are a lot of different breweries opening in cleveland and i have been to almost all of them! This one is my favorite! It is not in the heart of downtown but it is located in Lakeside Avenue of Cleveland. I went here for the first time and loved the atmosphere. It is not overly big and fancy but comfortable and laid back. One of the main reasons to go to a brewery is to try their beers. I tried few samples of their beers and immediately loved the Evil Motivates! It was smooth and refreshing for the summer time! I sat at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly and attentive. I also ordered their pork nachos and it was very delicious. The pork was tender and melted in my mouth and the chips were hot and fresh! I will definitely be back here for often to try not only their beers but more of their food as well!"}
{"text":"I can hardly keep up with all the new breweries in NEO, but Noble Beast stood out from the crowd.  Located in an old warehouse/factory, the decor and layout is well done.  I appreciated the old crane being incorporated into new lighting for the brew house.  The overhead door on the front of the building opens up on nice Cleveland days.  Came here for a work event, and it was put on well by Noble Beast.  They have an elevated area that serves events well.  The food and snacks were all top notch and it was serviced as expected.    For the beers, we stuck to our tried and true IPA, and Noble Beast has a contender for best craft beer IPA in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Breweries are popping up like mushrooms or whack-a-moles around town. Most of the time I would rather drink a High Life in a dark hillbilly bar instead of shelling out a lot of money for beer that tastes like my weirdo friend made it in his basement. I did the flight of beer at Noble Beast and enjoyed each one. I love the location. I used to work at Cuyahoga County Child Support in the welfare building at 17th and Superior. This place would have been useful at that time in my life. I was drinking heavy to deal with the stress. I am still drinking heavy to deal with stress, just of a different source. Noble Beast is located on the outskirts of downtown. Very close by to Crazy Horse. This patch of town makes me think of the Springsteen classic \"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\" I admire them for opening here instead of the near or west side in general. If you build it, they will come. The food here is great. The Polish Boy and burger blew my mind. They made a salsa with watermelon that was also inventive and tasty. The staff enthusiasm level was also encouraging. They believed in their product. I do too and will return."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick pint and snack after visiting the rock and roll hall of fame. We ended up trying all the house beers on tap and none disappointed. The kolsch was clean and crisp and the grisette was perfectly executed. The pig popcorn was the perfect bar snack to compliment the brews, and left me and my guy fighting for the last kernel. Cheers Noble Beast! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Located right across the street from WKYC, Nobel Beast offers a welcoming atmosphere. A garage door opened right onto the sidewalk inviting you inside.   Just inside to the left of the entrance was a bike rack that three people had used including one UH Bike rider. A couple of picnic tables in the entrance make way to high top tables farther inside. The left most section of the space was roped off for the actual brewing that takes place on site. In the back there was an elevated seating area where a private party was.    The place, just open about 9 weeks now, was busy. It wasn't a loud or rowdy atmosphere though. One man did paper work on the bar and another lady read a book. When I just arrived before 5 a work meeting was wrapping up at one of the picnic tables.   There seemed to be two bartenders which were friendly and attentive enough. The owner was present too at a table near the end of the bar with what looked like his wife and kid.   For food the meatball sub was good. The flavors all went well together. I could have used a less substantial bun though and another, or just larger, meatballs. The slaw side was good and a substantial portion. The Zucchini Fritter appetizer was good (Zucchini balls completely covered in breading). The texture was soft and they were sprinkled with cheese. All in all not healthy food, but good food."}
{"text":"Great microbrewery.  Enjoyed the beers and the grilled kielbasa and kielbasa corn dog were great.  Giving them 4 stars only because I thought they were understaffed and I don't believe they allow dogs."}
{"text":"Corn dog my #%Â!!! I guess they call it that to make it familiar to people. That AIN'T no damn corn dog. It's a freakin' kielbasa with batter made with the grains from the beer process with a side of BEER honey mustard..whaaaat? Take that ketchup!  That thing was Noble...haha. Thank you fellow Yelpers for the recommendation.  Forks, well little wooden pointy stick way up.   So it's a brewery right?  So I had the flight and the Sticke Alt was my fav. The Ego Tripping and the IPA were also yummy.  I know that shouldn't be said about beer. But it's one of my favorite words in the English language. If you like tripels, \"YES, please\", this one is ok. Lacks the full flavor profile for my taste. That being said, I finished the darn thing.  Chilled atmosphere with friendly staff. You get your own water and the utensils and napkins are in a vase at the bar. Gives you a really chilled vibe."}
{"text":"Perfect size brewery with a great Belgian Saison. Also had a session IPA and that was good as well. Everything Bagel dry rubbed wings were the bomb. I have multiple smokers and cook a lot of wings for friends and family during football season. Smoked dry rubbed wings are hard to beat. These are fried with just the right seasoning and cooked to the correct temperature. Crispy and great flavor. Might not beat wings off the smoker but some of the best I've had at a bar."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT BEER. Need I say more? Okay, I will. There's a lot of \"craft\" breweries popping up all over Cleveland. I go to all of them. Be been going to breweries before it was the cool thing to do.  Noble Beast is legit.  Additionally, they have really good snacks to enjoy with your beer.  You will be thoroughly satisfied with the pig popcorn and CLE corndog. Trust me on this one.  P.S. The bartenders are cool. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable night with the supper club folks.  I may not be the best choice to evaluate a brewery as I am not really into beer.  So with that said, my beer was fine and my food was good.  Probably would not order the veggie sandwich again but it was still good. My friend said she would not order the meatball sandwich again either. Others were happier with their choices.  Cool modern urban interior decor and picnic table seating.  Self serve ordering at the bar and you must pay attention for your name to be called when your order is ready.  Super friendly staff and owners were attentive."}
