{"text":"I visited this restaurant today and as an Indian, i was appalled at the quality of the food there. The food was very basic, one can make better food at home. The butter chicken was pathetic. It's a buffet restaurant, so the food was prepared with no special efforts. The dessert was horrible. It was a unnamed dish ( shaped like barfi but tasted nothing like that) just put there to be eaten as a desert. Also, the billing system felt rigged , given that we were charged more than the printed prices on the menu. The person at the counter ( who i think was owner ) told us to add tip. When we told about the quality of food, he was kind of annoyed and turned his face away . He didn't ask anything or put any effort to know what we didn't like. Highly disappointed and would suggest not to visit the place if you live authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in Montreal! Portions are ridiculously generous, I'm surprised more people don't come here. I've had a lot of Indian foods at plenty of different restaurants and this is the one I always end up going back to.  Plus they have clean washrooms!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! I was blown away by the quality of the dishes here. We ordered a whole tandoori chicken, lamb curry with yogurt, onions and saffron, butter chicken, okra, samosas, vegetarian biryani and naan bread. Every dish surpassed my expectations and was freshly made with a great selection of ingredients and most of all authenticity."}
{"text":"Zero stars for this restaurant, absolutely garbage. If you want to wait until the end of time for your food then this restaurant is for you! The slowest service that I have ever seen. Ordered our food and the waitress came back after 15 minutes to tell me that she didn't have the drinks that we ordered. Appetizers didn't come out on the same time. Half of our table had already eaten by the time other half got their appetizers. Replaced my drink with a substitute but never received it. Been here for two hours and I'm still waiting for my main course dinner! Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you would still like to take a chance to come to this restaurant please clear your day of any other plans because I can promise you that you won't be making it to anything else that you may have planned!!  Yelp please come up with option to give zero stars because this restaurant definitely deserves it!"}
{"text":"There are too many Indian places on Rue Jean Talon. And this one is one of the relatively new ones added to the list. It is rather a very big place, with bring your own wine option. Although, the food is bland and does not do justice to the the indian cuisine. The service is non-attentive. You can easily afford to skip this place if you want to."}
{"text":"I really like this place !  Living close I've tried many around, but I now always come back to this one. This one is pretty new compared to the other one. Been there to take away many times and it's always good. I really like the Channa Samosa, everything Dhan Saak, chicken saag and Shahi paneer. But there is a lot of choices ! The service has been always good. The place is pretty big so there is space and they propose buffet even is the evening."}
{"text":"As a montrealer, it comes as no surprise that I enjoy the occasional poutine. However, I'm one to be very picky; skeptical of trends altering the classic gravy-cheese curds classic. BUT with the butter chicken poutine...... MIND BLOWN!!! Often reluctant with fusion dishes, the butter chicken poutine was a match made in heaven. It's not easy balancing flavors from far reaching corners of the earth. The perfection that is the butter chicken poutine serves as a testament to the quality of the chef's artistry. All in all, definitely coming back here for some Indian cuisine, but ADD TWO BUTTER CHICKEN POUTINES TO THE ORDER, ONE FOR NOW, ONE TO GO!"}
