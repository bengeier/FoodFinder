{"text":"We went to Johnny's for Restaurant Week lunch and were delighted with the food, the service, and the entire experience from the moment we walked through the door.  Our meals started with both of us having the Italian Sausage stuffed mushrooms which were one of the best appetizers we had ever eaten.  The complimentary warm foccacia bread with olive oil, parmesan cheese, and cracked pepper is a really nice addition to the meal.

For our main courses I chose the lobster mac and cheese.  It was topped with a nicely crusted bread topping.  The lobster flavored the mac and cheese nicely.  My companion had the parmesan crusted steak with garlic mashed potatoes.  He gave me a taste of it and it was excellent also.  It was cooked medium rare and just melted in my mouth.  I've had many bad experiences of steak over the years but I now know it is SAFE and WISE to order steak at Johnny's where rare is truly rare.

The desserts were a turtle cheesecake for him and I had gingerbread cake topped with (and filled with) eggnog buttercream and set atop a port wine cranberry jam.  We had to eat those the next day as we were both too full to have them that day.  Both were excellent!!

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I along with some of our children and grandchildren had brunch at Johnnies yesterday.  It was the first time we had ever eaten there but it definitely won't be the last time.  The brunch wasn't the usual mediocre food that you find at a brunch later in the morning.  Everything was fresh and delicious, and the staff was attentive and very friendly.   

4 weeks ago we visited Johnnies for the first time.  Today we visited Johnnies for the LAST time.  I had bragged up this restaurant last time but CANNOT do that this time.  We had brunch both visits and both times we ate at 11 so we are comparing apples to apples in that respect. That is the only thing that was the same.  I am assuming that most of the wait staff as well as the kitchen staff didn't show up for work today.  The buffet tables were mostly empty and the food that was available was NOT FRESH.  We had to bus our own table and refill our water glasses as there wasn't staff to do either.  I was so disappointed with this visit as it was the first time the rest of our party had been there.  Definitely not a good first impression for them.  Goodbye Johnnies, we will be spending our brunches somewhere else from now on"}
{"text":"Reading other reviewer's comments on this place, it seems to have a split personality.  Many commented on how the food was good, yet the service poor.  My experience was the polar opposite: the food was mediocre-to-poor while the service was decent.

I walked in alone on a quiet Wednesday evening.  Like other reviewers, I am staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, a few hundred steps from the door of this restaurant. The host seated me quickly in a nice booth and the server came over quickly to take my drink order.  She soon brought my wine and some bread, which were both adequate, not outstanding.  My onion soup was industrial, but not unpleasant.  The Caesar salad was dressed with a tasteless product that probably came from a large plastic bottle from Sysco.  At least the anchovies were fresh (for an extra $2).  The biggest disappointment was my rib-eye steak.  It was perfectly cooked to medium but I have never before had a rib eye which looked and tasted so much like a strip steak.  It had almost zero marbling, virtually no flavor (none of the sweetness or tenderness one expects from a reasonable steakhouse) and was grainy as well.  I asked the waitress if this was normally such a lean cut and she affirmed that it was.  She offered to bring me a different cut of steak, but I concluded if their rib eye was tasteless, the sirloin would be like the sole of a shoe.  

When I received my check, it was about $45, which is a lot of money for the same or poorer quality food that I could have gotten from a TGIF or Applebees.  Overall, I was really disappointed in the quality of the food.

Just to add to the reasons to not waste my time at this place again, their martini, whiskey and port list was 2 pages long without a single price listed.  No way to tell if the lower-shelf whiskeys would be the same price as an 18 yr old single malt.  I find such tactics classless.  It places the customer in the position of asking \"how much is the cognac?\" and then repeating, one by one, trying to discern if there is anything of value on the list.  Why?  This is Middleton WI, not midtown Manhattan, NY!!!"}
{"text":"I had asked a co-worker for a good steakhouse in the area and Johnny's was suggested highly.

Well, I was sorely disappointed with the food. The service was okay.
The drunkin steak was over cooked(asked for med-rare, got medium). The broccoli was slightly mushy. The best thing about the plate was the garlic sauce under the steak and it made the steak edible.

I will not suggest Johnny's to anyone."}
{"text":"Don't eat there if you are alone.  Should have been better service, the room on the right was closed.  Really crappy service and dry fish."}
{"text":"When I go to a steakhouse, I expect them to know how to cook a medium piece of meat. BEWARE: if you are ordering a 6oz filet mignon (2 people in my party ordered this size), medium will look like WELL.

However the 2 people in my party that ordered 10oz pieces of meat medium was perfect. So just be aware on the smaller cuts.

Let me start by saying that it was a Saturday night at 8pm when my party of 4 arrived. It was dead and we had reservations. We were seated in a crescent shaped booth in the bar area. 

Restaurant was very nice looking outside, and inside had an old steakhouse, nice feel. Service was average, and we were there for several hours.

Had lots of drinks and all got steak dinners.

The calamari appetizer was very salty, would not recommend. The sausage bread was decent. 

Salad was family style unless you order individually. Came with a house balsamic and a ranch. Focaccia bread was very good.

Asparagus was excellent, as was garlic mashed potatoes. Crab stuffed shrimp was weird texture, would not recommend. High hopes for the parmesan crusted filet. It had nice tenderness but as I said, overcooked.

It was OK but for a $350 meal, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Johnny's Italian Steakhouse. In a word, DELICIOUS! Started w/ bruschetta w/ a nice chianti, had a spinach salad and a New York strip. The bruschetta was very tasty, and the salad was superb! Most spinach salads tend towards the sweet side, but this one was savory, w/ sundried tomatoes, boiled egg, bacon, and lightly dressed in a creamy dressing. The only sweetness were a few sugared walnuts, but they were a nice contrast. And the steak! OMG! It was a Parmesan-crusted New York strip (Angus beef), & melt in your mouth tender! I asked for med-rare - I find the better the cut, the rarer I like it, so even tho they brought it rare, it was so good I didn't mind. I'm ready for a nap! Curiously, I was not offered a dessert menu."}
{"text":"I will not be going back to Johnny's. My friend almost choked on a piece of metal in his water. I understand mistakes happen, but both the waiter and the manager were unapologetic, and even sarcastically asked if my friend was choking. On top of all that, he never even got another water! Horrible service. 

Aside from that the food left something to be desired. The salad greens were limp and old.  The \"garlic\" mashed potatoes couldn't have tasted more out-of-the-box. The garlic tasted just like garlic powder and was wayy too overpowering. 

Service and food both overall un-enjoyable."}
{"text":"The best food and best service ever!  Jeffrey is an amazing server! He made our day. The meatloaf was incredible."}
{"text":"Pros for our visit: Prompt service on a Saturday night, décor, noise level allowed for conversation, check was correct.
Cons for our visit: Food quality uneven, No extra effort by staff, facilities.
The recent visit to this establishment (which my wife was looking forward to trying) resulted in a dinner that will be forgotten by next weekend.  
The staff was mostly courteous to us and our party of three were seated almost immediately on a Saturday night.  The wait staff was attentive, but did nothing to extend themselves beyond what they expected to do.  Ex. This place does not have a beer list and I was not in the mood for wine.  When questioned, the server was able to recite the available tap beers and indicated they had additional bottled beers. \"What was I interested in?\"  After 3 local beer choices they did not have on hand based on his memory of their selection, I got a Pepsi product.  The house salad was ok, but only one person at the table specified a dressing and both of us received the same dressing on our salads.  The Spinach Salad was ok - good and the accompanying bread was flavorful but had the soft consistency of cotton balls.  Our entrées were of mixed reviews as well.  Our friend enjoyed her Pesce Basilico (freshwater tilapia fillet). My wife felt her Salmon Fiorintino tasted a bit off and was probably beyond the cooks ability to make the flavors turn out as a harmonious dish.  I chose a basic Chicken Parmigiano.  It was simply ok.  The chicken pounded into a schnitzel thickness, breaded and a bit over cooked, was very smothered in a marinara sauce with a slab of Mozzarella.  It's biggest downfall is too much of the toppings with no real Parmesan flavor.  The deserts were ok as well.  The small molten center Chocolate Cake was as described with an accompanying intense cinnamon ice cream; while the Grand Marnier Chocolate Mousse seemed to be made with Milk Chocolate instead of Dark Chocolate and came layered with whipped cream in a glass mug.  
As for the physical establishment: We enjoyed the décor and appreciated the low enough noise level that allowed us to converse easily.  However both the ladies and gentlemen's facilities were not on the same level (out of soap, overflowing waste bins, dirty floors and non flushing fixtures are not acceptable at any time for a restaurant).  
Of course all of these issues could have been resolved if we chose to make an issue out of them and forced the staff to do more than they had to or if we went out of our way to change the outcome.  I could have walked to the bar and made the bar tenders list the beers they did have until a suitable one was found.  We could have sent the incorrectly dressed salad back for another.  Repeatedly requested them to re-fill our water glasses and drinks; and there was more I could comment on, but we were out for the night with our friend and that was the important part."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant for the first time on Easter Sunday and were impressed by the look of the place, it is elegant and neat. I loved the idea of their tall booths to give some privacy to the customers. I had one of their signature steaks called Deburgo, they were two steak medallions with a white creamy sauce, the meat was kind of chewy taking in consideration their specialty is the steaks, the sauce was bland, for the side I asked for a house salad, you know the basic one, lettuce, cherry tomatoes; however, the dressing was really good, tangy and sweet  my boyfriend had a steak called Oscar, he also found his meat chewy, the only thing he liked were the garlic mashed potatoes, I tried some and he was right, it  tasted nice and homemade. To be honest, it didn't meet my expectations, I really hoped to have at least a wonderful piece of meat at a steakhouse."}
{"text":"I have visited Johnnys off and on for the last 10 years and have never been disappointed with their Calamari appetizer nor their Creme Brule."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly efficient staff.  No bread as the menu said.  Steak was so-so as was the shrimp.  Great garlic mashed but so what?  Average food, overpriced."}
{"text":"This was my second visit, the place was packed and very understaffed !! Waited about 20 minutes before my order was even taken then about another 30 for my food. Waited 10 mins for a refill. I ordered a soup with my meal , they charged me full price for my soup but never gave me the bread or salad that should of came with my meal. If I had hours to waste I would have asked for it. Not sure I would come back"}
{"text":"I was there last week, and had a less than perfect experience. Management invited me back for a second chance.  ThIngs were great. Martini's genorous and well made; fOccacia and infused oil very tasty.  Caesar salad with a perfectly tangy dressing, and I was offered anchovies (I took them), which is not so commonly done anymore.  Steak was cooked to perfection, juicy and flavorful, rice was the perfect consistency.  The carmel turtle cheesecake is worth a trip just for it.  A very nice dinner; I am in th area 2-3 times a year, and i WILL BE BACK.

Ambiance is very nice, dark wood, Sinatra, Bennett, Rat Pack in th background.  Busy bar, with multiple TVs,"}
{"text":"Was in town for training session.  Restaurant had a nice atmosphere with dim atmospheric lighting. We chose the brushcetta with shrimp for our complimentary appetizer.  Nicely toasted bread with cheese, tomato & onion, and topped with two half pieces of shrimp.  Was able to order a cranberry and soda as I wasn't drinking this nice, but could have used more ice and the soda was a little flat. My dining partner enjoyed her dirty martini.  I ordered the sirloin steak medium rare and garlic mashed potatoes. Potatoes were good as was steak.  My partner ordered the charbroiled rib eye medium.  She said it was cooked well.  The salad however looked like it had come straight out of the bag and the house dressing was rather blah.

Multiple wait staff seemed to be working with trainees tonight.  Restaurant got busy and the waitstaff left us alone for a bit to eat.  They did come back and ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks.  They did not have a problem with split checks."}
{"text":"Very much worth a return visit.  We had the veal Sinatra and the veal parmigiana, and reveled in them.  Lobster bisque and  asian salad were huge, and we wound up with three doggie boxes.  No dog, cat, nor even a gourmand iguana was likely to wrest any of them from us.  Justin, our server, was personable and fun amidst a bar full of loud, local high school reunionists. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere/vibe/feel of the place. Very comfortable, not too loud, and nice low level light. I enjoyed the fresh bread. It was warm & soft but there was no butter on the table, just olive oil which is fine by me but my wife kind of wanted butter. House salad was just OK. Had a $2 up-charge for a Caesar salad that might have been worth it because the house didn't do much for me. They have a decent wine selection. Ordered a glass of Red Rock (I think that's what it was) Merlot that I really enjoyed. It looked like the menu had MANY Martinis to pick from.  We all had pasta that we enjoyed so I really can't review any of the steaks... sorry.  I'd definitely try the place again."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever. My ribeye steak was bland, caesar salad was fine, and the bread was good... not good enough to eat there though. Avoid this place like the plague unless your idea of a good time is feeling like you're being held hostage in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  We were a party of 9, family in town for the holiday. We were seated on time in the back at a long table in room we had all to ourselves. Our waitress was very nice, there were a couple of things she couldn't answer, but went and found out for us. The problem was not with the front of house staff, it was the kitchen.  I cannot say if it was cheap ingredients, or lack of experience with the chef or both, but either way none of us will return.  There were a few highlights, but most of our meals ranged from underwhelming to in-edible. 

Ratings for The Apps:  Buffalo Mozzerella Caprese(4/5):  Those who shared it enjoyed it.  Crab Cake(5/5):  It was excellent, Stuffed Mushrooms(5/5): The in-house sausage had a wonderful flavor, and these were great.  Calamari(1/5):  These were tiny, it was mostly breading and the breading wasn't seasoned. One person barely ate any, the other shared them round the table to try to get rid of them.

Main Course:  3 ordered the daily special, Tilapia over zucchini noodles (1/5):  One person found it in-edible and sent it back, not opting to order something else, the others found it bland, underseasoned, boring, not worth the price, no one finished it.  Bone in Ribeye(1/5):  \"The toughest ribeye I have ever had\"  he couldn't even cut it with his knife, and the gorgonzola that he paid extra for, was one little piece not even the size of a dime.  It was his first meal of the day after a 13 hr work shift, he was starving, but didn't even eat half.  Veal (2/5:  Bland, underwhelming, he didn't finish it.  Stuffed Shrimp(2.5/5):  5 small shrimp, they tasted good, but not much food.  Paperdelle with scallops (1/5):  There was about 3 cups of arugla on top to make it look like a large meal, most of it I pushed aside it was overkill.  The scallops were cooked correctly, but the were gritty and sandy, and they failed to remove the tough abductor muscle.  Sorry but scallops should be CLEAN when you serve them, and I can accept the abductor muscle at a place that charges less, but a steakhouse that is charging what they charge should have kitchen staff that can properly clean a scallop. The lemon butter sauce they served with it, didn't taste much like real butter. And it was small, hardly any pasta in the bowl, and pasta is cheap!

Dessert:  (yes even after this some ordered dessert, they were still hungry).  Limoncello (1/5) was found inedible by the person who ordered it.  Turtle Cheesecake (4/5)  \"The best thing I had here, they probably buy it in\"  Lava Cake (5/5):  Heavenly, delicious, chocolate wonderful.  Cinnamon Ice cream (4/5)  Good. 

While there were a few highlights, most of the food was mediocre or worse, not worth the price when there are so many places to choose from in the Madison Area that charge the same or less for a great dinner.   The waitress was great and split our checks, but our meal for two came to $110 with tip (1 soda, 1 milk, no bar drinks).  I could have paid half that much for a great meal down the street.  That is a crazy price to pay for dirty scallops, and a ribeye you can't even cut.  We all agreed that it was not a place we want to experience again."}
{"text":"I love the steak here so much. I always get the filet with a side of their drunken sauce (which is amazing, though not so amazing for your waistline, if you care, which I don't). 

Hands down, my favorite Caesar salad I've come across. The dressing is fantastic. And the bread basket -- delicious. 

I've been here probably 15-20 times and have only had one bad experience with the steak, which was a bit undercooked. Otherwise, I find it perfect. I've also been here for brunch, and was't disappointed. Great spread -- and a giant cinnamon roll brought to the table to share. 

Service is good, atmosphere is usually nice and quiet. All around, good stuff."}
{"text":"Food 4 star, ambiance 3 star, service 1 star. The good-our steaks were very tender and cooked exactly as we ordered. Restaurant ambiance is typical for steakhouse. The bad- our server Jennifer looked and spoke like she is annoyed and she'd rather be somewhere else. I expect better service if my bill before tax was $225 for 4 diners before tax and tip. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. I had shrimp minelli and that was the best fetuccini pasta i had in my life. I have to say great service an very pleasant atmosphere. 5 stars and will definitely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Having brunch here was suggested by my brother and sister-in-law. I am NOT a fan of buffet, however I really tried to be fair and open-minded.  NOPE. I understand you sometimes have to sit a ways from the buffet, but it wasn't too busy so traveling to and from the buffet was ok. I was shocked when I ordered a Bloody Mary for a cocktail-a glass with ice and vodka, then you go to the buffet and finish making it to your liking. Using a premixed bloody mary and then you chose the additions to add to your drink. The selection of food was decent and presented nicely, and were tasty (and warm). Prime rib dipped in au jus was very good. There was a pasta with shrimp (just a few) that was ok. The deserts were ok to pretty good. The service was attentive and I could feel that they wanted us to enjoy our food and have a good experience. I wish I enjoyed buffets more."}
{"text":"I've been here for my birthday ones, the food was great and the service was nice. I plan to be here for my graduation dinner also! Pretty excited!"}
{"text":"Closest restaurant to my Hotel.

Food:
Bruschetta was a disappointment. Piled with diced tomatoes & mushy. I only ate 1 of 4 slices.
Side house salad was average. I couldn't finish it.
Seafood pasta was good. It would have been great if the pasta was served still hot.

I was sitting at the bar area so service was again just ok. The bartender did the best she could to serve me.

Based on other reviews, I might try the filet steak next time I am in the area.

Finally, I had a local beer recommended by another customer, which I liked."}
{"text":"Sigh.  It pains me to write this.  I have eaten at Johnny's before, and the food was great, and the service good.  However, tonight I ate there alone, and sat at the bar.  Considering that I was within eye and earshot of the two bartenders the entire time, the service was really poor.  There were two bartenders.  One was older, the other younger.  The older one seemed to only be servicing the wait station, where the servers picked up their drinks.  The younger one seemed to be covering the entire length of the bar himself.  When I sat down, sort of close to the wait station, the older one said 'hi' to me, but never asked me if he could get me a drink, offered me a menu, or anything else.  It was close to 10 minutes before the younger guy acknowledged me and brought me a menu.  Then, I had to wait a long time before he came to get my order.  And, again I had to wait a long time for him to take my dinner order.  I saw this same scenario repeated with two different couples that were seated around me during my time there.  Each time, the older guy either acknowledged them but didn't offer them a drink, or ignored them altogether, and then they waited quite a while before the younger guy got to them.  In one case, the younger guy got the order of the man in the pair, but never asked the woman what she wanted and it wasn't until their pager went off to notify them that the table was ready and he brought them their bill that she said 'I never got a drink!'  His response was a sort of gruff 'Well, what did you want???'.  Both bartenders need some significant training.  They need to know the menu better, then need to understand how to prioritize and work the bar better, they need to know how to SMILE and acknowledge their customers better.  Johnny's food was excellent, but the service?  Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here during Restaurant Week this year and I have to say it was only an \"ok\" experience. The atmosphere was nice and the service was good, but the the food was only ok despite the numerous rave reviews I have gotten. 

We ordered martinis and the Betta Bruschetta, which were delicious. However my Basilico Angel Hair was so garlicy I could barely eat it and the noodles were overdone. I ended up eating most of the bread that was on the table instead. We ordered the Grasshopper Bon Bon's for dessert and they were very good. 

Overall, I was disappointed especially for the price. There are much better steakhouse's like Ruth's Chris for the money."}
{"text":"Best martini in Madison--cold, dry,with crisp, fresh olives. Chicken Parmigiana is outstanding. Lighting is a bit muted for easy reading of their menus, but wait staff is always professional with the proper level of attention. The shrimp Frangelico salad is  a winner. Interesting choice of sauces on their signature steak dishes."}
{"text":"I booked a room at the Hilton Garden Inn for this week, and while looking around online for places to eat...I found Johnny's.  After reviewing the menu...I couldn't wait to try this place.  I was in no way disappointed!  The food was the best ever, and I have travel to or thru almost every state in the Union, and served overseas.  If food gets any better than this...believe me...it would have to be in my dreams!

Now....let's talk about service...ABOVE an BEYOND!  Kristen  (sp)...provided me with impeccable service and attentive conversation!  She knew how the food was cooked, and had a highly positive view of the food!  She  provided everything with perfect timing!  When I couldn't stuff everything down...Kristen bought me a carton and proceeded to place my crab stuffed Tiger shrimp in it!!!  I'm just glad this place isn't where I live...because if it was...I would be huge by now...from coming here everyday! 

I didn't get the hostess's name, but she was as sweet as she could be, and very customer service oriented.  I didn't have a reservation, but she did provide with the option of the bar, or in the back. I chose in the back.  She was friendly, and I have absolutely no complaints at all.  Even the wait staff greeted me as I walked by or smiled when I saw them walking by.  Great Job Kristen and everyone at Johnny\"s!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ribeye. It was bland (tasted like it hadn't even been salted) and it didn't have anything resembling a crust. So, it didn't look much like the pictures. Not sure if I just went on an off night for one of the cooks or not. It was at least cooked to med rare, as I ordered, but I only had about 3 bites of the steak - and I love steak. The calamari appetizer was good and my wife got a pasta dish that was really good. I can't remember the name, but it was solid."}
{"text":"We went without reservations after arriving late from out of town.  No more than half the tables in the restaurant were filled.  The hostess was snobby and asked if we had reservations and when we said we didn't, she said it would be a 25-30 minute wait. To say we were offended and insulted would be understated. We will not be back, ever. They need to work very hard on improving their attitudes and their attention to serving customers."}
{"text":"I gave this place another try (after a disheartening first visit, they reached out and asked me to give them another try) and wasn't disappointed.  The food was excellent.   I ordered a steak \"chanel\" style medium rare, with a side of spinach salad.

It was excellent all around.   The steak was cooked medium rare through and through and the \"chanel\" style toppings were excellent.

I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"- Wine selection: 3 stars
- Wine sampling: 5 stars (more than just the regular 1sip-to-tease-you, you actually get a two mouthful sips tastes if you want to sample any wine by the glass)
- Wine temperature: 2 stars (pinot noir was on the warm side)
- on the table unfiltered olive oil in-house blended with herbs and garlic + plus top of the shelf Parmesan cheese (in Wisconsin, I knoooooow!!!!!!): 5 stars (tip: ask for more bread, it's sinful!)
- stuffed pork chops - 4 stars
- salad -2 stars (ask for 'dressing on the side) and still, it may give you heartburn
- music level: bare minimum, great to cary on private conversation (or listen to the next table neighbor cell-phone conversation)."}
{"text":"I walked in at 6:30 on a Saturday night and was seated promptly in the restaurant. I can't say enough about the service. Prompt, attentive and friendly. I had the Filet Oscar which was phenomenal. Creme brûlée was also very good."}
{"text":"Service was great...bread was ok and the salad was good but I didn't like the fact I couldn't have my own salad and had to share with my table.  I ordered the Tiger prawn shrimp stuffed with crab cakes and I got 6 small shrimps with a spoonful of crab cake sitting on top.  The manager comes by and says how is everything...I said I don't like this and he says yea the crab cakes has a funny texture and walks away.  WTF??? How rude!! That was a waste of $25 and they don't have to worry about me ever coming back there when there are so many other restaurants in the area that are so much better than that place.  Way over priced!!!  Hope they get a new manager soon!!!  The current one is worthless"}
{"text":"Going to Johnny's OK, it's like going to Olive Garden, Outback Steakhouse or any other dependable chain restaurant.  The food and service will be formulary.  It's a good place for a night when you are not into taking any risks, and just want a warm meal."}
{"text":"Johnny's has become our go-to place for Sunday brunch. They have a great selection of food from eggs Benedict to prime rib and fabulous desserts. I am probably going to regret giving them a good review because it will become crowded on Sundays! We've also been there for weekday lunches and the Monte Cristo sandwich is the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice; once on each of my last two trips to Madison. I'll eat here again before I leave.

I am somewhat a creature of habit. When I try an \"Italian\" restaurant I want to know if it is \"Italian\" or \"italian\". This is easy to do. Order the marinara. It is a simple dish that most places don't bother to do right. But a real Italian restaurant will take the time to do this right. That means sauteing tomatoes and spices together, but knowing when to stop. And none of that \"al dente\" nonsense with the noodles...that's for fat Gourmands in bowties without friends, not for people who just like good food.

I am pleased to say Johnny's gets it right. The gravy was magnificent--neither acidic nor sweet with lots of tomato and oregano flavor. MMMMM MMM!

I had a \"side Caesar salad\" which was made with crisp, fresh, clean lettuce, parmigiano cheese, and a tangy, but not quite excellent dressing. It seems to lack the fishy flavor from the anchovy paste. Some folks leave that it, but if you do, that is NOT Caesar dressing. The anchovy is the core of a good Caesar.

I took my order to go, and that is where the fifth star went. $10 for a plate of spaghetti and nothing else. The menu says it is served with garlic bread but I received this neither when dining in nor when to go. Also, don't be so stingy with the napkins and not so cheap on the plasticware...the knife needs to be strong enough to support a noodle.

The staff are friendly at the bar, professional elsewhere if not overtly engaging.

Overall, a very pleasant experience and, as I said, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here considering I've grown up in Middleton. 
I went here for a work function over a lunch hour. In total there was a little over 20 of us. 
The food was great - Everyone's orders were correct and we all got our food within a couple minutes of each other so no one was left waiting. The restaurant was clean, quiet, and we enjoyed the music. 


There were only 2 minor things I noticed. One woman got a Caesar salad for lunch and it was drowning in dressing. I'd recommend going lighter on the dressing and giving some on the side so it can be added according to personal preference. 
The other was the table they gave us had half of our group up against a wall which made it challenging for our waitress. Needless to say there was passing of plates and glasses. It would have been nicer to sit in a more open area since the restaurant wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat and close to Residence Inn and Hilton Garden Inn. Warm foccacia bread is the best."}
{"text":"I was staying in the Middelton area for work & really wanting a steak and a cocktail after a long day but didn't feel like going downtown...Johnny's really hit the spot. For a little over $40 (before tip), I got a great sirloin (on special that evening and comes with focaccia and a salad), a raspberry mule (raspberry vodka, limoncello & a raspberry puree...delicious!), and dessert. Another person in our party ordered the scallops & said they were great...she was from Seattle so she's used to good seafood. 

Even though the place got a little busy, service was never an issue. The manager made sure we got drinks & knew the specials then without skipping a beat, the server ensured we had everything we needed for the remainder of the meal. Service felt genuine & like it is a priority here."}
{"text":"Update: Our once favorite place for our 1-2 times a month steak and pasta has become our last choice. 
We were just there a couple of weeks ago and somehow in that time, they changed everything! 

My husband LOVES their veggie tortellini and adds chicken to it. That is now off the menu, and the way they prepare the chicken is even different now. He was so disappointed. Nothing they left on the menu for choices was even comparable.

We also LOVE their loaded baked potato soup. Before we always subbed out the soup for the salad, and never had an issue. This time, without warning, were charged 5.00 extra PER CUP. Even though we chose to not have a salad. Our waitress never said anything either, even though we just discussed how sad my husband was about the pasta being gone. 

My food was amazing like always and the soup was still to die for. I just can't wrap my head around changing things so drastically at a restaurant where things are working well. I don't know if I'll be able to convince my husband to go back."}
{"text":"Went her for the wife's bday with friends, got table reservation for 12 people. Got to our table and ordered drinks while waiting for everyone else. Prompt service with the drinks. When everyone arrived we ordered our food and appetizers. The appetizers came out in a nice timely manner and after a good 15-20 minutes all of our food came out. Ordered the Johnny's Veal Sinatra with mashed potato and it was great! The creamy sauce was not heavy, very flavorful and went great with the mashed potato. Did not see any crab but no complaint. Overall it was great besides the fact that it was dark in there."}
{"text":"I had a choice between Ruth Chris and here. Made the wrong choice. Came to celebrate my daughters graduation , felt like I was at Applebee's. Big loud groups, kids running around , what a joke. Food was mediocre. My rib eye was so gristly I couldn't cut it. Had into send it back and get something else. Look at your options before go by here."}
{"text":"Service was terrible...waited 15 minutes for server, another 30 minutes for appetizers. Seemed like they didn't put on enough waitstaff. When we expressed our frustration to the management (Amanda), she shrugged it off as a busy night and treated us very dismissively."}
{"text":"Was  in Middleton on February 14th for a medical appointment for my sister. We stayed at the Residence Inn across the parking lot from Johnny's . Neither of us felt like going out after the day we had, especially on Valentines Day. Ordered take out from Johnny's and was delightfully surprised we were able to bill order to the room. Hostess who took order was friendly, but seemed new or not as versed with menu as she should be for taking phone orders. I verified my order a couple of times with her. Nonetheless, the food order arrived incredibly fast, hot and correct. The employee delivering order was pleasant and professional. Food was so good! I had the Smothered Steak, which arrived prepared as ordered and hot. One of the best steaks I've had in awhile, especially as a take out order. My sister had the Chicken Madeira, which was also good. Save for the fact the two baby asparagus stalks with the order, barely qualified asparagus to be included the menu description of this item. We both had Caesar salads & baked potatoes as our side items. Turtle cheese cake topped off the meal nicely. Was overall pretty pleased with service & taste of food. Would definitely patronize again."}
{"text":"My SO and I ventured to Middleton to indulge in a restaurant week meal. At $15 for 3 courses during lunch, you really can't beat the price. 

When we sat down, I asked our server how he was doing. He responded \"well I'm at work,\" with a large sigh. A little flippant and off putting, but otherwise he was super prompt throughout the meal. 

We both ordered the Caesar salad, Parmesan encrusted steak, and turtle cheesecake as dessert. LOTS of food for not a lot of money. It's not the best steak house in Madison, but it was worth it for us. The steak was cooked as we requested (medium), but we both thought the Parmesan crust was a little too thick and salty. I was really banking on the creme brûlée but they were out. Womp womp. Wasn't too shattered, because the turtle cheesecake was bomb with the candied walnuts on top. 

If you're going to spend a dime on a nice steak dinner, I can't say this would be at that top of my list. Pretty mediocre, just nothing to rave about. Maybe I'm subconsciously still a little hung up on the creme brûlée..."}
{"text":"Went here for our first anniversary and I don't regret it for a second.  Made a reservation for 6:45, but went early to sit and get a drink at the bar.  I loved their expansive bar list, especially the martinis!  Hint- get the pomegranate martini if you want your taste-buds to explode!  One downside to the martinis (other than them sneaking up on you) is that they were pricier than Johnny Black Label on the rocks. 
When we were ready to be seated, the hostess sat us immediately, even though it was before our reservation.  The waitress we had was attentive, but not overly so and super friendly.   We were wanting to order slowly and enjoy our meal and she understood that.  
As an appetizer, we ordered the fried ravioli (good and large portions!) and we were also given bread that had olive oil and Parmesan to dip into.  The bread was fresh, warm and divine.  I wanted an entire loaf for myself.  
For my entree, I ordered filet oscar (has a crab cake on top of the steak).  I got it medium rare, which it definitely was, thank you very much chef.  The crab-cake was okay, got a little mushy with the cream sauce.  The asparagus was okay, not a lot of flavor.  However, the steak itself and potatoes made up for it all!  Husband got the Parmesan crusted steak, but wasn't a big fan of the Parmesan crusting.  
Was very tempted for dessert (creme brulee! mounds bar! roasted banana cheesecake!) but just didn't have the room.  Plans are already being made to go back for more martini's and dessert!"}
{"text":"While staying at the nearby hotel for work trips, I often walked to Johnny's for dinner. The interior is nice-- dark and relaxing. The bartender is great! Super friendly and easygoing. they also have decent local brews on tap-- love the Hopilicious from Asylum Ale! 

Now for the food: the steaks are great. I ordered the filet most nights with steamed broccoli and salad. I can't complain. They can cook steaks the way you want, which in my case is rare. I hate it when steak houses can't cook a decent rare steak! Also, Johnny's offers several steak toppers, like a horseradish crust. I tried many out and they were all good.

The best dish they offer is the goat cheese salad. Yum! It took me a few tries before discovering it and it's truly delicious and makes for a perfect accompaniment to a steak dinner. 

This place's weak spot is absolutely desserts. Man, they are just not good. Huge portions, first off, and they LOOK great. However, every dessert I tried was just not very good-- dry/stale and bland overall. They are simply not worth the calories and I tried all of them over time.

Anyway, for a steakhouse right in front of a hotel, it's a decent spot with a lot of pretty good fare. I would definitely go here again if I return for work."}
{"text":"I am currently in Madison, WI for work and this was the closest steakhouse within walking distance of our hotel. We read the reviews on this place and were kind of iffy on trying it due to the mixed reviews. 

My sister and I, however, wanted to try something we didn't have in Virginia because we could have naturally gone to the PF Changs which was about a 2-3 block walk or we could have gone to Cheeseburger in Paradise on the opposite side but we said, \"No, no. We want to try something we haven't tried before.\"

We were very disappointed despite the smiles on our faces when our extremely efficient and nice waitress came by to ask how things were going. I love getting bread at a restaurant and the bread that we were given tasted like it was frozen then baked. A very...how you say, stretchy? Consistency? The olive oil concoction made one piece bearable.

We ordered calamari for our appetizer...sigh. Big mistake. There were only a few good pieces and the others felt like rubber bands in our mouths. The marinara and cream sauce was good but I think I'm going to leave calamari to the coastal cities. 

We were able to get a house salad with our choice of dressing. I'm a stickler for good restaurant ranch so I was anticipating the salad very much so. We got the salad and poured the ranch on top and took a huge bite...and...tasted...nothing...??? There was almost NO FLAVOR in the ranch! HAHAHA. It was the weirdest thing! It was like, I don't even know how to describe it. If you concentrated hard enough you could probably get the slightest taste of some herbs but other than that, nothing. 

Then we ordered our petit Filet Mignon with sides. This and the service was probably the only thing that prevented me from giving this place one star. The filet mignon was cooked to my preference and the sides were good. (How could you mess up steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes?) I will admit however, I've tasted much better filet mignon but it was still very good. 

The decor itself was fantastic and the service impeccable. The waitress always checked up on us and always made sure to ask how things were going (even though we lied somewhat).

A+ for service and decor.
D - - for food. :( Sad day."}
{"text":"This is definitely my top favorite steakhouse! The steaks are always cooked perfectly. I ordered the Midwest best filet mignon with no topper and as stated in the menu it was a delicious melt in your mouth steak. The service was great and the ambiance perfect! I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Spinach Salad was the best part.

If you go with a party less than 6, be prepared to have snail type service. Thinking about a refill on your drink, be prepared to be dehydrated. Want more bread, not happening. Don't think I'll be comming back to his place."}
{"text":"Terrific service, good quality food and very clean.  Best steak around for under $30.00.
 Ignore the first reviewer, Patric T,  if you look over his 130 reviews I don't think he gives more than 3 stars to any meal that costs over $7.00.  DEFINITELY GO HERE,  SERVICE AND FOOD ARE TERRIFIC."}
{"text":"Im excited to have found a place that will actually cook a rare steak ! Ive had their steak cooked plain and with horseradish and I prefer it plain. The horseradish they cook with it is bland. I highly recommend the mixed grilled vegetables as a side item. I would give them a five star but the quality of the meat could be better."}
{"text":"Nothing special that's for sure. Been here once and will never return. Very expensive obviously, but you don't get much for your dollar. Small Steak with one cheap side only for $25+. The restaurant is so dark you can't even read the menu. The waitress was extremely annoying asking so many questions over and over again interrupting conversations. Definitely overrated and no better than steak at Applebees. Outback is significantly better."}
{"text":"So where do I start?  I guess....ok, we went to Johnny's Italian Steakhouse  with a couple of friends for dinner on New Years Eve.  Now at the time I had no idea this place was a chain but the menu looked good so we went and it was a quaint little place.

Immediately I noticed our waitress had no idea what she was doing and was not very skilled at her job.  Also the place was very dark and one thing that bothered me was the lack of pepper on the table. (after asking a couple times they brought us out an old pepper shaker from the back that hardly worked as opposed to the ground pepper shakers that the other tables had)

We ordered our appetizers and they were actually quite good.  The calamari and the roma tomato salad had great flavor and hit the spot. To add to the good night, the salads were good too! 

But along came the entrees...ugh.  My steak was just \"ok\" at best with garlic mashed potatoes that were pre-made, hard, and old.  I also had shrimp stuffed with crab that came with my steak and...gross!  I was so not happy with my meal at all.  I wanted great and got...blah.

Now, the point that made this review a two star and not a three star is our waitress.  My wife is allergic to crab and ordered the Chanel No. 5 pasta.  One of our friends ordered a seafood pasta (that had crab) and the waitress could not tell the two apart when delivering them to us.  I am sorry but a screw up like that with a food allergy on a 7 month pregnant women would be quite big.  Luckily enough we searched through the meals and figured it out.

Overall, I did not like my food and will not be going back."}
{"text":"I would give this place much less stars if not for the food.

We came here for my dad's birthday and after reading some of the reviews for this place I wasn't really expecting much. To my surprise, the food was pretty good. But the service was terrible. I'll start with the good.

We started with Zucchini fries which were delicious. They were perfectly fried and seasoned and the sauce really complimented them well. Between all of us we ordered a filet with vegetables, the crusted goat cheese salad, the lasagna, chicken parmesan and tortellini portabella with grilled salmon. Everyone really enjoyed their dinner, no complaints on any of the food! Then for dessert we shared a crème brulee and a chocolate chip cookie dough arancini with cinnamon ice cream. Again, everything was really yummy. My brother complained that the dough on the arancini was a bit too chewy but that was the only downfall.

Now for the kicker. Our service was terrible. Not terrible in the \"our server was rude and didn't care about us\" sort of way but terrible in the it took us two and a half hours to get through dinner sort of way. We waited at least 20 minutes between each course. It was absolutely ridiculous. The place was pretty empty too. I can't imagine coming here on a busy night!

So, like I said. The food was actually really tasty. But when I go out to dinner I don't expect to sit there wondering if our server forgot about us after each course. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was a reliable go-to for several years, but has declined significantly under current kitchen mgmt.   

My last time in (and I mean it literally) I ordered the boneless ribeye, which I had had a couple of times before.   This time what came was a fairly flavorless piece of sirloin, very obviously not ribeye.   I pointed this out to the young waiter, who said \"I'll ask the kitchen,\" and wandered off, leaving the steak on the table.   A few minutes later he returned and told me \"no, it's what they sent.\"   

So either is was a correctable mistake that they didn't correct, or they're now saving money by deliberately substituting a cheap cut for a more expensive one thinking no one would notice.

I'm not sure which is worse, but either is a fatal flaw."}
{"text":"I have been to Johnny's several times over the last three years... every time I come out for meetings at Epic Headquarters... and have never been disappointed.

The atmosphere is retro in a good way.  Like a darkly lit,  dark wood,  martini and steak house from the 70's with background music by Sinatra and Crosby.  It's cozy.

Last night I had the broiled crab-stuffed snapper.  Served with steamed broccoli as a side (they don't drown it in butter or salt so it is actually good for you!) and a house salad.  The snapper was excellent. Seared with a wonderful crust and topped with real lump crab meat... and several large shrimp.  

Another good choice is the Seafood and Pasta Pomodoro. That one has shrimp, mussels, scallop (one large scallop) and fish with Pomodoro sauce over linguini. A seriously delicious Frutti di Mare type dish.  Maybe underpriced at $17, don't skip it just because it is one of the less expensive menu offerings.  And the Pomodoro sauce goes great with the foccacia bread."}
{"text":"I'd go with 3.5 stars. Went here a few times. First time was so so, second time made up for it. Bartender remembered me, and my order, was attentive and very friendly. Decor was alright, food was good. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I've visited Johnny's on multiple occasions while in town for business. The food is okay. Certainly not bad, but not really remarkable either. Given that, I do find it to be overpriced. The Parmesan crusted steak is unique and good, but again, not something that will stand out as a must have again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here about once a month for the last 5 months. When I first came here, I thought the place was amazing. But I also feel like I watched it go down hill since. The food quality has suffered a little, but it is still good food. However, the service continues to deteriorate on each visit. 

The bad service starts with the greeting at the front door. I've always made reservations because they acted really bothered if you don't. However, apparently they are no long using OpenTable, so a quick reservation is no longer an option.

I dislike sitting in bar areas of a restaurant, they are just loud, and I prefer to eat in a quieter environment. They always want you to sit in the bar area. When you asked to sit in the dining area, the host gives you a giant sigh and acts like you've asked for a private dining room.

Too bad... this could be the best place in Middleton... but the attitude of the staff just ruins it!"}
{"text":"We were there for a graduation celebration. I was pleased with the service, the dishes and the appetizers. The food was certainly above the average and the service was good. I had Seafood Pasta Pomodoro and the flavor is pretty good. I wouldn't say that it's \"a generous portion of Mediterranean seafood including shrimp, mussels and scallops\" as I only had one scallop in that plate. :-)

Overall, it's a good place if you are seeking somewhere to celebrate your anniversary, parent's birthday, or just want to have a good Italian food."}
{"text":"Normally, I love this place. Tonight was a nightmare!  I ordered a porterhouse rare, it came out medium well. Consequently, I was interrogated, by a less then forth right character, questioning my ability to gage the temperature in my steak? Manager...bleep...I don't care...bleep... I am here...bleep...I am here? Then, I finally received my porterhouse rare...SALT BOMB. To top it off, all of a sudden, I have the bartender making all nice with me? You know in that condescending way. This bartender is like the cover of a book, all out there, and pretentious, or obvious to the more astute. I wrote some respectful words in Italian on my bill, hopefully they will look them up? 
I am disappointed...:(."}
{"text":"Good portions, food tasted OK. I was satisfied but wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations!  From the greeting from the receptionist to the server!

Great food, prepared to order."}
{"text":"I was in Wisconsin for training and wanted a good steak! So my coworkers and I decided to try this place. We went on a Thursday night around 8 and the place was almost empty. We got a nice booth at the bar.  The ambiance and feel of the place was nice. I hate to be stereotypical, but it reminded me of a classic Italian restaurant. And when I saw the picture of Frank Sinatra on the wall, I knew it was official. :o)

To start we tried this fried potato and cheese goodness.  There were four of us so we split it four ways and it was MORE than enough. How can one go wrong with potatoes and cheese??? I tried the smothered steak. It was AMAZING!! The steak was nice and tender and seasoned well. My potatoes were delicious and mushrooms were amazing. Everything was just darn good! Our waitress was attentive and very friendly. We had no problems with the service at all.  She even split our checks and she split the appetizer four ways! We didn't even have to ask! 

If I have to go back to Wisconsin I'll be back at Johnny's. There is another steak I want to try!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Johnny's Steakhouse and I went with a date. He suggested we go to Johnny's. My first impression was that it had a very pleasant atmosphere. The bread side was great and also came in a small portion, which is a good thing! I got the Thursday special which was a Parmesan crusted sirloin served with garlic mashed potatoes. It was DELICIOUS! For a price of 10.50 I thought it was extremely inexpensive. I was also trying to keep my dish on the lower end of the price spectrum since my date was paying! I ordered it medium rare and it was at the perfect temperature. The mash was great too. Ask for our server, Julio. He was very proper, attentive, and overall a great server. I am excited to return to this place."}
{"text":"This my first time here and was pleasantly surprised. The ambience is good and reminds me of many steakhouses I've been too. I had a filet that was cooked perfectly. The service was prompt and friendly, but not overbearing.  Johnny's is would be a great place to take a date for a special occasion. 

I didn't give it 5 stars for the following reasons. 

1. The wine selection (by the glass) was lacking. They had several choices for each varietal, but all are low end wines.   Yes I'm a wine snob. 
2. The bread looks pretty, but lacks any real flavor. 

The rest of the meal was perfect. Try the baked potato soup. It was the amazing. 

I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We tried out the Restaurant Week dinner menu. 

I made reservations and we were promptly seated at that time. While we waited, we sat at the table behind the actual bar and it was nice that the bartenders checked in on us by walking around and taking our drink orders. Drink prices we had ranged from $6.50-10. You'll have to pay for drinks ordered there before being seated at your table. 

I had the stuffed mushrooms, coffee rubbed New York strip, and gingerbread cake. My husband got the stuffed mushrooms, seafood pasta pomodoro, and turtle cheesecake. A+ for the stuffed mushrooms, medium-done New York strip and garlic mashed potatoes, and turtle cheesecake. The seafood pasta pomodoro, while having a good assortment of fresh seafood, was quite bland. We're hoping that the leftovers can be doctored up for a light meal. The gingerbread cake was cold and dry, even with the port wine cranberry jam. The portions were great for sharing. 

The dark atmosphere with blues/jazz playing in the background was comforting. The noise level from other diners was loud, but as the night wore on and people cleared out, it became quieter. Service was attentive with frequent check-ins/water fills but with a frigid attitude making us feel uncomfortable about settling in and enjoying ourselves. 

I'd give it another go and try more steak dinners."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here to celebrate the end of my college semester. We were warmly greeted and sat quickly. We ordered zucchini fries for an AppStore and they were great. Very large portion, I highly recommend them. I ordered the prime rib and she ordered ribeye on the bone. My prime rib was good, not the best I've had. The ribeye was excellent, blackened and seasoned perfectly. Overall we had great experience, great food and a friendly staff. Our waiters name was Kevin and he was great, kind and helpful."}
{"text":"DH and I had a lovely meal at Johnny's Italian Steakhouse on Friday night.  We made 7:00 reservations and were seated promptly upon our arrival. The service from the host and our server was attentive and pleasant.  

We each had a 6 oz. filet mignon -- mine was Filet Oscar, and his was the Parmesan crusted filet with butterflied shrimp stuffed with crab.  We both ordered the filets cooked medium and they both turned out perfectly.  The sides were delicious.

I ordered a drink from the bar with a minor modification and it arrived exactly as I expected it to be.  

I am giving Johnny's 4 stars because, frankly, it isn't The Post House in Manhattan or even Morton's, but it is good for what you pay.  The Filet Oscar was $32 and the Filet with stuffed shrimp was $28.  These are high prices for the Madison market but low for comparable food in larger urban markets.

Thanks, Johnny's, for a memorable meal."}
{"text":"We visited Johnny's Italian Steakhouse on our way to a trade show in Wisconsin. We met our nephew there for brunch on Sunday. He lives in Madison and recommended Johnny's for brunch 

Great choice. It was amazing. I couldn't believe the spread they offered for brunch. When the waiter came over and explained that the brunch was only $15.00 per person, my wife and I nearly fell off our chairs. A brunch comparable to this one on Long Island where we are from costs $45-$60 per person. 

The food was excellent. The service was excellent. I'd like to give a shout out to our waiter but can't remember his name. 
We sat at a round booth to the left of the bar and came in at 10:00 am this Sunday. Hope management can figure out who it was cause he was great!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, average food and high prices...!  We went late one night with a reservation and it wasn't too crowded but it took forever for our waiter to come.  Then when he did come we asked for a specific type of wine and he had no idea if they had it and had to go and check.  It took a good 10 minutes for him to come back and say yes they did have it so we went with it and placed our order about 20 minutes after sitting and waiting hungry.

I had an odd goat cheese salad with flavorless breaded fryed goat cheese, 2 pieces of apples and lettuce that appeared to be the Dole bagged salad blend.  Nice iceburg and dried up shredded carrots.

My husband had the lasagnae which wasn't fully cooked.  Aunt had a decent chicken parmesan and uncle had a seafood dish that he enjoyed.

The absolute worst part though was where we were seated...  this place is big enough and all but we were sat right next to the kitchen door so the bright lights of the kitchen blinded me every 2 minutes when the waiters/waitress came in/out (but suprisingly never our waiter - who knows where he was!).  That wouldn't have been too bad but they kept yelling and screaming back there and dropping (or thowing - it was strange).  It was very difficult and I'm not sure I wanted to know what was going on back there.  I don't like to hear screaming coming from a kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and as usual was delicious. I had the Italian beef sandwich and my friend had the reuban. I had half of his and he had half of mine. They both were very good. Service was perfect. Prices reasonable.  You get what you pay for + more!  I love this place. It reminds me of the old supper clubs. Only wish they'd build one by the new theater in sun prairie. I would definitely eat there more often. Love the booths but the tables are comfortable too. The staff aims to please."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. What can I say? It's a steakhouse. I got a New York Strip and ordered it medium-rare, and got it back very, very rare. This is a going theme with steakhouses it seems, so whatever. I could have sent it back but we didn't have a lot of time.

Music was turned up a tad loud, so it wasn't as relaxing as I would have hoped, and while our server was very nice, she seemed a bit rushed.

Everything else was nice. The Banana cheesecake I got was superb. Get it."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. It's a good dinner destination. It's a classic Italian steakhouse.

I can't come here and not get the sausage bread appetizer. Think of it like a flat sausage calzone. The cheese came out really crispy and it almost was like eating a lasagna once I added on the marinara. The bread to filling ratio is good so that it doesn't taste like you're just eating a loaf of bread with some sausage.

I always go for the filet mignon. It's tender and very flavorful. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now!

Also, some steaks come with toppings and they have them in the title. You can add them to any steak though. Needless to say, my filet ended up with parmesean topping and it was a great cheesy and crispy topping.

Try to leave a little dessert if you can. When I was there, they had a truffle cheesecake which was wondering. I always love the graham cracker crusts but then add on some caramel and whip cream and you've got yourself a rich, creamy ending to your meal."}
{"text":"I looked for a decent brunch place near the Marriott west and all I could find was a little out of our way until I stumbled on Johnny's steakhouse which has an amazing Sunday brunch buffet from 10-2. I started with eggs Benedict and banana foster French toast and then jumped into lunch food. The salmon pasta and the beef Gorgonzola pastas both were delicious. My brother and father enjoyed the prime rib. They offered endless mimosas and bloody Mary's however since I was traveling I did not get to sample. I finished with dessert and fresh fruit. Would definitely go back if I were ever in Madison again."}
{"text":"Yet another EXCELLENT dinner. The Parmesan crusted filet was like BUTTAH. I'm am addicted to the Heart of Italy combo. Very good service and The zucchini strips were divine! Chef Rod is Da BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Go to Johnny's for lunch. Stay for dinner! Every time I'm in Wisconsin, I make it a point to visit Johnny's. The staff are so nice and professional and the food is second to none! I can't wait to visit the Madison area again!"}
{"text":"Saturday night was our first time here. Pretty good, not excellent. Good service, nice wait staff. Food good, nice ambiance. Will go back again."}
{"text":"We had a family celebration in December 2017, and Johnny's was as wonderful as I had remembered! Every meal was delicious, the drinks were good and strong, and yes, dessert (creme brulee) was heavenly. This is my go-to restaurant for a comfortable and upscale dinner. Yay, Johnny's!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went here on a Tuesday for lunch while doing some shopping nearby.  Wow was this place a (Grand Slam)  had to use a baseball term now the season has begun.  Amazing from start til the end.  We came in around 1:30pm and we're sat in the bar in a nice booth.  Greeted promptly by our waiter and told specials.  He suggested a few things to us which was nice because we had never been there before.

We both orderd a different micro beer they had on tap.  They had a nice selection to chose from.  We then decided to start out with an appitizer.  We decided to try the sausage stuffed mushrooms.  We were taking to flavor town and back.  So much going on with the sausage and then topped with a fresh cheese.  Amazing!  Try them and you may not even order dinner just more of these....
  My wife orderd thier specialty Lobster Mac-N-cheese....  Fresh lobster, flavor baked into pasta, large lobster chuncks.  Nailed it on this one.  I went with the Monte Christo sandwich which is a Ham,Turkey, Swiss, and American cheese sandwich dipped into an egg wash and batter fried.  Sounds wired but it gets better yet.  They sprinkle powdered sugar over the top and serve with a raspberry dipping sauce.  Home Run!  If we would have been in the area later into the evening, we would have pulled a double header and done dinner here as well.  That's how good this place is.  We will be back.  I know you liked that double header comment baseball fans....  Try this place for yourself.  Very clean, more upscale look and feel, prices very reasonable $10- $25, friendly staff, and most of all mouth watering food.  You pay for quality, and I felt like we ripped them off."}
{"text":"The food was standard for a steakhouse; good but nothing special. The service is what ruined the experience for us. Our waitress was unattentive and condescending and attempted to make up for her lack of skill by smiling and it all seemed very fake. She judged our menu choices and seemed put off by the fact that we didn't order bar drinks. Off to the car!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Food was of good quality for the price as a steak house restaurant.  Would highly recommend it for a date or a nice meal if staying in the nearby Marriott or Hilton .  Recommend the beef medalions with king crab"}
{"text":"Made reservations for my husband's birthday dinner on 6/24/17 and it was the WORST service we have EVER experienced. We were sat and ignored for 20 minutes, every server that walked by ignored us. The manager happened to walk by, offered to get us our drinks and said our waitress would be over soon. 5 minutes to get a glass of water and another 5 minutes for my husband to get a Moscow mule, which by the way, was brought over by another server who SLAMMED it down in front of him so hard that it splashed on his clothing. She walked away without saying a word. A couple minutes later our waitress FINALLY comes by and looks confused when I ask for the check. I explain we are leaving due to how we are being treated. She offers to bring us free bread while he \"enjoys\" his drink. The bread that is supposed to be complimentary for everyone else except for us I guess. Btw, EVERYONE else that came in after us was served and catered to immediately. I will NEVER return to Johnny's and will never recommend them to anyone I know. Wouldn't even give them a star if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining. Enjoyed the first class atmosphere and great service. Delicious complementary bread. Excellent salad!  Loved the baked potato soup."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend, per his recommendation. It was good, honestly it was darn good. 

It was a Thursday and the lunch special was Certified Angus Beef Top Sirloin. You can choose garlic mashed potatoes, or French fries. I opted for the fries. My friend did the mashed potatoes. You also get a soft drink included with your lunch, all for $10. 

The service was okay, nothing to boast about. I'll be back for that Thursday lunch special!"}
{"text":"Slow service. We hardly saw our waiter. In 45 minutes we got our appetizer, bread, had to flag down the floor manager for water refills, and no entree. Almost an hour elapsed when another server brought us our food. Two of the pasta portions for the chicken parm were cold. My lasagna was luke warm. When it arrived it looked good- good portion and neat. I sent it back for it to be warmed and another dish was brought 5-7 minutes later. Very obviously microwaved, sloppy melted cheese, smaller portion than the first dish. The side sausage was boiled and the skin was rubbery. It tasted okay but appeared as if it was prepared by a kid. Excuses followed about how there was a \"big party\" and the kitchen was \"slammed\". No offer to make the meal right by comping a cent. The food was okay but not worth the $. When Im in the area I may or may not return. I understand a restaurant can have a bad night. Even though our server was scarce other waitstaff were very busy and attentive guess we just drew the shortest straw this particular evening."}
{"text":"Was on a business trip for work.  The company that operates this restaurant is based in the Midwest and do a great job with food and hotels.  

I came in about 8pm and sat at the bar.  I asked the bartender about some local brews and was immediately sampled 3 or 4 'tastes' and found my favorite!  

She knew her menus and products well.  I had the French Onion Soup and a Ribeye Steak with Bleu Cheese topping - Cooked perfectly and well flavored.  

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was here late on a Tuesday evening, so it was not very busy. The Food was great, the service quick and attentive and the wine spectacular. Yes it is a bit pricey but well worth it. The food was served fast and prepared perfectly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and perfect evening! I love the Salmon Fiorintino, delicious every time and the portions are big, I had half of it for lunch the next day. We also enjoyed the Zucchini fries....yummy! 

Lovely ambiance for a date night or if you just need a night to kick back and enjoy some great food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a whim. We both could have not been more satisfied with the food. She had the salmon florin tine and I had the Parmesan crusted NY strip. Both we're amazing. Nice atmosphere. Service was a tad slow, but good things take time."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing based on service, NOT the food (since we didn't eat any!). 

We came in here starving and had a lukewarm greeting from the two hosts. Ok, fine. Whatever. Maybe it was the gloomy, almost-about-to-rain weather.

We were seated in a booth near a table of what seemed like 15-20 people. Unfortunately, we had the same server they did. Which means, we didn't really get much attention....if at all. 

The only thing we really got was water, which arrived later than expected. And we put in our order for the lobster mac and cheese appetizer. After a couple of minutes, we were pretty much ready to order. That's when the server began to take the bigger table's order....and we just weren't having it.

Our logic was that she could've taken our order first to get us out of the way rather than have us wait for her to take the order of 15-20 people. So, learning our lesson from the horrendous service at Picanha in California (we told ourselves if we had a feeling that it wasn't gonna be a good experience, we wouldn't stay), we went with our gut and just left.

Oh well. MAYBE we'll try some other time. 

At least we quenched our thirst with some water."}
{"text":"Johnny's is no longer our go to place for a guaranteed fabulous meal, with exceptional service.  The hosts and hostesses seem like you are an inconvenience., not very welcoming.  They don't even smile.  

Most of the waitstaff are very good but some are not very observant.  Dirty dishes are not removed, coffee  and drinks are not refilled.  

The food is hit and miss.  I guess it depends on who is in the kitchen.  The desserts that use to be the best in town are now just ok or in some cases really bad.  

This is very sad.  We use to love Johnny's and are very disappointed in the decline of the service and food.  I doubt we will be returning."}
{"text":"Seems to be a very nice romantic spot it what on the inset an odd location. A very pleasant place with an amazingly friendly staff, especially Tyler \"the bartender\" he is a REAL jem and a kick in the pants! 
The decor is semi-formal if not out and out old school. Linen tablecloths and napkins set the tone. 
The food, even though I NEVER go into detail is top notch. I say if you are in the area, have a little extra cash (the place ain't cheap) or better yet you want a romantic atmosphere you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Solid steakhouse, but not special.  The goat cheese salad was very tasty, but I added steak to make it an entree salad....the steak was a bit tough.  That would not have been so bad,  but their idea of a steak knife was a giant butter knife....it simply could NOT cut the steak.  Asked for a \"steak knife\" thinking they had something sharper; got another glorified butter knife.  

The lemon raspberry cake was delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times. I usually come here once every trip because it's so close to our hotel (Hilton Garden Inn-literally right across the street). I ALWAYS get the filet mignon with the spinach salad, baked potato and banana cheesecake.


The filet is cooked to the way you like it. Baked potato comes with all the fixings. Spinach salad comes with a yummy sweet salad dressing and my favorite is the banan cheesecake. The bananas come out caramelized and gives the cheesecake a nice crust.

The annoying thing about this restaurant is the fact that they make you wait 30 minutes for a party of 5+. We waited 30 minutes each time and the restaraunt was half empty. Service is also a bit slow and one time we sat for 3 hours just waiting for our food, eating and then waiting some more to get the bill. Next time, I'm just going to order it to go and eat it in my room."}
{"text":"Food was fine however that was the positive side. Reservation was made almost a month ago for 4 to celebrate a birthday yet they gave us a booth in the bar next to the bar itself, rather than in the dining room. It was impossible to have a conversation, especially since it was our 1st chance to meet our son's new girlfriend. Additionally the waitress was not friendly and treated us as an afterthought besides being rude. We had previously had a negative experience here but decided to give them another try, we won't be back"}
{"text":"Hmm, well this was an ok experience. For all of the hype and reputation, I probably will not be back. The service was really slow. I was seated almost ten minutes before I was asked what I would like for a drink. I ordered the steak skewers (a special) for appetizer. They were small, burnt, unimpressive. At every point during this meal, I could have said \"meh.\" 

I had a steak and mashed potato dinner. The weird thing?  No veggies. I know that was not in the description but I literally got a plate with steak and potatoes. And it was ok. There was nothing of merit to describe the food. Honestly, I am just going to end this review because it was a whole lot of \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Looking for a slightly upscale, perfect for a date night, somewhat lounge-y and yet romantic restaurant? Look no further than Johnny's Italian Steakhouse.

I love a good steak house and this place is no exception, the menu is typical for a steak house but with an Italian flair. Add in the Rat Pack influences: huge martini list, music, and artwork. This place is just something really special.

I loved dinner here so much that I think I'll need to heed other reviewers advice and stop in for Sunday brunch next time!"}
{"text":"I would give a 2.5 if I could. Here's the thing. We usually only remember to write a review unless something is really good or really bad. I came to Johnny's about 3 years ago and got the ravioli and remember it being decent. Like a chain Italian restaurant. I had it again 3 weeks ago and got the apple Gorgonzola salad, minestrone soup, and tomato mozzarella salad. Overall it was satisfactory. Good enough that when I decided it was too cold and late to go out for food, I ordered Johnny's. This time, the food was awful. And I was starving so that says a lot. The minestrone was way too salty and tasted like it came from a can. The tomato mozzarella salad just did not seem fresh. And I got the \"crispy zucchini\", which was just a flat out disappointment. I'll stick to braving the cold next time."}
{"text":"I ate here for restaurant week. The food and service were top notch. My cocktails were amazing! Everything was great! My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"You are much better off going to one of the local steak places like Tornado Room or Smoky's than this chain restaurant.  The food was sub-par for the price.  

For example, the salad tasted identical to the cheap pre-made bag of salad you buy at Copps, right down to the shredded, dried-up carrots.  Mine even had ice crystals in it, meaning they probably put on the plate the day before and the refrigerator was too cold.  Yuck!  Next, my steak was described on the menu to have a light crust of parmesan cheese.  I thought, hmmm.. interesting idea to balance the beef fat with a little salty dry cheese.  What came out?  A 1/4 inch thick layer of parmesan cheese baked onto my steak.  Come to think of it, everything was just way over-the-top with seasonings, cheese, butter, cream, etc.  I couldn't taste potatoes in the hash browns.  I tasted mass amounts of cheese and sour cream.

The service was very attentive and quick.  However our waitress kept trying to up-sell just about every course - i.e. would you like to upgrade your salad to a caesar for another $2?  would you like to add shrimp to your steak for another $5?  That's pretty tacky when you are  buying a $25 entree.  I had clients with me and felt like I'd taken them to TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"Had a great Valentine's day experience here.  Food is great prices high but nice environment"}
{"text":"Yuck, just spent $35 for a lousy spinach salad, a side of bread and a glass of wine. The salad dressing was gross. The dressing had separated and was more of a jelly. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'll always like this place it's dark big booths right in Middleton and usually you can always get a table. I enjoy the drink list I like that they have the underwood Pinot noir and the martinis are great! We got zucchini fries, filet mignon with loaded bake potato and the porterhouse. Zuchinni fries too over done and salty. All the food is a bit salty but that doesn't bother me. My boyfriend didn't like it as much. Loaded baked was so good perfectly loaded and cooked! Steaks were cooked on point I thought and the Caesar and spinach salad are both delicious. Good dressing and big potions I also fill up here and have left overs! The staff is always friendly and I think the servers are great at what they do. Nice bathrooms too."}
{"text":"We have been to Johnny's many times for dinner and celebrations and always had wonderful food and experiences.  However, this review is specifically for the cocktail lounge.  My husband and I stopped by on a Friday evening for a couple of drinks.  The bartenders made our experience.  Jill and Soojin were attentive, professional and delightful!  The cocktail lounge has great ambience and is a pleasure for date night, a cocktail before dinner, or just for stopping in spontaneously.  Trust me, you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sit at the bar. Let Justin decide what you drink and eat. You won't be sorry. The salmon is good. Oscar filet was amazing. Sausage bread you must try. And don't forget to eat your croutons. They make them in house I'm told."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!   Lobsters bisque was horrible.  Steak was average.   Stuffed shrimp had no texture - mush.  Redeeming factor the service was good!"}
{"text":"Johnny's is located in West Madison in a newer section of town. It is easy to find and there is plenty of parking.   The decor is beautiful, this would be a great date night spot.  The food is higher end Italan.  The salads they offer before your meal are goat cheese or ceasar, i think they also have the traditional salad as well.  I had a wonderful angel hair pasta with scallops, it was absolutely delicious.  The prices are average for the quality of food and i am a fan.  The service was also excellent.  This is a great spot and I will definatley return when i visit Madison again."}
{"text":"First visit to Johnny's Italian Steakhouse - recommended and joined by friends.  Cocktails at the bar - Classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned and some Johnny Walker.  Our server was great, super friendly and accommodating - even offered some \"readers\" to see the menu better.  I had the ribeye - one of the best steaks I've had in some time.  She had the cedar planked salmon - excellent.   Pasta, Salad and bread - delicious.  This was a top notch, classic supper club experience - Well done."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: We eat here twice a year.

Dinner on Saturday night- 6/11.  Appetizers were lobster mac n cheese and sausage stuffed mushrooms.  After salads our main courses for my partner and I were smothered top sirloin and filet medallions.  Martinis consumed (hahahaha) were sidecars for myself and birthday cake for my girlfriend.  The entire experience was what you would expect....We like this restaurant for it's consistency with deliciousness and we love the music they play."}
{"text":"Great service. I ordered the homemade ravioli dish. It was very saucy and good. Salad was good. The only improvement would be adding more light. I do like the Rat Pack theme! Desserts were perfect. Good selection."}
{"text":"I love the staff here. They take really good care of the customers and believe in great customer service."}
{"text":"I have been to Madison three times before this and every time I came I would make sure to go here once if not twice. However, my recent experience was subpar. The chubby cut I ordered was not cooked the way I wanted and looked smaller and different then I remember. The person who served us was not very friendly and we only saw her three times during the whole time.  Once to order, second when she bought the food, and third when we asked for the bill. The creme Brulee, and the real reason for going, did not disappoint as usual. Would I go again? Yea! Hopefully, this was a off night for them."}
{"text":"We recently took our family there for brunch.  About 14 of us.  The waitress was so nice, accommodating and fun.  The food was delicious, and the desserts are homemade which is a rarity these days.  We plan another trip back soon.  HIghly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was great. No complaints there. The appetizer of a shrimp cocktail was bland. I had a seafood pasta which was alright. The scallops were a bit over cooked probably because the pasta was hot and kept cooking it after it was sauteed. Food was not really worth the price with all the aforementioned hiccups."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with the food.  A couple of times the service was a bit off, (slow) but not enough to warrant docking the rating.   It's a place where my wife and I can go and know we'll both have good food, and a good variety."}
{"text":"*Restaurant Week Lunch Review Only*

We tried the Italsian Sausage stuffed mushrooms, lobster mac n' cheese, and \"Steak, Steak, Steak\", creme brulee and turtle cheesecake. Such an interesting experience that I don't know how else to do this other than doing a pros and cons list:

Cons:

- Service was very friendly but a little strange (in terms of timing, we received our entrees while eating our appetizers and desserts while a couple of bites into our entrees, which seemed a little rushed. In general, that's fine because usually, we don't have much time over the lunch hour so service like this would be welcomed)
- Everything besides the desserts were only OK. We enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms (though a little heavy, very well done), the bread, and the mashed potatoes from the steak dish. The lobster mac n' cheese, however, was a huge miss. The claw on the top was tough, dry, and had the strong seafood smell, and there was no lobster within the mac n' cheese itself, which was very disappointing. The steak was a little overcooked (medium-rare was requested), which is no big deal

Pros:

- Excellent bang for your buck. 3 course meal with large portion sizes? Count me in!
- DESSERTS. 10/5 stars! The portion of creme brulee was enormous and easily a dessert that could be shared between two people. The glaze on top was well done and the flavor was delicate and all around one of the best I have had. The turtle cheesecake, likewise, was decadent and delicious and was also a great treat. Full sized portions that were a great end to the meal.
- The bread here was quite fluffy and delicious and the establishment itself had very nice servers. The mashed potatoes were also very well done.
- The bar looked beautiful and the booths were romantic


Overall, note that everything here is very unhealthy if you're not ordering a salad! The steak was encrusted with a garlic parmesan butter that was tasty, but cholesterol laden. The mac and cheese is also equally decadant as well as the Italian Sausage stuffed mushrooms covered in cheese. This is not your typical \"upscale steakhouse\", so expect large portions instead of fine dining. That being said, I had an overall, great experience here and was happy I tried it out. Also note, lunch specials here are generally very reasonable."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review has nothing to do with the dinner served at Johnny's. I have had dinner here before, it's pretty good (albeit a bit overpriced). But nothing deserving of 5 stars.

My review is for the Sunday brunch at Johnny's. Oh my, wow!  $15 all you can eat buffet.. And that is a steal for the food that is offered. There's a prime rib station, omelet station, waffle station, dessert bar, and numerous hot breakfast/lunch dishes which often vary from week to week. There is also a fresh, GIANT, complimentary cinnamon bun brought to your table.

If this isn't enough to entice you, Johnny's offers BOTTOMLESS mimosa's for under $5!!!!! I'm serious!

To top it off, I have never.. Ever had to wait to be seated for brunch at Johnny's. Do yourself a favor and skip Granite City's overpriced, sub par brunch that you have to wait for an hour just to get a table. Go to Johnny's instead!"}
{"text":"This was a nice place. Very romantic. However, my wife and I were treated as outsiders. We came dressed in appropriate attire. However we were treated as if we didn't have money. Our waitress was snotty and acted as if she was too busy for us. The food was fantastic. The service was another story. The prices were slightly higher than the value of the food brought to the table. But all in all we most likely would not go back."}
{"text":"Johnny's is your best bet for a good meal when staying at the Hilton Garden Inn in Middleton if you don't have a car. Biggest plus is that they offer room service to the hotel, which is great especially when the weather is bad. Note that there is an additional fee for room service so if you're up for walking about a few hundred feet I suggest just going to the restaurant if you want to save some dollars. 
They have a good variety of steak, salad, and Italian dishes on their menu. I've ate there various times and haven't had a bad meal. Some standouts were:
The spinach salad- you pay $3.50 to upgrade your side salad to this. It's pretty huge for a side salad I was barely hungry after eating it. It comes with thick strips of bacon and a delicious bacon dressing. The dressing was so good I wanted some to go. 
The Parmesan crusted sirloin w stuffed shrimp- this was really good. I usually don't go for sirloin at steakhouses because it's often not that tender. This was the exception it was very tender and cooked perfectly. I got the mushrooms as a topper, I thought it'd be a couple of sliced mushrooms but it was a plateful of flavor infused baby Bella's. This was an excellent and indulgent meal.
The salmon and shrimp on the salad- I ordered a Waldorf salad with salmon, instead they delivered a shrimp frangelico salad w salmon. It was late in the night and I didn't feel like calling them out on it and the salad looked great. The salmon and shrimp were delicious, but I didn't care for the hazelnuts and dried apricots (which is why I ordered the Waldorf)."}
{"text":"First time here, tired traveler and this was next door. Perfect and the staff were awesome,  attentive  and friendly!"}
{"text":"Yes, I am upgrading my rating.  I am back in Madison for work.  I have had Johnny's for the last two nights for delivery to my hotel room.  I was very impressed with their steaks.  It was cooked it perfectly and the temperature was still very warm when I got them.   I splurged tonight and got desert.  The ice cream that came with the cake had not started to melt yet.  It probably has been the best delivery I have had in a long time, if ever.  Service was very fast and correct. .  Food, awesome, service incredible.  Thanks for making eating in my hotel room an event not a task,"}
{"text":"Came for sunday brunch which was amazing! Jeffrey our server was the best....and all you can drink mimosas for $5.50 can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Steak was over cooked (ordered medium rare received medium) . Service was slow. Side item wasn't correct (ordered mixed veg received wild rice). Despite being over cooked the steak was good but I think the waiter was the cause for our issues."}
{"text":"We came to Johnny's to celebrate my Dad's retirement and I was very glad this place was nice enough to really fit the occasion. We were seated in a half circle booth facing the bar which is dim with blue lighting for a sort of cool factor. They had some easy listening jazz playing with a Frank Sinatra song here and there. It all worked pleasantly together for a nice dinner.

I had their whiskey old fashioned sweet to go along with my meal and I thought it was very smooth. We shared a family style salad and were able to try some great house bread in olive oil and pepper. The bread had a nice salty crust that kept having me lean in for one more piece. 

I selected the Veal Sinatra for my meal and was happy with my choice. The veal had a nice seared crust and was topped with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, shrimp, peppers and a cream sauce that was much thinner and lighter than an Alfredo. The seasoned mixed vegetables were very tasty dipped in this sauce (so much for the healthy side!). I think with the salad and bread this easily could be two meals, although I enjoyed it so much I just kept going.

We finished our celebration with their creme brulee and their chocolate cake. I thought the cake was intended to be a molten cake because of its size and shape, yet there was no center but rather a little pool of chocolate at the top in a little indent. This came with a scoop of caramel ice cream and a little whipped cream. It was rich and tasty, but my favorite of the two was easily the creme brulee. The caramelized top was so sweet and so crisp, I was trying to eat it slowly so I could savor it all before it was gone.

Overall I think this was a very nice dining occasion and if I lived in Madison I would surely come back to have dinner on their patio area in the summer."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during restaurant week. I started off with the Italian stuffed mushrooms. I did not really enjoy the sausage but the mushrooms were decent. It was a little on the fatty/oily side for me so I could barely finish it. I had the lobster mac and cheese for an entree. I was excited to have some lobster after a long hiatus but was disappointed greatly. Their \"lobster\" really is just a claw of lobster on top of the mac and cheese. There is none in the dish itself. You can imagine my disappointment...For dessert, I had the creme brûlée which was really really good. It was also huge, probably bigger than the entree itself. This was definitely the highlight of the meal. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience but I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to Johnny's on a number of occasions both for dinner and for drinks. As a steakhouse it's so so. I prefer it for drinks. 

This evening I was there for a cocktail reception with a variety of appetizers. The food was decent... Some sort of pizza roll, which I did enjoy. It was stuffed with a sweet sausage. There was also shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, and stuffed mushrooms. There was also a nice cured meat platter - very good. 

It seemed like the kitchen and wait staff was having a hard time keeping pace with our reception - but overall the service and food were decent."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night at six, and the lot was fairly empty.  We were seated immediately.  Our server was very attentive and answered all of our questions.  
Skip the appetizer and enjoy the complementary warm bread. It's divine!  The salad is very good - love the croutons!
I ordered the Heart of Italy which was a serving of chicken parmesan, a serving of fettuccini, and a parmesan crusted steak.  I didn't care for the red sauce on the chicken, but the pasta was great and that steak was incredible!  I want everything I eat to come with that parmesan crust now!  It was super tasty.
My husband ordered seafood ravioli and my little boy got chicken strips and they both were very happy with their meals.
It's a beautiful restaurant.  The tables are pretty big so it's hard to hear those sitting across from you.  
Overall we had a great time and we'd definitely come back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Johnny's does a great with drink specials, entrees and desserts (really good with desserts).

I was here on business and we choice this location for our group meal. I would definitely re-visit again. The service was solid and the food was really flavorful. 

Save room for dessert and make sure to order the \"Mounds Candy Bar\" dessert."}
{"text":"Other than poorly made cocktails, this is a great experience. Love the music and ambiance and the wait staff was superior. Get the stuffed mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Wine was good.. Although my wife ordered vegetables with her steak.  When the meal arrived, there were maybe six vegetable pieces.. When we asked the server if we could get more vegetables, the response was, you got 4 ounces... Really?!  That is ridiculous.. Vegetables cost almost nothing compared to steak.. Won't be coming back to this place again.."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from Samantha at the Hilton Garden Inn across the street. We were seated promptly and introduced to Jeremiah, our waiter. We ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and chicken parmigiana. Both dishes were very good and the service Jeremiah provided was very good also. We would definitely eat here again when in the area."}
{"text":"came on a sunday night and they were actually pretty busy.  i was seated immediately.  ordered the bone in rib eye medium with garlic mash and the house  salad.  first was the bread which was actually focaccia bread.  it was soft and full of flavor.  i thought this will be a good meal.  the salad came out and that was pretty standard for a house salad.  a nice light vinaigrette dressing on greens and a few cherry tomatoes and croutons.  Then the meat came out almost immediately after i finished.  the garlic mashed potato was probably my favorite food on the plate.  just a few chunks and full of garlic flavor.  yummmm.  the meat on the other hand was just okay.  it was tender and easy to cut but it was pretty fatty and definitely on the rarer side.  when you think medium you think pink.  but this was red.  not a lot of seasoning either so it wasnt so flavorful.  convenient location for people staying in middleton.  staff was nice.  if i come back, id try something else, not the rib eye."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a nice team lunch here with 7 other people.  I'm so glad I made reservations because two parties ahead of us were told it would be a 30 minute wait, despite the parking lot and restaurant being empty.  When the parties pushed back, the host responded nicely that they were full with reservations. 

Jeffrey took wonderful care of us, refilling drinks quickly and even running back to the kitchen to verify ingredients in a dish.  Didn't hesitate when we requested more of their delicious bread, either.  The family-style house salad that was served was very good; fresh ingredients and lightly dressed.  My coworker had a cup of the baked potato soup and couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Two of us had the lunch filet which was served with a really colorful side of fresh vegetables and cooked perfectly.  My (oddly named) Rope Sausage & Pesto pasta had a generous amount of sun-dried tomatoes and I'm sure I took more than half of it home.  The steak sandwich at the table was piled high with steak and onion straws and he said it was fantastic.  

I couldn't help but notice that the restaurant was still pretty quiet when we left.  There was a group of 8 near us and then some of the booths had 'reserved' signs, but no guests.  I wonder if they just don't have the staff to cover busy lunches....

Overall the restaurant is clean, quiet and modern with dark wood throughout.  I thought the prices were fair given the quality and quantity of the food.  The lunch specials were extremely well-priced, with a filet tip stroganoff running $11, which included a drink."}
{"text":"After my flight was 2.5 hours late, I was looking for a nice place for a cocktail and dinner and it was already around 9pm.  Most nearby places were closed but Johnny's was open until 10pm.  I walked over from the hotel to Johnny's and took a spot at the bar.  The ambiance was nice and the bar was cool.  Relaxing atmosphere and good service.  My martini was served in a chilled glass.  The minestrone soup tasted very fresh for being served one hour before closing time.  The shrimp frangelico salad was delicious.  Next time I'm out this way, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious. Well since I need to say more I will.

I needed a table for one on a Tuesday night and popped in here to make a reservation (I don't think I really needed it) and then did some shopping. After walking around the shops, I was about 30 minutes early and was easily seated. 

I was super hungry after shopping and decided to start my meal with the Italian Sausage Stuffed Mushrooms. The sausage in the mushrooms were good but towards the end (there were 5 mushrooms) I dug out the mushrooms and just ate the cheese and mushrooms.

Then, I had the Petite Filet (medium) with salad, broccoli and asparagus. I have to say this is the best filet I have had in Wisconsin so far. It was delicious-goodness."}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner with friends. We met in the bar for drinks. The brandy old fashions were excellent and the bartender was attentive. 

We started dinner with crab cakes. They were superb but expensive at $13.00 each. The lobster bisque was very flavorful and, in my husband's onion, the best in Madison. Worth the $9.00/bowl. The Caesar salad was large, full of crunchy croutons and is an upgrade over the house salad which is served family style.

When we placed our order we asked for bread, knowing it usually arrives with the drinks, and they make an olive oil Parmesan dipping sauce table-side. We were told bread came with the salad. By the time salads arrived we'd had appetizers and our plates were removed. No table side dipping sauce or bread plates. By the time our waitress checked back she was serving entrees. Time for bread was over so we didn't mention it. We did ask for additional forks as they were cleared with the appetizer and salad courses. Instead of bringing each person new cutlery the waitress brought one napkin enclosed setting and said to share it as it had two forks and a knife. Really, this is a classy restaurant, be observant, and bring a new fork when you clear one away.  One more service observation. I appreciate having my water glass refilled without asking.

The tenderloin entree was nicely seared and flavorful. My dinner companion ordered the salmon Florentine stuffed with goat cheese and pine nuts. She said she'd order it again. The Chanel #5 pasta has cheese ravioli in a rich cream sauce with shrimp and lobster. The dish was good , though over salted, and swimming in sauce. The steak Debutgo was rare as requested, smaller than I remember, over salted and served with too much sauce. The pasta alforno on the side was excellent

Over all it was a nice dining experience with friends with a few minor misses. I recommend this restaurant and will be dining their again soon."}
{"text":"We made reservations for for two on my birthday for 5:15pm on a Thursday. We we got there, the place was pretty empty but by the time we left, business picked up pretty well and fast. I would recommend making RSVP regardless of the day and time. Now on to the important stuff.

Johnny's was by far the best restaurant I've eaten at in Wisconsin along with Flemings Steak House. I know they are competitors but these places are just top of the line. 

I ordered the steak and shrimp stuffed with crab and garlic mash potatoes. The serving sizes are awesome! For $30, you get a great deal of food including bottomless salad which was excellent and fresh bread with olive oil. I do not know what kind of dressing they used for the salad but it was excellent and didn't overwhelm the salad. The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.
I am not a fan of crab and didn't want the stuff shrimp with crab but I am so happy I ordered it. The crab was fresh and cooked perfectly. They were basically mini crab cakes stuffed in between the shrimp and the tail. It complimented the steak very well which was crusted itself. 

I cannot say enough good things about Johnny's. The kiwi martini was made to perfection, the music playing in background was soothing and it's a great spot for couples. Do not take children. It's meant for adults 18+. 

Service was great. Host was great. Martini was great! Plus I got a free ice cream for my birthday! I will be back here. 

Highly recommended. Come we extra money however. For me and my boyfriend, we spent $75 without tip but it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Walked in just before 10:00 and they refused to serve any food.  They have an event here and turned me away.  Poor way to run a business."}
{"text":"My go to dinner while in town for EPIC training. I've been about 6 times, and once there was plastic inside of the salmon spinach rolls. They took it off my tab. Literally, pulled the plastic out which told me it was pre-made. Other than that service has been great and they delivered to my room twice in the snow!"}
{"text":"Nice menu selection and friendly well trained staff make for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Chef Rod runs a tight ship. Great, high-quality food and service that doesn't disappoint. I'm especially fond of their Sunday brunch spread - don't miss it ... especially on \"special\" events like Easter and Mother's Day."}
{"text":"My wife and I popped in one afternoon for lunch....and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of food.

 I had the BEST EVER salad...like ever!...it's called the Johnny's spinach salad and you can order it as a side with ur steak. 

The wife ordered french onion soup and teriyaki salmon, both excellent!. The steak was nice and juicy....and btw, don't forget to get ur steaks oscar style (whatever that means) simply because they come with the most amazing piece of crab-cake EVER!

One star off for adding 2 extra dollars on our bill. I am sure they would have taken it off had we brought it to their notice....but we didn't want to make a scene."}
{"text":"Best service EVER
I'm staying at the Fairfield Mariott for a business trip, and I ordered delivery. I completely goofed and accidentally gave Johnny's the wrong room number and wrong name (I forgot my room was booked under my associate's name). They tried to deliver my food and were unsuccessful. When I realized what had happened I called the restaurant to try and retrieve my meal.  Johnny's said they'd have to charge me for both dinners if they came back out for a second delivery, and I declined.  Shortly after the manager called my room and said he understood things happen, and he'd deliver my exact order no charge! He even personally delivered my meal and would not accept a tip. Oh, and threw in some free soup :D"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. Service was excellent and the Filet Oscar was also great. Ordered the calamari for appetizers and it was far too salty.. that was the only negative here."}
{"text":"I got a steak here, as it's a steakhouse. It was mediocre at best- The texture and taste were about the same as one you'd get from Applebee's or the like for 10 dollars. Service was also not that great. There were a total of like 10 steak fries with my order, which were super salty. If you are staying at nearby hotels just take a shuttle downtown for better food, or go to the Indian place nearby."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and this was down the street from my brother's workplace, so we gave it a shot. Both my bro and I are dairy free, he's allergic and I've become lactose intolerant as of this year. Our server accommodated us graciously and we were very pleased with the choice we made. Both of us had the same thing, 21 day aged filet mignon with asparagus, salad as a starter. It was perfect! 
The hostess noticed that we hadn't been waited on for awhile and found us a server right away, so I give the hosp staff a plus for being on their A game. I've been in the industry for 10+ years, so I'm more than understanding of how those kinds of things happen.
All in all, great experience, swanky atmosphere, and awesome food.
Would bring a date here if I lived in the area. 
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my parents anniversary.
Pros: Attentive and friendly service, extensive menu with lots of options for steaks, seafood and pasta, reasonable prices given the classy atmosphere. Everyone enjoyed their meals. 
Cons: It was surprisingly noisy, which wasn't so good for a special occasion and our table was so close to the next table I was afraid of bumping elbows with the person behind me. I also didn't like all of the water spots on the wine glasses. 

Overall a nice experience, but the little things stood out."}
{"text":"Bomb brunch! I have only been here during brunch on Sunday's so I am not sure about what there dinner is like. If it is anything like brunch though I would recommend it. Not only do they have all you can drink bloody Mary bar for $9 they also have all you can drink mimosas for $5.50.e For food they have a brunch buffet as well on Sunday's. I am not the biggest fan of buffets but even I have to admit this one is pretty good. 

The buffet consists of a row of breakfast staples such as eggs Benedict, bacon, sausage eggs, etc. The other row is Italian options that change. When I have been here the Italian option have always had a few different things. They also have a omelette station, waffle station and prime rib station. The last thing is a salad and dessert table. Overall it is a very nice spread. Especially when you are a few drinks in. 

One day I will try dinner and I hope to enjoy it as much as I do the brunch."}
{"text":"We live in Janesville and we will drive a hour just to go here. By far the best steak in the state. You won't go anywhere else once you go here."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. There are so many other places in Madison that use LOCAL, FRESH vegetables. I paid more money than I should have for a filet with no flavor. Definitely under seasoned meat. I ordered the mixed veggies and they were pretty bad. Not sure if they were frozen then thawed but they were NOT fresh. I mean you can go to the farmer's market and get green peppers! I was underwhelmed. Our service was not very good either. The bread they bring you was not fresh, seemed days old. You can tell all their products are shipped in. That's great if that's your thing or you don't care, but if I'm going to pay $35 before tip for only a steak and veggies, they better be memorable and amazing. Not factory farm and frozen. You can get really good food in Madison and in Middleton, there's no reason you need to give Johnny's your money."}
{"text":"This restaurant is contracted with the Hilton Garden Inn as their dinner room service. I had their salmon, spinach, artichoke pasta for dinner and it was great. It came w a side salad and a baked potato. There was enough food for leftovers the next day. They charge a $1 delivery fee + an automatic 18% gratuity. So worth it! Definitely a better option than what the downstairs kitchen has to offer."}
{"text":"We were in town for an anniversary weekend and chose this restaurant near our hotel one evening. I had a peppercorn steak pasta dish and it was delicious. Creamy, veggies, lots of steak, on fettuccine, totally hit the spot.  My husband got the porterhouse with parmesan crust. It was perfectly cooked and tender, on par with our favorite steak places back home. If in the area of a location,  we will be going again."}
{"text":"Nice steakhouse with great service.  But depending on who's the chef for the day, your food may be a hit or a miss.  I've eaten here before while away on business and have had the stuffed pork chops with Brussels sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes.  The dish was delicious!  The pork chops were tender and seasoned to perfection.  Yet, when I returned a few weeks later and ordered the Parmesan crusted ribeye, I was extremely disappointed.  The steak was tough and lacked flavor.  I also ordered my steak to be prepared medium and received Medium-rare instead.  The mashed potatoes were hard and bland.  Not sure if they had a new crop of chefs working that day, but they can do better."}
{"text":"My husband absolutely loved the veal that they serve here.  I had the Tortellini Portabello . It was decent , but nothing out of this world. The crusted goat cheese salad was very tasty. The service was really good too. Not a bad spot to go, just not top of the list."}
{"text":"Johnny's Italian Steakhouse was an accidental find for us as we drove around looking for a place for dinner. We are staying at the nearby Marriott and did not want hotel food. Johnny's fit the bill!

Decor is quite dark (dark woods, low lighting) throughout. Ambiance is cozy and intimate. We were four and were seated at a booth with a high surround, so there is no exposure to the next booth (they have tables as well).

I had my typical chicken parmesan dish to serve as a benchmark for comparison purposes. It was really good! The chicken was nicely done, and tasty. I got it with a side of pasta and marinara sauce (one can get other sides instead, like vegetables). My coworkers got other dishes and they really enjoyed their dinners. All of our meals came with a salad (very good, and makes dinner a great value!). Some of us opted for dessert. I got the hot lava cake (so good).

This place was definitely a place we would come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"The place is nicely decorated, ample parking space, online reservation as well. The steak I ordered was encrusted with a garlic parmesan butter that was tasty, and decent size, the mac & cheese was great on flavor as well. This is not your typical \"upscale steakhouse\", so expect large portions instead of fine dining."}
{"text":"Your run of the mill steakhouse. 

I don't have anything great to say nor anything bad. We've dined here numerous times and are never disappointed. At the same time infrequently find myself wishing I would have gone to Delmonico's and spent just a little more."}
{"text":"Looking no further for a fantastic caterer. Becca suggested a fabulous menu of Seafood Pomodoro, Cesar's salad, Chicken Parmesan, & Lobster Mac-n-Cheese, along with plenty of bread & olive oil. The pomodoro was the overall winner with large, tender scallops, mussels, mushrooms. No guest was being conservative with their portions because it was SO delicious. Lobster mac-n-cheese was perfect to go with the chicken, as it does not come with pasta 

I mimicked the ambiance of Johnny's with a Bellini & Mimosa bar at home, along with pastries & fresh fruit. 

They provided the utensils & refuse bags. If you need an early pick-up, best on a Sunday like I did as they are preparing their famous brunch menu.

They provided the utensils & refuse bags. If you need an early pick-up, best on a Sunday like I did as they are preparing their famous brunch menu. My guests arrived at 10am, so my local pick-up time of 9:30am was just right. Jeffrey happily assisted carrying it in my car with additional serving suggestions. David, Becca, & Jeffrey always deliver with the utmost care & quality. Chat with them for catering your next party at home. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Second week in a row.  Business in Wisconsin!
Great bar great food. I do love prime rib. 
Trying an old fashioned mule with brandy."}
{"text":"My Restaurant Week experience; good service, but food was mostly a miss.

Johnny's has easy parking, online reservations, and a pleasant, although unremarkable atmosphere.

All dinners come with focaccia bread with parmesan and oil at the table.  The bread is pillowy and garlicky.  My appetizer was the house salad, which features prosciutto, candied nuts, cheese, and crumbled hard boiled egg.  Excellent--despite the charcuterie, it's not too salty.

Entree was a generously sized ribeye (especially for Restaurant Week!) with garlic mashed potatoes.  The ribeye was medium well, as opposed to my order for medium, and just was not as high of a quality of meat as I would want from a steakhouse. The garlic suffered from too much of a raw garlic flavor as opposed to a roasty garlic.  Dessert was tiramisu--again, kind of a meh tiramisu.  Our server was excellent. 

Due to the meh food, I don't plan to return again. If I do return, I would probably order a full size house salad and chow down on salad and focaccia."}
{"text":"I first visited here during restaurant week. The service is very good. And I enjoyed the three-course meal a lot. 
The Parmesan crust steak is very special. And the starters were very good as well.

Then, I took a second visit at their Sunday brunch. It includes prime rib, omelettes, waffles, and other food and sweets. The prime rib was good, and all the other food were very tasty. They also had pasta and teriyaki salmon rice which turned out to be my favorite! The all-you-can-eat brunch is $15 per person. And not to mention their endless mimosas for only $5.5!"}
{"text":"Weird strip mall location, but convenient parking  and once you're inside the space is nice and  quiet--a pleasant place to have an extended conversation. The menu is part-Italian, part-steakhouse--a little odd but it seems to work. Our group enjoyed the shared appetizer platter with fried ravioli, sausage rolls, and calamari.  Your entree comes with salad and a side (unless it's pasta, of course), and portions are reasonable (most folks at my table finished their plates).  We shared some desserts, which were tasty, and the service was nice; there's a reasonably priced list of by-the-glass wines. Best of all, no one seems to care how long you sit.  If I were looking for a place for a group to dine where everyone could find something they wanted to eat and which was nice but not ridiculously extravagant, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner with 8 people here last night. The location was nicely maintained and clean. The staff were professional and courteous and the service was great. 

The food was nicely done. Caesar salad to start was fresh and the dressing was creamy and not over the top. 

My main was the veal Milanese which was breaded veal served under an arugula salad. I had a side of pasta with their version of an Alfredo sauce on it. It was all very nice. 

Everyone seemed to enjoy the wine and the assortment of beers."}
{"text":"Right now I'm here for a second time in 2 weeks because I want to give them another shot, but once again my coworker and I are going to leave disappointed. 

When I was here the first time, I sat at the bar and got the filet which was actually a pretty  decent cut of meat, but the seasoning they put on there just makes it seem like a really cheap steak( think montreal seasoning from costco). 

This time, they took 1.5hrs to overcook my med rare porter house to a beef jerky like medium well. I'm so hungry that i'm just going to eat it and blame myself for trusting them. Its such an insult to the cow that gave us this fine piece of meat so some knuckle head can over cook it."}
{"text":"Let me start with the dessert, which is super awesome. However, the steak they serve may use some improvement. I ordered the porterhouse steak which came as a huge, gigantic piece. The inside is pink and juicy, but the steak as whole was not very well seasoned or salted. The outer part of the steak tends to be hard and dry. Overall I would give the Burlee 5-star and the steak 2. BTW, the service is also 4.5-star so it is where my 3 is coming from."}
{"text":"Overall, we were not impressed and it was not a good experience. We arrived at 8:30pm on Sunday of Labor Day weekend and they close at 9pm. Although there weren't many people there, our service was still very slow and our server was frantic the whole time. It took a while for our server to come greet us and we had to ask for waters...guess that must not be automatic anymore. We ordered the sausage bread as an appetizer and some of the pieces were burnt on the outside but completely cold in the middle/inside. My supperclub spinach salad did not have any of the hot bacon dressing on it...so they must have forgotten to put it on. I ordered my steak medium and the outside was crunchy and burnt. We weren't even done eating yet because our food took forever to come out and they had already turned off the music and TVs, and turned up the lights. They definitely made us feel very unwelcome and rushed. Thus, we probably won't go back for a very long time."}
{"text":"Johnny's Italian Steakhouse is now my favorite Thursday lunch restaurant.
Johnny's offers a different lunch special Monday through Friday. But Thursday, Thursday is my ultimate fave: Steak Steak Steak!! It's a Certified Angus Sirloin with a thick, broiled parmesan crust. It's served with your choice of fries or mashed potatoes, but when we requested broccoli instead, it was cheerfully swapped (and no fee, either). The steak was incredibly delicious.....the best I've had in a while.
The meal also included a soft drink in the super reasonable \"lunch special\" price. Plus a lovely warm bread basket. Needless to say, both my mate and I were very very impressed!"}
{"text":"On a cold day with no rental car, Johnny's Italian Steakhouse sure came in handy when it was dinnertime.  Our large group of 20+ was expertly handled by Heather, and if you are sitting in her section you are in extremely good hands!  She managed to take care of our entire group with almost no help, and nailed every aspect of it.   Everyone got the right food, the right check, drinks refilled, you name it. 

There was a ribeye special that night, and while I didn't do a great job taking the picture, it had a bunch of sauteed vegetables on top, with a very nice sauce on the bottom.  It came with a choice of side, but a loaded baked potato is the only REAL option.  Am I right, or am I right?  Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  It does look nice, but the food sucks.  I ordered the filet and it was low quality with vegetables drenched in butter.  My date had a salmon pasta and that tasted horrible as the salmon was very fishy.  Tiramisu was average.  Don't go here."}
{"text":"We had a very poor experience here. We came here in the late afternoon (4pm) on a Saturday after a wedding where we did not eat. They sat us in the bar section, where we were not greeted by our server but had him complaining while standing next to our table to another server who had 'stolen his table'

We wanted a drink, and I asked the server if they had any drink specials and he replied,'Umm let me check,' then left and did not return for another 5 minutes. He did not have any drink specials when he got back. He was unable to tell us the beers they had, and did not have a list. 

We each ordered a steak, filet mignon for me and my partner got the NY strip. They tasted OK, but were over done and covered in a thick gravy-like sauce. Not what we expected from a steakhouse."}
{"text":"I'm not too impressed, ordered the stuffed mushrooms which were ok, but very greasy.  Also had the lasagna which was lacked flavor and was the most bland lasagna I've ever had."}
{"text":"We  went to celebrate my sisters birthday and we both had salads that were terrible.  Mine was so covered in dressing that I didn't eat it and the other salad was full of rusty colored lettuce.  We complained but nothing was done.  We are done  with Johnny!s Steak House."}
{"text":"mediocre service and sp so food. nice bar area but was not impressed with bartenders' attentiveness

Prices were reasonable - but prime rib was disappointing."}
{"text":"YUCK, don't order the spinach salad. It was dry (no dressing) and so not worth the price. I had a lot of wilted spinach leaves. All the sundries tomatoes, bacon, and egg was at the bottom. The baked potato soup was ok, could have been warmer. I'm here in town for work and came to the restaurant on the hotels recommendation. Maybe their other food is better. I was expecting high end salad as the restaurant looks nice."}
{"text":"Amazing steaks! Had the filet medallion trio and was a wonderful variety of tastes with the crusted toppings. The bone in ribeye was what my friend ordered and it was cooked to perfection at rare to medium rare, as ordered. My side of asparagus was under cooked & hard - older stalks. The garlic mashed potatoes were very garlicky & creamy. Waiter (John) was very knowledgable and very pleasant. Definitely returning here when in Madison again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and cozy interior. The food was amazing."}
{"text":"I stayed near the restaurant so I thought I'd try it. I was pleasantly surprised. This place beat my expectations. The food was very good. They try to do the retro steakhouse thing with Sanatra music--a bit cliche but after a couple of good drinks it was working. Prices were very fair too. I'll go back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. I decided to stay local instead of eating in downtown Madison and I'm glad I did. The steak was cooked perfectly too. The Parmesan was a little heavy but easily scraped off and still left a good flavor. The service was excellent too. This was a nice surprise."}
