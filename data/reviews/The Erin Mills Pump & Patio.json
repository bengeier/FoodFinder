{"text":"Despite a mix up with our reservation they made all attempt to ensure we were seated well. The service was great and our server very patient with out group. The beer selection on tap was moderate but the food was very good. Portion size huge and the taste was a treat to the tastebuds. Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Far better options in the area make this my first and only trip to Erin Mills Pump & Patio.

Went with my girlfriend on a Friday night and we were promptly seated upstairs. I quite enjoyed the seating areas, quite unique compared to other restaurants. Beer selection was good, my girlfriend was very pleased they offer Somersby on draft, and I the same with respect to Hops & Bolts.

We started off with the calamari and at $14.99 i expected a decent portion, but was underwhelmed when it came to the table. The portion size did not come close to reflecting the cost and the flavour didn't make up for it either. Calamari was good, not spectacular. The two dipping sauce options were quite makeshift as if they just decided to use a sauce from another dish and throw it on the plate.

I had the 2 piece halibut fish and chips, and it was honestly the worst Halibut Ive ever eaten. Thick, heavy fish that required a knife to cut with. Not flaky, not light, and left a very unpleasant taste in my mouth. The portion size was also underwhelming given the $20 price tag (Especially since I'm fairly certain it was not fresh Halibut, but previously frozen). Not that it mattered in this regard as I didn't finish it, but small portions/high prices was a theme I noticed.

My GF had the Turkey Panini with ceasar salad. First off, what restaurant in 2014 charges $2 more to \"upgrade\" from a garden salad to a ceasar salad? 16.99 for a sandwich and salad when its all said and done is once again, overpriced for what you get. Turkey, of course, is inherently dry and the kitchen really did nothing to combat this. Bacon was all fat, hardly any meat on it that you could enjoyably consume. An average sandwich all around.

I did read other reviews from many sources and what I noticed were people commenting on portion sizes being large. My takeaway was that their side dishes are generous, (side ceasar and fries) but I think it's safe to say people are more concerned with the main part of their dish, not the associated side dish.

So at the end of the day, its an $80+ bill for 2 beers, 2 mains and an app. Given the food quality and associated prices, I really see nothing that will push me back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a family night of pub food on Sunday.  

This rating is difficult, because I have to at least factor in the restaurant's *potential*, since I feel much of my experience on Sunday was likely a one-off event.

First of all the place was BUSY!   We ran into 3 separate groups of people we know from the neighbourhood, so it was hopping with area residents eager to try it out, especially on the Family Day long weekend.  

The food is typical pub fare with some nicer options too.  Everything was average but tasty.   

The issues:
* They took FOREVER to take our order.  At one point we said we needed another minute, but we made it clear \"really, just one more minute\", but we then waited probably about 20 minutes for the waitress to return.
* When the food did come, 2 people got their food first, then another minute or two passed before the 3rd person got theirs.... and then we realized that the 4th meal wasn't coming (mine).  We reminded them of it as they brought the others, but sure enough, a few minutes later they returned and admitted the order hadn't been put through.  So we had to wait quite a while for my meal.  The other 3 were essentially done their meal by the time it arrived.
* The manager came to apologize about the late meal, and brought a coupon, which we appreciated.  He asked if I'd like anything else, so I said vinegar - and he never returned!   I had to flag down another server for there.

The delays at our friends' tables were similar.  

The atmosphere was nice, the place feels clean.  But the service that night was definitely atrocious.  

We did notice that we hadn't been charged for my meal, so they did try to make right on their mistakes, and i appreciate that.  Incidences like that make me inclined to visit again and give them another shot.  It's a great option for that neighbourhood if they can make a go of it.

(Oh - and it's pretty pricey for an upscale pub.   $17 for pasta, and most apps are in the $13-$15 range)."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly servers, just service was a bit slow. Not horrible for us, but I did notice a man who was seated nearby waited for a good 10-15 minutes before he even got to place his drink order.  The servers seemed new, so maybe they're still working out \"who gets what table\".

Otherwise a great place - wings were some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good wings. Especially worth it when it's wing night. I've tried the medium, southern Cajun, and forty Creek - they're all great. Nice patio too."}
{"text":"Great place! Food is great! Friendly people. Go there for Wing night Monday  and Tuesday's. Parking is good. Also have a patio."}
{"text":"It looks like a pub from outside but its actually not a bad decor inside. It's more of a rustic kind of restaurant. As for the food, it was good but it was a bit expensive. We both ordered sandwiches because it was kinda the cheapest."}
{"text":"What happened? Seriously, what happened?

Either I'm expecting way too much from these types of pub restaurants, or the Pump's standards have fallen far short. I came here last week with my mother for lunch. Weird, cavernous atmosphere with fellow patrons who all looked hungover or bored, exorbitant prices, staff who you couldn't pay to give less care... it all added up to a frustrating experience. We ended up leaving after looking at the lunch menu and seeing overpriced pub food.

Not coming back here again. Get your act together. Just because it's a pub, doesn't mean you have to give up any semblance of restaurant standards."}
{"text":"This place is actually in Mississauga, not Toronto.  Anyways, here it goes: this place is fairly new and it is located in an former bistro place, however, they managed to get the right atmosphere with the decoration and me and my wife love this place, we go there almost every week as they have wings specials from Sunday to Wednesday and they are superb!.  the pizza is also reaaaaally good. The staff is super friendly, so, good food and good service: 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best Sports Bar & Grill in Mississauga ! 

I absolutely love this place for what it is. Don't expect a \"fine dinning experience\" because that's really not what the Erin Mills Pump & Patio is all about...and that's fine!

I can't even begin to count the number of quality flat screens they have hanging on their walls. Whether you're sitting at the bar, dining room or the upstairs lounge, you're guaranteed a view of the game. 
Did I forget to mention they have a HUGE 165\" Projection Screen? 
... yeah that's right, 165\"! 

If you're not already convinced that this is the best sports bar & grill in Mississauga, let me finish off by talking about the food, drinks and staff.

Food: Known for their (grilled) chicken wings the pump offers everything from pulled pork sliders to a variety of amazing salads and delicious sandwiches. Legendary steaks and ribs (locally sourced) and signature homemade Pump House burgers. 

Drinks: Large selection of draught beers followed by an extensive wine list from a variety of regions. You name it, they have it.

Staff: Friendly, warm and genuine! I'm never disappointed with the service here. 

Give them a try and don't be surprised when you find yourself coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The dough the dough the dough..pizza definitely should not be your first or second or even third choice. This place should not serve pizza at all. Well yeah...beer is good, but what beer isint? Patio nice too...just stick with the beer, you'll be fine:)"}
{"text":"Really do not understand the bad reviews for this place. I've been here twice and both times the food was great. The atmosphere is lovely. I'd describe it as an upscale sports bar. The service is a bit slow but they can work on that.

Now this place is known for their grilled wings which are justttttt amaaaazing!! The char on the wings adds such amazing flavour. And even better ... Tuesday is wing night with 59 cent wings.

I've also had their Louisiana Salad which was quite delicious! It was a very good portion with 3 jumbo shrimps and 3 strips of chicken. The salad dressing was just right.

I don't know if some of the past reviewers are super fussy or what but give this place a try, especially their grilled wings :)"}
{"text":"Erin mills Pump great oven pizza. Try the meat lovers. Better prices than the clarkson pump."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place from friends, but I was honestly underwhelmed after the hype.

We were a large party, roughly a dozen people or so, which may have factored into some of the below experiences. We were initially served pretty promptly when we were all seated around 6:45. The food took a little while to come out, but it was a Saturday evening and they clearly timed the food to come out at about the same time for everyone. We got a few orders of sweet potato fries and nachos for the table; both were pretty standard in my opinion. I got a Swiss burger with normal fries; this is typically one of my favorite combinations of burgers - it's actually the only thing I'll eat at McDonald's. But my burger was dry, even a bit charred on the outside. The server didn't ask me how I wanted it done, so I didn't suppose that I could ask for my more typical medium-rare (this was well-done). I rarely eat Swiss burgers with any of the provided veggies, but those tomatoes were essentially to getting it down. It's not that it tasted bad, it was just really dry. Fries were fine. If I had paid $5.99 for this, that would be okay, but it was $15.99, which was way too much, even if the burger had been good. The amount of fries was generous, but potatoes are not expensive in the first place, and nothing about the burger was gourmet (e.g., brioche bun, truffle oil, etc.). Would also note that one of our party members got a pizza that was burned to the point that he could pick up the whole thing without having it bend even the slightest.

The service also went way downhill after we initially ordered. The server came back maybe twice to see if we wanted more drinks (being mostly students, they could have made a lot more money if they kept coming back) and didn't do any refills of non-alcoholic beverages. Even when they cleared our plates, they didn't ask if we wanted anything else. Also to be noted was the fact that you could see all the scratches and cleaning rag marks on the tabletop reflecting in the light; not really the servers' fault so much as a design flaw.

Could have been two stars, but I thought about everything else that I've given two stars and they're not this bad. They had a lot of TV's too, which was nice (though par for the course)."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" = Totally underwhelmed after 3 visits.

We've been going because it's a pub right in our neighbourhood and a nice stroll. After 3 dissapointing meals, it's safe to say we'll return for drinks only.

My concerns:
-The food is subpar. So far we've had a dry burger, cold fries, and soggy, undercooked wings 
-The level of noise is quite high day, noon or night 
-The servers are inappropriately dressed. Lots of skin showing in the wrong places and odd themed \"costumes\""}
{"text":"Food isn't so great, but the establishment is really nicely put together. Patio area is huge! Bigger than the inside. Second floor is strictly for reservation parties only. 

Plenty of televisions hug on the walls for guests to enjoy and washrooms are very clean.

It is located inside a higher-end plaza (just outside the mississauga road area) many customers tend to dress up although its not really necessary. I've been 3 times and we all wore shorts and tee's. 

Service was excellent for 2 of the 3 occasions I went. 
I really wish the food was better, nothing on the menu was mindblownin, your basic pub food at an upscale price. 

There is lots of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Average place with average food and over-priced menu items...can make a cheaper better version at home."}
{"text":"So this place is brand new, built around winter 2014. It feels so cramped and small inside. I don't like the giant glass window that allows you to see outside, as this lets in too might light. The bathroom is designed for little people with little tallywackers. The bathroom is so cramped and tiny, and the urinal is the largest I have every seen in my life! The waitresses wear white bras with white see through tops - I thought this was a family restaurant. I saw lots of nips that night, which is not the best for a rated G night. the waitress evened added extra to our bill without telling us in advance, for me I find that very rude. If it costs extra for bacon and cheese, you need to let the customer know before and not surprise him/her when the bill arrives. I will never go back unless I shrink in size or I bring $1 bills for the waitresses' cleavage."}
{"text":"Penne fra diavolo is so good here! Everything else is good- pretty standard. Have been here many times and food has always been good. Try their spin dip as well! Can't complain. Seafood quasaedilla was just ok. Steak is ok too."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3* as well. Decent little place. When we walked in we were seated upstairs in the dining area. The problem...screaming kids in the area so we moved. 

I had the Jalapeño Burger with sweet potato fries & a side Greek salad. Nothing to complain about for the food or wait staff just not as nice as I would have liked. Lighting was off colour. P.S. They had the Figure Skating Channel on. There are zero circumstances that this channel is acceptable!"}
{"text":"Tip:  If you're coming for wings, get them GRILLED!

Came on a Monday for wing night, $0.69/each and this place is a-ok.  The Southern Cajun w/ Sauce, not dry, was quite a tasty sauce for wings.  I cannot comment on any other kind of food.  

Staff consists of really young girls who don't look of drinking age.  Waitress was nice, but I felt as though she came around waaay too often to \"check up\".  Perhaps her shift was ending and she wanted her tips, but it was a bit too intrusive.

We couldn't check out the patio because it had rained, so that was a bit of a letdown.

Restaurant itself has a nice set-up though with high cathedral ceilings and even a level upstairs to chill.

Washroom is all the way in the basement, so if you have a small bladder/planning to drink a lot, I'd recommend you sit on the main level!"}
{"text":"Great patio.  I really enjoyed the vibe here and service was great.  

I had the wings grilled which tasted great but not very spicy even though I got the spicest option.  

Lots of parking at the side and back.  The plaza it's in is a bit confusing but it's actually nice and feels like a small town.  

No tvs outside but they have loungers and tables.  Lots of tvs inside with a big projection"}
{"text":"We went to The Erin Mills Pump & Patio for the first time last weekend. We went on a Sunday evening around 6:30 and had no problem getting a table.

Shortly after being seated by the hostess, we were greeted by our friendly waitress who took our drinks order. 

We took a few minutes to decide what we wanted to eat, but the waitress kindly came back a couple of times to check on us.

We ordered a banquet burger, a gluten-free 'Godfather' pizza and a medium chicken wings. 

Everything came quite quickly after we ordered. All of the food was piping hot when it was delivered.

The banquet burger was delicious and a very generous size. It came with fries, but we decided to sub. a Caesar salad (a $3 surcharge). Although the salad was really tasty, it wasn't worth an extra $3.

The wings were also very tasty and just the right amount of spicy.

The gluten-free pizza tasted good (with a bolognese sauce instead of regular pizza sauce) but the bottom of the crust was completely white and not at all crisp. I ended up taking most of it home and baking it again to make it more crispy.

All in all, the food was pretty good although the prices were fairly high for pub food.  I think we'd probably go back to try some other items, but it wouldn't be one of our regular haunts because of the prices."}
{"text":"Been there about four times but I have to say each time was a disappointment.  I have liked visiting the other two pump locations (pump house grill & clarkson pump) but the food at the airless pump is a lot less portion size and quality compared to the other two. Even though this new location is the closest to my house within walking distance I do not think I would return again"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service.  Terrific place to meet up with friends.  The parking is behind the place and shared with multiple businesses so sometimes it's hard to find a spot close by.  Nonetheless there is ample parking, just may have to walk a bit."}
{"text":"I agree with Mary D. I'm slightly partial because the pump is closeby to where I live- it's comforting to think there's a reliable place to grab a beer and good food within walking distance.

In my opinion the food is a little overpriced for what you get. I definitely would not recommend the nachos. However with that being said, by no means have I exhausted all options on the menu and like many other bars they have daily specials so maybe check those out. 

If you're a fan, they make a great sangria and overall it's a great place to grab some drinks on the patio for lunch or in the evening."}
{"text":"Decent place with a great patio. A bit overpriced for what you get but salads, wings and pizzas were all tasty.  

Been twice now. Will go again."}
