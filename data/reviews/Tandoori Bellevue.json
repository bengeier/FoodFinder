{"text":"The bhindi (okra) was excellently seasoned, well-balanced and the naan was really fresh and buttery. The eggplant was also good, but not as good as the okra!   Le bhindi était excellent, très bien-assaisonné. Tout les épices étaient équilibrés ensemble. Ce repas était mieux, plus exceptionnelle, que l'aubergine, à nos avis. Aussi le naan était frais et bien cuit avec le ghee sur le dessus"}
{"text":"Great food and service, lovely environment, located near the water. We had a delicious dinner at the end of the weekend. Worth the pit stop in Saint Anne de Belleview"}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  One of the best butter chicken I have ever had. Service needs some improvement but acceptable nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Montreal. We've tried several both in the west island and in the city but we always come back to the Tandoori Bellevue.   We've given up on finding anything better in Montreal. When we travel abroad and eat Indian we always think of tandoori Bellevue even on a recent trip to the UK!  Ask for the chicken Saag its not on the menu but they make a great SAAG"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Montreal.   They have excellent food, try the chef's recommendation, they  won't disappoint you. They have the best naan and terrible tandoori chicken....  The first time I went there, I threw up in their bathroom...guess my stomach wasn't made for Indian food: the thin chip-like thing they bring to each table before you order is very stimulating, be careful. I go eat there frequently and bring my friends sometimes."}
{"text":"AMAZING butter chicken and Excellent customer service. PERIOD."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, delicious food. If you want to have Indian food in West Island, this will be the best choice."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Indian restaurant! Cozy atmosphere, They have a great vegetarian/ vegan selection. Everything is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice Indian restaurant for a special occasion supper with my husband, let's face it, most Indian restaurants don't care too much about decor and atmosphere. Tandoori Bellevue was recommended by a friend and I was excited to try it. In a nutshell, it didn't disappoint! The location is beautiful right by the water, and the interior was nicely decorated, well maintained and clean :) We ordered the onion bhaji which I was disappointed by as it was mostly batter with barely any onion and crumbled a lot more than I'd like. The chicken pakora on the other hand was perfect, nice thin batter that was perfectly crisp on the outside with super moist chicken on the inside. The butter chicken was to die for, the chili paneer was good as well. The chicken biryani, although it contained a generous amount of chicken, wasn't that great, the rice was overdone and the amount of different spices overwhelmed the dish. Service was on point, I am removing one star from my review solely due to the bathroom situation, the hand soap was diluted with water and the narrow stairs leading down to the bathroom are tricky to use."}
{"text":"I ordered 10 dishes today from Tandoori Bellevue and once again - it was pure delight. The Lamb Bhuna and Aloo Bhindi geta special mention... delicious! The Lamb Tandoori was to die for..... Best restaurant around...."}
{"text":"I came in for a mid-week lunch. The place was almost entirely empty! Only one couple sitting by the front window, and one friendly waitress. They have a lunch special - a number of main dishes that come with your choice of samosa or pakora, and naan or rice. I went with a chicken curry ($11) with pakora and naan. It was all good! I finished with a chai ($2) so with tax and tip it was over $17 but still probably cheaper than the competing tourist traps on the waterline (minus the waterline atmosphere, but for spicy indian food, air-conditioning is better). It was quite and relaxed. The food was served with a smile in a timely manner. Good find in the west-island!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Loved the biriyani and paneel kahari.  Drinks were decent. Right across lake. Pefrect for me and my husband to go on boardwalk and enjoy the view after dinner.we  were there for long weekend get away."}
{"text":"The beef mantras was not prepared as I have normally have had it over the past years and coconut milk was used. It tasted OK but not to the standard I have been used to there. We could only pay our invoice in cash and had to leave to go to the bank because their transaction machine was not working and was not checked before opening the restraunt. All in All it was only an OK meal and we had to constantly ask for service."}
{"text":"On a beautiful warm November day while shopping in Sainte Anne de Bellevue, decided to try some Indian food.  My friend and I both had the Butter Chicken with Naan and rice.  Absolutely delicious!  As well the fantastic Vegetable Samosa's - could have enjoyed a plateful of them as a whole meal!  Our server was friendly and efficient; when I asked if it was possible to turn down the heat (restaurant was way too warm) she did so right away.  My only negative observation is the location of the washroom.  It is located in the basement; down some very steep steps and the general vicinity does not smell too nice.  Having a bathroom on the main level would be a most welcome improvement - especially for any customers with mobility issues.  I will definitely visit this restaurant again because the food was So Good."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, $10-$15. Always go there when I'm in the mood for Indian and am near Sainte Anne's."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat in Ste-Anne. The food is very good and it is quite comparable to good Indian restaurants in Parc Ex but with better decor. It also comes with a steeper price tag. However, compared to other restaurants in Ste-Anne, it is better priced and a much better value for money.   All of the dishes I have tried so far are delicious. The quality of the sauces/curried is amazing. The garlic naan bread is outstanding. The biryani is excellent. Even the palak paneer was quite good and I don't even like paneer. I think it mostly has to do with the quality of the sauce.   The level of spiciness has been just okay for me, though I find it a little on the mild side. Those who like it really spicy or who are used to having Indian cuisine from out of town will probably want it a bit more spicy. However, the spice level is on par with the majority of Montreal restaurants.   Overall, in my book, this is a very good Indian restaurant as well as a good restaurant in general in the area. It is quite out of the way for me, so I don't think I'd ever come here just for the restaurant, especially considering the price tag (for Indian food), but whenever I'm in the area, this is my first choice."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in town! There butter chicken is to die for, and pairs perfectly with their naan. Tried their lamb briyani for the first time, but that was a little dry for my taste. Definitely worth trying Tandoori if you're in Ste-Anne :)"}
{"text":"Lives in the UK for a few years, this place comes close. The food is decent!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for a very affordable price in a great location.   You can almost miss their doorway if going too quickly, but once inside the ambiance is very friendly and cozy.   My husband is Indian and therefore we regularly consume Indian food. We ordered the veg samosas and the maharaja platter. The papadums were excellent and crispy. Samosa were good but did lack a bit of spice to them.   As part of the maharaja platter we ordered paneer tikka masala, mutton korma, chicken tandoori and chicken curry. The paneer and.mutton were excellent, with the chicken curry being as good as I've tasted in other places. The tandoori chicken was average and the portion on the small side compared to the rest of the meal, but everything else made up for it."}
