{"text":"For a new place in such a small community, it lacks friendliness and basic comfort.  Every time I go in, that blonde woman has an awful fowl look on her face, no manners whatsoever.  I asked her the wifi code politely and she slammed the post it down on the counter.  It's over priced and they're lucky there isn't much else in competition around them."}
{"text":"The food and coffee was pretty good but they only took cash and were not quick to serve when I walked in. Also they were not loyal to their Yelp checkin coupon, saying that it was over...not so great customer service for a new place."}
{"text":"Had brunch today: Parisco omelette with mixed green salad.  Food is good, coffees are excellent. They're still kinda working out the kinks but I'm sure this place will be outstanding once it gets rolling.  They also have a little patio outside with about a dozen tables."}
{"text":"I live in the condo above Parisco Cafe and it is so convenient and delicious. The prices are great and the people who work there are super friendly. The market which is attached to the cafe recently opened and the prices are a little bit steeper but that's to be expected with the convenience of a store in a condo. The food is always fresh and great and I love how they bake everything themselves. Croissants, goat cheese salad, smoked salmon Sammy, omelettes and pasta ai fungi are personal faves. I'm in here at least once a week and will continue to be."}
{"text":"I have been living in the Fort York area for 2-3 years now and always missed having a coffee shop in the neighborhood. PARISCO is not just any coffee shop but one that you feel at home and the staff is warm and friendly. There have delicious freshly baked goods and every meal(bf,lunch n dinner) thats absolutely yummy!  Prices are afforadable and service is great. Best part of it is the owner Martin who always welcomes you with a smile....I would give 5/5 starts for service, food and staff.."}
{"text":"I lived very close to Parisco Cafe and have started coming here often, usually to work on my laptop. The staff is very friendly and the prices are great. It's also a very nice environment. Seating is comfortable, lots of natural light, there are enough outlets, and supposedly there is wifi (I use my own).  The food is also very good, which I'll admit I wasn't expecting. I get the black bean patties, which are vegan, a couple times a week. They are made in-house, served with two kinds of salad, half of avocado, and topped with coconut milk. Most importantly, they are delicious--and conveniently healthy!  Recently, I came for brunch with family and everyone seemed happy with their food. The menu is varied enough that there is something for everyone. I just with they had more vegan options!"}
{"text":"Moved to the area and the place is a convenient walking distance, which is what it's designed for. Had a warmed up soggy quiche and a very tiny cappuccino for about $15, and didn't want to stay long because the chairs (while cool looking) are super uncomfortable and the wrong height for the rest of the furniture. If you're looking for a quick coffee and a baked good I'd swing by, but otherwise it's worth the walk to go someplace else."}
{"text":"I had the grilled salmon sandwich and it was great. The bread was really crunchy which made complimented the contents of the sandwich well. It he salmon and egg were really flavorful. The Caesar salad was solid. Just be ready for the wait if you don't get a croissant. Great breakfast food that will hold you over past average lunch times."}
{"text":"This is a rock solid cafe with great coffee, an outstanding house salad, and great sandwiches. The grilled salmon is so good. I have been coming here every day during the Pan American Games, and have yet to be disappointed. Great food with great customer service!"}
{"text":"I ordered an iced coffee and they gave me hot coffee on ice. By the time I paid for it, the ice was melted and I was left with watered down lukewarm coffee. This place is brutal. Please don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars. Like most of the other reviewers, I live next door and frequent this place out of convenience. Solid food, decent prices. They fall short on service, I can't tell you how many times I've stood at the counter without being acknowledge for what seems like an eternity. I mean, I don't expect service in a snap, but it doesn't take much to tell people that you'll be with them them shortly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch awhile back. Had the croque Monsieur. Was good and very fresh. Good service as well. Only downside was I found it a bit on the pricey side. But hey, what do you expect from Condo Land?"}
{"text":"Hello Everyone that lives in Fort York be aware of this place!!!!!  Cold cheap coffee.  Old rotten smelly pastries..  Very expensive on top.  I live in this neighbourhood and I I have given them 3 chances.. NO MORE.  All 3 visits I was disappointed   They shouldn't be in business.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  Horrible Horrible Horrible"}
{"text":"I was here for brunch yesterday. Great little spot close to home. They were accommodating at substituting different items (my friend wanted Swiss cheese in her omelette instead of Brie). I got a brownie to go and that was delicious too. Just a cute place to get some good cafe food and it helps that it's close to the Watercity Condos."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has a great ambience with friendly people. Both food and coffee are fresh with good price. Can't wait to have breakfast here!"}
{"text":"I live in the building this cafe opened in and we are quite happy it is here. The owners are incredibly warm and welcoming and it is a very cozy and modern atmosphere. They have a lineup of salads, pastries, coffees, panini's and main dishes.   They seem to rotate what they offer which keeps it fresh and each time you come in. Everything I have ordered so far from here has been excellent and hand made. They seem to do it all from scratch which is how I like it!  My last order was a Ricotta Toast with a salad which was quite tasty.   Simple, elegant and tasty dishes. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"It's a nice enough place.  On a weekend they'll ask you for $10 for a sizable omelette with a generous side of garden/ceasar salad or fries.  Pretty good deal if you ask me.  Through the week they offer a selection of pastries and fresh-made sandwiches that vary from meh to marvellous.  Can't say I was enthused about waiting 15 minutes for a coffee without a word of apology or explanation.  Free refills, though.  That big TV hanging on the wall playing reality TV shows is pretty distracting."}
{"text":"Had a couple great omelettes and they made a one off sandwich for my kid. Food prep was slowish but expected as things were being made to order we were the only ones in the place for late breakfast. Good food and service but wouldn't want to be here when it's super busy unless they staff up at these times."}
{"text":"I love the cafe and the market place run by the nicest people and food is always good"}
{"text":"Amazing food at a hidden gem!  My second time here and not only is the food great but the ladies that represent the place are even better!  Extremely pleasant to deal with!  Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to order delivery (which was free because we're in the next building over) one rainy day and enjoyed two paninis with fries. The fries were really good but were very greasy. I got the goat cheese and red pepper one which was surprisingly heavy on the goat cheese. Most places skimp but this was just a bit too far on the other side.  Definitely glad I gave them another chance. Yet to retry their pastries or coffee but our area totally needs a good lunch/takeout spot and I think this is a good fit! Looking forward to enjoying a drink on their patio (another thing the neighbourhood needed)."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated with charm and grace.  Finally a great little cafe,  lunch spot AND attached convenience store in the area!!  :) :) :)   Worth noting that the portions are rock solid and priced reasonably at $8-12 portfolio a meal.   Yay!"}
{"text":"Good little cafe in the neighborhood that does not really have anything else around.  Friendly owners and staff, good food (a little pricey but it is a small business and rent and wages are not cheap these days). If you are a coffee connoisseur you might not enjoy a cup here, otherwise it's a pretty good blend.  Especially would like to point out their omelettes: huge, fluffy and come with an amazing side salad!"}
