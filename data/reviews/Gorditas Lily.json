{"text":"Amazing!! I was blown away with the Carne Deshebrada en Verde Gordita. Super flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. Bean and cheese gordita was really good as well. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Gorditas Lily - wow!  How did we not find you as soon as you opened?

Lunchtime came around yesterday, and we did the usual 'what's for lunch today?' bit - my buddy said, \"Hey, there's a Gorditas place on Cave Creek - looks like where 2 Sisters Thai used to be - only 3 reviews, but they're all good - let's check it out\"

Walked in and checked out the menu...asked the nice young lady working there, \"so, what do I want?\"  She guided me toward the Carne Deshebrada gorditas...I couldn't decide whether I wanted red (Rojo) or green (Verde), so I got one  of each.  

The Rojo was really tasty - great flavor, and with some of the salsa they provided, it was terrific!  The Verde is the spicier of the two - left a nice afterglow on the lips - also really great flavor (and give it some of the salsa, too!)

My buddy got a Verde and the Chile Relleno gordita - from his reaction, I goofed...he said the Chile Relleno gordita was the best new thing he's tried in months.  Shucks...now we have to go back, soon!  :-)

Folks, get over here and pack this place - we want to make sure they're here for a long time - what are you waiting for?  Get in the car.  Drive.  I'll wait...

P.S. Don't let the Pepsi refrigerator behind the counter throw you - they have bottles of Coke  :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped by after getting tamales across the street.   Amazing gorditas.  Spicy flavors and really nice people working there.  Very clean.  Stop by for a tasty treat"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Lily hand makes all tortillas and stews that she generously puts into the gorditas! The veggie options are fantastic.....yummy nopales!"}
{"text":"Notice this place just opened.  Had to stop by and try some gorditas.  Im so glad that I did now I have a place in N Phx to get my Spicy Gordita fix.  Plus they have chicharron!   I will be back."}
{"text":"Gotta start off with the customer service. They are super nice & friendly. They only accept cash, kinda sucks cause we had to go get some. But whatever aha my main thing here was the gorditas... the gorditas de picadillo aren't that great. Its literally ground beef with no type of seasoning and just pico. Every place ive had gorditas de picadillo at its ground beef with potatoes and some type of salsa or seasoning. They where very simple here. The gorditas de chicharon were amazing tho. Loved them! One thing i also saw was that their salsa looked like they just threw a bunch of onions in a little bit of salsa. Wasn't so great either. If i come back its only gunna be for the chicharon. Thats it."}
{"text":"Very authentic, nice and spicy. You can tell the tortillas are hand made. I was sweating pretty good on the green shredded beef stew. Not the greatest location, but worth the extra few minutes drive."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant! 

Small menu but everything is good, friendly people. The chicken mole is HOT. 

Cash only so bring cash."}
