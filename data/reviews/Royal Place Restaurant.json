{"text":"My poor friends paid so much money per head for this disgusting place and rude wait staff. I don't know whats worse, terrible service or this filthy venue. No wonder it is for sale. These people have definitely given up! DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE!"}
{"text":"This is their WING review. I found them on the pIttsburgh wing night and they have all you can eat wings for 7.95!  They are might good too! With that they have out salad and every time I have gone the cook, has made something different from stuffed shells to Swedish meatballs. It is well worth going!"}
{"text":"Go literally anywhere else for an enjoyable night out. The food is unremarkable, the prices are too, don't order any alcohol other than a beer because it will not be made well, the place itself is rundown, and the servers are incredibly rude. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Sorry, I gotten very used to no smoking I public places in Pittsburgh. When a couple sits down and lights up next to me, I'm out of here. Ash trays all over the bar. Yuck!"}
{"text":"We have come here for shows, so I really cannot comment on the food, but the prices look absolutely unbeatable.  I think it was like $6 for a dozen whole wings?!  I will definitely have to come back here and check out the food.  However I was a little surprised that they did not give me free refills?  I paid a cover to come watch a show, I paid $2.50 for a damn coke.. give me a refill!!"}
