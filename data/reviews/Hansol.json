{"text":"From Dallas Texas for the US Fencing Tournaments, and Togo Oder for the lunch here, it was so good food and services.
I took my family for the diner again this place. Good Korean food !"}
{"text":"Last weekend I had visited Cleveland with a few buddies of mine and after a day of traveling, we were  definitely craving some homey Korean food. Living in in the NJ/NY \"K-town\" area, we wanted to check out one of Cleveland's Korean restaurant scenes to compare and quickly found Hansol. We ordered a few bowls of soondae gook,ojinguh (squid) bokkeum, and some Korean BBQ to share. 

I found that the broth of the soondae gook to be deep and savory while not being as oily or greasy as the broths I'm usually accustomed to finding at the Korean restaurants back home. I could taste the \"authenticity\" in the the soup which was impressive.

The ojinguh bokkeum was spicy and wasn't rubbery in texture or flavor and the BBQ was very delicious! The meat was given with a sauce that was AMAZING!!!  It was such a great compliment to the BBQ and tasted even better in the lettuce wraps that came with our meats.  A nice surprise that we received with the BBQ was a complimentary steamed egg omelette which was a nice touch and definitely appreciated (I love my egg omelette).  The one thing that I was hoping for was some garlic to grill. I probably could've asked but was too preoccupied enjoying the rest of the meal. 

I found the menu options and prices to be quite reasonable and was glad to see the variety of dishes (and soju) that was offered.

The staff was very welcoming and friendly and the service was very quick. If ever you're in the area and looking for some quality Korean food, I'd definitely recommend Hansol!"}
{"text":"This review is based on 3 visits to Han Sol. 

FIRST VISIT: very disappointing. It was around 5pm on a Saturday. We ordered kimbap to share. It was tasteless and the rice was old. I had the Soondae gook, it was OK but I'm not sure what meat was in with the Soondae. The banchan were blah and the rice was old, cold and hard. My husband got the stir fried pork, he said it was OK. 

SECOND VISIT: much better! I ordered the yuk gae jang. Great spice, good amount of meat. Delicious! Rice was warm and fresh. Banchan was fresh and varied. They had my favourite banchan, the anchovies. 

THIRD VISIT: Great! I had seol leong tang. It was yummy, but would have liked just a couple more slices of the thinly sliced beef. Rice was warm and fresh again, banchan was varied and good. 

I'm glad I didn't let my first experience of this new place prevent me from giving it another chance. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, good service, nice menu with good options! The tea is awesome!
I highly recommend this restaurant for the ones who really appreciate good Korean food!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious. We ordered pot stickers and the seafood pancake, plus pork belly and beef to grill on the table. Our table was broken, so we had to use an electric grill. It turned out well but wasn't quite as fun as having the open flame grill. I was disappointed bc there weren't as many little banchan dishes as there's used to be served with the old restaurant. All the variety pickled veg, etc are my favorite! Still, our dinner was tasty and the owners were friendly. I like this place and will come back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Hansol a higher rating, Seoul Hot Pot was one of my favorites.  With new owners and a new name, Hansol is ok, but doesn't quite soar.  The layout is the same as it used to be, although they have put up some new wallpaper and decor in the back main dining area; feels a little more decorated I did like the wooden masks.  The menu is similar to the previous one, but it seems like there is less variety to choose from, perhaps because there are a number of items with no English descriptions.  I ended up ordering the S-6 the SengSungJiGae which is the spicy fish stew.

Dinner comes with the barley tea and banchon; the tea is always good, the selection of banchon was a bit more limited usual, and while good, they were not as good as Seoul Hot Pot used to serve.   The fish stew was alright, the broth was spicy, the tofu and vegies were good, but even though they served a good portion of fish, ocean perch may not have been the best choice for the dish, it just didn't seem like the best preparation for the perch and the flavor was out of synch with the rest of the dish.

Service was decent, I do know what Morgan was talking about about missing the love, but that may come with time.

I will probably give Hansol another try, I want it to be better then I experienced.  I was in on Saturday night and the restaurant was very quiet, with me being the only guest there when I left at 8:30pm, hopefully they can pick up business and become what we all want."}
{"text":"I used to go to Seoul Hot Pot many years back, but now that I see that the ownership and name have changed, I decided to check out Hansol. The menu is different from what I remember, and I like that they now have grills for Korean BBQ. The menu is still fairly small, though now they have a variety of different stews to try. I got the DocDoRiTang, JaeYookBokUm, and Haemul Pajeon. The pajeon is fairly standard and there is nothing particularly special about it, though still tasty. The banchan selection was rather small, but tasty nonetheless.

I really liked the DocDoRiTang and JaeYookBokUm though. The DocDoRiTang stew was very tasty, the potatoes were nice and soft, and the chicken was very flavorful. The JaeYookBokUm was spicy, but not to the point of being unbearable. As with many good spicy dishes, it made me crave rice and it went well with the rice that the restaurant served. 

I liked how the restaurant, as with many other Korean restaurants, give you complimentary Yakult for dessert. It's a drink that reminds me of my childhood, and is quite tasty and refreshing. A good way to end a meal."}
{"text":"I went to visit family in Ohio and we wanted to have korean food so we went to Hansol. There was a plethora of options that I could pick from on the menu. When the food came out, it took me by complete surprise. The food was amazing and I could tell that there was love put into it. Definitely recommend the seollongtang and the korean bbq here! 10/10!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. I would say the only I would only REAL Korean food in town. I usually don't give out a review unless it's very good or very bad. In this case is because its excellence!"}
{"text":"Hansol is in the former location of Seoul Hot Pot and is a great addition/continuation for Korean cuisine/BBQ in Cleveland.

Obviously, they must be listening to the reviews since I was greeted with big happy smiles and plenty of guidance in helping me choose my dinner!   I went in by myself and am not an expert on Korean food and so Sharon (my Server) went through all of the side dishes.

I ordered the BiBimBap $10.95 (mixed rice topped with beef, veggies and a fried egg) and Hemoolpajun $7.00 (Seafood pancake w/ green onion) and thought both were delicious!

If you like your rice crispier, order the DolSotBiBimBap and this comes in a hot pot for just a couple dollars more and worth it!

I also tried their Korean German Style Beer and drinks like an imported lager.

For me, service was fantastic and I didn't know the former owners so had no presupposition as to what it was like before...just glad it is here now.

I will definitely go back with friends...great value!"}
{"text":"Went to Hansol for table Korean BBQ. Ordered Kalbi and was told it is made in the kitchen. So I changed my order to a meat dish offered for table BBQ and the server brought out a portable butane grill and placed it directly on top of the gas table grill. It made absolutely no sense why they did not use the table grill. Was very disappointed and likely won't return.  Its sad that there are no Korean restaurants in Cleveland with true table BBQ. I happened to be in Troy Michigan this weekend and found a great Korean BBQ with wood briquet table top Kalbi grilling."}
{"text":"Terrific Kalbi and banchan! Hansol is a cozy little restaurant located in the middle of Clevelands Asian town. They offer Korean BBQ with actual gas grills at your table. Unique dishes not offered at other restaurants like Korean pork hock. Service was very friendly and they had a small but essential  selection of Korean soju to choose from to go with the BBQ. All in all, I would go here again!"}

Our some of our favorites. Though everything we've tried has been authentic (per our trip to Seoul and from living in nyc and sf)"}
{"text":"My first experience (and perhaps last) was very disappointing. First, the service was subpar- the server was indifferent and seemed to drag her feet at our party's (very basic) requests. 

To start, we ordered seafood pancakes (that barely had any seafood in it) and ddeok-bo-ggi as our appetizers. One plate of the pancakes was clearly burnt; additionally, the ddeok-bo-ggi had very soggy vermicelli noodles and a few pieces of beef, which seemed to have somehow ended up in the dish accidentally. 

The ban-chan (complimentary small dishes) consisted of kimchi, spice-seasoned bean sprouts, radish kimchi, and sliced/seasoned seaweed (mi-yeok jool-gi). They came out in such small portions that we had to ask our server for ~4 additional sets (since our party was large of 10).  

We thought the main entrees would get better- we ordered the jae-yook boggeum, bulgogi, dak dohli tang, and oh-jing-uh bokkeum. Generally, the portions were a lot smaller than expected (sort of to the point where you felt bad taking more than a chopstick full). The jae-yook bokkeum had very thinly sliced pork that I'm not used to in this dish (typically, thick cut, hefty pieces). The bulgogi was in literally a thick, viscous flavoring that looked more like syrup/paste(?) and I had no interest in trying this. The most decent dish was the oh-jing-uh bokkeum (squid), which resembled closest to traditional Korean food. 

Worst of all, the rice came out way later than the main entree dishes and, to our disappointment, were burnt (you could smell it while you're eating the rice) or in the cooker for an extended period of time (tasted \"old\").  

Overall, our party was very disappointed in the service and in the quality of the food. I definitely do not recommend this place if you are looking for closest-to-authentic Korean food because this is the farthest experience from it."}
{"text":"This place is largely the same as the restaurant that used to occupy this spot, Seoul Hot Pot... yet at the same time, it sort of isn't. Not much as changed as far as the decor and setup. Even the menu looks startlingly similar with the bright yellow pages decorated with pictures of the dishes. Still though, I have to admit I didn't feel as much of a welcoming vibe when I stopped in here as I did with the old owners. If you never got the chance to visit Seoul Hot Pot, you'll notice the difference immediately. The old owners were incredibly kind and friendly, where as I felt the new owners are perhaps still acclimating. No fault of their's really, but I think it's worth mentioning that this place really didn't have a warm welcoming feel.
As mentioned, the menu is largely the same. They offer most of the standard traditional Korean dishes, most of them scaled down a bit for size, and they also still have the BBQ tables if you fancy a big Korean BBQ. Since I was only here for lunch, I tried out the haemul pajeon (seafood pancake) and soondubu jjigae (soft tofu stew). The pajeon was quite bready, and didn't have a nice crispy outer layer that I love so much. The fillings were pretty generous though, and I do like that they offer a smaller size as opposed to other places that just offer the full size for sharing. The soondubu jjigae was also disappointing, it was barely spicy, and again while packed with tofu and seafood, really was lacking in the complexity of jjigae broth I crave. They do also offer the complimentary corn tea and banchan, pretty standard for most Korean restaurants, nothing special to note here. 
While I'm glad I tried Hansol, I do think it doesn't compare for those that might be accustomed to Seoul Hotpot. I wouldn't discourage people from coming here, but it's definitely not the best Korean that Cleveland has to offer, and I'm eager to see if the atmosphere will improve on further visits."}
