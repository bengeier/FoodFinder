{"text":"What a great find! This cute fast casual restaurant is a healthy alternative and welcomed here to our community. Informative staff and tasty food make for a great choice up in this neck of the woods. Try the spicy humans or the classic Baba G (eggplant) base in either a wrap or a bowl. The lamb is flavorful and fresh veggies are fantastic. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"FRESH!  FRESH!  FRESH! 
Had to try this place after more than a few neighbors recommended it. It certainly didn't disappoint. Simple to order. Choose this, that, and the other, then sprinkle with freshness. I had the spicy hummus with seasonal grilled veggies and most of the toppings they offered.  The more toppings, the more value. 
THEY DON'T NICKEL AND DIME. 
Chicken and lamb were delicious too as my family opted for it!"}
{"text":"This is a great new Mediterranean Cafe. Everything is fresh and tasty. The staff was very courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"Love the concept. The food is great. Fantastic quick healthy option. Had the bowl with the spicy hummus. Toppings and sauces are delicious as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Concept and potential is good, what bothered me the most, we took a bowl with lamb to share for the first time to try, it looked to me as the meat portion was very small so I asked if possible to add a little meat so he did just that, added a little meat, when I got the check saw we were charged an extra $4 for this addition without notifying us in advance for that!? All he needed to say it is an additional $4 if you want a little more meat, I would think if I want it or not (I am talking about smaller then a spoon size portion!)"}
{"text":"I originally tried this restaurant yesterday and was so blown away by the flavors and freshness that I came back again today. The way I would describe this place is it's sort of a Mediterranean twist on a chipotle or make your own pizza place. You are greater as soon as you walk through the door and the atmosphere is very modern yet comfortable. You start off choosing between a bowl or a wrap and from there the possibilities are endless. They have 4 types of hummus, I'd recommend the spicy one, lots of meat, veggie, and even a fried cheese option. All the food is fresh and the owner even showed me that they don't even have a freezer on the premises. All the food I have tried is amazing and I will definitely be coming back a lot. I would recommend this restaurant to any person looking for fresh, healthy, Mediterranean food that gives you many options to make it your own."}
{"text":"Great little place! Fresh food and friendly service. The staff is very pleasant and helpful. All ingredients are fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Yup they deserve a FIVE STAR rating for a reason EVERYTHING I ate and drank was delicious, I'm really impressed, all the ingredients were fresh I hope they can keep it up! I'll be back soon! The wrap was the shit lol"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch finally. OMG. So good. Everything is home made and you build your own bowl or pita. Several varieties of hummus and sauces. Numerous protein choices Vegan, vegetarian and carnivore. Something for everyone
Best falafel in the area 
I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Come for the halloumi cheese...  stay for the peanut butter & chocolate hummus dessert!  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in town. The food is fresh, delicious, and has lots of options that are unique and different. The atmosphere and setup are great. I would recommend to check this place out!"}
{"text":"BOMB! Great concept and friendly and knowledgeable staff! Place for everyone....vegan....vegetarian....carnivores..perfect for all groups! Can't miss with this place"}
{"text":"This is my favorite new place! Fresh, healthy and delicious. With all my new dietary needs this is my go to spot! They have it all for vegans, gf, and meat eaters alike! No discrimination here. Hummus is a must try!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go get something fast and healthy!! They have the BEST service, so friendly! I've been like 10 times and will keep going back! Everything is so fresh and yummy!! I highly recommend hummus and hope they keep their prices the same even if they get super popular."}
{"text":"First time eating here...great tasting food. Had a vegetable bowl with the cucumber yogurt sauce. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is absolutely amazing!  All the food is so fresh and the flavors explode.  The combinations are phenomenal and creative.  Great for vegans, vegetarians and omnivores alike.  The owner is working the front line and so friendly.  The atmosphere is trendy and comfortable and just a perfect combination of all the things.  Yay!!!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken hummus bowl with the black lentils was fantastic. Food and service is amazing. Only thing preventing a 5 star review is the weird soda machine, the cherry soda was the worst cherry soda I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is Ah.maz.ing. Sooo good. As a vegan, I don't think I've ever gone to a restaurant with carry out and been so satisfied.  I absolutely love it. The spices, heartiness, presentation and *of course* the hummus are all wonderful."}
{"text":"Place is incredible! Fresh food made everyday. Amazing service, Chaz was the man and helped us with our first time ordering. Definitely will come back. Great food!!"}
{"text":"If you read other reviews they will tell you how healthy and delicious the food is. The hummus and baba ganoush are to die for. Even the toppings are good. Make whatever you like!  The bowl I whipped together was so good I would come back again. 
The disappointing thing was the portion size for the rice and the protein. I am not expecting a heaping portion like they give you at chipotle (since the making a bowl concept is similar).  But I do expect a portion that is larger than a few bites. When my bf got the lamb, he was given MAYBE 3 bites worth. That just seems cheap on HUMMUS's end considering you are already paying 9-something for the lamb bowl (this is before paying for an extra serving of protein). As for the rice, it was sprinkled onto the spinach. Sprinkled.  A good serving size of rice for dinner is a cup and what I got was half that. 
The food here is delicious but all that go in should not be afraid of asking for extra with such low portion sizes."}
{"text":"A lot of flavors going on here. A small Chipotle /Zaba style place where you build your own  wrap  or bowl but with middle eastern style fare. Really tasty and reasonable."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day and it was so good, but it's so far from where my friends and I live. I'm definitely coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Hummus had excellent service and the food was amazing! They have an array of selections and a great vegan selection. The falafels are delicious and the different types of hummus and sauces they offer are amazing too. There is not a thing I would not get (except for the animal products because I am vegan; however, that makes it the perfect place to go with a non-vegan). This place is the mediterranean chipotle, but 100x better. They locally source their ingredients and have a wonderful company model. Love this place! 10/10"}
{"text":"Delish! Familiar concept. Build a bowl or wrap. Great Mediterranean style ingredients, too numerous to list. Everything prepared in house. Vegetarians, Vegans and Meat eaters will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"First time here, and it doesn't disappoint!  Decor is awesome-in fact, looks like Fixer Upper came to visit!  Shiplap and subway tile, along with distressed wood tables and iron chairs, is just adorable. A projector with silenced B&W film right onto the shiplap wall is a great touch!

We both got hummus bowls, his lamb and mine veggie. All ingredients super-fresh, non-GMO. The garlic sauce is perfect. Kudos for the Stubborn soda option-I got Black Cherry, but the Vanilla Agave is also great.  I'm going to have to order this online. 

Overall, a great find-don't pass it by!"}
{"text":"Went there to pick up to go dinner and was so happy with the whole experience. The staff were super friendly and explained all the options and let me sample stuff before putting it into my bowl. I was so happy to find a place that I can buy dinner for my other half and I. I was able to get a vegan bowl and also a steak wrap for my love with plenty of options in both parts. Super impressed and the food was beyond delicious."}
{"text":"Well, it looks like I didn't need to leave a 5* review because they have plenty! I didn't expect much from this place since it looked super plain from the outside...but YUM! Really unique, delicious options for my Hummus bowl. And I also loved the options for beverages (watermelon juice, for example) Cute, inviting atmosphere as well. I love it when eating healthy is this delicious! Oh...and thank you for being environmentally friendly with the paper bowls as opposed to plastic."}
{"text":"Another positive review here is almost gratuitous but I have to pay homage to the best fast casual place I've ever been. 

Everything is fresh, filled with bright flavors-- I actually know because my always-maximizing Chinese mum literally asked for every topping they had and they generously doled out a fat spoonful of each without hesitation. And the flavors are so well curated that even that monstrous hodgepodge she got tasted delicious. 

My family was skeptical and complain-y when I made them drive 25 minutes for a hummus place but by the time we left they were already happily talking about what they'd get next time we came. Trust me, they are VERY grudging with their acknowledgement of error.

If you haven't tried halloumi yet, do it here. It's made to order, golden and crispy on the outside. The braised lamb is excellent too."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. It's so so so good! The only downside was that the girl that served us rolled her eyes at my mom and didn't ask me what salad and hummus I want, just assumed. I can't lower the rating based on the actions of one employee but it was kind of the whoa moment of my day:/"}
{"text":"Amazing! Ordering is similar to Chipotle, but the food is much better. Great staff and the super-nice owner even stopped by our table to introduce himself. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous experience fabulous food friendly staff, very fresh!!good value highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great service! Great unlimited options! I typically do not like Falafel. However, they put theirs in a pan instead of the oven. Very inexpensive for what you are getting!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere in this place the food is very healthy and delicious it is a fantastic alternative to unhealthy fast food.  This is the Mediterranean diet!"}
{"text":"HUMMUS caught my eyes on Yelp with its 5 stars reviews and colourful pictures. It was my first time eating at a place like HUMMUS so I didn't know what to expect. The staff was very helpful even though instructions were right on the board in front of me. I loved how they had so many options to choose from, right from the the kind of hummus to the sauce at the end. I chose mine in a bowl starting with spicy hummus, with a mix of all four greens, half rice and half black lentils, with flame grilled chicken, and herb tahini sauce and hot chilli harissa. The toppings I chose were red beet, sunflower seeds, cucumber, and quinoa. 

Portion was generous and I was very full at the end. I enjoyed the nice kick from the spicy hummus and the hot chilli harissa, it definitely made me wanting more. The flame grilled chicken was just delicious, it was flavourful and it wasn't too dry. All ingredients worked perfectly with one another, I had no complaints except how delicious it was! I felt so satisfied after the meal knowing all ingredients were fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"Owner is passionate and takes pride in serving fresh food. It's always clean, always fresh and the service is wonderful. The prices are unbelievable. I come a couple times a week. Delicious! Favorite new restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Not only is this place new, but man it lives up to its 5 star yelp review! 
Every experience here has been quick, tasty, and pleasant. 
You can get a pita or a bowl. You then choose your hummus, grain (rice / lentil),  protein (chicken, veggies, lamb, steak, beef), then off to toppings and sauces. The garlic sauce is a little too much for me but the tzatziki sauce is wonderful. It's roughly $10 for a bowl. 
The atmosphere is a little hipster, but cute. it's well lit, friendly atmosphere with music playing. It tends to get pretty busy around lunch hours so seating can be limited."}
{"text":"I saw the perfect five star ratings on Yelp and read the rave reviews on social media, yet I was still hesitant about trying another overly hyped-up \"healthy\" Mediterranean restaurant/cafe. It's rare that I leave a place feeling overwhelmed with contentment because of an exceptional experience, however that's what happened tonight. Unmatched service and fresh yummy food, it's no wonder I walked out with a smile from ear to ear. 

It may be time I get a second job, to pay for my new HUMMUS addiction. Thanks a lot guys."}
{"text":"Unreal place to eat and great service. It's the freshest food in Las Vegas and you can't beat the pricing. We have already eaten here 4 times."}
{"text":"Loved it! This will be my go to place. Ordered a chicken bowl. Lots a toppings to choose from. Loved their sauces. Healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"If you can find the place, you'll love it. Great variety of fresh and delicious ingredients for reasonable prices. Because of the mix of proteins and toppings, you could eat here regularly and never repeat your meal. Loved it and will be back."}
{"text":"Discovered this little place today! They have vegan/vegetarian and gluten free options! Everything is made fresh and you can sample everything, and they do a great job explaining everything. Great little gem! Lots of food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and great atmosphere!! Najeeb and his staff are very friendly and oriented about the food and the flavor. We loved it"}
{"text":"Hidden gym... 

I love how fresh everything is here. I ordered a bowl with the eggplant hummus and grilled chicken. The eggplant hummus was so good! I got a mixture of greens and rice and quinoa. The garlic sauce was on point too!"}
{"text":"Hummus is an easy choice for any meal. It's healthy, tasty, and has fast and friendly service. It's been a go-to place for us for the last few months and we're happy to have them so close by."}
{"text":"I have to say it right off the bat. I only leave reviews if a place is outstanding or horrible. This place is MIND BLOWING! I really though I wouldn't like it but each and everything there has so much flavor. This has got to be one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas. I am a foodie for sure so this was a really pleasant surprise to finally have a great place here in Vegas. You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now, I work across the street.   I finally decided to walk across the street and pick up lunch.  I got a build your own bowl with babaganoush, spinach, arugula, and chard, rice,lentils, chicken, and a mixture of sauteed vegetables garlic butter, tzatziki sauce.  It was enough for two people and it was so good.  I will be walking there again soon to pickup lunch again."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tastes fresh. I had a lamb bowl with baba ganoush base and a bunch of toppings. Everything was good... So good! The ingredients seem so simple, and I am so amazed with the flavors. The haloumi hash is also a must try. I'll be a frequent flyer her for sure. Oh, and the drink options are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Omg!! It was my first time here and It was amazing, so sad my stomach is small, otherwise I would ate it all. 
creative, delicious food, and service awesome. Only thing is the music was little bit too loud but it was good choice.

The deco is great, the wall with the white and black videos gave the place a good ambiance and the paintings ( less is more )

Competitive prices 

We will be back S O O N!!!! ~ wishing you guys the best always 

The bowl is colorful and only good food, no regrets eating here, is all natural- even the drinks!!!

We needed something like this"}
{"text":"Not the best location to find.  This place is located on the back side of a commercial area, but make a trip there because the foods is delicious, and the price is right.  I would describe it like a Mediterranean chipotle with more unique delicious options.  I will be going back to try more.  The bubaG with falafel was solid, but my favorite was the spicy hummus with the roasted veggies(so good), and remember to get some garlic with Tahini dressing along with the pickled vegetables.  I'm glad I went, and I see why it gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Everything from the food to the music is quality. The ingredients are fresh and you can taste it. Hummus doesn't taste the same after you refrigerate it overnight. The Hummus here is FRESH. Try the TzatZiki and the Shredded Lamb!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! So yummy! I live in Summerlin but always find reason to go to Henderson so I could have lunch here!"}
{"text":"OUT OF THIS WORLD! 

Their ingredients are fresh and delicious, also not to mention beautiful in color! My bowl came out picture perfect. 

Not only was it beautiful in a photo, but my tummy was so happy with the amount of food and the ingredients, it's telling me to go back for more. 

In all seriousness, I could eat this daily. 

Plus, it's adorable inside. They were playing old black and white films on the wall. HOW CUTE! 

You'll fall in love too, I swear. Go get em' tiger"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The decor is bright and fresh feeling.  
I stopped in for lunch solo.  It is healthy and quick.  I chose a bowl - other choice is a wrap.  There are so many options that it is easy to fill your bowl with yummy items that specifically meet your dietary needs!  Everything tasted so fresh!  This is one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, after work, for the first time after a few recommendations from co-workers. Hummus is located to the back of the building where Pho Mai Lan is located. I was confused for a second when my GPS directed me to the front and decided to circle around to see if it may be on the side or something. Mildly hidden but not that hard as long as you are in the right area

Many have called Hummus a \"Mediterranean Chipotle\". Fairly correct in a sense but I feel like Hummus is more complicated XD more to pick and choose from . 

1. Start by picking \"Hum Bowl\" or \"Pita Wrap\". 
2. Pick your hummus: Choice of classic, spicy, market (bean free), or BabaG (Baba ghanoush - eggplant)
3. Choose Greens: Romaine, Baby Chard, Baby Spinach, Baby Kale, or I had the choice of arugula too ! 
4: Add Grains: Herbed rice or black lentils 
5: Pick the Protein: Flame Grilled Chicken, Flame Grilled Beef, Braised Lamb, Vegan Falafel, Crispy Halloumi Cheese, Seasonal Roasted Veggies
6. Choose Toppings: Topping variety was wide (I don't remember them all). Choices include pickled onions, a seasoned and plain quinoa, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, ..... yeah I don't remember that many.. there were some sort of pickles, some mixed salad thing with lemon juice, etc
7. Pick your sauce: Garlic Sauce, Mint Tzatziki, Herb Tahini, Muhammara, Hot Chili harissa, House Dressing

I had picked a hummus bowl w/ spicy hummus. They spread the hummus around the bowl so you get some during every bite?? Lol A mix of baby spinach and arugula was really good, topped with herbed rice. Friend's had all preferred chicken but I do plan on trying the beef and lamb at some point as well. I picked a good amount of toppings including pickled onions, feta cheese, seasoned quinoa, cherry tomatoes, salad thing w/ lemon juice... I was hoping to get some spice from the hot chili harissa but it wasn't as spicy as I hoped. Or remotely spicy (for my anyway). Harissa is a type of African chili paste that's fairly known to be quite spicy but their version is really mild. Mixed with garlic sauce and tzatziki was a good way to go. 

After I got home, I mixed everything together before I ate it, or at least to the best of my ability.... maybe I should take have more of a chipotle mindset and just shake it in the bowl. Lol Overall, its like eating a chipotle bowl but it was mildly more difficult because of the greens. Flavor wise, there were a lot of bright flavors (from the pickled onions to the lemon juice salad thing...) cutting through the creaminess of the sauces and what not xD Chicken was pretty similar to chipotle actually. Cube bite size dark meat chicken. The harissa and garlic sauce is fairly thick but tzatziki was much thinner. Good amount of food for the price. All this for $8.55. Almost seems cheaper and theoretically healthier than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Loved the bowl with fresh, healthy, and delicious ingredients. Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"This is like a delicious Mediterranean version of chipotle (not the actual taste of the food, but the way you order). The service was great and the employees were extremely helpful. Definitely worth a try. I hope this place expands and sticks around (they just opened two months ago)."}
{"text":"Such a gem! Tucked away in a nondescript shopping center, this place is amazing! There are so many options for add ins that the customization options are seemingly endless. I opted for a bowl with spicy hummus, lamb, and about six other add ins. It was an explosion of flavor in my mouth and very filling. Staff was friendly, the restaurant is clean, and service was quick. I highly recommend this place to anyone. I am definitely coming back here to eat next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Mere words don't express how delicious my hummus salad/bowl was. Let's just say the entire bag of food didn't make it on the car ride home. I had to dig in! I have been wanting to try this place since Vegansbaby first posted from there on instagram last month. Well I live in Summerlin and finally made it over and am so glad I did. I got 2 huge bowls of goodness including roasted veggies, baba ganoush, fresh falafels, pomegranate seeds, lentils, tabouli, cubes, tomatoes, etc. etc. etc. Ingredients never ended! Fresh and delicious flavors and so inexpensive. Very friendly service also. No pretentious nonsense. I hope you are so successful and get a location in Summerlin soon!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and I'm super glad we came! Service was amazing and the food was even better. I don't know another place with this concept. Its like a Mediterranean Chipotle. Definitely will be back! Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I rarely do reviews but this place is so good, I feel I have to.  The best way to describe Hummus is a  Mediterranean Chipotle.  

Pick what style of food you want (wrap or bowl), choose your protein, then add all veg and extras you want (don't forget to add some crunchy chickpeas!)

Remember it's not just for meat eaters.  Hummus is vegetarian and vegan friendly with so many choices. 

The only downside is that there aren't more locations!"}
{"text":"Just amazing! Couldn't ask for more. Very friendly and great service. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm still eating lunch and I can't wait to come here again. Fast and friendly customer service. Very clean. And, what's most important, the food is great. All the food is fresh and clean. This is how real food is supposed to taste. Thank you for the vegetarian options."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for those that want to eat something super quick, super healthy, and super fresh. Everything tastes amazing and it was a perfect post workout meal. And the service is top notch! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best HUMMUS in the valley! Extremely cool restaurant idea: chipotle-style Mediterranean bowls and wraps. Everything is made fresh, and tastes incredible! My husband is a vegan and has a ton of options here as well. Try the falafel, they cook it when you order, and it. is. TO DIE FOR! Restaurant owner is wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy and refreshing! Bowls and wraps. We are visiting and happened to stumble upon this place. Everything was fresh tasting and it was such a treat. Recommend to anyone that likes healthy treats!"}
{"text":"Very innovative menu items, liked the chipotle style bowl/wrap system. Taste is very good and service is exceptional. Hope to see they growing a lot bigger and open multiple locations.."}
{"text":"So incredibly delicious and filling and wonderful. Have been here multiple times. Everyone is very friendly and helps you to create an excellent meal. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Healthy and satisfying. Excellent preparation and high quality ingredients. Customizable and generous."}
{"text":"We we're in a rush and yelp came to the rescue we saw this was almost 5 stars and pictures looked amazing. It is hidden in a back building with a lot of parking at night, not so much during the day. I love that they are a already cooked and build your own type of meal. They had so many healthy options to chose from. The thing I liked the most about HUMMUS is their mix ins and options of sauces. The best part of the meal was their pita chips, it's like nothing I've ever tasted. I always crave the pita chips, it pairs so well with their bowls. We try to come every other Sunday because it is that GOOD."}
{"text":"So tasty and so healthy, think Chipotle style Mediterranean, but much better and healthier."}
{"text":"Why would you go to fast food when you could be eating here!?!?!!   Delish and healthy -not your typical anything!!   I had a yummy pita wrap with real lamb and roasted veggies OMG!!  Just do this!!!!"}
{"text":"All of the five star reviews on here are not without merit. 

I had the spicy shredded beef bowl, which was perfectly flavored. 

All of the toppings were also tasty and fresh. 

The selection of fountain drinks was also on point. 

Definitely a must."}
{"text":"Update: Still love this place but I have to mention this... one of the guys serving food on Sunday 4/8 is doing so with Apple Air Pods in his ears. I also LOVE my Air Pods but come on you are serving customers! Wake up call, owners. This does not send a good message to customers. 


Got dinner here tonight for the first time and was absolutely blown away! I'm a huge fan of the fast casual build-your-own concepts and this one doesn't disappoint. Flavors were amazing and there was a ride range of toppings to keep it interesting. The concept of the brand and a menu tour were done to perfection by the guy up front.

Some suggestions to make it even better: 1) Find a way to label the toppings. Some were obvious what they were, but most it was hard to tell. I felt guilty asking about each one. I can imagine that it could potentially hold up the line when the restaurant is very busy. 2) Add something SPICY. The Spicy Hummus and Harissa weren't kicking enough for me.

I'll be back TOMORROW!"}
{"text":"Really confused by these ratings. Individually everything I'm sure tastes great but with that many ingredients honestly it becomes one big mixture of food and you no longer taste individual taste of each item in the bowl. He first couple bites you can taste things but after a while it all tastes the same which is disappointing considering each topping probably tasted good on it's own. I'm probably just not a fan of this all you can top it with type of food. There are so many great choices here to add to your bowl. I absolutely love the concept and this is my favorite type of food as well so I thought what could go wrong? Customer service was great and he even asked how I liked the food afterwards. 

Well what went wrong then? I was stuck in the bathroom for hours afterwards. I'm not sure if it was food poisoning or just ate something bad there, but either way I did not enjoy the feeling after eating there. Not good at all. 

The 2 stars are for the concept and the customer service but minus a few stars for the toilet issue and the mixture of food."}
{"text":"Great service and healthy eat! Staff gave us a quick introduction of the menu. Good to hear that everything is made fresh and non-GMO, and some items are vegan. I got the spicy hummus, half rice half lentils, half steaks half roasted veggies, and various toppings. I could not finish my bowl. Portion is huge, and it is fulfilling. I was not impressed with the steaks (a bit chewy and was bland), but it went well with everything else. The roasted veggies option (to replace protein) was delicious. That and the halved cherry tomato topping were the highlights. 
Good for lunch and dinner. I feel full, but not stuffed or gross out."}
{"text":"Too bad I live in another state or I'd be here everyday. Please open another location in La Quinta CA. What I love about this place is the many choices, varieties, and ability to change it up every time you come here. I like to line my bowl with Baba ganoush and then I ask for all the varieties of greens. Their chicken is incredibly moist or you can choose grilled vegetables, beef, or lamb. 

There are so many different toppings to choose from, and even sauces that for  me it would be impossible to exhaust all the possible combinations. 

If you have dietary restrictions it is very easy to customize your meal here. Healthy yummy food.  I can't wait to go back.  Upbeat energetic staff and clean environment make this my new fast food fav."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly service. Lots of poke places all over, so it's nice to see a Mediterranean restaurant that is adopting the fresh / make your own dish style."}
{"text":"What's not to love.  Really impressed with their selection of fresh ingredients. When I first came one of the trays was empty but after I asked if there was any more greens, the employee pointed out owners who were in the back in the process of cutting up more greens. Yes! I liked that, especially it was late evening already, and I was not getting something that's been sitting there all day. They have choice of lentils or herb rice. Love the sauces. My go-to is the \"house fave\" Garlic sauce.  The employee was really helpful and offered to let me try all of them before I decided. Thank you!! 

Customize your bowl or wrap. The DIY process is easy as 123. Just read and follow the directions people. You cant go wrong. All the veggies and sauces complement each other.  TIP: the more colorful, the more delicious, not only visually appealing but tastier too.

Love also how they remodeled the space with a more fresh and modern look. The projection screen is pretty cool touch. 

Prices are reasonable enough for having your daily lunch fix here.

The space the current restaurant is in has gone over many turnovers through the years, I have a feeling though this place will be here to stay for a while!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm, my bowl was packed with so much goodness I don't know where to start. Service was great, the kids up front seemed very excited about all the fresh ingredients. They made sure to mention they don't carry a freezer and everything is chopped and cooked fresh daily. The kid assembling my bowl was getting so excited by my choosing of toppings, I thought he was gonna eat it himself. Lots of topping options and sauce options which is always a plus in my book! The price point I thought was very reasonable considering everything you're getting and the quality of ingredients. The staff was very knowledge as well about different flavor profiles and what ingredients exactly go into the different sauces and dips! 5 stars from me, thank you HUMMUS for the wonderful meal"}
{"text":"I was wowed by this place! I walked in without any expectations and waaala ;-) I may be a bit bias because Mediterranean is one of my most favorite cuisines. 

I was immediately impressed by how fresh everything was. I ordered a bowl with regular hummus, chicken, rice, lentils, pickled onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, quinoa...and a few other fresh items with garlic sauce. I had no idea how it would turn out or what veggies would taste well with what...but, I was truly amazed!!! Only reason I took one star off because chicken was a little dry. 

The resturant was very clean and the staff was friendly. They give you free taste test as well. 

I really enjoyed it!! Especially since I'm trying to eat healthy and stay away from processed foods."}
{"text":"Really good food, fresh ingredients. The employee there was so helpful and thorough. He made it really easy for us as vegans by explaining all the ingredients, what were in the sauces and how things were made. He told us that nothing was frozen, everything was made fresh and the food was delicious. I will definitely be coming back more often as they are very vegan friendly, healthy and decently priced."}
{"text":"Some people talk about a hidden gem. This is really really hidden. This restaurant is located on the backside of the parking lot that it shares with Lee's Liquor and Egg Works. Even knowing its there, it is still easy to just drive by. I guess the silver lining to that location is that there is little problem finding parking.
When we walked in, we were greeted by three very friendly staff. Hearing we were first timers, we got an intro mini-speech about the restaurant. The big take home is everything is super fresh - no freezer here. You place your order at the counter \"Chipotle-style\". First decision - bowl or wrap. Then which hummus to go with. I went spicy (yes, it is very spicy for the Gringo palate). Then pick a green, then a protein (chicken, beef, lamb, vegan, cheese or veggie). Then you add in the toppings - way too many to list here. Finally, choose a sauce. I went with the herb tahini. When I go back, I will ask them to go light on the sauce. There are so many wonderful flavors in the bowl, it really doesn't need any sauce so it's a pity to mask them with tahini sauce (which was quite good). Dinner for 2 for about $15. Huge portions, more than I could finish. And delish!
We also got to taste their house made chocolate peanut butter hummus. Sorta like healthy Nutella. Too full to buy some tonight but we will back and take some home for a dessert."}
{"text":"Wow!! Super great salad and the customer service was excellent. Don't be fooled by the name, I'm not a hummus fan and was able to get a healthy, delicious salad or wrap with fresh gridded chicken. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing. Clean, friendly service, awesome food, great atmosphere. Generous portions, too, glad I came hungry. I got a wrap with falafel as the main and a bunch of fixings, the pita fries and the currant thyme juice. Everything was so fresh, and the garlic sauce was so delicious (but definitely needed a FEW mints after - totally worth it)!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Cute hangout with super friendly staff and a great selection of hummus, meat, and toppings to make a delicious hummus bowl or wrap. The selection of dressings was a little intimating so we let our server mix us up something that he liked. It was a perfect blend. We weren't sure what we would find there but followed the Yelp recommendations and weren't disappointed. Loved the beverage selections too. Pita fries are a must! Even ended up adding dessert hummus, which is delicious! Worth the 20 minute drive. They'll be seeing us again."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place as we waited for some work on our car. We saw the sign on the centre's pillar and searched out the restaurant. It's hidden so not visible from the road. The lack of visibility is a shame because this has to be the best build your own concept we have found. We are both trying to eat healthier and this place certainly helps. Nice fresh food and we knew we had eaten with no processed after tastes which you get at other similar restaurants. You have to try this place trust me you will return and the value for money us excellent."}
{"text":"We love this place. Awesome healthy food at a good price. Do not go here, because I do not want to wait in line behind you"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I got the bowl with chard and spinach leaves, spicy hummus, lentils, roasted veggies,topped with mint, pomegranate, pickled onions, cucumbers, roasted chickpeas and sunflower seeds to name a few. I also got the black currant sage juice. They have watermelon juice as well as cucumber. I tried all three and was shocked that I loved the black currant Sage juice. I also got the falafel fries. You must try them! My total price came out to $12.95. I did tip as well so it came out to more than that. But that's what I paid for food and drink. By the way, today's date is October 4, 2017. This way you can gauge the price by the date."}
{"text":"Hummus is yummus- both the chickpea spread itself and this particular new restaurant! I live clear across town and am actively looking for opportunities to come by more often. What has me so impressed? 

The quality is a huge factor- non-GMO and organic when possible, a large variety of textures and herbs, everything from sauces to spreads made in-house daily, and everything so fresh they don't even have a freezer. Not only is everything delicious, but add in their stellar service, Stubborn sodas, house teas, and movie wall decor? I can't NOT love this place. 

I started with a bowl- the classic hummus and baba are both good picks for your base, combine your greens however you wish, pick or combine lentils and herbed rice for your carbs, and you're already looking at a hefty portion before you get to the protein and toppings! Their falafel is vegan perfection, but they also have seasonal veggies as another option. Carnivores have a huge variety and the lamb will be my next pick. Then go hog-wild with colorful and textually diverse toppings from herbed feta to cherry tomatoes, marinated onions, fresh mint, pomegranate seeds, and roasted chickpeas. If that's not enough flavor for you, add sauce- the harissa has a nice savory heat and the tzatziki is nicely cooling  but the classic garlic is my fave. 

Next time I'll probably try a wrap, but now that I know how good they are, I'll likely be loading up and taking multiple meals- at under $10/order for a giant portion, why wouldn't you?"}
{"text":"We heard about this new Lebanese restaurant, and we had to try it. From when we first walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the decor, and everything felt super clean. It's a chipotle style kinda restaurant where you pick and choose what you want. I ordered the falafel sandwich and my vegan wife got the falafel bowl. They don't cook the falafels till after you place your order which preserves the freshness. The spinach and artichoke hummus is amazing and it's a must to try. Overall the food was fresh and tastes very authentic. Najib the owner is very friendly and passionate about his restaurant. He even threw in some free delicious pita fries with our meals. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Extremely well priced. Healthy food at a good price is hard to come by."}
{"text":"I stopped by randomly looking for something healthy to eat, the line was kind of long because it was lunch time. But worth the wait. The guy in the back, I'm assuming he was the owner was extremely friendly and explained how it all worked. He was great. The food was great. I will be back. I always enjoy when people take the extra time to be extra friendly. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great plce to grab quick bite, fresh food, modernized new way of service healthy food, enjoyed every bite. Sure will be coming back"}
{"text":"It's a build -your -own healthy Mediterranean style cafe...I like it! 
Upon entering this cute little eatery I see it's decorated nicely (less is more), and is very clean and bright inside. You basically build your meal like a Chipotle or Qdoba. The girl at the counter was very helpful
and walked me through how it works and explained all the options. 
You can choose hummus, baba Ganoush, or some other purée type thing for your bottom layer. Other options include rice, lentils, various greens, tom, cuc, olives, pickled onion, etc. Toppings include sunflower seeds, roasted chickpeas, and crumbled pita chips. 
Since it was my first time I tried a little of everything. My protein was the falafel.
Not extremely authentic flavors, but at least they were fresh and good quality. And to have the option of these flavors instead of another build your own taco or burrito place is a welcome thing! 
My total along with a drink (currant thyme juice mixed w the cucumber blossom-yumm!) was $11. Very reasonable. 
Giving this 4 stars for being fresh, being innovative & having a different option when hungry for something quick, and for the great service I received."}
{"text":"This place definitely exceeding my expectations. I was looking for a healthy delicious meal with my friend while shopping and found this place on yelp just up the street. I had the falafel bowl with the classic hummus and a bunch of toppings. I will be back to see what other great combos I can put together."}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful and patient staff... but most of all, the food was phenomenal!  What a great idea and healthy too!  Also, it doesn't break the bank.  Love the old movies projected onto the wooden wall.    Nice touch... Kudos!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!  I moved to Henderson from California and was so worried I wouldn't find a place that had good garlic sauce.  I was super impressed with the Garlic Sauce, the friendly staff and the delicious drinks!!!! Also the assortment of olives and sides were out of this world!!"}
{"text":"So yummy! The meat and veggies were fresh and the girl at the counter was super helpful at explaining what everything was. Great place to grab a quick and healthy lunch"}
{"text":"Fresh food, good flavors, friendly staff.

What more could you want? Ease of ordering for those not as familiar with Mediterranean food.

On their chalkboard they walk you through the ordering process, and the staff helps you out as well. The chalkboard and staff direction work great until you get to the unlimited toppings. There are so many that they don't have space to list them.  This can lead to other guests holding up the line while asking what each item is. They could help this by labeling their items. 

I will be back again. They do have a solid concept, and I left full and happy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a wonderfully welcome addition to the culinary landscape of the area.  Healthy, fresh, vegan, gluten free options that don't taste like cardboard? Count me in.  The name had me thrown, because I initially expected the offerings to be limited to differently flavored hummus's.  I was wrong.  This menu is like a journey for your mouth, as you build your own custom wrap or bowl.  Black lentils, savory chicken, falafel, tabouli, tzatziki, all of the flavors combine into a gorgeous creation that feels both trendy and classic.  

The assembly line staff were efficient and friendly to even the most novice customers, helping them along their journey.  If you are into food, and you prefer your food to be fresh and lovingly prepared, HUMMUS is your next spot. Trust me!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean salads in Henderson. Love their menu and is great value for money. We liked their unique juices as well."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for lunch couple days ago.  Forgot to yelp it. This place is legit. Will be back for the tasty food and fantastic service. I know Mediterranean food as I am middle eastern and this food meet and exceeded from a taste and quality perspective!!! Thanks y'all for making our lunch a good experience see ya soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome find  from yelp.  Great concept. Make your own hummus bowl or wrap with fresh ingredients. So many options. You get a lot for the price reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is great. I got a wrap with spicy humus, spinach, lentil/rice blend, cherry tomatoes, olives and the steak. It was very tasty and so full could not be wrapped, lol. I live close by so I will be coming back. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for some Mediterranean."}
{"text":"SNAP! Yes, Hummus really IS as good as all the Yelp reviews say. WOW! I totally love this place! I like the style, the food, the atmosphere, everything! I'm an OG, so the music might be a little loud for me, but the food was really beyond awesome! SO fresh! Not a freezer in the joint (I took a peek in the kitchen and saw them fire grilling some meat too). You get to create your own dish. Hummus, spicy hummus, lamb, beef, chicken, all kinds of veggies and sauces as well. I'm going to have a blast exploring all the different flavor profiles here! I really dig the fountain drinks too. It's some brand I've seen a few times, but no high-fructose corn syrup in the drinks, which is fantastic IMHO. My wife loved Hummus too and she's pretty picky about Mediterranean food. I am too. Spot on. Well done, Hummus!"}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. Delicious. I'm truly hoping this is the future of fast food. I've been here four times everything is always fresh. A great place to pick up a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I wish there was one in Southwest! Talk about amazing! I hope they open more locations. So much flavor and deliciousness! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious ingredients that you can craft into your own delicious bowl! Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Definitely a top place to go for a Mediterranean masterpiece!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Michigan. We saw all the great reviews and decided to try it.  The food was amazing. My favorite was the garlic sauce with pita.  Not only was the food delicious, but the fountain pop was unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Fresh, amazing Mediterranean food reminiscent of the time I spent in both Jordan and Israel. Portions are super generous for the bowls, service is wonderful and the toppings are numerous and delicious.  I literally cannot stop talking about how great this place is, and I wish I lived back in Vegas because I would go all the time.

Also- you can add roasted veggies to any bowl without having to pay extra!"}
{"text":"Superb place! It's introduces healthy eastern influences to this part of the world in a fast food concept! Don't miss the baba ganoush,halloumi cheese side and the refreshing watermelon drink! Good vibes, hopefully they get open multiple locations soon!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat. Fresh, delicious, and excellent customer service. Cool vibe and decor as well."}
{"text":"Anytime I want to have a healthy and filling meal I go to Hummus. The staff is very polite and the food is very fresh. The garlic sauce may give you a garlicky breath but it's totally worth it considering how delicious the food is."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! All ingredients are so fresh and flavorful and delicious. I've eaten there the past 3 days!! Bowls and wraps are equally delicious. I could eat here everyday. The spicy hummus and the harissa together are magic!"}
{"text":"WOW, you guys nailed it! 

It's so difficult to find legit, quality food on the run and I'm so happy to see a business catering to fast healthy food, THANK YOU! 

My bowl: spicy hummus, chicken, spinach, black lentil beans, tabouli, cherry tomatoes, extra kalamata olives and mint tzatziki sauce. So much goodness.

Food is wonderful, the staff is super friendly and the ambiance is unique and comfortable. All around, a great job, I will be frequently Hummus :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and the food was excellent highly recommend will be back in the future"}
{"text":"Trying out a new Greek place today and so happy I did! Went to Hummus for lunch. This is a great concept I like. Blaze pizza did it and so does Hummus. A Chipotle style built your own bowl or wrap. Lots of great options! I went with the bowl today and I loved it! Delicious and the healthiest thing I've had in days, just a real feel good meal. I thought having hummus on the bottom would be weird, but I worked great. The lamb was wonderful and I love the whole scoop of feta. Will definitely be back especially since it's so close to my place in Anthem."}
{"text":"This place rules! The owner and his team are amazing. The food is fantastic and its such an original unique concept. You just have to try it. I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"All I can say is AMAZING! I get the hummus bowl and it is fantastic every single time. Love this little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and two young girls. They were extremely accommodating, explained everything and let me slowly decide and make the perfect hummus bowl. Healthy, perfect spices, clean, well priced and fun. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new place! It's wonderful to have a healthy option in the neighborhood :) the staff was so sweet and friendly and the food was of course the best part. I'm already looking forward to the next time I stop in. :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING fresh Meditteranean food!  It's my new favorite lunch hot spot!  The employees are super helpful and knowledgeable about their product!  Highly recommend to anybody seeking flavorful and fresh food!"}
{"text":"**** Perfect place for a quick, delicious and healthy meal. * The restaurant has a chipotle setup for Mediterranean food. I love all of the options they have- the ingredients are all very fresh and healthy. 4 hummus options- all are good, but I chose the spicy hummus. They have fresh juices that were delicious too. The Price is very reasonable. The restaurant has a cool setup- bright colors and even a projector that plays classic films to enjoy while you eat. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their ingredients. I will definitely recommend this place and be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So fresh! Full of flavor! Great service! Huge portions! I always do the chicken bowl with veggies, spicy hummus, and tons of other toppings . Love the garlic sauce. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Flavorful and healthy! Sooo many choices to fill your bowl or wrap for that special individual taste! Highly recommend this for either lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews and pictures. The food is so good!!! I got a bowl that is probably three meals for me & trust me I can eat a lot! I'm sure someone who eats really small meals can get more meals out of it. You pick your hummus first then your leafy greens. After that, you can pick a meat with roasted veggies if you like. Then they have a whole bunch of toppings. It was my first time & a gentlemen helped me. I think he is the owner. He is very personable & explained to me everything. He was awesome. All this under 10 bucks. I'm on a mission to eat more healthy & this place is definitely fit for that. Thank you Hummus & I will be back again."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan falafel wraps.  There's a lot of vegan options and the owner was really nice. Definitely coming back. Recommend to all vegans. They also have GF options."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Let's talk about these hummus bowls for a minute. First off, you walk in and super modern super casual super cute little vibe. It's kind of like a subway or chipotle line. You start with your hummus, greens, then meats and toppings. Finally they have some awesome sauces to choose from. I mean, what's great about here is the bowl is like under $10 and you get A TON of food. They offer wraps here too which is basically your bowl in a wrap which I think is cool. 


Anyways, fun/cute/unique places are a must on this side of town especially because they're building all these new malls and stores along St. Rose and businesses like this should definitely get some exposure early on. 

Four stars just because the service is whatever. It's a bunch of teenage kids who are just trying to make a little extra cash. Nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Totally obsessed. The pita driest rocked, the unsweetened watermelon magic juice was delicious and the bowl was something I could eat everyday"}
{"text":"Super quick healthy food. You order your type of hummus and whether you want an bowl or wrap, then you choose type of meet ( I chose Birdseye beef), chicken, lamb or veggie... then comes all the good Dixon's - too many to mention. A good variety that will help change the flavor profile if you visit often. Their drinks are really interesting - hello watermelon. Lavender. I opted for the all natural sodas - so good!"}
{"text":"Tucked away, but we found it. Thank goodness for signage! Stopped in for lunch. Once we walked in the door it reminded me exactly of Rice in Coral Gables. We asked if they were affiliated, but they are not. 
You can choose either a wrap or bowl. Pick your base of salad or grains and then top with delicious meats or vegetables and a huge array of toppings... from pickled onions, beets, quinoa, seasoned tomatoes, feta and so much more... Made every bite of my bowl Delicious!!!! Good news is that you don't feel guilty, because it is all lean choices. 
They have natural flavor sodas and flavored waters. I prefer a black tea. This is a great place for lunch, especially if you're getting your car clean at 7 Hills Car Wash."}
{"text":"This place is really legit... I tried the lamb that they said had some grass fed story... was awesome."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find, it is not facing the street. The menu is something like you would see at chipotle with the person standing behind the counter and they dip things into the bowl. There are no traditional drinks such as ice tea or soda. The staff are nice but this is not a place that will probably make it too long."}
{"text":"Best place for vegan food! Really!
It was quiet when we arrived so service was very quick with only one person working there. You get a choice of hummus, followed by lettuce and other good stuff in either a bowl or a wrap. I never realized this place was hidden in the back of a business complex until now.
The wrap I had was excellent, and I'd definitely try them again."}
{"text":"This place is so good! My husband and I just ate here tonight. There is a nice variety of food and you can get as many toppings as you want!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of my fav places to eat in Henderson! 
I love love looooove hummus. This place is seriously bomb. My fav hummus is the market or spicy and I don't they get their lentils to taste so good! If you're a falafel person they are crunchy and all the Yums too. 
Their toppings are awesome and so flavorful. 
If they had student discounts I would be here even more frequently. 
The bowls are also super instagram worthy. 

The seating area is really nice too , I love the rustic feel. 
Most of the staff I've interacted with are very sweet and super fun! Just one inicident one girl didn't seem to be having a good day and was getting annoyed when I was putting some toppings on and then she rushed my order to cashier and I wasn't even done yet .  We hadn't even put any dressing or crunchies on. But , everyone else has provided fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Ok, I just ate here and I'm literally SO EXCITED about this new find. So many options for me and what my tastebuds are feeling! And the guy that helped me had such a great personality. I believe his name started with a \"J\". Good customer service makes for an even better experience! Oh, and I just paid $8.55 for a huge portion. SOLD."}
{"text":"Middle eastern restaurants are easy to find on Eastern Avenue,  I can think of at least 7 off the top of my head.  Most are good to excellent.  HUMMUS is spectacular!!!   I was there in their first week which typically is difficult for restaurants.  I should know as I have been involved with the startup of several restaurants that eventually became national chains. Yet, HUMMUS hit the ground running fast and is still running at top speed.  I keep on coming back because they get an A+  for quality of the food, decor, prices (value), and good service.  They get a B+ on location as it can be hard to find as it is located behind some other restaurants.
   Let me try to describe how good the food is as well as the concept. Some other reviewer described HUMMUS as being similar to Chipolte. That is a good description but I truly feel the quality of the food is better at Hummus.  You first choose your flavor of hummus or babaghanoush  (egg plant) for your bowl or wrap. Then came the fresh greens including your choice of romaine, baby spinach, kale or baby chard. Next came either herbed rice or black lentils.  I usually ask for a little of both. This is followed by a generous scoop of  either steak/chicken/lamb or vegetarian options.  I have never tried anything but the chicken because it is that good.  Top off this bowl or wrap with various toppings and then pick your sauce including the house favorite garlic sauce. My own personal favorite is their own house dressing called citrus mint.  Writing this review is making me hungry!!!
   The decor of HUMMUS is pleasant with a healthy feel.  Speaking of healthy, the ingredients all seemed to be fresh. Even though I am a meat eater, vegetarians and vegans will be pleased by the choices they may find at HUMMUS.  I also really like that they did not go the way of having either a Pepsi or Coke soda fountain.  The soft drinks were very different and quite tasty.  HUMMUS also makes some home made drinks such as cucumber mint..  BTW, the paper bowls they use are recyclable. I believe this is one example of how the owner also wants a healthy world.  My only complaint on the decor is that the restaurant sometimes runs out of seating during busy times because people just want to hang out there. It is a nice problem for a restaurant to have.
   The prices are a very good value for what you get.  The grilled chicken bowl I usually get is only $7.90.  The beef and lamb are only slightly more.  Drinks are reasonably priced at about $2.50.  A side of pita fries is also $2.50 with a side of falafel being about $4.
   Good customer service is important to any restaurant.  The people behind the counter are friendly yet quick.  If you don't know what to try, they can suggest bowls or wraps that others have loved,  The owner seems to be there most of the time and just may drop by your table to see what you think.  He is always trying to improve but seriously folks, there is not much to improve on.
  The location of HUMMUS is somewhat difficult to find but this will help.  Ii's in the northwest corner of the intersection of Sun Ridge Heights and Eastern.  It is behind a couple of buildings (like Lee's Liquor) and I believe it has a green sign.
   In conclusion, if you like really good fresh food at a reasonable price and at a place where they truly value their customers, HUMMUS is a place you must try.    #hummusbowls #gethumbowled"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Fresh healthy and delicious. And close to where I live will be coming back ALOT !"}
{"text":"Tried this twice now and loved it both times. The server on Sunday afternoon however was very impatient and couldn't wait to get us through the line but the food was great. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and the gentleman behind the counter helped me build the perfect pita wrap. Had the braised lamb. Super good, and try the pickled onions.  They were unreal. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is SUCH A GEM. It's not easy to find places where you can get an incredibly tasty and HEALTHY meal. This place is at the top of my list when eating out. Their food is top notch and always fresh. They have vegan and gluten free options and so many amazing flavors. Their food is also very reasonable and the portions are very filling. 

I brought my parents here just last night while they're visiting from out of town and were blown away by the food. The manager was in and was wonderful. All around - this place does it right."}
{"text":"This place is amazing so many options! Bowls are huge! I ordered one and it made two meals. The steak was super tender. If you love garlic, their garlic sauce is a must."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago to try this place out. I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food and Mediterranean flavors and decided to swing by based off of the reviews.

It's a pretty good concept, build your own food through production line, nothing new as far as concept but a little more unique. Coming from Los Angeles I'm no stranger to Mediterranean food set my expectations were set pretty high.

Came in about an hour before closing. There's about four of the people inside enjoying their dinner. Walked up to the construction/food/ordering counter. A girl walked up from the back and stood there just looking at us. We were never technically greeted which made for a very awkward few minutes as we tried to navigate through the menu.

We decided to get a salad and a pita. You basically pick your protein or no protein and can either get some kind of wrap or pita or salad. Selection of toppings is pretty decent. Nothing out of the ordinary. And also choice of hummus style.

First thing I noticed was the consistency of the hummus. Very runny and watery. On the pita that I got it was kind of oozing out of the sides. I went with the beef as the protein. The meat over all looked pretty dry. Portion size was relatively small as well. Decided to take it to go because I didn't want to be that guy that was sitting there while everyone else was trying to clean and go home.

Flavors are OK. Like I said everything is pretty decent. There aren't too many of these places around except for places like parsley Mediterranean. So maybe that's why the reviews are so high. Everything seemed kind of fresh and the place was pretty clean. The girl behind the counter wasn't too helpful and for the price we paid serving sizes were small and there wasn't a true explosion of flavor.

If you're in the neighborhood give it a try, if not you're not missing out on too too much."}
{"text":"We like this place. We came here while we got our car washed for lunch. Its healthy food and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super cute place to get your Greek fix in! It is a chipotle style environment, where you get to pick your flavor of hummus, pita bread, meat, and toppings! Everyone was super friendly and they have a super cool soda bar!! 10/10 would recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome atmosphere! This will definitely be the new regular place to pick up fresh, healthy food for my busy family!"}
{"text":"One of my new favs. Think of a chipotle, but Greek style. Pick wrap or bowl. Rice or lentils. Beef, chicken, pork. Greek toppings and sauces (cucumbers, tomatoes, slaw, olives, Greek yogurt sauce, etc). Really fresh. Well priced (like $10pp). Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Created my own Hummus bowl! Everything tasted phenomenal! The decor in here is well put together, really cute, kind of like a \"home feel\".. wish I didn't live so far, I'd be here everyday.. well I'm glad I do actually lol"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and it is delicious! I'm half Lebanese and take my Middle Eastern food very seriously and they did not disappoint. Think of it like Cafe Rio or Chipotle for this style of cuisine. I only give it four stars because the girl who made my dish was super sweet but seemed sick, and that's a big no no for me. Other than that it was delicious."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Loved the ability to create your own as I have diet restrictions & allergies. The lamb was very tasty & had a great marinade. My husband had the pulled beef and that was very tasty too. Clean. Organized. Very friendly staff. Seen some drink options as well, but didn't try them. Will have to come back again to try the drinks."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place ... I was passing thru Vegas and yelp a healthy place to eat ..not to heavy and delicious .."}
{"text":"Came to lunch here looking for some vegetarian fare and ended up with pita and falafel.  Nice atmosphere, clean, and the person prepping our order was super patient with the menu explanation.  A wide variety of topping that you can choose from, everything looked fresh and colorful.  The menu is a good value, I think next time I would go for the bowl as the pita was breaking  up a bit in my hands."}
{"text":"Based on the greeting we received from the super friendly owner, Najib, the whole vibe of the place and freshness of the food, we will be supporting this neighborhood spot! Very cool and bowl options are like nothing I have ever seen!!  The freshly made (by Najib's sister) fruit drink infusions are BOMB! 
Wow, we met everyone tonight, the owner and the chef!
I hope and wish that everyone up the hill and down the hill will support HUMMUS. Come try, you will have no regrets if what you crave is fresh, healthy and made with love. Btw, there are no take out menus (in an effort to go paperless) so you will need to come inside. It's behind Bell's BBQ and Pho Mailan. Yay they have also decided to stay open until 10, something we desperately need in the neighborhood! Wonderful food, unique but simple concept--imo the way eating should be. Make HUMMUS your Go-To Bowl spot and you will not be sorry! 
Yep ate there last night and going back today. I never do that!"}
{"text":"New place.  Super tasty!  Super fresh!  Super nice staff!  I hope they open a west side location."}
{"text":"I hosted my book club here tonight.   Great place! The food is fresh, and the.service is friendly and fast.  I had spicy hummus, roasted veggies, rice, and a ton of toppings.  Huge portions! I could finish only half my bowl."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! I saw a sign from the corner of my eye that said Hummus bowl so I quickly went into the parking lot to investigate . Hidden in the back behind the Vietnamese restaurant is the BEST hummus bowl I ever had.  The food was fresh, the hummus and eggplant dip was amazing.  The owner and staff were delightful... this will definitely be my go to place.  If you are looking for authentic food this is a must."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. I've been twice and the food speaks for itself. Hummus, meat and veggies is excellent."}
{"text":"This is a great place! I have celiac disease so I need to make sure everything is gluten free. I couldn't believe all the great options. Food is never frozen and is NON GMO. You can just taste the freshness.  The owner and staff were very friendly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A nice find thanks to yelp. I always try any ethnic food but especially mediterranean. This new place had excellent service, super fresh high quality food, and everything was extremely flavorful. These are the businesses we need to support.  Lastly, the price was spot on. Great to try many options until you find perfection. 

Falafel was righteous. I ordered a chicken wrap with a bunch of super fresh ingredients. GO NOW."}
{"text":"Hands down the best quick casual restaurant in Las Vegas! Simple, delicious and tons of healthy veggies and healthy options! Thank you hummus for being so amazing!"}
{"text":"Best described as a Chipotle or Subway with Mediterranean food.  Very inexpensive, but food quality is outstanding.  Everything was fresh and tasted as it should.  Nothing was left out on \"display\" for too long.  The associates working were very friendly (Feb 7, around 9 PM) and engaged with us.  Location is modern and bright.  Lots of floor to ceiling windows to make it very open and exposed.  You won't find Coca-Cola or Pepsi here.  They use a different company (which I cannot remember the name now), but has a great selection like root beer, cream sodas, fruit-flavors."}
{"text":"I can't praise this place enough. I describe it as a Mediterranean chipotle. If you're thinking \"well, I don't really like hummus that much\".... just don't put it in your bowl! The lineup includes a base of your choice of hummus (reg, spicy, baba gan, market), choice of greens (arugula, chard, spinach, baby kale, I think romaine as well), rice and/or black lentils, a protein source (chicken, steak, falafel, veggies) and then whatever else your heart desires. They have over a dozen topping options and nothing costs extra. Lots of sauce options too. Depending on which protein choice you get you will spend $7-10. You can also make a wrap instead of a bowl but if you get as much as I do, you will want a bowl to fit it all in!"}
{"text":"My second time stopping in this week. I love all the options!  You have your choice of a variety of hummus, lettuce, meats, toppings, and dressings. It's all delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and i was pleasantly suprised with this quaint hidden gem. I love mediterranean food, so this slight chipotle spin on a classic was clever. You have 2 options bowl or wrap. I'd pick bowl if your a tad hungrier. Hummus, greens, protein, and unlimited toppings made for a very hearty meal. It was my first meal of the day at noon and kept me full until 7pm! I also gave the cinnamon twist pita fries with peanut butter hummus a go and was impressed with flavor, just not so much texture. The pita fries where I expected them to be soft were hard. But overall i felt like this was a delightful meal satisfying and refreshing. Its far from where i live but i will definitely make the drive!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with not much expectations and the hidden location was not so appealing...but guess what ? Nice surprise ! Everything is fresh and tasty and you will have a very good mediteranean experience, so long that you do the right mix... but overall very good food (4 stars) the extra bonus point is for the very friendly staff ! (Yes staff does a lot in a restaurant experience) keep up the good work ! Well done !"}
{"text":"The food was very flavorful & beautiful! So grateful that I found this spot. The Hummus was spicy, the chicken was tender, the grilled veggies were cooked to perfection! The unfortunate thing was they were out of a few items when we arrived around 6:30pm. Aside from that, this will be one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh!
I loved the flavors of this new Mediterranean delight. The owner was serving and took pride with the rest of the crew. Open for only a few months but they have their shit together! Even though I'm not vegetarian/ vegan; I had my fill of  meat the past few days and decided to try go with veggie options. I had the wrap with babba-gannoush spread, half rice/ lentils, baby spinach, falafel balls, spiced tomatoes, quinoa tabouli, pickled onions, olives, topped with roasted red pepper & walnut spread and the tzatziki sauce drizzle. OMG. I was full-extremely satisfied but not heavy full...know what I mean? Another gem was the drinks. I had the fresh ice cold watermelon/ mint \"mockjito\" that washes it all down. 
Wifey had the bowl with much of the same toppings but chose roasted veggies instead of the falafel. She washed it down with pineapple-cream soda. Awesome. Run, don't walk to this hidden gem in Henderson. A SOLID choice when looking for options other than Mexican, Italian, burgers or Chinese. 
When the owner asked how my meal was...I told him \"don't change a thing! You've got a winner!\""}
{"text":"I think it's a winner. Welcome to the neighborhood.  The flavors are fresh and inviting . The price point is perfect for the volume of choices  available. I  got the lamb bowl n all the dressing were amazing the vegetables were on point deffently a new regular spot a great  healthy dining treat."}
{"text":"Sooo tasty. Fast and friendly service.  Delicious vegan options!  Good prices too.  All ingredients were fresh!"}
{"text":"OMG SO DELICIOUS!!!! Everything is SO fresh!! We are sooooo excited we found this place!! We struggle finding restaurants we like because we like to eat clean and hate freezer food and this place doesn't even have a freezer!! The guy who helped us was so lovely and helpful and helped us choose what to pair with the lamb. So delicious, so fresh, such nice staff - bravo!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big hummus eater, but came here for lunch the other day and my already average expectations were surpassed by what seemed like little explosions of awesome deliciousness in my mouth..

Parking was fine there were a lot of stalls open given how busy they were. I was about the 5th person in line.
Vegan friendly if that's what you're looking for.
The staff was great and helpful with my decisions which basically was a bowl with nearly everything thrown in it, not to forget the pita fries!

Cozy little area to eat.. must have sat here for about an hour in conversation before realizing that I actually had things to do after lunch.
Over all I would definitely come back and have a nice hummus meal here, even though this is probably the only time I ever eat hummus, it's totally worth coming back to."}
{"text":"I got a bowl.  Lucky for me there were two customers before me or else I would not have understood the ingredients to add to my bowl.  I was too proud to ask for help I guess :-).  I thought I would eat some right away and save the rest for the next day, but I could not stop eating it!!  I finished the entire bowl and when I weighed myself the next day I was a few ounces lighter so no weight gain.  Very good and healthy food.  Wish they had one where I live."}
{"text":"Great place. I live in summerlin but come out to Henderson everyday  Bc my bf lives in southern highlands.  I love the quality and taste and service. So happy this place opened and I look forward to referring more people to eat here"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when I walked in. As others stated, it's kind of like a Mediterranean Chipotle and I'm not a big fan of Chipotle.  However all the ingredients were fresh and so flavorful. I like spicy and the spicy items I selected had the right amount of \"bite.\" I live down the street and I'm afraid this may become a daily obsession."}
{"text":"I really liked the food and the place but ended up paying $17 for a lamb bowl n a drink! 
There was no lamb really left bottom of the pan type thing so I asked if she could just throw some ck in there to make up for it.. I think she charged or something cause to pay that much for lunch for a bowl is nuts!"}
{"text":"Simply the best fresh food I have had from a take out place. I have never been here before but plan to return.  All the spreads and hummus is made right there and it compliments the salads.  This is a small hard to find place inside a industrial plaza and has only been open 6 Months.  It is a small non chain eatery. Fresh everything."}
{"text":"This is a really neat place. Their setup is like a Mediterranean Chipotle. I got the lamb bowl with Bbaganoush and it was delicious . I love the toppings that have ; apple,fennel and carrot slaw; black lentils, pickled onions; quinoa Tabouleh. Once you bite into it, it's like a flavor explosion. If you get the right mix of everything you can positively enjoy yourself. The only thing about this is the location. Because it's in the back of a strip mall it won't receive much foot traffic, but I hope it does well and continues to succeed.

They don't freeze any of their products and everything is fresh. We need more healthy alternatives like this. I didn't even get to there soda fountain= they have black cherry tarragon soda !! So delicious, and the staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about their products. You can tell they believe in what they sell and it helps to sell more"}
{"text":"My family and I visited Hummus this past weekend and absolutely loved it! It was our first time and it didn't disappoint

Update-
We've now gone 3 times in 2 weeks and it's an absolute hit every time! I can't get enough. It's my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Basically a Mediterranean Chipotle, but wow, the food is amazing! You can choose from either a bowl or a wrap, but my go to is the bowl with spicy hummus, half and half white rice and lentils, and the braised beef. You can add whatever vegetable and sauces you would like on top of the bowl, and they're all super fresh! I always get the white garlic and harissa sauces as well. 

Been here about 5x now. Huge portions, tasty food, reasonable prices, and friendly service, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Just what this area needed. Fresh clean food so many options for your bowl. Everything is homemade and fresh. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The restaurant is superclean. Can't wait to go back with the family"}
{"text":"I was intrigued with the buzz this place was getting and when I looked them up on here they had 5 stars so I had to see for myself why! I went with a bowl, spiced hummus, arugula and they're crazy amount of fresh toppings is what really took the cake for me! The set up of it reminds me of chipotle set up when you're ordering they have lots of fresh finely chopped veggies, crunchy chickpeas, pomegranate seeds, garlic sauce and so much more!!! I will be returning for more. If they switched their beef to grass fed that would be awesome.  But to end on a good note they are worth the hype!"}
{"text":"A bunch of my classmates were raving about this place so I wanted to check this place out. It is kind of like a chipotle for mediterranean food. 

I was not expecting much when I came here, but was pleasantly surprised. The food portions were right on point. Not so much that you are going to food coma and not so little that you leave hungry. They had 3 different types of hummus available (spicy was my favorite). You get to choose your choice of meat and then layer on the topping. They have a garlic butter/sauce which is definitely a must if you like garlic. 

The workers here were also very pleasant and a gentleman (who i assume was the owner) came by to make sure everything came out okay. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"If you like Mediterranean food this is the place. This place is like going to Subway. Except this place your getting heathy Quality food. Excellent customer service. Will repeat!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went in and were greeted by one of the owners he was awesome i asked him to make me a bowl like he would eat it, needless to say it was amazing, as he made it he described everything he was putting in it and how it was made it was awesome. The Decor in this place is awesome as well i highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been going there three days in a row now since I found it. I get the wrap and add all the fresh toppings and add-ons and believe me it is incredible. The food is so fresh and the quality is amazing. I usually feel amazing after I eat it. Not at all gross which is common when you go to a fast-food joint. I recommend this place to everyone. I love it so much."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday! I went back again today. This is my new favorite place. I love that you can custom make your bowl and everything is fresh to order! I might go back tomorrow?!?!?"}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, well presented, yumm!
Never tried these varieties of toppings.
Good protein for after the gym!
Met the owner too, super nice guy, a passion for food!
Colelegaci.com"}
{"text":"Came yesterday for the first time. The food was about a 3 and the service was a 5. The tall gentleman behind the counter walked my through the process and explained all the ingredients even know i am a chef and already knew what everything is. If you like Garlic you will deft like this place. After I had my wrap i tasted garlic for the next 10 hours. I would come back though."}
{"text":"So so yummy. The chipotle, blaze, and subway of high quality, super flavorful Mediterranean food.  A little spendy, but huge portion, expensive ingredients if I were to make at home.  Love it.  Will go back many times"}
{"text":"I decided on a whim to try Hummus for lunch on Sunday after a workout, and liked it enough to return Monday on my lunch for another build-your-own bowl. The positive reviews on Yelp! hold true, Hummus serves up flavorful and healthy Mediterranean ingredients that you create to your liking. The grilled chicken is juicy and seasoned with care, there is a selection process for your greens and type of hummus offered, as well as the assembly line of nutritious toppings (such as crunchy chickpeas, mint tahini sauce, finely chopped cucumbers and pickled beets)! You can be as bold or simple in your creations, no matter which you choose - Hummus is a palate pleaser!"}
{"text":"To start I am not that crazy about hummus, but this place really impressed me ! I had a wrap that had  baba ganoush instead of humus as the spread. I picked beef for my meat and loaded on tons of their delicious toppings. They had some sort of shredded apple topping and it was so good. I have recommend this place to several friends already and everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for healthy good food. The manager showed me excellent customer service and helped me out a lot. Great environment, will come here more often !"}
{"text":"Food is great. Local fast casual. It's Hummus ala Cipolte. The falafel bowl with spicy hummus and assorted toppings is delicious and filling"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends for lunch and we absolutely loved it! The bowls are flavorful and filling, but so healthy!"}
{"text":"Great lil place. Food was delicious and the price is great. The only downfall is it probably only has 8 tables for seating. But overall I Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If you were on a vegan diet and you were craving chipotle, I would definitely recommend Hummus. You create your own bowl of hearty healthy food. If that's even a thing, lol. There are different types of hummus to start the base of your bowl. Then you can top it off with tons of veggies and their special house sauce. Grab yourself a cup for their freshly watermelon juice. After all that, grub up and trust me. You'll feel healthy lol. 

Extra details: Creating your own bowl comes out to 8-10 bucks. The atmosphere was friendly and green. Your trendy hipster spot. Take a pic against their wall for the gram game. I did realize it can get pretty busy. And the line can be slow at times due to new people who have never tried the place before asking the workers a ton of questions aka like me."}
{"text":"Really good food i work next door and it's hard not going next door all the time. The spicy hummus is my favorite. Definitely has good kick. The food is always fresh and a lot of the staff is sweet and nice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick and healthy meal, this is the place to be. My food was fresh and delicious with a good price point for the amount of food in an order. Not to forget the the black and white movies played in the common area which I loved. The owner or manager was pleasant with a great personality. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place, love it.  

The food, textures and flavors are superb and one refreshing surprise, no Coke or Pepsi, but a drinks fountain of unusual fruits, berry and vegetable juice lime cucumber. Love it more as drinks NOT sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.

You select the main dish of hummus and salad and then add your choice if meat then various toppings of feta cheese, mint, pickles, onions, olives, pomegranate, lentils, rice, tzatziki, and more.

For fresh healthy food at a reasonable price 
YOU CANNOT BEAT IT"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's off the beaten path because it's not street front. I am in love with their salads, it's not typical of any salad from any other restaurant. There are many choices but it's not overwhelming. The people who work there are very nice and helpful. You must try it!"}
{"text":"The freshest meal I had in a long time.
So tasty. Lots of selection: falafel, meats, halumi cheese...whatever you like. All of that wrapped or placed in a bowl with rice or beans and lots and lots of toppings. 
I wish this place was near my home"}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food. Clean atmosphere,  friendly staff.  The hummus is delicious.  I like the fact that you can make it your own... you decide what goes on either your bowl or wrap. Delicious,  I will come back  again when in Vegas. 

Thank you guys. 

You should open a Hummus in Los Angeles district area!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food is amazing. Everything is completely customizable. The employees could have been a little more helpful. I had mentioned it was my first time here and wasn't sure what certain items were. I kept having to ask what each item was. The seating was horrible. They have less than 10 tables and all were full. I will go back, but get it to go next time."}
{"text":"Great healthy food !!!! That place used to be a deli sandwich cafe but this is also a good choice to have the place is kind of hidden so u may have to take a closer look for the place.the staff are friendly if u are not familiar with middle eastern food they are very patient to explain to u also u can sample them. I will def come back again!"}
{"text":"Chipotle set up on the inside where you can pick your toppings. Got a bowl with classic hummus, chicken and so many toppings I can't name.. for picky eaters this place probably is good because they have so many topping options. Vegetarian options are available as well. All the food was made in house and tasted clean and fresh with a lot of flavor. Got a watermelon drink that was made fresh which was delicious. 

The staff was very friendly, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. The food is super fresh and prepared quickly. The taste is phenomenal and you will never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here & let me just say it's AMAZING ! 
We received great customer service. They went over what they offer and allowed us to try every hummus option, and anything else we asked about. 
I ordered the falafel wrap, they make the falafels fresh and made to order. Normally a hit or miss when it comes to falafels not everyone can make them good but theirs were amazing! I'm extremely happy with the food as well as the service, everything was EXCEPTIONAL!!! Definitely a new favorite spot !"}
{"text":"I am so happy that we finally came here to eat. The food tastes amazing and fresh.  My husband and I both opted for the bowls..next time we will have to try the wrap. There are plenty of options to choose from to build an amazing meal. This is a great idea. I was happy  to see that they offer vegan and gluten free options. The sugar free beverages were refreshing too.  We will be returning and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I wish I got the name of the guy that made my bowl because he was so nice and informative about the whole concept of this place. Just so you know what kind of level they are on when it comes to freshness.. there are no freezers in there. I love that they know where their meats are coming from and the diets that they are on. 

It's a lot... a lot of food and a lot of options. Definitely a Greek/Mediterranean version of Chipotle, with higher quality foods lol. This place is definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm actually doing this, but I'm giving out a 5 Star Review! I hardly ever do this so y'all better check this place out because it is LEGIT! This is basically a Mediterranean style Chipotle where you can pick various ingredients in either a bowl or pita form. You get to pick things like the hummus flavor, the greens, the grains, the protein, a various assortment of toppings (like tomatoes, cilantro, pomegranate seeds, feta cheese, and etc.), and you finish it off with the sauce.

I ended up ordering a bowl with the spicy hummus which is apparently their most popular flavor and it isn't even spicy hehe along with the beef. Although the appearance leaves a lot to be desired, there is just so much flavor packed into each bite! After the first bite I knew that I just had to write this review because of how good the food is and how I want y'all to check this place out ASAP. The portion is a good deal too! I'm actually surprised I got such a big bowl with a bunch of ingredients for less than $10 and we all know how pricy Mediterranean food can be!  

The workers here are super helpful and nice as well. The guy who helped me was very enthusiastic and had a bunch of recommendations since I was a bit overwhelmed and indecisive lol. He even offered to put more ingredients that he thought would complement my choices which meant a lot to me because most places just want to get you in and out. 

Overall I would definitely come back here again despite it being a bit far for me. The location is a bit hard to find at first so make sure to have your GPS on. Apparently all their ingredients are fresh and wholesome as well. I really can't think of anything negative because my whole experience was just so positive."}
{"text":"Food excellent...fresh..nongmo..try to use organic.  Generous servings.  Friendly.  I would've given 5 stars but I took one off for the music...omgosh..when I eat out I want to relax not feel like I'm at,a dance club.  Kind of stressful.  Couldn't even hear the clerk talking.  I hate that.  So hopefully they'll realize a calming environment is good for digestion and conversation.  :)  we might go back for pick up but not to eat in. Maybe that's why it's empty but steady stream of pick up?  Anyway def. Good healthy food ..yum"}
{"text":"After watching a cooking show about Mediterranean food on PBS I turned to Yelp to see where I could get a delicious meal. And Hummus caught my eye. The pics and reviews were a selling point for me to show my hubby who is not too keen on trying new things. But I told him we can try it and maybe he might like it. So he picked me up from work and took me on a lunch date. The restaurant was clean and bright despite the rain. We were greeted when we walked in and were asked if this was our first visit. The ladies behind the counter were very friendly explaining how we could have a bowl or a pita. Plus they let us try their choices of hummus. All were yummy. I chose the spinach artichoke and hubby chose half original and jalapeño. My husband decided on a bowl and I went the pita route. The whole time we were building our meals the staff was patient and answered any questions we had. Which was nice because sometimes trying something new can be overwhelming. We sat down to eat and the atmosphere was calm and relaxing. I enjoyed my pita and look forward to coming back to try a bowl. And the best part is my hubby said he would like to go again as well. Thank you for a new lunch date spot. See you soon. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious fast-casual restaurant. Everything tasted super fresh and light while still maintaining lots of flavor. They have really interesting juices and sodas. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food and a great idea. However the space was too small so there wasn't enough seating."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not amazing as reviews would suggest. I'd give 3 stars but it was miserably hot as they set the temp to 80. Had to eat outside but there was no shade so overall poor experience. Who sets their restaurant to 80???"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 5 times in the last few weeks and I must say ,hands down it's so delicious and healthy. It's a very neat concept as well. They even have healthy drink options. The place is very very clean and decorated nicely. The staff is always very friendly. You can dine in or order \"to go\" as well. There are many choices of food items to place into your hummus bowl. You go down a line of selections and they put it together for you. Don't miss out on this gem. I'm kind of a little food snob and very hooked on this place. Big thumbs up"}
{"text":"Hummus is amazing! Food is delicious and fresh -- awesome customer service... cute, simple and tasteful decor. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. The food is very delicious...I would rate it 5 stars. Customer service is great...what ruined it for me is I waited 20 minutes in line to get my bowl. I was the 4th customer in line. I came in here at 12pm. There was only 1 person working the front. So he was doing everything. Poor guy was working so hard. The owner of this restaurant needs to hire another person to work the front or the owner should work during busy times. I really want to love this place and return but was so turned off by waiting 20 mins just to order 1 bowl. No ones fault I guess expect maybe better management and planning.

Day 2
Went back again...had a craving. Service was excellent. Food amazing.  5 Star for sure."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! It's not always easy to find a place that is delicious with both vegan and gluten-free options for me, as well as meat options for my husband and kids. I'm not on this side of town often, but when I am this has become one of my \"go-to\" stops."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants! Fresh food. Clean restaurant. Flavorful, locally sourced ingredients. I love the spicy hummus and the lamb and the flash fried chickpeas. Go with the bowl, always! Also the drinks are really good: cane sugar fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and the customizable bowls and wraps give a very special experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So many delicious vegan options, including vegan tahini sauce which I've never seen before! The prices are also very affordable too. I could eat lunch here everyday. As we left I heard the owner say \"we love our vegans here\" and that made me feel so welcome. What a wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"Incredible food... going since day one! Always a great and healthy meat, awesome drinks, and friendly staff! Where is the salted Carmel hummus though?!??! Can't wait to come in again and again..."}
{"text":"First time stopping by this place, and we were impressed. The quality and variety of ingredients is great. I had the steak and it was really good! Great value for the price and the service was outstanding. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"What a great place to grab a bite for lunch or dinner. The hummus is great and the have an array of toppings for your bowl or pita. I prefer the beef protein the best. The owner and staff always have great attitudes and customer service and they are not chincey on their portions. Now that this place is starting to become popular, there will most likely be a bit of a line during rush food times so make sure you have a few extra minutes to spare."}
{"text":"This place was awesome ! It's like a chipotle Mediterranean style. All there food is fresh and they don't even have a freezer and you can taste it."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy, affordable food is just what I need and love. Although for a first timer, the menu may seem confusing, just go down the list and ask for help when needed. Hummus reminds me of a Mediterranean Chipotle. Everything is prepared in front of you and looks very fresh.

I recommend getting the bowl to start because the servers load so much into the bowl that the wrap usually starts falling apart. The classic and spicy hummus are the two popular choices and are placed at the bottom of a nice treat as you dig in. I picked the black lentils for my grain, which I enjoyed. 

When it comes to protein, the braised lamb is a popular choice. Unfortunately for me, they were at the very bottom of the tray for the night so whatever I got ended up being very salty. They ended up topping my bowl off with the roasted vegetables, which was appreciated, but I didn't enjoy how salty the meat was. As for the grilled chicken, I thoroughly enjoyed this protein and would recommend this in the future. It was not dry at all, and very flavorful.

As for the toppings, load it up as much as you can! Too many olives can make things too salty as well, but I love olives. As for the sauce, I love tzatziki, so that was an obvious choice for me. The pita fries are crunchy and go wonderfully as a side to share. 

If it weren't for the salty lamb, I would've definitely given this place five stars, but I will be back. A great, healthy meal for under $10 is a tough find!"}
{"text":"Really great food and service. Come here maybe once to twice a week. Love the freshness of the food. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend the quinoa salad and the falafel.  So many vegan and gluten free options.  All the food is fresh (they don't even have a freezer or a microwave anywhere in the restaurant), and it's a family owned business. The food is made with love.  Authentic flavors with a twist.  Go taste the love!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! There's a lot of healthy options and the food is fresh. Would love to see a quinoa or brown rice option."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! Servers went out of their way to make sure we were knowledgeable about all our food selections. Portions are HUGE and very filling. Good value for the price. The interior is spacious and modern, with simple decor. 

Can't go wrong with any of your choices here!

Unlimited refills on beverages :)"}
{"text":"Sooooooo delicious!!!  First timer and the staff was super helpful and friendly explaining and walking you through making your bowl.  Every ingredient was extremely fresh and so good!!!!  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"omg I've been waiting for a place like this to open up here in town. Mediterranean food chipotle style where you can build your own bowl, get a pita wrap, or both haha. On top of all that everything is made in house and fresh, they don't own any freezers!!

I got the bowl filled with spicy hummus and mixed the chicken and veggies. Then added spinach, rice, black lentils that gave a nice texture, pickled onions, tomatoes, cucumber, kalamata olives, Tabbouleh, and topped it off with garlic sauce and another dressing. I like my toppings what can I say. Food was super delicious and pretty filling. 

The girl behind the counter was also very helpful giving me some tips and letting me sample the different hummus they had to offer. The owner was a stand up guy too, he talked about how he wanted to share the food he grew up with. And he even added a free drink for me since they had some fresh drinks they make in house too. I got the currant and thyme and omg I'm so glad he gave me that free drink haha. 

Overall great service and great food 5/5!! I actually called the store to let them know they're doing a great job and their product is quality. Wishing them luck and I'll be back again soon"}
{"text":"You certainly get a lot of food here! Talk about a lot of bang for your buck! The service was extremely fast and it's pretty neat to watch the staff make your order on front of you! The food is very fresh and filling. I'll definitely be making another trip here!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for hummus and Mediterranean food and the green Hummus Bowl sign caught my eye.  I did a fast u-turn and parked, and looked up the Yelp reviews, which were all glowing.  I am so happy I stopped here--the food was mouth-watering and delicious, and everything was incredibly fresh and every bite a delight.  I use to love Zankou Chicken when I lived in L. A.  But this is now my new favorite hummus bowl place, and even though I live on the other side of town, I will make it
a point to stop by when I'm in the area.  I had the pleasure to meet the owner, Najeem (spelling?) who welcomed me warmly, and proudly told me about his new restaurant (and he happens to have these astonishing movie-star good looks).  I wish him all the success with his amazing new restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The spicy hummus was in my veggie based bowl and the variety of toppings made each bowl personal. Definitely the new Mediterranean spot in Anthem area, go support your local businesses:)"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Wish there was one in California though! Definitely will be back later on today, lol. If you're on any specific diet whether it's no carbs, low carbs, or high carbs, this place suits your needs. For those paleo people out there, this place is perfect :)"}
{"text":"Five stars all around! The staff are super friendly, the food is Delicious , and the place is very clean. I chose a hummus bowl and experienced a flavor orgy in my mouth. Hummus is yummus! Hands down one of the best healthy \"fast\" new spots in town."}
{"text":"I'm from California, but I'm in town visiting a friend for the weekend. We were both hangry and in the mood for something light but filling. This was a very yummy place! We had the wrap with lamb and it was delicious! Everything tastes fresh and the service is awesome! It was clean, yummy, and friendly."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant since we were looking for something to eat after venturing to the doctor at St. Rose. We discovered it by word of mouth, one of the medical assistants told us about it. With the changes that I need to make with my heart diet is a huge part of something that I need to change. We are what we eat, totally. So she commented that we should go to HUMMUS since we were going to do lunch anyways. So here we are.

Upon first walking in the restaurant it was a bit overwhelming but the friendly staff helped me with all of my questions. I ended up getting a bowl and made it classic, with lentils and seasonal veggies with garlic sauce. The cashier told me that the garlic sauce was a house favorite and it was wonderful. I was so impressed with the staff and professionalism of the staff that I will return here too."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure!!  Tucked back off the street but once you find it, you will find yourself going back and back!  I just found it and have been 4 times in less than a week!  The food is delicious!  Fresh! I can't get enough!  The owners are 2 brothers and they are friendly, welcoming and they use family recipes!  They are going places for sure!!  If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"The greens are all wilted! Not fresh at all. Came at 9:30pm and they refused to make the falafel even though they close at 10:00pm. If you're not going to offer everything then why even stay open til 10:00pm?? The cook was lazy to prepare it, we left and ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"Gyros are the newest hottest growing trend right now. And this place is great!!! You can get either a wrap or a bowl. (Which is helpful because the wraps, 'while delicious' could not be messier to eat) the hummus is great. The proteins are not super authentic, but they are still DELICIOUS!!! And all the toppings and the sauces are incredible. Everything has its own unique flavor that adds a different layer of flavor. 1000% I WILL BE BACK!!! Good job!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, and the customer service was great,  fresh selections and very tasty.  I found a new for my tummy."}
{"text":"This place had great ratings and I had to try it! It did not disappoint. Delish and fresh! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after so many people recommended it. It's located in an odd spot so it's kind of hard to find. I cant say I loved where they chose to put it but it's a cute, clean little place nonetheless. The girls working there weren't very warm and kind of looked stressed out or over it. There wasn't a line and it didn't seem too busy so I'm not quite sure why they came off this way. It was around 12 o'clock when we decided to walk in. I got the classic hummus bowl with falafel, kale, rice and lentils. My husband got the classic bowl with romaine, rice, and grilled veggies. When she asked us what toppings we'd like, we noticed they were out of the ones we wanted. When my husband asked her if there would be more made, she quickly said \"no, we ran out.\" So that was kind of disappointing. We picked some other options and paid. The falafel is made in the back, so you do have to wait for them to bring it out to you. I didn't know that so when she handed me my bowl I asked for my falafel and she was a little annoyed and said she'd bring it out. (Sorry, first time here. How was I supposed to know) anyway the food was actually pretty good. My husbands rice was hard and he kept having to pick it out of his mouth. My falafel was overdone and a bit dry, but other then that it was tasty. I commented to him on the fact that it was only noon and they were running out of things which honestly is bad business. Apparently one of his coworkers ate there the day before and the owner had to go out and buy more lentils because they ran out. That isn't a good sign...I hope they get it together over there because the food is good and obviously people like it. They need to start keeping up with the demands. I hope to go back when they have all ingredients available and have a better experience and then rewrite this review the way I hoped I'd get to."}
{"text":"Great find, healthy and delicious! This quick service Mediterranean place packs a quality punch and is open until 10 pm. A bit tucked  away on the back of the center, but so good. Great ingredients and flavors will not disappoint. I will be going back again today to try another bowl. So happy to have this option in this area! Do not miss out....and please keep this alive. Rare find."}
{"text":"The rave reviews so far are no joke. I was very happy after trying this newest take on the Chipotle-inspired business model.

HUMMUS Bowls & Wraps is a simply and appropriately named casual restaurant on the back side of a building with more visible tenants such as Pho MaiLan and Bell's BBQ. They do customizable bowls and \"wraps\" (more on this later) with a Mediterranean / Middle Eastern flair, and there's plentiful seating with a rather bright/white aesthetic and what vaguely sounds like culturally appropriate music.

The owner wasn't on premises, but a very knowledgeable employee greeted me and walked me figuratively through the menu and literally down the assembly line after mentioning that almost everything is made in-house. The steps are as follows:

1) Decide whether you want a bowl or wrap.

2) Hummus! There's classic hummus, spicy hummus, bean-free \"market\" hummus (spinach/artichoke blend), and baba ganoush (eggplant). Classic hummus and baba ganoush were both delicious.

3) Greens. Choices are romaine, chard, spinach, and kale. Romaine is boring, and the crunch is redundant if you get the right toppings down the line, so I don't foresee myself ever choosing it.

4) Herbed rice or black lentils. Both are viable, but the lentils were pretty darn good.

5) Protein, the sole determinant of price. Choices are flame grilled chicken ($7.90), flame grilled beef ($8.82), braised lamb ($9.70), falafel ($7.90), crispy halloumi cheese ($7.90), and seasonal roasted veggies ($6.95). More notes on what I chose later, but cheese wasn't on display, beef looked potentially dry (although that could be an unfounded fear), and veggies looked vibrant and almost appealing enough to choose. Almost.

6) Toppings. Lots and lots of toppings. If you skimp, don't expect to be as impressed. I invested time here because the menu says \"get creative.\" Definitely look into the cherry tomatoes, the feta with some additional goodies in it, the different quinoas, the pickled onions (not too tart), the pomegranate seeds (a pop of sweetness), green onion, parsley, mint, and some crunchy ingredients (sunflower seeds, crunchy chickpeas, crunchy pita bits). Just about all of those (and more) were fresh and delicious, with the except of a few yellowing sprigs of parsley.

7) Sauce(s). Garlic sauce, mint tzatziki, herb tahini, muhammara (described as roasted peppers and walnuts), hot chili harissa, house dressing (described as citrus mint). The raw garlic packs a powerful punch and both the tzatziki and tahini are awesome, but I didn't really get much out of the muhammara. I'm reminded of poke bowl places and how you can't typically get much flavor out of just one sauce, but even if you only choose one sauce for your entree here, you'll probably be very happy.

I ended up with two entrees, and I also tried some sides. While dining in, I managed to finish a pita with grilled chicken. The pita tastes great but has an awkward form factor. Not only does it not really fold readily after you load it up with toppings, but it gets pretty wet unless you deliberately stick to dry items and get sauce on the side or something. Fortunately, you can always fork and knife it if need be. The chicken was pretty good and wasn't dry.

I also took a bowl to-go but had a few good bites of it. Rice was fine. Braised lamb was delicious and tender. It was a modest but very reasonable portion of really good lamb. Where else can you get that sort of meat in relatively intact form? This really is a treat special treat. 

I'm always looking out for good falafel, so I picked up a side order ($3.97 for 4 pieces). The ground and spiced chickpea balls may be vegan, but they can be remarkably delicious anyway. HUMMUS's falafel are a bit salty, but their flavor is phenomenal compared to anything else that I've had in town and at least matches if not exceeds what I've eaten elsewhere. The texture is even more remarkable, with a brilliant crispy exterior that must be tasted fresh. Omnivores and vegans alike will love this.

Pita chips ($2.31) were pretty good too, although I only had a bite. No comment on the fountain drinks ($2.59), which I didn't taste at all, but they include an uncommon soda brand and a few house-made blends. I'll consider giving those a try next time.

HUMMUS is not just one of the best adaptations of the customizable bowl model, but they're easily the best casual Mediterranean eats in the local scene. It's cheaper and more satisfying than the \"colorful\" place not too far down Eastern, and it's far superior to the local, \"modern\" Mediterranean chain which has also received Chipotle-esque comparisons. This is worth the drive even if you're clear across town."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Very fresh and creative ingredients. It's like a Mediterranean Chipotle: bowls or pita wraps, choice of hummus, lettuce, protein, rice, lentils, toppings ranging from pomegranate seeds to apple slaw to pickled onions, fresh mint, etc and choice of sauces. The bowls are generous and it was only $10.50. The service was very helpful and the atmosphere is bright, inviting and clean."}
{"text":"We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.

HUMMUS is terrific.  It is a small place, a little tricky to find, that offers excellent flavor varieties of hummus and middle eastern food.  It is set up similar to a Chipotle in that you choose your hummus base, your greens, your rice or black beans, your protein which consists of beef, chicken, lamb, grilled vegetables and other choices, your sauces and enjoy it in a large bowl or wrap configuration.   It is outstanding! Healthy, vegan and gluten free options if you prefer.   The flavors are magnificent, the ingredients fresh, the serving size is ample and a value for the price.  They also have unique soft drink flavors.  This is not your run-of-the-mill middle eastern restaurant.   It is very casual and comfortable.  Old movies play on the wall while you eat which is fun.

Love this place.  Great tastes, fresh and healthy choices, excellent value.  It is worth searching out.  In a sea of restaurants, HUMMUS stands out as an excellent choice that we can heartily commend to you."}
{"text":"This place is great, and they have gluten free options too!"}
{"text":"Good fast food. You get to choose from a variety of options to make the bowl or wrap exactly how you like it. I like the vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"Fresh flavors and so many options. I wouldn't know just what to recommend because you can make so many different combos. I'm not vegan but my friend who is dragged me here and I actually skipped the meats because the veggies looked so delicious. I look forward to coming back here and trying more of their options. It's the perfect place when you want something that tastes good and feels healthy!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely the best, healthy and refreshingly delicious. I enjoyed it very much and will be back for more."}
{"text":"First of all, excellent customer service.  Second of all,  amazing choices of items. Third of all, every choice you make will have you coming back as a regular."}
{"text":"I was in Henderson for a doctor's appointment. I was looking for a healthy place to eat afterwards and found this place on Yelp. It is hands down the BEST meal I've had in a super long time! I seriously can't believe this restaurant isn't available all over the United States! I am so sad there is only one and that they are so far from my house. I seriously need one of these closer to me. The world should not be deprived of this deliciousness! The recipes for each item are so fresh and so full of flavor! 
I went with the roasted veggie hummus bowl with a variety of lettuce and a combo of rice and black lentils. I got to pick several other toppings to go with my bowl. All recipes are his family recipes and are so very yummy! I really hope they start opening this restaurant up everywhere because it's a true hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Overall great food, service, and presntation! Very clean fresh and beautiful. Our first time and we all absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! This isn't your average bowl mixology joint, every single ingredient they carry is fresh and almost all of it is made in-house, down to the healthy drinks. In fact, it's pretty hard to find anything here that is unhealthy! This was my FIRST VISIT and I loved the decor walking in, plus you are greeted immediately! The setup is nice and the service was fantastic, very accommodating and informative. 

I was able to sample a few things before selecting and thank goodness because the bean-free hummus that I was curious about was OUTTA SIGHT! You do have to like garlic, and many of the selections are garlicky, but still yummy as ever. With the create-your-own-bowl concept, like any other place, you begin with a base, add a protein, and then go crazy with the toppings. What I liked about this joint is that they focus on spread (hummus, baba ghanoush, etc) as the base rather than greens or rice. One of the bowl selections available is a green or grain, but they are more of an accent instead of a \"bowl filler.\"  

I HIGHLY recommend the bean-free hummus; it's a spinach and artichoke concept with tahini but it's the tastiest spread they have. I also fell in love with their halloumi, both it and the falafel are cooked to order and these are the little things that set this place apart. The falafel is good, albeit a bit heavy on the spice side, tasted like a little too much cumin or ground coriander, but still great and fluffy inside. 

At HUMMUS, they also make almost all of the topping ingredients in-house, even the pickled onions! The apple and fennel slaw was one of my favorites in the toppings area. You can pretty much go crazy with toppings and all of it is good! They can also top it all off with a sauce (like spicy or traditional garlic sauce) and their house-made spicy seasoning or a crunchy addition like fried chickpeas or sunflower seeds!

In the end, the \"bowlology\" experience at HUMMUS  was like no other and I can't wait for my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious! The staff couldn't have cared less about service or customers needs. Felt like we were an imposition to counter staff while trying to order. Too bad."}
{"text":"Discovered Hummus on yelp. This place looks really clean and the food was super tasty and affordable. I love all the option tl build your bowl or wrap. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Super good tasting food with a ton of different flavor. I plan on being a regular here. I really like it."}
{"text":"Food was really great. Tasty and fresh. My reason for the 3 star rating was for the customer service. There isn't any. It was my family's first time at Hummus and we explained this to the person at the front counter. No explanation of selecting from the menu or even welcoming us."}
{"text":"Wow. That is the last time I read Yelp reviews. I hate to be rude, but you people shouldn't be reviewing food. This place is flat out awful. Wife picked up a beef bowl for me with lentils and the grilled steak is ice cold. Is this supposed to be a salad? There is a small pile of hummus, a small pile of tomatoes, a small pile of black lentils and some spinach with some cold steak on top of it. A hard, over fried side of falafel. How is this five star food? This is a solid two star place, maybe three if they can manage to keep the meat warm. I can hardly blame the restaurant for being this bad when the rest of you have given them five stars. I'm giving them one just to help knock them down where they belong. What a joke. I blame the Yelp reviewers most of all. You're terrible."}
{"text":"Never had this type of food before but it was super good and I also told my friends on Facebook to check it out and told a friend by text we should go."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really worth 5 stars! I know I didn't believe it when I first saw it, but when I tried the food, wow, it's like a flavor explosion in your mouth! It was so good, that. Had to buy another bowl to go for my lunch tomorrow! 

I saw it when I was driving to my workout class, Studio Remixx on Eastern, then I Yelped it, and I knew it was my post workout meal! 

They spread the hummus (4 to choose from!) on the side of the bowl, add veggies, carbs (I didn't get it this time), protein and toppings. I love the crunchy toppings too. So many different toppings to choose from. I got the garlic sauce and it was delicious, I just wanted it in every bite. For $9 lunch, it was totally worth it. On the plus side it's healthy and delicious!! 

I would drive from the other side of town to get Hummus Bowl again. Open one up near Rainbow and 215 please!"}
{"text":"This was a great find for a lunch spot. We were happy to see that it was moderately busy when we went in for lunch as well. The food was awesome and the service was fast and friendly. You can tell that the hummus is made fresh daily and the same goes for the other ingredients as well. You can really taste the freshness in all of it! We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Fast?! Healthy?! IG worthy?! HUMMUS is everything I could wish for and more. When did all these awesome quick lunch spots open up on Eastern?! I'm overwhelmed by all of my food options (and sadly I won't be checking any other restaurants out in the area since I'm happy with HUMMUS on the daily). 
BRAISED LAMB BRAISED LAMB. Shredded, melt in your mouth lamb with the perfect consistency. I won't order any other meats. They convinced me to try the beef once and it was NOT good. Dry and boring compared to the lamb. Don't get it. 
\"Chipotle style\" order at the counter and seat yourself. The line can get a little long at lunch time, but way faster than any sit down place. 
There are 3 tables outside shared with the rest of the complex. It's on the back side of the complex, can't be seen from the Main Street."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! This place is the Mediterranean version of chipotle except with fresher ingredients! Not only fresher, but also a plethora of it too. I am so happy I came across this place on Yelp when arriving to Vegas and looking for dinner. The prices are incredible for the amount of toppings you can get. I chose the chicken bowl and wow the chicken was so flavorful and it paired well with the spicy hummus. 

There was a young man who helped my friend and I and he described everything so well and really helped with pairings. I was hesitant that all my toppings would go well together, but they all really did and there is no maximum on how many toppings you can load into your bowl. 

This place was SOOO good, I was really sad I didn't have a chance to go back before leaving Vegas. I am definitely looking forward to going back to Vegas and having so more HUMMUS!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh

Hummus reminds me of the Bay Area sooo much.

Fast and casual with a hipster vibe and high quality healthy ingredients.

What else can a girl ask for? 

Order your food at the counter and choose which toppings you like, the braised lamb, grilled vegetables, jalapeño hummus, and muhumarra flavors were out of this world delicious. 

They important their tahini directly from Lebanon and it is clear they take serious pride in the quality of their food.

Vegan falafel available.

Vegetarian friendly. 

Indoor seating. 

Beware the shopping center is a pain to get into and out of depending on where you are coming from and trying to go but it is seriously worth it.

I wish Henderson had a salad bar concept like hummus."}
{"text":"This place is insanely good. It's just a matter of time until it takes over the world. Kind of out of the way for me. But I'll make the drive."}
{"text":"Shockingly good. This is a build-your-own concept like Chipotle, poke bowls, and Subway so you choose a protein (beef, chicken, vegan falafel), a base (salad, rice, etc.), types of hummus, and tons of toppings which consist of various vegetables and nuts. Ingredients were very fresh and it comes out to approximately $10 per bowl. I highly recommend getting a bowl with the spicy hummus, braised beef, rice/salad (half of each), your choice of toppings, and their awesome garlic butter. Don't skip the garlic butter.

I wasn't impressed by their falafel, it was hard, dry, and overly salty but the rest was delicious."}
{"text":"Went here last week for the first time.  There are tons of selections for the bowl or wrap, and portions are huge.  Owners were very welcoming, and even gave us free drinks!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. We tried the wrap and it is delish! Customer service is excellent. Love their soda and juice alternative... watermelon mockjito is awesome..."}
{"text":"HUMMUS was everything I hoped for and more! I got an amazing bowl with baba ganoush, baby kale, black lentils, delicious white meat chicken, tons of toppings, amazing sauces, etc. My new favorite place for a quick bite for sure! I will now be in here once or twice a week surely. So happy HUMMUS is now in the anthem area it's just what I was looking for! Service was great, place was hipster and very clean, and the options were endless even if you're a vegetarian, vegan, etc. Prices were amazing too, I think my chicken bowl was less than $8 and it was huuuuge, but I did eat the whole thing since I came here directly from the gym. You have to try it here! I hope this business thrives for a long time! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"You know when you love a place so much that you can't wait to tell everyone about it? Hummus is that place for me! Healthy meets delicious served fast and at a reasonable price.

To start you pick between a bowl and a pita. Then the options include several types of hummus, various greens, protein options, rice, lentils, vegetables, cheese, olives, sauces, and spreads. The combinations seem almost unlimited. Drink options are interesting with specialty sodas and juices. Everything seemed very fresh and we were told the restaurant makes everything daily. 

My bowl definitely tasted fresh and delicious. I went with spicy hummus and loved it mixed with the other flavors in the bowl. The chicken was nicely charred from the grill, but still moist. The garlic sauce was yummy as well as the mint tzatziki. My husband loved his pita and he isn't the type to touch healthy food normally. Both options included more than enough food.

The inside of the restaurant is simple and clean. It's pleasant for a quick and casual option. Staff was friendly and quick to explain how everything worked when we walked in."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised after trying this place - very flavorful sauces, veggies, and good quality protein. Great for a post workout meal! I got the bowl and could have saved the other half for lunch the next day. Normally I am hesitant eating at the healthier establishments because of my budget, and the situation is usually a small portion of food for an expensive price, which is understandable. It's hard to come by healthy food places to eat here on Eastern... I am definitely making regular visits here from now on."}
{"text":"A-OK!

This place reminds me of a lighter take on a San Diego placed called the \"Kebab Shop\". Similar servings and it's a nice taste when I can't get home for my Mediterranean food fix. 

Bowls and Pita prices are based on the protein you choose. Bowls come on a bed of greens. I really enjoyed my chicken bowl with garlic sauce (YUM), rice, tomatoes, and cucumber. The best surprise were the toasted chick peas and pita chips! Yum!

Their website is still a WIP so use Yelp's handy user photos of an idea of their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. So many options for vegetarians and carnivores. From the hummus to the toppings, everything tastes extremely delicious and is really fresh. The staff and management was super helpful as it was my first time there. I cannot wait to come back! This place might be my new staple!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I live in Summerlin and I drove over because of all the amazing things I have heard about this place! There is options for everyone so no one will leave dissatisfied! Very healthy and fulfilling alternative for anyone looking to eat for a better tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had a chance get it together and get down to HUMMUS! The variety of options are fresh making it incredibly easy to get carried away...you will want to try it all! The pita fries are especially good for dipping up any leftover hummus in your bowl. I'm pretty sure we've been there at least once a week over the last few months. From bowls to wraps or even the halloumi hash, go #gethumbowled"}
{"text":"My first time here this evening. I stopped by after getting my nails done. I'm so glad I did!!!  Hummus has such an amazing vibe when you walk in. The customer service is awesome from the young man that works there, he really helped me with everything step by step. The Falafel is THE BEST I have come across in LV, I can't begin to describe the food; I would be here all night. I was pleased I was able to have a Vegan hummus bowl with any options to chose from!!!! Also the \"a must try\" the watermelon water.  I'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This \"new\" restaurant is such a great little place.  You get delicious food in a bowl that can serve up to 2 people and still be full.  I'm new here myself so having found this healthy spot I am really happy.  I look forward to showing up again whenever I'm schlepping over to the Henderson area.  It definitely is a place to try out and enjoy if you're ever in the Vegas area.  Henderson is just down the strip and this place is quite the find."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place 6/5 I would. It is seriously freaking amazing!! Think of chipotle, but Mediterranean style with super fresh and delicious ingredients.

I came on a Saturday for lunch with some friends. The location is a bit hidden in a strip mall, but the interior is super cute. You have the option between a bowl or pita, choice of hummus, choice of greens, rice, lentils, and tons of delicious toppings and sauces. I personally recommend the garlic sauce and spicy hummus.

For this most recent visit I went with a bowl including spicy hummus, romaine, rice, roasted vegetables, olives, cucumber, tomatoes, and garlic sauce. The portion was huge and it's vegetarian friendly. What's not to love?!

The only sad part about this place is how far away it is from me, ugh! Please I'm begging you to open a location in Summerlin or the west side!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Completely. Friendly staff. Delicious delicious delicious. I got the baba g, Rice, chicken, veggies, and a bunch of toppings. It was 100% gluten free, super filling, fresh, and tasty. I was impressed with all of the fresh, homemade ingredients. Very affordable with lots of gluten free and vegan options."}
{"text":"I just wanted healthy food in Vegas. It was delicious, fresh and full of flavor. Exactly want my body needed after eating bad casino food. And not to expensive. The bowl was big enough for a mid day meal for two."}
{"text":"Amazing and always fresh healthy Mediterranean/Lebanese DIY/Chipotle style but on a higher nutritious value and no sugar added fountain drinks.
Grateful they opened this location near my home, and with my new year resolutions, this is the one spot I would frequent multiple times per week.
It is soul food for me, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff greets u with a smile. The food is delicious!!! Its excellent quality ingredients.. i recommend the hot chili harissa with the lamb. I chose everything and tasted all the sauces, home made fresh quality! Definitely will be back!

They have nice drink options as well! Love the watermelon \"mock\"jito and currant thyme drinks.. thank goodness we found this place!"}
{"text":"OMG this was good. I've been wanting to try this new spot out for a couple of weeks and I'm so glad I finally got the chance! 

The location is tucked away in the shopping center but is still easy to find. The interior is clean and bright and while there is seating inside, the bowls are easy to take to go. 

The food was super delicious and fresh. The owner was there when we went in to pick up dinner and told us that they make pretty much everything in house and that absolutely nothing is frozen. I decided to go with a bowl with classic hummus, lamb, and a number of toppings (my favorites were the quinoa and the pickled onion which is made in house as well). We also decided to share an order of falafel, which was a great choice as the falafel was cooked to order and absolutely perfect. 

I can't wait to come back here. This is a great place to pick up a quick and healthy lunch or dinner to go and I fully intend to do that again soon."}
{"text":"This place is like a Mediterranean chipotle. You can get a wrap or a bowl. I chose a zucchini hummus and baba ganoush (sp?) with spinach, rice, assorted toppings with tzatziki and Garlic sauce. It's a wet kind of salad, but all of my favorite flavors were represented. There was more on the menu, but I couldn't focus on all of that. I had to restrain myself from licking the bowl. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised how yummy good the food taste!  Veggie option as well; always good to have options.  Fresh fresh food with friendly service is always a great combination topped with reasonable prices.  Great addition to Henderson!  If this new spot keeps these important 'ingredients',  I will definitely be their loyal customer"}
{"text":"I tried here on a whim as my regular place closed. This was better and beyond expectations. The hummus here is out of this world. The flavor is loaded in every bite. The server, Chaz, told me to get the lamb which I'm quite pleased by. The lamb has a good texture and good mix with the rest of my bowl. Go here ASAP and ask Chaz to make it. You will be appreciative of the food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after I got off work & im soooo glad I did. I've had this place bookmarked for a while but it's such a long way from my house! 

So I came in and the guy behind the counter kindly explained to me how their system worked. It's pretty much the chipotle system! You first pick the kind of hummus you want, I got the spicy one. Then, greens - I opted for spinach. Afterwards, lentils or rice - I did half & half! Then, you pick what kind of meat - I got their falafel! Their falafels are made to order so it's really fresh. After, you get to pick your toppings & you can put however much you want on there, no extra charge! I had to wait a little for my falafels but let me tell you... the wait is totally worth it!! Probably the best falafels I've had in Vegas! It's crispy and fresh and just so good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"It was just past 8PM on a recent Thursday evening when my wife and I arrived at this restaurant.  Other than another couple who were finishing their meal, we were the only ones in the restaurant other than 2 employees.  Our choices were limited because several items, notably the salad greens had not been replenished even though the restaurant was not schedule to close for almost 2 hours.  There were only a few pieces of Romaine in the tray and the spinach was wet and looked unappetizing. Each of the available meat choices appeared to be dried out from sitting too long so my wife decided to go with the roasted vegetables adding classic hummus as a base plus black lentils, arugula, tomatoes and sunflower seeds with a citrus mint dressing.  My bowl was filled with arugula, tasteless herbed rice, flamed (dried out) chicken, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, pomegranate seeds and feta with the same dressing.  We found the quantity of rice/black beans to be excessive in relation to the remaining ingredients so the overall flavor profile came up short."}
{"text":"*update* The owner actually listened to our review, changed the beef so it is more tender and invited us back. They even added a shredded beef option which reminds me of Mexican Birria, for those that are familiar. Both were great! I've never seen a restaurant listen to their customers and adapt this quickly to make things better and earn their business. This place is a must try! It is both delicious and a healthy choice which is hard to find. I invited my coworker this time and he loved it. Will definitely be coming back over and over."}
{"text":"What a great find. I stop in here at least twice a week. Everything is so fresh and delicious. The service is outstanding. And it's cheap for everything you get. I normally have them pick what I'm going to eat. They know what goes best. It's a great way to break out of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mediterranean style food I've had in Henderson, EVER! When you walk in you immediately smell all of the delicious ingredients they have to offer.

I had heard this place was like a Mediterranean chipotle but that doesn't even come close to doing it justice! They literally have dozens of toppings you can add to your bowl at NO EXTRA CHARGE! Forget about getting Nickel and dimed at other restaurants! I typically eat more than most and I could barely finish my bowl, by far the best portion sizes I've ever seen.

If your in Henderson or Las Vegas you HAVE to try this place out you want be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow! Healthy and delicious.  All the ingredients were super fresh.  Fun way to create a bowl with Humus, greens, chicken, rice, lentils and more.  Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise. Staff was very friendly, and my bowl was exceptional. The menu was very easy to read and follow. Ingredients tasted fresh, especially the sauces!! Yummy. I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! The girl working was super helpful explaining to me what would taste good with what. Everything tasted fresh and I felt good about what I ate even though I pretty much licked the bowl clean. The only issue I can see is seating is tight but I went at an off time so it was fine."}
{"text":"This spot is for sure 5*! Everything incl. customer service, food choice, quality, price was incredible. Shout out to Jay who made my first time there a treat with an amazing bowl made with love! I am already craving this place again even though I am still stuffed lol
I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"I personally like the entire experience. A healthy place which is awesome! You got to pick your hummus and your toppings . We had both the spicy and the regular hummus which both were tasty. Tried the Halloum side which was ok but the falafel was the only thing that was flavorLESS. That's the only thing that needs improvement. Besides that the people that work there were very pleasurable and nice which is always a good reason to come back. Thumbs up for me"}
{"text":"Bumping up my rating. Great customer service. Came here again, got the veggies instead of falafel. Food was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Drove by and decided to check this place out and I'm obsessed! I will definitely be recommending this to friends and will be coming back. Chicken bowl with spicy hummus, so delicious"}
{"text":"The food was good but it not clean. Behind the counter looked like it was not wiped down at all that day. There was trash and food all over the floor. The tables were smeared with food and even the chairs were dirty. I really liked the food but will not go back due to how dirty they were."}
{"text":"The flavors are out of this world!! The service is really great too! I had tried the baba ganoush on my first visit but it was a bit too lemony for me.  On my second visit I asked the nice girl with the pretty eye makeup which was her fave. She suggested The \"market\" bean-free zucchini \"hummus\" or the spicy hummus. I opted for half and half of each and OMG! I am in loveeee.  My go-to from here on out is: roasted veggie bowl, extra veggies. Those veggies are soooo flavorful! Half zucchini half spicy hummus. Rice and lentils. No greens. Allllll the toppings except for pickles. Extra beets extra pickled onions. Alll the sauces except garlic and house dressing. Pita croutons.  Mix it all up and the explosion of flavor is unreal!! Also HUGE portions that fed me 3 times!"}
{"text":"I came here during lunch and I liked the affordable price and fast service. This is a build your own bowl kinda place which I appreciate the opportunity to choose from multiple veggies and meat options. 

I chose the bowl with the classic hummus. Since I am not a picky eater I basically selected pretty much all the options on my bowl. I also chose the lamb and about three very flavorful sauces.

I really enjoyed my meal especially knowing that I was eating something healthy. After finishing I felt satisfied...not overly full. I really liked how well the food felt in my system. 

The only thing I was not a fan of was how soggy the bottom of my bowl felt with the hummus. It was a tasty flavor but not the best texture. 

If I am ever in the area I would def stop here again. Thank you for your time and service!"}
{"text":"Came back and tried different toppings this time.  Glad they allow the option to do half rice and black lentils. Once again I went with the lamb. Consistent from the first time. As Najib promised, their market dip (bean free dip) changes. Today was spinach and sesame. Muhammara was great.  Harissa not as spicy as I've encountered at other places.  Whomever said the flavors just blend together needs to not come to such places because every flavor I chose comes through cleanly. From the citrus mint dressing, the tanginess of the pickles, the lamb, brined kalamta olives, roasted chick peas, etc. Once again, portion is huge! Love it."}
{"text":"Alright, BEST falafel. hands down. Fresh veggies & out of this world spices and seasonings. My boyfriend is a falafel head so we ordered a falafel wrap with side of falafel. Basically chipotle style hummus bowls and wraps.

On the wrap we added Baba G., kale, romaine lettuce, black lentils, herbed tomatoes, diced beets, and a red sauce that was spicy and amazing (I forgot what they called it). 

They've got a variety of hummus flavors to choose from along with a bunch of sauces like tzaziki (did I spell that right?), tahini, and red sauces and a garlic paste. Ah! So many amazing options! Gonna have to go back and try different wraps.

They've got Stubborn Soda with unique flavors and juices such as currant thyme to choose from! Let's just say I tasted every one before I decided on a drink. They're all good but I ended up with orange hibiscus.

It's a cute restaurant And they play black and white movies on the wall. Will be back again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!   We haven't seen a fresh, creative place like Hummus before.   The food is made fresh daily and the staff is super helpful with explaining everything.   I had the hummus bowl with lamb and roasted veggies- absolutely delish!!   I did a combination of the original hummus and market hummus (no bean).   Also tried a side of falafel- they're made fresh to order.   Great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wow! I wish I had this place in my hometown. Delicious, healthy meal on the go. And reasonably priced for what you can get. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves a delicious healthy meals on the go. Once you try them out, I'm sure you'll be a regular :)"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place! I have been driving past it for months, as I live right by it. Used to be a coffee shop I believe?

So, my husband isn't in to this kind of \"healthy\" stuff, like at all. I drug him here anyway. They have steak, so he was happy. 

I ordered a bowl. I will try to remember all of my ingredients! I got the eggplant hummus, romaine and spinach, black lentils, roasted mixed veggies, about 15 toppings, and the herb tahini dressing on the top. My toppings included tomatoes, cucumbers, apple slaw, quinoa, feta cheese, sunflower seeds, and beets. I'm sure there was more! 

We also got the pita chips, and got to sample their new peanut butter desert hummus. Yum!

Almost forgot, I got the pineapple cream soda.... tastes like desert :)

I will def be back! Not sure about my husband, but my 3 year not only loved her side of rice, but loved the music and was dancing all over the place. We can do mommy daughter dates!"}
{"text":"According to the server, everything is made from scratch, using non-GMO ingredients.
Their spicy hummus was very tasty. Nice Jalapeno kick! One of veggie topping I fell in love was Diced Beets!
I'm not sure if it was pickled, but I could munch that all by itself. 
My husband and I had bowls... Next time, will try Pita."}
{"text":"I was looking for something new and stumbled upon this restaurant. The food was amazing and you get a lot for your buck!!! The location is tricky to find as it's on the back side of the building but it seems to be popular. I recommend this place if your into Mediterranean style."}
{"text":"Looks like a new favorite in the neighborhood, healthy, all organic and DELICIOUS!!! I told them to make me up something and whatever they put together was the bomb!! 4 different types of hummus for the base of your bowl, like 5 different kinds of greens, 3 different proteins and toppings galore! I'll definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this spot! I reallly wanted to! 

Friday morning after a night of obliteration in the town, I wanted to eat something fresh and healthy. Naturally I opened up my handy dandy yelp bookmarks to find a new spot to try! Came across hummus! Was amped about going for Mediterranean as I love the spices that Mediterranean food consists of. 

This joint is another chipotle for Mediterranean food! You pick your base, your toppings, your meat, your sauce etc! I came for a salad and got hardly any salad. My bowl was thoroughly and unequivocally wet from the hummus they spread around the bowl. Mind you, it wasn't wet from dressing! I got the dressing on the side! I was dying for something healthy, light, and refreshing! 

Unfortunately for me, the wetness ruined my entire bowl! Wasn't for me! Maybe the next time, if I return, I'll probably do the hummus on the side??? 
I didn't even end up finishing my bowl, not even half way before I couldn't do the wetness anymore. 

Advice: get the hummus on the side!! 

They do play old school films on the projector on the wall though. Super cool touch!"}
{"text":"I finally got over to Hummus today after seeing all of the great reviews on Yelp and I was not disappointed! I tried the bowl with classic hummus, romaine, steak, beets, feta, herb rice, red pepper spread, and toasted toppings. It was out if this world and I can't help but notice how reasonable this all was for under $10! 

I can't wait to come back and I think I'm going to be a regular! They need some kind of loyalty program is the only advice I can give them!"}
{"text":"This place was ahhhhmazing. It's like a BYO Mediterranean spot. I got a bowl with chicken, lentils, hummus, garlic sauce (ask them to go light on it it's very powerful), crispy chickpeas, and arugula. They also carry healthier sodas and non added sugar teas and mock(tails)! This place is far from my house since it is close to Anthem. I loved their coca-cola they had! The other sodas tasted a bit weird.

It's in a very awkward spot so the GPS took me to a different strip mall. The facility is very clean, the staff are very nice and patient as well. I had so many questions and they didn't mind me at all :) overall amazing prices, high quality food, and nice staff. I will be back if I'm in the Henderson/Anthem area!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably amazing! Easy to find parking, and you're greeted by kind staff and a warm atmosphere. The menu is easy to read, and the server allowed me to mix n match my proteins, veggies, etc. This helped because they have what seems to be unlimited veggies+ toppings, ALL DELICIOUS AND UNIQUE! It'll come to around $8-$10 and it was filling. Let me tell you that I lasted 8+ hours before eating another meal because I was so full"}
{"text":"If we lived on this side of town, we would be here all the time. The lamb was to-die-for, and the lentils were the perfect offset for its richness. The hummus itself was flavorful, and the staff did a great job walking the newbies I brought with me through Mediterranean cuisine. The choices for drinks were also fabulous. Great soda and non-carbonated varieties. I've suggested it to everyone I know who lives in the area!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but when I walked in, i told them I've never been there before so the employee walked me through everything and answered all my questions and gave great suggestions. 

I think you get a good amount of food for the price and even unlimited toppings so I was able to save my bowl for another meal which was really nice! They have great vegan options as well."}
{"text":"This food was amazing! So colorful, tasteful, and unique. I love Mediterranean food anyway, but this had all kinds of topping to create your very own. It was my first time here and it was explained with patience and kind explanation from a young guy up front. Thank you for the amazing food and awesome attitude! I got one bowl with grilled chicken and one bowl with the shredded lamb - definitely recommend the lamb! This place is a 10/10"}
{"text":"I knew this place was going to be good!  OMG it is even better than I expected.  The owner Najib is super friendly.  I met him before Hummus opened, he answered a few questions for me.  And after that I waited, and waited for it to open!  So yesssssss, this is some amazing food.  It's different, it's fresh, it's all made in house.  There are no freezers in the back.  They explain the ingredients, that you might not know what it is.  Hunny 'cha  don't even ask me all that I put in my bowl, because, I had to ask quite a few questions about what this was or what that was.  And my bowl came out amazing!  I hope I can recreate it when I go back.  So you can do it in a bowl or on pita bread.  If you like hummus, you really should check it out.  Heck, even if you don't like hummus, you don't have to have the hummus on your bowl or pita.  But it's worth checking out if you want something fresh with organic ingredients.  This is also a good place for Vegan's and vegetarians."}
{"text":"Excellent little spot.  The food is fresh healthy and amazing. 

Hard to find as Its in back of the mall but well worth the search. I could eat hear everyday. Staff is friendly and store is super clean."}
{"text":"Excellent food & friendly staff. Really glad I found this place for lunch today. Simple, but pleasant environment. The owner came out to introduce himself, and was very personable."}
{"text":"I'm way too lazy to Yelp usually but this place is too delicious to not give a shout out to. I've tried just about everything here and it's all tasty af. Pitas are huge, bowls are plenty of portion. The amount of topping choices is amazing-pretty much all of them very nutritious. If you like clean yet deliciously healthy food you need to try this place. Prices are very fair, staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Vegan/gluten free friendly place! So in love with what I ordered! So delicious and flavorful  must try this place! Friendly staff and knowledgeable. Literally drive by this place many times and finally get to try it! So good!"}
{"text":"I cannot wait to come back here! The food was super fresh and delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful! They were also very knowledgeable about their ingredients and how things are sourced and prepared, a true testament to its freshness! 

I love Mediterranean cuisine, and this place did not disappoint. I try to eat vegan when I can, and this place makes it easy for Vegans/Vegetarians. I had a Vegan falafel bowl with spicy hummus, rice, lentils and kale. They have a huge selection of toppings to choose from and lots of in-house made dressings and sauces. There's no freezer in the place, most of their stuff is made in-house, and it's a family owned business.  I took my order to go but the facility was very clean and I love the decor!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The quality, the atmosphere, and the attention to detail is on point. Rather than feeling heavy after eating, I feel completely energized while being full (thought about getting more to go just to have some more for later). I got lamb the first time around but I will definitely be back to try to chicken. Did I mention the sauces are amazing!!! Don't forget to try all the soda flavors. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best tasting clean eating restaurants I have ever been to. I got a hummus bowl (pic attached) and it was absolutely amazing! Will definitely be coming back soooooon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Hummus , amazing food, very fresh and delicious, one of the best  mediterranean restaurants I have ever tried .... very recommended 
Good job guys"}
{"text":"So good, so fresh! Large portions made in a sort of Chipotle style. Friendly staff. Perfect pricing. All that to say, \"We'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Tried this out for the first time today and it was really delicious! Got a spicy hummus bowl with vegan falafels. And it was only 8$! Will be back here again"}
{"text":"Like other reviews have noted this is basically a chipotle with Mediterranean flavors.  You get a choice of a bowl or a pita wrap and then fill up to your heart's desire.  My pita wrap was just as filling as my sister's bowl, can't go wrong with either option.  My sister and I both agree that we much prefer the overall taste of the food here compared to other similar type restaurants we've been to in The Valley.   Portion sizes are a great value and most importantly the variety of available toppings is amazing.  Loved the seasoned cherry tomatoes, pickled onions, tabouli - think those will be my staples when I return.  Can't wait to go back and try the other \"hummus\" offerings of babaganoush and/or the bean free option.  If it's anything like the classic and spicy I know I won't be disappointed.   I just wish this was closer to where I lived in the SW."}
{"text":"I would love to love this place as much as everyone else seems to but so far I'm not entirely sold. I've been here a couple of times and heard the spiel both times... they don't even own a freezer, everything's made fresh, yada yada. I love that concept but hated that i damn near lost a tooth unexpectedly biting into a massive bone in my chicken. The last time I was in I didn't like that the guy at the counter stopped preparing my meal to tell newcomers about the restaurant. I was held up while they asked questions and, being in with my fussy toddler, i couldn't appreciate the delay. A simple, I'll be right with you after I finish up here\" could have went a long way right then. Friendly service but could afford to learn to prioritize customers in a fairer way. 

The hummus and baba ganoush are excellent. I had really liked the chicken but, after the bone incident, I think I'm kind of scarred. Roasted veggies are delish but I think they are an extra charge to an already somewhat pricey meal. And finally, my bowl just wasn't that filling for dinner, and I loaded up on toppings so something was amiss. Maybe more protein and less lettuce? I don't know.

I don't want to write this place off just yet but I'm not fully buying in right now. Improvements are needed."}
{"text":"We pass this place almost every day and finally decided to stop in.  The entrance is around the back of the shopping plaza. 

The young man behind the counter was extremely helpful.  He explained how it all worked. Whether you're getting a bowl or a pita wrap, you choose a flavor of hummus, greens, grains, protein etc (like Chipotle), finish it off with a dressing and you have a monster of a meal. I wasn't sure if it would be my thing, but I was pleasantly surprised. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. The young man even gave us two cups to taste their home made beverages. Service was prompt, courteous and everything looked and tasted fresh. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"If flavors could speak they'd have been shouting. The food is delicious and not your typical gyro meats on bread that you find in many casual eateries. Like Chipotle, the menu is simple; pick hummus base then meat if you want, beans, rice pomegranate and leafy veggies. What you end up with is a bowl of flavor so good you'd be had pressed to leave any at the end of your meal. Of course I should mention that the staff are friendly and can easily recommend ingredients to those who are new as I was. They also have 3 unique drinks to choose from or standard fountain flavors. I stumbled upon this restaurant on my lunch break after a rough morning at work. I left glad to have stopped in."}
{"text":"Absolutely the healthiest, cheapest fast food I've ever had! The customer service was very personal and I felt very welcomed in. I definitely recommend it for any vegetarians/vegans that try to watch what they eat: even the meat comes from a genuine non gmo, naturally feed farms"}
{"text":"Hummus is this cute spot tucked in Henderson. My friend suggested this spot after a post workout. It's a DEFINITE must go back! I wish they had more locations. They have this cute chalkboard menu and ambiance. 

I just decided to go order by best suggestions. I ordered the spinach artichoke hummus bowl with kale, black rice, tomatoes, beets, feta cheese, cucumber, olives, toasted chickpeas, roasted veggies- varies by season. It was definitely AMAZING! Super fresh and well packed all for $10! I even ordered the pita fries. 

I asked for multiple dressings on the side and the mint balsamic was my favorite."}
{"text":"There's nothing but good things to say about Hummus! 
We've been waiting on this location to open for quite some time and the wait was well worth it! 

Food: It's pretty simple! You get to choose a hummus flavor as a base, then select your greens that they have available, do rice or beans or half and half, then choose a protein and load on the topping options! Since we do about 80% plant based eating, we were in the right spot! I chose the plain hummus, kale greens, half beans and half rice, and falafel for my protein. On top I did cucumbers, their quinoa mixture, beets, fennel slaw, tahini sauce, garlic spread and chickpeas! The serving size was huge and the flavors were perfect! 

Service: the staff was helpful and friendly. For our first time, they answered all of my questions even if the answers were right in front of me lol.

Atmosphere: Hummus is big enough for a larger party or for a couple of people to enjoy their time together. It's not too big or too small. There's even outdoor seating tables which we loved to let our little one eat (messily) and run amuck afterwards. 

Location: Located on the rear of the shopping plaza, Hummus is tucked away in a nice spot. Off of Sunridge and Eastern, I won't complain that it's so close to home! 

Overall - We're hooked and are happy to find a super affordable healthy eats joint since we're not huge cooks in our house!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is always the bomb diggity but the quality here is out of dis world!! Everything is fresh (no freezer), truly authentic, non-GMO, organic, etc.

We both got massive wraps (like massive), as well as pita fries and drinks on the house. So thankful for an owner that literally let us try everything, every sauce and hummus, and gave us the opportunity to try the other unique stuff on the menu!! The pita fries were so good dipped into the tzaztiki and the harissa sauces. Kinda like the crunchy fries at the bottom of the bag taste. And we got to try all of their fresh juices (there was a cucumber melon, watermelon \"mock\"jito, currant, etc) and they also had organic sodas to choose from. They had a bitchin selection of sauces and hummus. The spinach and artichoke hummus, chili harissa sauce, tahini, and the tzatziki were our favorites. Listen to what the owner says when he recommends something - he knows his stuff.

I thought that I was very well-versed in authentic med. food until we came here. :) Shoutout to the owner for letting us try everything and not making fun of us when we butchered all the pronunciation of the food. PS Very vegan friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is such an awesome find! A delicious spin on bowl style eating with a unique variety of healthy options. Everything was fresh and the prices were reasonable, highly recommend and will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Fresh healthy food! We stopped her for dinner on night and it was delicious. Definitely not a date night place but the food was good and the kids even enjoyed it. Wish we had one back home."}
{"text":"This place is like Chipotle but with hummus. Such a brilliant concept, I only wish they had more locations! You choose a type of hummus (I got the spicy) and then your choice of meat (he let me get a little meat and a little of the roasted veggies) and then any topping you want just like Chipotle. The gentlemen behind the counter were very very pleasant. Wonderful place! Enough for lunch the next day. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wish there were a hummus near our house in Los Angeles! This is a fantastic concept: fresh, gourmet sides of highest quality. You create your own bowls or wraps. They have del"}
{"text":"Wow - We read all of the great Yelp reviews and had to give this place a shot.  It SURPASSED expectations....It is AMAZING!  Everything is sooo fresh - You build your own hummus bowl, starting with hummus and greens and then add any of about 30 different toppings.  I have been there 5 or 6 times since first trying it 3 weeks ago and have never waited more than 5 minutes for my food.  How great is that?  Hummus will now be a weekly part of my dining plans."}
{"text":"This is one of the best healthy restaurants in Vegas. I definitely recommend the HumBowl with romaine, rice, chicken, and the citrus mint dressing. Pita wraps are great too! The fresh squeezed juices are perfect, and so is the resteraunt atmosphere! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to check this place out for lunch since it was new.. 

it was hard to find because i didn't see it from the street.. turns out.. you have to drive in the complex and go around building in order to find it.. 

parking is a bit packed since there are other places to eat/shop and also there are local businesses in the area.. 

walking in.. its very open and clean.. the decor.. like most restaurants / cafes i've been going has the typical ikea essentials.. 

being that it was lunch time.. there was a line to order.. and unfortunately, there was only one person working behind the counter.. and the people in front of us was new to Mediterranean style food so it took a little longer.. 

finally was our turn.. and we too had some questions about their menu.. the girl was very nice and she took the time explaining it to us.. even though there was a long line behind us.. 

price was ok.. and the quality of food was ok.. i was expecting more for the price.. and i was expecting the food to taste a bit better... compared to other Mediterranean food...

will try and give it a go again one day.."}
{"text":"love love love. Everything about it.  Has been consistent since they opened.  I wish there were multiple locations around the valley.  The chicken is so tender and juicy."}
{"text":"My buddy said I should try this place and when he told me it was a Mediterranean place, I thought it was going to be another kebab type place. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it wasn't. Taking on the fresh bowl concept, Hummus provides lots of options and so far, all taste great. I had the classic hummus with lentils, arugula and steak with a bunch of nice toppings. Very tasty. I will be coming back as there are a bunch of combinations I want to try. It's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Love it! So glad I live close by this eatery. I love the bowls that you can customize anyway you want. They are never stingy with the toppings and everything is fresh and tasty. All the people working are so helpful and friendly, I can definitely eat here every week. Def try the halloumi hash, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"First time trying Hummus and man was I blown away!! Food was excellent and customer service was superb. I will definitely be making more visits here!!"}
{"text":"Ok seriously if I could give this place six stars I would!!! And I'm a picky eater! They use really fresh ingredients and it shows. Flavors are out of this world good and the atmosphere is very nice. I got the salad bowl with tons of toppings on it! Definitely stop in here for lunch! The hummus is amazing and we got a dessert on the house that is done type of chickpea peanut butter mouse but holy cow It was amazing!! My favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, I'm not too big on Mediterranean food but I did enjoy this place. The chicken had good flavor but I didn't like the shredded lamb I'm not a big lamb person to begin with so not for me. The bowl situation is pretty cool, feel like you're getting chipotle or something but with a different flavor profile. Their fountain sodas are all interesting as well I believe they are all organic with cane sugar or agave, the flavor I tried was pineapple cream soda and it was pretty good. This place is tucked away but it's not too hard to find."}
{"text":"The concept is a great twist on your classic Greek food. Great tasting sodas and delicious meats/toppings to choose from in a way that you can choose what you want on your pita wrap. Clean environment with enthusiastic employees. Restaurant is new so give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is kinda hidden.. but great food !! And also hoping for more locations !:)"}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  Found it thanks to Yelp.  It's kind of hidden, but that is the only downside.  Grilled chicken was flavorful and tender. All of the different kinds of hummus were delicious. Greens were on ice, fresh and crispy. Roasted veggies, garlic sauce, tahini, tzakiki, and everything else we so good!"}
{"text":"There food is so good! Staff is very friendly. Have been here twice now and both times the food was great and staff was pretty helpful to a new comer here."}
{"text":"Such an amazing fresh healthy eating experience that you can tailor so many different ways. The best of quality and price!! There is nothing like this. And they are totally well done for people with allergies!! A must!! My new favorite for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Authentic Middle Eastern Homemade, the owner stole his Mom's receipies! Smart Guy!
Like Chipotle you build your own; picking all your ingredients. However, unlike Chipotle.... everything is Fresh, made on location! Service is also Grade A, they will guide you through the process to make your personalized gourmet feast! Make sure you try one of their exotic fresh beverages. I had the watermelon mock jito! Most refreshing. Try this place for a wonderful healthy meal, great to witch it up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here and that have great food. Been back twice already. Homemade sodas and drinks, gluten free options and paleo friendly. So delicious and will definitely make this a place to go when we are in town!"}
{"text":"So yummy!  I live out of state in an area with limited options for fresh creative food choices.  Highly recommended to anyone who wants a health and well thought out meal."}
{"text":"On the rare occasion I make the drive all the way over here, I always want to check out new places to eat, so I saw this one and saw what good reviews it had. At first I thought it was a more dine in place, but it's kind of like chipotle but Mediterranean style. I got the chicken bowl with hummus veggies and the spicy sauce they have. It was really good, and they also had sugar free drinks which were tasty as well. The chicken was alright, I'd probably skip that next time and just stick to the veggies. Cool concept good food and service was good too."}
{"text":"Hummus is a great place to go for lunch.  Fresh food and the best Hummus bowls.  I've been several times."}
{"text":"Difficult to find healthy eats but this hidden gem is delicious!! Great spot for a quick bite. I had the bowl with zuchinni hummus, mixed greens, grilled chicken and topped it off with a variety of of veges. Yum! Too excited to eat to post a pic. This place is definitely worth a try. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! May be my new favorite place for a fast healthy bowl of yum! First of all the service was friendly, knowledgeable, and so accommodating of all my silly questions and requests. I'm a vegetarian and their veggies were so flavorful and well thought out, not just an after thought like most places veggie options. Also the falafels were fantastic, usually I'm not a fan of them but these were fabulous! We will definitely be coming back and telling our friends about this sweet little spot!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Build your own bowl or wrap. The food was fresh and full of flavor. Lots of options. The employees were really nice and helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just got a spicy hummus, white rice, chicken/steak, quinoa, pickled veggies with tzatziki/garlic sauce, bowl from here. What can I say? This is what people on Death Row should order. You can tell every single ingredient is fresh, nutritional and made with love. This place completely raises my standards for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"If this is what healthy eating is...count me in! 

Hummus makes custom Mediterranean inspired bowls and wraps using fresh, healthy ingredients. Most everything is vegetarian/vegan however they do have some meat options for those of us who want it. 

Hummus is open 7 days a week from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM. A little hard to find as it is located in the back of the building. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and explained how it works. You pick a bowl or wrap, one of four hummus selections, one of five greens and then a huge selection of toppings. 

For my bowl I chose: babaganoush, arugula and spinach, lentils, braised lamb, roasted vegetables, quinoa, feta cheese, pomegranate seeds and tzatziki sauce. There are so many different options here you could come back over and over and never have the same thing. 

It was fresh, delicious and very filling. Service was quick and friendly and at under $10 a bowl very reasonably priced. Hummus also has three house made juices to choose from as well which all sounded wonderful. This is a great healthy option for lunch or dinner when in Henderson."}
{"text":"So yummy!!! Great prices and so fresh. Just what we need on south Eastern. Besides the build your own bowl we tried the falafel and loved that too! Definitely will be back soon 
The place is kinda hidden in the back but well worth finding"}
{"text":"It's my favorite lunch spot in Henderson!  Yummy, fast and healthy!  Love that i can customize my bowl!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate mock-up of Chipotle with a Mediterranean take to it, and I am a fan. The only thing that makes me upset about it is that it's not close to where I live. But for driving from southwest to Henderson, this restaurant did not disappoint. 

First, you choose whether you want a bowl or a wrap. And we both chose a bowl, because why not? This is a make-your-own spot so it's great to play around with the ingredients. 

I got the classic hummus with salad, white rice, beans, and lamb. My mistake was getting the tzatziki because they drench your bowl making it look unappetizing, but that was the least of my complaints. It was delicious, flavorful, and filling with all the individual ingredients that worked harmoniously well together. 

The interior of this place was clean and modern which almost reminded me of a cafe rather than a restaurant. It's the perfect place to have lunch with good friends! 

Now, the boiling question of the day: would I come back? Yes!"}
