{"text":"Love this place the food is always great and the workers are so friendly all of the time i highly recommend you just try it ... Oh and the carne asada fries are LIFE"}
{"text":"I always come for the breakfast. I'm never disappointed I usually order the chorizo breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"Tacos were amazing, must have the chips that come out super hot and fresh! Get the guacamole and tacos! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! 
Great salsa bar, warm and crispy tortilla chips! 
Friendly service! 
Ordered 3 tacos. Shrimp, Carne Asada, Carnitas. 
Delicious (from what I could tell) homemade corn tortillas packed with fresh ingredients and delicious meats! Lots of flavor, very good meat. The Carne Asada could've been just a bit better, but I am spoiled as hell by the Mexican Food all over the Valley! A place I will definitely go back to if I am that far West!"}
{"text":"We needed a place to  dine on the West Side. We have our meals here @ LAST TWICE A WEEK.  Have not been able to find  another place that we enioy more than Lazaros.  Very clean and service is great!"}
{"text":"The Open Air Salsa Bar creeped me out.  Clean or Unclean it looked like a Bacteria breeding ground.  The Salsa was room temperature.
The Food ?  Was warm placed in the To-Go Boxes neatly.  But the best part of the  # 17 Meal was the warmed up Flour Tortilla and meat,  the Rice was luke cold and the refried Beans were watery - again this happened before.
  
I won't return or recommend  this place."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good taco shop, but this is definitely the place to go for Mexican food. Food is fresh and they even serve chips."}
{"text":"Nothing el special. About tbis place, enchiladas tasted like it was out of a can, Plus no alcohol! ! Will never return!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place, my husband had the carne asada nachos and I had the carne asada fries which are topped with the exact same thing. (Guac, beans, sour cream and cheese) They were both equally delicious! The service was quick too! The only reason I gave 4 stars was because we had a fish taco that didn't seem to have any flavor, we're still planning on going back to try more food nonetheless."}
{"text":"Is OK for a quick fix. Pretty sure the refried beans are made with lard. So they have a different taste to them.  I had the Steak Rancheros it was pretty good. The broth was the best part.  The meat was very tender.  Make sure to get salsa from the salsa bar, the food is not spicy st all."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week for lunch as I practically work across the street, my faves are the Arizona burrito and the bacon breakfast burrito. The girls are always friendly and the food is reasonably priced. Tip: If you know what you want and want it ready when you get there for takeout then give em a call."}
{"text":"After reading other Yelp reviews we were expecting better. Carne Asada nachos were pretty good as were the tacos and tortilla chips. Enchilada was just okay. I think the tortillas are handmade but the guacamole was disappointedly store bought. However. The service was less than enthusiastic. The one employee we saw chewed gum noisily the whole time we were there. Restaurant was clean but lacked any ambiance and the TV was distracting. Prices were reasonable but I would have gladly paid a little more to have better quality plastic ware and napkins. I would probably go back for take out but not for a sit down experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in after seeing the reviews on yelp and was not disappointed.  I've always been a fan of these no frills local Mexican places. I had the Lazaro burrito and it was fantastic.  The carne asada was very flavorful and there were three or four full size shrimp, the pollo was there but seemed overshadowed by the other flavors. I would agree with some of the other reviews that there wasn't a lot of heat but the salsas were good and I added as desired each bite. The chips and queso were also great, the chips were definitely homemade and fresh. The queso also seemed to be homemade and had just the right amount of chiles or jalapeños in it to be flavorful without being overpowering."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, clean, great salad bar. Accommodating chef!! Great Yummy food!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, reasonable prices and the portions are big. My favorite is the chili Verde burrito with white cheese melt on top yummy!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Coming from living right next to the San Luis border and going for tacos, this place comes dead close to that goodness! Amazing cabeza tacos and the carne asada fries! They def do a great job! I'll be going back for the cabeza tacos for sure"}
{"text":"I have tried fili b's and federicos.. Lazaros is by far the best taco shop in Phoenix! Everything is very very good! Their carne asada burritos, supreme nachos and fish tacos are AMAZING! You really cant go wrong with anything in the menu! Their portions are very well served and They have a full salsa bar that complimets your food very well. The staff is very attentive, friendly and nice.. Its a very low key place to grab a quick bite.. They have no drive-tru but the food is so good its definitely worth getting out of  your car for."}
{"text":"La comida excelente. En mi vida había comido tacos tan ricos. Los tacos al pastor y la carne asada espectacular."}
{"text":"I really did enjoy  this place was the serving size being really good along with the prices. You got real silverware and chips and I love how conveniently close it is to me"}
{"text":"Their rice and beans are so, so delicious! Good place and not busy so you should get your food pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Sadly they don't make breakfast burritos like they used to. The quality has gone down considerably. The only thing I like now, is their red salsa which I'm not gonna drive out of my for."}
{"text":"I have a small sample size.  Stopped in for a carne  asada  burrito. I'm an expert on carne asada.  It was excellent.  The meat was lean and tender.  Tortilla was fresh.  It was one of the better I have had.  It is nice and clean. I didn't have much but what had was 5 star."}
{"text":"Great food!! No customer service whatsoever!! Had the Carne asada nachos very good, huge portion,  crispy chips. Was not greeted at all walked up to the counter after checking out the menu and nothing  just a blank stare I had to greet the cashier.  When food was ready she just walked to the counter screamed my order and walked away. Again might be back for the food if I can get passed the complete lack of customer service."}
{"text":"The chips were fresh, warm and delicious. Our main course was really good and the portion size was more than we could eat. A great place to go if you want good food fast."}
{"text":"This place blows every 'bertos restaurant out of the water, you'll never want to go back to them once you eat here! They don't have a drive through, if they did, there would always be a line. 

Their burritos are huge!  A great value for around $7- $8. 
Lazaro burrito is my favorite, it has beef, chicken, and shrimp w/pico de gallo and guacamole. I ask for extra guacamole and it's extra satisfying!

Carne asada burrito is my second favorite.  With extra guacamole because avocados are very important with my Mexican food.  

Taco Tuesday!  $1 street tacos. Need I say more?

I love their hot salsa roja,  they have a little salsa bar with everything you need to spice it up. 

There are so many things to try on the menu. I feel like it doesn't matter what you choose, it won't disappoint. It's one of those places where you really can't go wrong with anything you order! 

Quality and quantity factors are very well balanced! The prices are fair for both the quality and quantity of what you get. Friendly staff. Why go to any of the surrounding crappy fast food restaurants when you can spend just as much, if not less and have a very filling delicious burrito etc? I saved their number in my phone because I like to call in my order and pick it up. Easily a favorite burrito spot!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome, and delicioso!  Would recommend the street tacos, enchiladas, and Carne asada fries.  The super nachos are fantastic and enormous.  Have not had a bad meal and they are very courteous and quick. Food quality is excellent and their salsa is actually spicy.  The burritos are outstanding and huge.  Anyone looking for quick Mexican food, this is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!! I get the same thing every time... The carne asada burrito. Best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada tacos are very good! Tortillas are way better than your average taco shop."}
{"text":"Good burritos with a lot of meat. Hot fresh chips free with your meal, freshly made salsas. Kid friendly place. Plentiful parking. Taco Tuesday specials.

Wifey had the Lazaro special burrito which had a mixta of shrimp, pork, beef 

I got the plate with burrito, enchilada, rice and beans. Good comfort food.

Next time we will do just tacos, it was so much food! :)"}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant , so I was kind of nervous when i didn't see other customers inside , but I'm glad we still have it a try , portions are huge & prices are just right . My daughter got just one carne Asada taco and that thing was packed with meat , I ordered a carnitas taco and chicken tostada , I didn't thing that I'd get full off one taco , but I did and it was delicious , I saved the tostada for later and was still delicious . And on top of that ordered a carne Asada quesadilla which was also Amazing , I'm not too much of a carne Asada fan because usually most places are bland and dry but the carne Asada here was to die for . Can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu , thank goodness this is close to home ."}
{"text":"First time customer and came off the Yelp reviews. The atmosphere isn't the most charming for eat in, but it does look clean. The service was fast and the staff were friendly. They didn't offer a choice in the taco shell (just gave me corn) and also charge for toppings such as sour cream, guacamole and etc. The food taste fresh and good, I would recommend to anyone who just needs to kill their craving such as I did today, but that's about it. It seems like a mom and pop shop and I like to support local business."}
{"text":"The best hands down. The food is fresh to order and the staff is friendly. I have eaten there countless times and have never been disappointed in the food or service. Taco shops like this don't really exist anymore. They take pride in each dish they serve. It is clean and the brothers that work there always greet me with a smile, bring my food to me at my table and keep the business running efficiently. You can tell it's a smaller family ran business, but that's what makes it genuine. They take a personal pride in the details that are lost in the large ran franchised taco shops. It reminds me of home and thats what I like."}
{"text":"Great tacos and you can't beat the price.


You might need three or four of these street tacos to fill you up, but at 1.50  each, there's no financial impediment in order to satisfy you hunger.

The carne asada, al pastor, and green chili beef  are top-notch. The tacos at Lazaro's are served with a generous amount of  grilled meat piled on top of  double housemade tortillas and topped off with cilantro and onions. Order them up grande or street-size, they are delicious. 

In addition to great tacos, Lazaro's has some of the best chips and salsa around.  The chips are made to order and served piping hot.  The chips are hot, light, and crispy, there I meal in itself.

If your in the area and craving tacos you should stop by.  You won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a Cardinals game. Everything is freshly made to order. Very clean place, owners are great, very friendly. The portions are huge!! I ordered a fish taco and a carnitas taco, one was like a meal! Both were delish. My husband ordered the special which was shrimp soup, it was a very large bowl filled with many large, pink, sweet shrimp and veggies in a very flavorful broth! Our dining partners ordered burritos that were huge and yummy! No alcohol, but no problem! Hope it doesn't get too crowded before the game now that I have given it away. Don't let the non-di script appearance fool you. It is a hidden gem!!! Please try it!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this place after one of my nearby favorite Mexican place closed down and I have to say this place is amazing. It is very clean and on top of that, the food is delicious especially Carne Asada nachos and burrito. Haven't try anything else but will in the future. 
And to save money, go to restaurants and purchase a vouchers that u only need to pay $6 for a $10 worth and u can use the voucher with a total of $20+"}
{"text":"Tacos al pastor were good and the carne Asada fries were good.It was a take out order but everything seemed cleaned.Mh husband also had the carne Asada tacos which he says they were Also good.they have other things in their menu  I Will like totry, so I  will be back"}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about their shrimp tacos! I will drive from downtown any day to get them! The food here is really good and at a great price. The perfect spot to get quick good food, the service is always friendly too."}
{"text":"Good place for tasty affordable mexican food/take out. I always get the chili verde and it is good."}
{"text":"I had been craving carne asada fries all day, so of course I come to Yelp.
I usually eat Juliobertos' carne asada fries and they never disappoint but figured I'd see what else is in the area .
This place was five minutes from my house, so I decided to try it .
The sign on the building doesn't match the name here but I still found it okay .
My daughter and I went in, looked @ the menu and ordered .
The girl @ the register didn't smile one time, which is fine, whatever but when I asked her questions about the food, it was like she had no idea .
She looked @ some reference guide a couple times .
Okay, still not a dealbreaker .
I ordered the carne asada fries .
They came with beans, carne, cheese, sour cream and guacamole .
These fries looked nice but were completely flavorless and not good @ all .
My daughter got a cheese quesadilla w. beans and rice .
She ate the quesadilla and the beans but the rice tasted like it had too much vinegar or something (not sure why it would even taste like vinegar) ..
We also ordered churros that were also underwhelming .
Here it is the next day and we both are sick from the food last night .
Def will not be going back .
I'll stick to the fast food fries ."}
{"text":"First off, the sign on the building does not match Rancho Nuevo which was confusing. There were lots of options on the menu but the lady taking our order seemed to have no clue at all what I was asking for when I told her that I just wanted chicken, cheese and rice. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it came out very greasy and soggy. It was underwhelming to say the least. The lady was not friendly at all and the restaurant was a mess. Literally only had one half cleaned booth to sit and eat on. The Salsa tasted pretty watery and not fresh. I also ordered guacamole which tastes/looks as if it was squeezed out of a bag. They only had 4 options out of the fountain dispenser because it was broken and bottled drinks which were an up charge. Very certain that I will not be back to eat here again. Also, finished eating and not even ten minutes later, I immediately felt sick. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"We just happened to stop into this restaurant because the place we were going to was too packed. I cannot tell you how excited I am to have found this place. The menudo was made to perfection and quite possibly the best I've ever had. Coming from Denver and the amazing Mexican food there, that says a lot. Looking forward to getting my menudo fix next weekend!"}
{"text":"I will for sure be back!!! The food is really good I got a torta de milanesa and it was really good, really good service and not a lot of wait time!!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday,  this is the place to be... The Carne Asada and the carnitas are very good."}
{"text":"First off let's start by saying that it sucks to throw money away. That's exactly how I feel about my expenditure here.  Pluses are that the chops are free and self serve. Salsa was good. My enchiladas tasted like the sauce was out if a can. And they were watery and gross. My wife's breakfast burrito was very heavy on the potato and the meat was very fatty. Our kids pollo asada tacos looked nasty but the kids said it was good. Overall for a 4.5 star rating this place was nasty. Also the name on the building said lazaros and made it confusing to find. There was a small sign that has the correct name. Overall save your money. 

*** update: after my whole family getting sick from eaten my here, I've updated it to a one star review."}
{"text":"Woke up one day wanting tacos. Went here for (almost) breakfast around 10:30 with my little brother. The lady at the counter was super nice and friendly, food came out very quick. The meal has 2 tacos and in my head I'm like \"no way, 3 tacos make a meal I better order something else\" this was a mistake because portions are really big. 2 huge tacos.  My brother ordered 2 tostadas and only ate like half of one. Salsa bar just plain rocks. Definitely recommend this place.  Just make sure that they're open before you go because I'm pretty sure their hours on google are wrong."}
{"text":"We went on Tuesday and they had taco specials. The carne asada was excellent. The pastor was good, but I liked the asada better. The restaurant was really clean and service was quick. I will be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Last night I tried the street tacos and they were very delicious!!! The yellow small corn tortillas were very soft and warm. So this morning I decided to try their menudo, we were a little skeptical about it because me being Mexican very picky on my menudo. Let me tell you it's pretty damn close to my nana's. I glad we found this new joint to run to near my house. Did I mention they aren't greedy with their food!!"}
{"text":"Love their street tacos, ceviche and pozole! I love that we can go and get our own chips and salsa. I wish they had a better soda selection and more comfortable seating but for those prices I don't mind!"}
{"text":"The quality was so-so, service was quick and average. We were looking for something fast on the way to Camelback Ranch and that's what we got. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"If you're feeling a little hungry, drop in for some carne asada tacos. Reasonably priced, and a-ok in my book, even if I have to douse them with a little more salsa than usual. 

If you're wanting a solid meal, go for one of their specialty burritos. It has like 4 different kinds of meat in it. A little on the salty side for me, but I was so satisfied with the beefy, porky goodness that I had to swear off flesh for a couple days after so I could recover from my meat hangover. 

And if you're feeling real hungry...like Harold-and-Kumar-when-they-finally-get-to-White-Castle hungry, then go for one of the fries. I am convinced that no human being should attempt to try the chicken bacon fries alone. It's a MONSTROSITY. You'll WANT to finish them, but won't get through more than 1/3 on a good day.

It's a notch above the drive-thru places on every corner, but costs the same."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for authentic mexican food, this is your spot. I bought a house close by so I could visit often. Kidding. I didn't know about Lazaro's when I bought my house, but I do visit often, so it worked out for the best. The food is great, the people are great, the prices are great. I'm here once a week on average.
The only problem that I've run into is the weekend crowd, expect a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing. I'm kind of a snob for Mexican food having lived in southern California and the chicagoland area. Delicious, great portions. Little expensive but I got a combo and bottle of coke, had them add cheese to my burrito. Only cost 13, which isn't bad for how much food I got and the quality. Definitely try a carne asada burrito, but anything is probably really good. If you can cook steak you can cook the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We used an Entertainment coupon, she accepted it no problem. My dad ordered the chile rellenos and I got the carne asada plate. The first thing to go were the beans on my plate which were delicious. The corn and flour tortillas are excellent. We got big portions, probably could have split one plate but decided to pig out since we had the coupon. Salsa bar is decent, the hot does have some kick. The tables could have been more clean, and the staff more friendly, but overall a good value for the money."}
{"text":"I randomly selected this place for breakfast. The salsa bar is plenty with at least 4 different types of salsa, peppers, radishes,  cucumbers, serve your own chips. The salsa is good and has enough kick to it and I love spicy hot salsa! The portions are hefty as I left with food remaining on my plate only because I got full. Good food, clean, light and airy atmosphere. It is calm and quiet with one flat screen showing a movie on the FX channel. It feels like I just had an awesome breakfast at my Aunt's house. I recommend this place and will definitely be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Only thing I ever had was the Lazaro burrito but quite possibly the best burrito I ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Ok...so that was damn good food. The only reason for the 4 stars is that the salsa bar was empty. If that was at a 100% capacity, then this would have been a 5 star place. The enchiladas were perfect. The chips where warm and tasty. I will be coming back to this place for sure."}
{"text":"This place opened up about a year ago, under new ownership. I must say it has improved drastically! Better customer service, better food, and the best of all, larger serving portions! I take my family here regularly and its a family night out going to Lazaros!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area.... woke up with a hangovers and we were in need of some posole and menudo. I saw this place on the way to my usual menudo spot by my old house and decided to give these guys a try. Both sopas were delicious!!! Definitely gonna come back for more and to try other stuff. The 2 ladies working the front were very nice. Make sure you ask for chips if they are busy or you may not get none. All in all, a great find right by my new place.... i reccomend you come in and try it!"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back!! The food was sooooo good, even my picky eaters left satisfied!! I had the Carne Asada Nachos (with extra Guac thanks to my daughters not liking it) & they were fantastic!! This will be a new fave for us.

The girl at the counter who took order was very friendly, our food came out in under 10 mins and everything was fresh... ESPECIALLY the tortilla chips which were piping hot & crunchy. No complaints from a tough critic!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, their carne asada fries are delicious! I like to ask them to make the fries on the crispy side which makes this extra tasty! My husband lives their chimis and next I want to try their breakfast burritos!"}
