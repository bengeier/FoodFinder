{"text":"I haven't been here in a little while, but it's consistently the best thai food I've had in Montreal. I'm pretty sure they must make their own curries from scratch with quality ingredients. The Tom Kha soup is blissful. The panang curry is heavenly."}

{"text":"Was at Phayathai on a weekday evening in March of this year with some girlfriends.  Reservations aren't necessary early in the week but should be made Thur., Frid. and weekends.

We were seated in a little alcove. It was comfortable and private. The service was impeccable, friendly and discrete.

We started with a plate of mixed appetizers. All 5 selections were delicious (dumplings, egg rolls, sweet dried beef, green mango salad and a fifth one I forget). It's meant for 2 people but 3 of us ate from it and it was more than enough.

I had crab claws in a spicy sauce that was fantastic. The crab was sweet and plentiful and the sauce had the perfect balance of spices. My friends all had satay chicken which they all enjoyed very much. One of them stating is was one of the best satay sauce she had tasted.  The dishes were accompanied by a choice of sticky or steamed rice that came in a separate dish.
When it was time for dessert, the waiter noticed a gift on our table and inquired whether it was someone's birthday. As it was, the birthday girl was offered a free dessert. The dessert list consisted of sorbets and fried bananas. Desserts are good but not exceptional. 

Presentations were beautiful throughout the entire meal.

Prices are very reasonable (it came out to approx. $20 per person) for that part of town and portions are a decent size.

All in all we had an excellent experience at PhayaThai on Laurier and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst Pad Thai I have ever had. Very over priced too. I got it delivery and actually put it into a strainer and rinsed it off in an attempt to make it edible. Didnt work. 

Even worse I accidentally went there to eat in person after getting them delivery. I didnt realize it until Id been seated and the delivery boy, who was also the waiter, came over to my table. Yeah, nightmare in process. So I ordered NOT the Pad Thai. Its a pretty looking place maybe they had something that wasnt like leftover vomit. I got a curry, soup, and salad. How could they all be bad? 

They were bad. They were ALL bad. Theres this greasy taste that I couldnt quite put my finger on but it was in everything including the dressing for the salad. Its got to be their peanut sauce but then how did it get into the soup. On top of that the chicken tasted off. Like it had gone bad. In the end paid 50 dollars for everything and left very dissatisfied and having barely touched my meal."}
{"text":"Food was not very tasty and was overpriced. I ordered the PadKiMew and it was very salty, not even mixed well, did not taste fresh and actually used the wrong type of noodle. Don't come here as there are many better restaurants in the area. I certainly will not come back!"}
{"text":"Went here based on good reviews and was extremely satisfied. We were a group of several ladies and requested the chef choose a variety of plates for us to share and he kindly complied. The flavors were spot-on and the service friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant for large groups as it is quite small."}
{"text":"This is quite simply the worst Thai food I have ever had. The portions are small, the papaya salad watery and bland, the sauces are goop, and the dumplings mushy. Our duck dish had a few gristly bits of skin and very little meat floating in a greasy broth. And it isn't even cheap. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife on our 10 year wedding anniversary based on reviews/recommendations.  The food was very tasty but the atmosphere was rather bland and the kids running around was not the romantic environment I was seeking.  That said, I would go there again for take-out next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The pad Thai is very tasty but a bit too saucy. Unfortunately the green curry wasn't so great, it was a bit watery and not very flavourful, I never ordered it again but I like the girl who works there, shes very nice."}
{"text":"Not a thai place I would recommend. Food doesn't taste much. Old boring decor. 
The only good thing is the location on Laurier."}
{"text":"We got delivery from here after seeing the good ratings on JustEat.ca. I have no idea what the ratings were for. We had the Basil Tofu and Red Curry Duck. The first was fine - the sauce a little oily - but just an average dish. The latter was just unacceptable. The curry itself was tasty but the pieces of duck were inedible; only bones, fat and skin with no actual meat. For a $17 plate of food I expected a lot more. Strongly wouldn't recommend; maybe their dine-in is better"}
{"text":"It was good but not min blowing or extremely authentic, would go back if i'm in the area."}
