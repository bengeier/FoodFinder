{"text":"Excellent cappuccinos + a big muffin + free wifi = an excellent way to work on a sunny day.   On a student budget, coming here is a treat but the cappuccino is worth it. The atmosphere is quiet enough to concentrate but bright and buzzing enough to keep you awake. They also have excellent music."}
{"text":"When we moved to Toronto my partner and I auditioned many of Queen Street's finest coffee shops to replace our beloved Revolver and Kafka's back in Vancouver. R2 is the place that won our hearts. Great coffee served by nice people in a warm, bright, comfy atmosphere -- that's exactly what I want!  The coffee is excellent -- often fantastic (especially when Elnaz is working the machine). There's lots of seating but the long narrow room isn't crowded so if you need a little space you can usually find it. The treats are yummy, especially the banana peanut butter muffins which will carry you from brekkie to dinner. But if you get hungry R2 also makes delish sandwiches and breakfast buns right in-house.  Someone below has called the service unfriendly, but isn't that just a little needy? I have to wonder what their expectations are. If you're friendly, then the folks at R2 are friendly but if you're shy or sad, they're not going to try to jolly you out of your mood but they sure will give you a good cup of coffee and some nummy treats. It's a coffee shop, not a best friend you pay for by the cup."}
{"text":"Great service. Great staff. Fantastic (maybe the best?) coffee in the city and a chill, relax, climate controlled and wifi accessible location to catch up with friends, sit and relax or work!   BTW - obsessed with the sesame chicken sandwich and veggie tarts!"}
{"text":"woohoo! as good as it gets indeed,  The place is full of nice crowd every time of the day you go in, the coffees are amazing not like the bloody starbucks which they push a button and diarrhea comes out!  They spend good time on their coffees which I appreciate, the soups (especially tomato soup) is squeezed!!  Free wifi too"}
{"text":"I love the interior and space of R Squared cafe, even it's temperature! I can sit by the window and not feel chilly (so happy!). When I came in around 3:00 in the afternoon, it was very, very busy! But wow is the food expensive or what! Somehow a tiny sandwich (less than the size of my palm) and a London Fog came out to be $10. I think from now on I'll just grab a regular tea and eat before coming. Great space though! And service is really nice."}
{"text":"Good people making great coffee. The interior is a cool mix of stark walls and rustic accents. My go to is the Americano, but in the winter the Spanish latte is Amaze!  With a little dash of cayenne pepper its a subtle little kick when you start to feel a cold come on. Lovely!"}
{"text":"Best espresso in town. The place is very cosy and welcome."}
{"text":"If you're into pretentious people who care more about rich kid outfits and boring dude bro handshakes, rather than making sure everyone's comfortable (staff & customers) then you probably deserve to be treated like shit by the owner who's gouging for mediocre espresso. Go for it."}
{"text":"The coffee at R2 is delish and made by a passionate barista with a talent for latte art.  It's also nice that the owner, Reza, is always around and happy to help or answer questions.  This place has an unpretentious vibe.  But, something about the design of the cafe makes me feel like I'm in an echo chamber - it can get loud at times, and I wouldn't consider trying to get work done here."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. They know how to make espresso. Their sandwiches remind me of street food in Paris."}
{"text":"Really excellent, distinctive dark Americanos. Very even flavour with rich, balanced yet unique flavour. You'll find yourself wanting this exact coffee once you're tried it. Sheik white interior with plenty of Macbook hipsters. Trendy but approachable. Generally speaking tasteful music; indie leaning towards electro/edm and synthpop. Busy most days, R2 has grown into a Queen&Bathurst institution. Enjoy the people watching in the window bar seats and let the day slowly drift by. A bit pricey, but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of R Squared Cafe when they first opened - but, I believe some of the former baristas don't work there anymore; I always see the same 3 workers now.   Their coffee is still one of the best that I have ever tried and they get their baked treats from some local baker - the matcha cookies are to die for! But, what's making me avoid this place is the service. The workers are not as friendly as before and they seem annoyed when I take a few moments to look at their drink list to decide what drink to get. The baristas always have this serious looking face the last few times that I visited. As a side note, they no longer do fun designs on the top of your drinks anymore.   I'm always so tempted to come back here, so I can get those matcha shortbread cookies - but, I can't handle the unfriendly service. I have migrated to Dark Horse (which they have a few locations across Toronto and one a few doors down from R Squared) or Jimmy's Coffee (2 locations in Toronto).   This cafe is no longer a place that I recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"This place has the BESTTTT coffee! Like the actual coffee beans they use is something unusual and delicious, haven't had it anywhere else. Just for the straight forward espresso based drinks I give 5 stars but beyond that....  They have R2 specialties that are to die for. Seriously. Orange Mocha, peanut butter latte....they have smth called the M2 (seasonal) that is an iced coffee drink made with coconut water and cinnamon and some other deliciousness -- all so good  The baristas are really attentive to the quality of the drinks they make - I don't appreciate careless baristas and these guys always know what they are doing  Definitely check them out and try one of their yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"The BEST of espresso on Queen West. The owners are friendly and always working to dial in the best calibrated shots around. Homemade Spanakopitas and Beef patties are to die for. If you have a sweet tooth their Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly, relaxed, well-designed, light-filled, quiet.  I always try to stop in here when I'm in TO.  Yesterday, the barista brought me a second espresso - on the house, unrequested - because he said he'd adjusted the grind and enhanced the flavor.  That alone left me with a smile all day."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for probably the last two years on and off. It's a nice medium sized cafe that's run by what it appears to be Persian brothers. The scene is filled with hip young 20 year olds with their MacBooks trying to get some work done while getting their caffeine fix. the drinks here are fairly good however slightly on the higher end of the price tag. Free wifi however it's been a hit or miss at times. They also have one of those stamp cards after 8 drinks I believe however I don't believe a lot of people use them. The seating can be pretty packed sometimes but you should be able to grab a seat most of the time. Overall nice place to come and swing by for some quick work to get done on queen street west."}
{"text":"I like how they've differentiated themselves from other caf√©s nearby. Neatly lined magazines (including the last 8 months of The New Yorker!), clean, sharp decor and serious baristas. They keep the place so clean that it satisfies even my neurosis for cleanliness. And, was pleasantly surprised by the amount of seating that was available once you peered inside. Will be back to try the M2 (espresso with coconut water and cinnamon.) What a strange combination!"}
{"text":"It is a 3.5 star review. The restaurant inside is narrow but it develops in the back. there are some table and it is excellent to work/study. If you seat in the back it is not too much noisy, music is soft and not loud. Their cappuccino is very good (good art). We also tried a blueberry scone: very tasty but a bit chewy and dry. Service is great and people working there are very friendly.  I deduct 1.5 stars for two reasons: a bit too pricy (not a surprise given the location) and their espresso is a bit burnt (at least mine it was). I may change and raise my review if the next coffee is better.  I'll come back here to spend few afternoons working but not to simply sip a cup of joe."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, the fastest free WiFi i found so far, the tea was pretty good as well, and the staff is typical canadian friendly :)"}
{"text":"I used to like this cafe. The coffee's delicious, whether hot or cold, the drinks never disappoint. The vibe was great; it was a slightly older crowd so you don't get a lot of first year's working away on group projects. The space was great to work or to grab a coffee with a friend.   However, i went there today and it was less than satisfying. The owner (or manager) had a terrible attitude; he was rude to other customers and extremely unfriendly when anyone asked him for the internet password.  He looked like he didn't want to be there and poor service ruins any good coffee."}
{"text":"We went to R2 today because I saw a guys account on instagram and he did really cool designs.. I thought it said he worked at r2 but maybe there's diff locations? Idk.. we were going to Queen west anyways so we stopped in and had lattes and salads. The design was a cute heart in the latte ..the guy on instagram drew faces and really cool things but the heart was still cute.. and it was the best tasting latte I've ever had. The salads were also really good and the croissant was fresh and flaky . The place was decorated really cool too and the people working were so friendly . We had our one year old in there and got the vibe that people go there to study  ( alot of people on laptops) so we didn't want to stay too long because our little guy can get loud...however I'd recommend this place . Great experience . It's a treat once in a while because it is pricey..   I'd recommend this sweet little spot."}
{"text":"Great Cafe other than the fact some people seem to think its a public library."}
{"text":"Independent coffee shop with amazing coffee that never tastes burnt. They do my americano almond milk misto perfectly. I live behind White Squirrel but always come here instead (R2 is much better in my opinion).   I wish the cups were a bit larger especially when I'm taking it to go, because the coffee is done so fast. Sometimes I ask but they have messed up the order in a larger cup a couple times so I don't bother anymore.   Still gets 4* for the consistent quality and being a great workspace to spend the day. The sandwiches are also way better quality than your average coffee shop."}
{"text":"I had a cappuccino n it tasted real good. Staff r friendly too. You will all kinds of people here, some study, some work, some r taking a break from shopping and some just there passing time. No drip coffee post noon. Overall a nice place to hav coffee n get some work done along."}
{"text":"I love their friendly service and coffee...and decor too!! Especially, wooden table!  A male barista created a beautiful leaf on my cappucino. Very silky foam as it should be.  As a coffee lover, I needed to find a place like this to make proper coffee. And if you are also coffee lover, try this place and you will see this is the right place!  I would like to try their espresso next time.  One of the best coffee in Toronto."}
{"text":"Nice vibe, solid coffee! WiFi was decent and plenty of table room. Back tables can be a bit dark and drafty,  but overall a good spot to relax and study or just leisurely enjoy your favorite coffee beverage. I only had a drip, but it was fresh, hot, and all the adds you could want."}
{"text":"Coffee is good. I'm not very particular. But I have to say the service is pretty awful. Just like one of the review said, that \" I don't care\" attitude could be annoying sometimes.   Same price same quality of coffee, I rather go to some other places in town."}
{"text":"I Love R2! It is my morning ritual! I have floated between a few different cafes on queen west when I first moved in, but stayed here for good about 6 months ago. It really is the best espresso and the staff are extremely friendly and not too hip to talk to a square like me. There really isn't anything bad I can say about them. Love the baked goods, amazing sandwiches, spanakopita, the vibe, and decor."}
{"text":"They stop serving drip coffee after a certain time, but their alternative is an Americano. Sigh. Cute interiors. Customers are typical Queen West people in Chelsea boots and draped in those blankets from Aritzia that pass off as scarves or ponchos or whatever. Lots of MacBooks Air users and people talking about being \"development\" in their careers. Coffee is aight."}
{"text":"Great new cafe on Queen West.  We came in for a fast bite to go and were pleasantly surprised.  The cajun chicken sandwich was a little bland but fresh otherwise.  The mortadella and Brie sandwich was excellent.  The service was great also, one of the servers suggested that we try their banana bread which had JUST come out of the oven as we couldn't decide on a dessert (since the weekend is the only time we allow ourselves to be \"bad\").  It was super yummy.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Like the vibe at this cafe and the staff were nice!"}
{"text":"Awkward service, stale food, not a good experience. The atmosphere is alright, there seem to be several regulars here who know each other."}
{"text":"Def will return to this cafe to camp/study/work/surf. Good tasting croissants & beverages. Decent Wi-Fi signals.  Great vibe with energetic, young staff."}
{"text":"I have to agree with other reviewers the latte art is the best in the city. Staff is very friendly and polite. Setup is very nice with lotsa seating, free WiFi and some interesting reading material. Now for the cappuccino it is quite good, the espresso shot is mellow and the milk is frothed well.  latte art is the best I have seen in the city. 3.5 for the drink (I prefer a stronger espresso taste) 4-5 stars for other stuff. I will visit again when I am in this area."}
{"text":"Walking down Queen West not paying attention you'd easily miss this place, so keep your eye out! Tucked away next to Oak+Fort this cafe is basically THE place to be for numerous reasons. They actually have decent space to study at and they don't mind if you \"loiter\" there all day studying. They have a great selection of food made in house, and awesome drinks. Another place that plays great music and is awesome for people watching, on Queen West or in the cafe itself."}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice cafe. I love the touch of Persian culture that the owner has managed with retro movie posters and small decor items.  The venue is large open and bright especially if you sit by the door; and it looked like they have a back patio area too (bonus!)  I had an iced americano and it was delicious; would have loved to try the treats but stayin away from sweet stuff :) Service was good too didn't notice anything awful in the two hours I was there like some folks said below.  I'll definitely return great place to study or work at!"}
{"text":"Very funky layout in this cafe, a little hipster in appearance but fits the neighbourhood perfectly. Great specialty coffee, regular brew. Service is open and friendly. Only downfall is no drip coffee past twelve. It's a small cafe so sitting can be limited at times. Pricing Is fair for the quality you get. Will return."}
{"text":"4 Stars.  There's not much to say about this place other than they know what they are doing with coffee. I had heard so much about this place from other great cafe's around the city and decided to meet a friend here on a weekday afternoon. All the hype, it is justified.  This is an absolute gem of a place in the downtown core of Toronto. It looks to be small upon entrance, but just take a look further back and the place has plenty of room to relax for an afternoon and get things done. There is of course competition around, but the standard in which this cafe holds to is not found a whole lot around the city.  If you are around the Bathurst and Queen area this place should be the place you get your morning coffee.  If it's not, make it your place.   That's it."}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype about this place. I had higher expectations with the reviews. I was walking along queen street and saw this place, and it also answered my question about where all these people with coffee cups were coming from.  The service was a little on the slow side. I came in the early afternoon, and was disappointed to find that they no longer serve drip coffee. Really? It's Toronto! So I had to pay $3.00 for an Americano, which was nothing special at all. Furthermore, I put a bit of cream, which made it colder than I like. I like my coffee to still be hot once I have added my cream. I asked if they could potentially remake it and steam the cream, or if they could add water (but I told them this would dilute it). They told me the had no control over the temperature of the water (of course, I get that), but all they did was add a bit of water to the Americano which didn't really make it hotter. They should have at least followed up and asked if it was to my liking after. I wasn't impressed with the service. The acoustics in this place are awful. The music was actually nice, but could hardly be heard over the talking (not much, but sounded loud).   If the place had better service, coffee, and atmosphere (I guess that's almost everything, ha), it would be nice. I really wasn't feeling it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They make one of the best London Fogs in the city, and their baked goods are delish.  Plus the free wifi, beautiful interior (with lots of natural light) and hip atmosphere?  A great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The coffee is great, the staff is uber friendly, and the ambiance is awesome as well! I love this place, especially after moving from Seattle where coffeehouses are everywhere and of the best quality."}
{"text":"Great little cafe in the fashion district. The interior was bright and cozy. There were plenty of seats and tables for customers to use. I ordered a Spanish latte and it is like a regular latte with a bit of cajun. The addition of the cajun spice gave the latte a very distinguished flavour that makes me want to go back for another cup!"}
{"text":"Love love love love love love love them  Ok seriously what's NOT to love about them? The cafe itself is beautiful, trendy AND comfortable, which is kind of hard to find these days. Free wifi with open plugs( hard to find again) and great music. I think I actually Shazamed 5 songs when I was there last.   They have the best Americano obviously everyone knows that. I just tried the Iced Mocha the other day: YUMMY and I thought I dont even like Mocha.   Once Reza made me a special iced tea, SO GOOD. I asked what it was and turns out its some sort of a fruit tea called Bora Bora, that you can even eat it dry! isn't that cool? A tea that you can both eat OR drink.  love love love love love love love them"}
{"text":"I try to pop in whenever I'm in the neighbourhood. The coffee and non-caffeinated drinks are fabulous. The ambiance is very low-key and funky. Great place to spend time with a laptop or just a book."}
{"text":"Cozy place with nice decor that is perfectly fit for a cup of coffee in the afternoon.  My original intend was another destination near by but I guess my fate has me to park my car just right outside of this Cafe this afternoon. When I get off my car, as a coffee lover, just couldn't resist to go in and get a cup coffee when I am just right outside the door.   I ordered a Mocha and this cup of baby is very good! Rich with flavour with strong aroma as well! A very lovely cup of drink. I am glad I walk into this shop, which turn my good mood to an awesome mood for this afternoon after this drink!"}
{"text":"My first stop for the second coffee passport and I say 3.5 stars. The lack of a 4 or 5 star review is mainly for the friendliness which could have nicer, normally one would expect the barista to be sort of excited at least for giving me my first stamp, in fact what I got was the exact opposite. The staff didn't seem all that happy when I came up with my passport saying \"it wasn't good for them\". When I started saying that thanks to the first passport I had returned to locations I would otherwise never have been to, they didn't seem to be all that in to having the conversation. But on the other hand, when we were leaving a different barista was friendly and asked us how our coffee was etc.  While I was a fan of Quaff, R Squared does seem to be it's cleaner and brighter brother/sister? Seating seems to be ample and very roomy which I'm always a fan of and free wifi is a plus too! . Like Vivek mentions in his review, the vintage movie posters were a nice addition in the back.   I got a pistachio biscotti which could have been cheaper but was delicious nonetheless. My latte was well done and went down smooth and my friend's cappuccino did have some nice art going for it.  I would give them another shot as I did like my drink, but after being spoiled by friendly staff at most other locations, R squared gets points off for lack of love towards the Coffee Passport program, which I happen to love."}
{"text":"great coffee. Almond milk in lattes or on the bar. Long, narrow design but a few benches.   A friend said it was his fav in city and I can't disagree it's a delight to coffee connoisseurs"}
{"text":"A great place for a coffee and a small bite - they do artisan-style mini sandwiches and the cookies looked good too. The space works very well, it's an elongated room and there are a variety of spots to sit depending on whether you want to work, socialise, read, people watch, dog watch, it's a decent place to hang out. Wifi in the house too. Big plus."}
{"text":"Really smooth cappuccino -- my BF thinks the best he's had in Toronto. Fair price. Really nice ambience ... clean, bright.   If you're a schlub like me, you might feel a little intimidated. The clientele seems to be mostly hipsters and chic European types. I felt fatter and greasier every minute I stood there waiting for my coffee.  There is actually a generous amount of seating, but again, like so many cafes offering wifi, two people can't get a seat on a Saturday at 5 PM because of all those people who apparently don't have internet at home, but have $1000 laptops. In the summer, that's not so much a problem; Trinity-Bellwoods is a quick walk away. But in the winter ... deal-breaker."}
{"text":"I love love R2!! Been coming here since I moved to TO!! The employees are amazing! So nice and knowledgable! Coffee and atmosphere is amazing! Worth coming too!! Blueberry scones and a latte are my go to's!"}
{"text":"R squared is located on Queen st, just west of the bathurst intersection. I checked it out on a weekday evening around 8pm. My first impression was 'this place is cool' with its high ceilings, modern-cozy wooden tables and white chairs. The music was happening.  I ordered a chai latte, which was really well made. Sweet and tasty, lots of foam. Their latte art is very good. At first I thought I was getting heart...then an apple...but my server continued on to create a butterfly! What talent!  I also had a biscotti, really good! One of the better biscotti's I've had, with a real texture and heartiness (much better than the ones at second cup).  I didnt try the wifi, but I am pretty sure its free!  So based on food and drink, I'd easily give this place a 4 start. Its one downfall was it was pretty noisy. Not ideal for studying, which I was trying to do. I managed to stay about 1/2 hour, but I couldn't concentrate after that. The conversations were at the level you would expect in a noisy bar.  But hey, it could of been just the one night there happened to be a noisier crowd in the cafe.   I would definitely return here, but lower my expectations in terms of studying potential. If you are looking for a cool place to have a non-alcoholic beverage and chill with friends, then this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"Love the relaxing ambiance and the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies! They also have free wifi and lots of outlets so that you can get work done! I also really like the simplistic interior decoration - the white washed walls and the geometric lamps gives off a very chic vibe, almost as if you were at a boutique rather than at a cafe."}
{"text":"Great place to catchup on work. Latte was very good; coffee was bold enough to overpower the milk. Great Latte Art.  Music is a bit too loud. Was trying to listen to my own but the cafes music was overpowering my own.   Otherwise...enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Came here to do some work on a Sunday morning (the odds were against me for seating space) but I was surprised to find out that there was quite a few empty seats. Their menu is on the slightly pricier side but I did really enjoy the M squared (it would be perfect for a hot summer day).   The cafe is on the noisier side and therefore, it might not be the best place to study (or you can just bring noise cancelling headphones). There are a lot of people working on their computers or reading so you don't feel too bad doing work there."}
{"text":"Such GOOD coffee! Also had a chocolate chip cookie that was delicious for a total of 7$. Very great place to hang out, study, read or catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Very cool area, priced on the higher end (as expected, comparable to other trendy coffee shops), and friendly and efficient staff. They have wifi so feel free to bring your laptop and spend a couple of hours here.   I'm a faithful to the M2 (iced, made with coconut water, cinnamon, and still get my caffeine kick!)"}
{"text":"There was this girl, something like a pretty animal name? I think gazelle. OH. MY. GOD. Not only was she the sweetest when I ordered my flat white, she offered me water after I sat down. So hospitable (also gorgeous), would come here again and recommend it to all my friends!!!"}
{"text":"Long narrow space, mostly white aesthetic with burst of colour at the back.  Nice use of space, and some natural lite.  Repurposed wood for tables, counters.  A nice selection of reasonably healthy treats. Laptop city! I've never seen so many laptops in a coffee shop before.  :-D Low key service.  Must try: Matcha shortbread - heaven.  Would I recommend:  Yes Would I return:  Yes"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place when it was the Quaff Cafe. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the coffee was not bad either.  In this reinvention, it still remains open and airy.  I did notice all the white Eames chairs.  That was a nice touch.  I have to admit I paid little mind to the seating before. I just like the place.  Customer service was friendly and prompt. They were great with pairing their baked goods like the one I had, the peanut butter double dipped milk chocolate biscotti, with a drink.  I didn't listen and I suppose I should have because my americano was alright but not the best I have had.  I would still try something else though maybe the cappuccino they suggested.  My friend had their oatmeal chocolate chip cookie which strangely had a salty taste. I have no idea if that was intentional. I wanted to purchase one of my own but alas, none left. Must be good. Next time.  All in all, a welcome spot in the queen west district.  PS...It is seems to be a must to work on a Mac in there.  Mental note: buy a mac."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit a place for the first time, I always ask myself, \"Is this somewhere that I can see myself hanging out with my friends on a regular basis?\" The answer: Oh yeah. The staff is super friendly, and always willing to engage me in conversation. The coffee and snacks are perfect and are exactly what you'd want from your local coffee shop. My drink of choice is the cappuccino, although their regular coffee hits the spot when I'm on the go. Perfect place to grab a drink and a bite in the afternoon with friends before parting ways for the day. I'm not one to study/write at coffee  shops, but they have free Wi-Fi and plenty of outlets for my laptop. Not much else you can ask for from a coffee shop...except for maybe some booze. 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Try the Spanish latte! Fantastic! Also, great service- really nice guy behind the bar. And good wifi. Huge place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty much my go-to if I want to settle in to do some work. WiFi is reliable.   A pretty sizeable cafe, much longer than it is wide, with a good number of smaller tables toward the back (though the high tables at the front are the best for people watching). Lots of interesting knickknacks on the wall and shelves. They have a pretty neat collection of old books and magazines if you're into that sort of thing.   I've only tried their Americanos and Mistos, but both are usually on-point. Food is tasty. Baristas smile more often than not, which is refreshing in that part of town."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to visit R Squared last Sunday. Since the new owners have taken over Quaff Caf√© months ago, I failed at my neighbourly duties to visit it.   While I did like Quaff's Parisian atmosphere but I also really like how the caf√© looks now. The significant changes are a small lounge area by the windows with a comfy sofa chair and small table. There seems to be more seating than before and now, more bold colours on the walls to really brighten up the space.    The seating set up is to similar to what Quaff had. Despite it being a Sunday afternoon, there was no shortage of people transfixed at their computers in Freelancer's Row.   When I came here, I was in a bit of less-than-happy mood. After ordering my cappuccino and croissant, the cute and very nice barista asked me a question: \"Do you like a teddy bear or a butterfly?\"  \"Teddy bear...?,\" I said.   The barista's head disappeared behind the machine and I asked him, \"Do I get a prize for answering your survey?\"  Little did I know that I was in store for something great. I peered over the counter and saw him create the best design latte art I have ever seen: he created a teddy bear in the cappuccino foam. [Check out the photo]  It's the best latte/cappuccino art I've seen in the city. How impressive!  This small gesture was great and whatever mood I had immediately evaporated. My first visit marked a great start to beautiful patronage with R Squared."}
{"text":"Pretty nice ambience. Lots of seating w/ outlets. Owner is very friendly  Good date spot"}
{"text":"My fave caf√© in this neighbourhood. Cozy vibe and great food and drink options. Try the pink latte (almond tea latte) -- it's creamy, just sweet enough, and so pretty. Their cookies and mini sandwiches are great too if you get hungry while studying/working here. Try the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, it's delicious!! They have a loyalty card, I think it's buy 9 get 1 free for drinks. They also have a jug of water and magazines, so really, everything you need is here. Staff are always nice and seem to enjoy what they do! It does get crowded though, sometimes it's hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"Awesome latte. What a decent surprise! Went in for the 1st time and can't wait to stop by the next day for another one. The coffee beans taste spectacular!"}
{"text":"in hindsight, i admit: i could have ordered better. so much latte art!  but, two espressos and nothing to write home of alas, had i yelped!  no open tables in the bright sunny front so, stuck in the back  just overall meh when great coffeeshops abound a bit disappoint"}
{"text":"Nothing particularly special about this place. My latte was average for an independent/third-wave coffee shot. From what I can tell, they don't roast their own beans but use a special Rsquared version of Social Coffee & Tea Co.   The baristas seem to care more about socializing amongst theirselves than anything else. The cashier person continued her conversation with a co-worker while I waited to order. The barista talked to the other employees about how they don't like hot coffee - only warm. So it wasn't much of a surprise that my latte came out luke warm.   The place has a decent number of tables/seats, but too bad every table is occupied by a single person with a macbook. Had to take my coffee to go.   Would pass on this place."}
{"text":"I found R Squared on BlogTO and I wasn't disappointed at all coming here. I don't remember the name of my drink, it's orange mixed with something. ( it may sound nasty but hey, I tried it, I loved it!). It was something new for me. My friend ordered an espresso and said it's a bit bitter. But for me as a coffee lover, and after tasting it, the espresso here is pretty good. I mean, it's bitter but it doesn't have the \"burn\" taste at all. The server was nice and friendly. She helped my friend pick a pastry (a muffin, danish, I don't remember) since he was hungry and wanted something that goes well with his espresso. According to his comment, the pastry made the espresso less bitter and helped him to finish his drink.  We were there catching up about our hectic lives. Very funky but creative decorations and layouts, but fit perfectly in the Queen West neighbourhood. People there were busy catching up with work and I felt like a professional with an open macbook. I guess it was because of the atmosphere and people around made me feel that way.  It's a bit far from the subway. I know we could have taken the street car, but it was worth the walk in a warm, sunny day.:)  The price is fair for the quality, the art of the latte, and the atmosphere. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place lured me in with it's gallery like layout, wall art, and gorgeous baristas. At first i felt clustered and then I saw an array of chairs, tables, stools in the back of the room; then my eyes struck a small donation box on the counter unexpectedly waiting for my response, which shook me up a bit.   All of the sudden I found myself,quietly, thanking the man above for the greatest town, city in the world which I live in. That morning all I wanted to do was order my M2 drink which consists of the best ingredients and the perfect kick of espresso infused with Coconut Water on this side of town and return back to my ear plugs which were blasting Adele's \"hello,\"..but I couldn't help but to do a second take at that small donation box where there were six words imprinted in the most simplistic way, demanding my uttermost attention and accelerating my respect level for this humble coffee shop tenfold.  Those words were: WE ACCEPT DONATIONS FOR SYRIAN REFUGEES."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Coffee in Town. No doubt. Very friendly and super nice staff. I have been there when i was in Toronto to visit my family. Roomy cafe with the thoughtful spacing. Modern interior architecture with shabby chic furniture styles. I have been following them since and their menu updates constantly adding new interesting stuff. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Nice big space that can hold a good amount of people. Decent flat white.. a bit bitter though. Good chocolate chip cookie. A big water dispenser to fetch your own water, with nice big glasses so you're not getting up too often. An ideal place to get some work done with reliable, fast wifi, but it gets very busy."}
{"text":"R Squared - your coffee is undeniably good, your patrons are friendly, but your staff are kinda...well, pompous.  I'm not a fan of the \"I don't care\" hipster service that pops up every once in a while, and my time at R Squared was full of just that!   I do really like their coffee - americanos, and cappuccinos brewed to perfection, beautifully presented, and a great area to sit and hang out while you're in caffeine bliss, buttt the service really took away from my experience.   Everyone I was with agreed with me about the weird \"I don't care about you\" service, but after reading the other reviews, I'm thinking maybe it was an off day for them.   So, R Squared - this was your first chance, but I'll give you another to impress me!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place to sit and hang out, with wifi and great drinks and treats. The staff, on the other hand, can be pretty dismissive. I've gone here four or five times, and every time thought 'it must just be a bad time for them'- but it happens every time I come in. The baristas consistently seem more interested in talking to each other about their social lives than helping you.   If you want a good latte and a light, open atmosphere to work in, this is a great spot. If you're sensitive about service, or want some attention when you order, I'd head to one of the many other cafes on Queen St."}
{"text":"Narrow place.  Pricy.  Bitter coffee."}
{"text":"I was looking for a cafe with large tables and outlets where I could plug in for a few hours and do some work. Rsquared fit the bill!  I came in around 9a on a Friday when the cafe was mostly empty save for a few people coming in and out. The inside is huge and broken up into two rooms - there are a ton of tables in each for you to sit and catch up with a friend or pull out the laptop and whittle away on Excel.  As for the drinks, I stuck with an Americano with soy milk. The coffee is good, very good.  This place looks like it gets busy in the afternoons. As I was leaving around 1p all of the tables were taken. It may be harder to find a seat later in the day. Regardless, good coffee and good vibes."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating Passed by this cute coffee shop for a caffine fix.   Spanish latte ($4.50 for large) Iced espresso, condensed milk, and cayenne. Surprisingly it wasn't too sweet, I thought it would be since condensed milk is quite sweet - thinking they must have mixed it with normal milk. The drink does taste quite milky and creamy though. It's interesting how they added cayenne, there is a slight peppery after taste.   This place has quite interesting drinks, they even have protein shakes."}
{"text":"The quality of the coffees at R Squared have surpassed all my expectations. This is my new go-to place for artisan coffee excellence.  In addition to the delicious espresso drinks, I especially love their pour-overs. I had the Ethiopian Sadama in a pour-over several times and it was consistently outstanding.  Best coffee I've tasted in a long time. Also really impressed with GTA's own Social Coffee roaster (who RSquared uses); finally, a local roaster striving for really high quality.  P.S. I am [sadly?] a coffee geek who's been into coffee for many years, I prefer it black in order to taste the subtleties of great coffee, and as a result don't usually drink anything like Timmy's or Starbuck's black because all I taste are the caustic flavours of crappy coffee and/or over roasting. I say usually, because sometimes it's an emergency -- a matter of getting caffeinated or not, and in that case I'll load up on cream to cover the tastes."}
{"text":"Great great coffee and expresso. Balzac's and this place are definitely my two favourites. Not much in terms of baked goods,  croissants etc."}
{"text":"Love those South Facing floor to ceiling windows opening up to Queen Street, especially on a nice, gorgeous Sunday afternoon.   R Squared Cafe is bright, clean and full of energy! Barista was so excited to see me using my Indie Coffee Passport.   Cappuccino was A-OK. I can tell the barista did take the care in making the drinks.   R Squared Cafe was quiet with everyone busy typing away on their laptops.... Free WIFI and Coffee and Sunny Afternoon.......... I felt like I am in a library! :)"}
{"text":"Read about this place on Yelp and decided to try it the one time I happened to be in the area. I like the look of this place, it's simple and cozy, and I could easily spend the day here just hanging out and chilling with their free wifi. It's a bit pricey - drinks are probably comparable to Starbucks' prices. I ordered the orange mocha and thought it was pretty good, but then again I don't know much about coffee. I did enjoy my drink though, and the latte art was nice. I also got a gluten-free cookie of some sort, which I guess must have been pricey, because my total bill ended up being around $8... but the cookie was really really delicious. I do wish the cashier was more informed about the ingredients in the cookie though - I don't have any dietary restrictions, but I'm sure the contents would have mattered to some people. Their drink menu is pretty simple, which some people like, but I wouldn't complain if they had a few more options."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee. Rich flavour. I had a latte and I'm looking forward to trying a straight-up espresso from them next."}
{"text":"R Squared Cafe is an unassuming, quaint, modern picturesque cafe on Queen st. A selection of slightly overpriced baked goods and sandwiches are available for a quick bite. Limited but decent drink menu selection. Friendly staff.   R Squared Cafe's Matcha latte was velvety smooth! While the matcha flavor is not as pronounced as I would have normally liked, it is still a better green tea latte than Starbucks.   Spacious and clean, R Squared Cafe is a great place to socialize, study, or create plans for the years to come."}
{"text":"Two gentlemen named Reza now own the Queen street space formerly housed by Quaff, which has been completely renovated and rebranded. I never really liked the name Quaff but for atmosphere and espresso it was solid. This new incarnation however, is not only an incremental slide up the alphabet (and squared no less) it's an improvement too.  There is a fresh coat of paint, new furniture, and interesting touches of Persian culture throughout. (Be sure to check out the vintage movie posters in the back.) It's brighter in there too, as though they have pulled the daylight from Queen street back into the recesses of the erstwhile cozy and antique hollow, to create a clean, bright and modern space.   A few elements still persist. Freelancers' Row is still intact but the new chairs are definitely a relief. And of course the great big chalkboard menu looms behind the baristae.  They know their coffee, and I notice that pour-over has made its way on to the menu. I had an iced coffee on my visit, and it was respectable.   This sea change brings improved customer service. I had barely cracked my laptop to write this review, when the barista came over to whisper the password to me. They also have a loyalty card program too. Be warned that they are leery about accepting debit for smaller orders, but they do accept it. This rechristening seems like a herald of good things to come.  Obligatory Title Pun: The REZA'S have an EDGE.  Menu Readability: The chalkboard remains and the printing is scalloped.  Need to mention: The Wi-Fi password is hilariously insecure.  What this place teaches me about myself: I dig any change so long as it's quadratic."}
{"text":"Found this unassuming cafe while roaming around on Queen st. The menu is limited in a GOOD way - not too many cafe drinks cluttering up the menu, they had two interesting specials we ordered. I went with the spanish latte containing condensed milk, espresso, and a dash of cayenne pepper. The spice was suble and the texture velvety smooth. Topped with a wonderful latte art flower. My gf ordered the other special cafe drink which was an herbal tea latte of sorts with a wonderful aroma. Each drink was beautifully crafted.   With free wifi and limited seating, I could see myself hanging out here reading/studying all day."}
{"text":"This place looks uber tiny from the outside, but once you walk in, it's surprisingly spacious with great sunlight coming in. Probably one of the best studying places in TO (you can almost always get a spot). And even I'm working on the same table with someone..it's doesn't feel like the dude's all up in my grills.  Really unpretentious and chill."}
{"text":"Well done, R Squared. Any coffee shop in a hip part of town with a line out the door, brews worthy coffee. But don't worry. The line goes fast. Once you get to the front, order a latte or an americano for some of the best coffee in Toronto. Grab a window table with the best natural light shining in, snap an Instagram photo, give it two thumbs up, and head over to Graffiti Alley to explore."}
{"text":"R Squared is a cute little nook on the north side of Queen west. I've checked it out a few times in my travels in that area and have gotten a variety of different drinks. All good and really cute atmosphere. Would return!"}
