{"text":"Food is great, we had momo, Himalayan chicken curry, and chicken curry, they are so good, especially the chicken momo, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Myself and 2 other people went here for dinner on Sunday,  March 19 at 5;00 p.m. as we pulled up they were closing. The sign said \"open until 9:00\" on Sundays. Maybe business wasn't good so they decided to close early. I will never go out of my way to come here as gain! This little dump can forgot my business. If you say you are going to be open, then be open!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonably priced.   Customer focused management.  Owner is community minded and supports the local neighborhood. I really enjoy supporting this local business!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but fairly typical Indian type of cuisine. All the dishes were pretty spicy. I enjoyed the dining experience, but I wouldn't say it's out of this world."}
{"text":"I tried the Buffet they have on Saturdays. It was probably the freshest buffet I've ever been to. Everything was delicious and there was so much variety. A great way to sample the different Himalayan dishes. Very aromatic and tasty. The service was exceptional. Very friendly and respectful. I can't wait to go back and order from the regular menu. The chia tea was a nice after lunch treat! And I liked that warm Naan bread was included."}
{"text":"To celebrate my recent graduation, my husband and I thought it would be fun to go out to dinner with family and friends. We called and made reservations for the day and time (for 8pm on a Saturday) for 14 people. When we arrived, the manager had no idea that we had a reservation, and no tables were set up and nothing was prepared. Not a big deal, our friends arranged the tables in the back room so that we'd all be able to sit. Not every seat had napkins, silverware, but we did have cups for water. It was not busy in the restaurant, there were only two people in the main dining room.   The service, although friendly, was extremely slow. A few times members of our party had to track down a waitress to ask for straws, more water, and utensils. Our meals came out at various intervals, with some members of our party waiting nearly an hour for their meals while others received theirs within about 15-20 minutes. Service was honestly in a bit of disarray, but the waitresses were very friendly and apologetic when food service was all over the place. There was also some confusion when it came to ordering-my cousin was told they were out of eggplant for her dish and that she'd have to order something else...but then they came out with the dish for her. But one of our friends ordered the same thing, and they had her order something else and then brought that one out. Go figure.   Now onto the food- The food, once it came out, was good! I wouldn't say it's my favorite place, but it's definitely a solid option. The food was clean and not too oily (a pet peeve of mine when it comes to curries), cooked well, and smelled great! Everything was cooked just right-nothing was over/under done, and was well seasoned. There was a lot of food sharing around the tables, and everyone was pleased with their food. Many of our friends said that they'd like to go back...just in smaller groups, because it seemed like our group of 14 people overwhelmed them. I can't imagine if the front room was also busy at the same time!  I know that the restaurant is new, and so they have kinks to work out to get the flow of service down, as well as flow in the kitchen. But once they get that, I know they'll become very popular! The food speaks for itself, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant itself is very clean. We'll definitely be back, just in smaller groups! We're looking forward to hopefully trying out their weekend buffet soon.   PS-there appears to be only street parking, unless we missed a back lot or something as we were all arriving at night."}
{"text":"You have no idea how much I eamted to love this place.   Unfortunately I will NEVER return to try their cooking.  You see, my wife and I drove 26 miles from our home in Stow, OH to try this place on a Sunday night because on Yelp it said they were open till 10PM.  We arrived at 8:40 to a restaurant which had about 10 guests in different stages of dining.  After confirming their hours of operation on the 'OPEN' sign hanging on the main entrance, we went inside.  After standing in place for what seems to be an eternity, we were approached by a young lady  telling us they were closed.  After inquiring about the hours posted online AND on the front door, the young lady informed us that, \"it's Sunday you know\".  These folks could offer us FREE FOOD FOR LIFE and I would never return.  Now to post this all over social media.  The BEST Himalayan/Nepalese food I've eaten is in Columbus, OH (Mo Mo Ghar)."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet, smaller selection of items but the buffet was very inexpensive and all of the items were delicious. Highlights included the fried vegetable dumplings which were absolutely bursting with flavor and the Himalayan chicken curry. We ordered chai to go along with our food and it was fantastic, just the right amount of sweetness and the chai masala they use is really unique, it had a distinct lemongrass flavor that was delicious.  The restaurant interior has been completely redone since the venerable Cuisine du Cambodge previously occupying the space closed - I almost didn't recognize the place. It's bright and functional, and the tablecloths and cloth napkins are a great touch."}
{"text":"I'm being generous for giving four stars because it's a new restaurant and I'm sure they're still working things out.  The food was really good, but the service was lacking.  They weren't very busy, but there were mistakes with timing (got an appetizer after my wife's entree, got my entree after my wife was finished, got the naan when I was halfway finished) and with orders going to the wrong tables (even though there were only four tables).  I'll eventually come back and revise this review."}
{"text":"Okeish taste overall. If you love Momos, this is the place for you!! Found some good chowmen though. Compared to other Chinese restaurants around me. I will prefer this one for chowmen noodles. Not so good for you if you are looking for Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Authentic Nepali cuisine. Food is amazing, prices are reasonable, and the servers are very polite and kind. The $9.99 lunch buffet allows you to try a few traditional Nepali and Indian dishes. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went last night and were pretty excited about trying this place out. There were maybe 3 other tables seated when we got there.   We ordered our appetizers and drinks first and that was a mistake.  We ordered 2 chai tea, a mango lassi, chili pakora and some garlic naan.   We got our appetizer in about 20 minutes, at least 30 for the lassi , 45 for the chai. We had ordered our dinners after we got our appetizer. Our dinners did not come out at the same time. We finally got the naan 90 minutes after ordering when some of us had our dinners. The waitress came to ask if we wanted the check and we were still missing one of the dinners we ordered, this was at about 2 hours in. We just had her bring us a container so we could take it home.   The sad part is the food is really good and we really wanted to like this place. I think maybe they should just stick having a buffet all the time."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here and it didn't disappoint!  - We were pleased to receive complimentary crispy bread with the green chutney sauce.  The chutney had a nice kick to it - the naan was just like i like it, fluffy with a little crisp to it. - The restaurant had a good ambience: nice flooring, clean bathrooms, appropriate lighting, nepali music videos playing in the background, and cozy but with enough space to not feel cramped. - not something i usually notice: the bowls that our curries came in: decorative and very sturdy.  Definitely not from the bottom shelf at Dean's Supply - couldn't help but notice the fixings for a lunch buffet.  I love indian (and by extension nepali) buffets, and I will definitely be trying this out.  Nepali cuisine is great for how it exists at the nexus of a lot of great cuisines.  Very happy to finally have one, and one that does it well, in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Going to a restaurant always sets up your expectations and when they are not met the disappointment sets in. That's precisely what happened to us.  This is a newly opened Nepali/Indian restaurant. The Himalayan cuisine sets it apart and the Momo's are part of that. However I'm surprised that on a Friday evening around 7pm they are out of this.  Anyhow we order the food including the mango lassi. Then the waiting game started. An hour into not being served anything, I asked the wait staff to at least give the mango shake to the kids and they come out and tell us that they are out of that as well.  Food finally arrived. I have to say the prices are very reasonable compared to other similar area restaurant.  The chicken Tikka wasn't tender and slightly chewy. They provide a decent sauce with it which is nothing but makhani. The dal tadka had lentils which were hard. The Himalayan chicken dum biriyani was probably the only Nepali cuisine we could get and that was good with a nice flavor but with lots of boneless chicken pieces. The service staff was sweet and apologize d for the slow service.  I am sorry but I wouldn't go back to this establishment until they get their act together or if I'm in the area with plenty of time to kill and I'm not starving"}
{"text":"Friendly attentive service and Samosas are the BEST in Cleveland. Normally we order take out"}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight for dinner. We were really impressed by how extensive the menu is. Really great options for both vegetarians and meat-eaters. I was hoping to try the vegetable momo but unfortunately they were out. Instead I ordered palak paneer and it was very good. Also had garlic naan that was fantastic. Service was very friendly. This place is a good addition to the neighborhood and I hope they'll stick around."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I love ethnic food and was very excited to see a Himalayan style restaurant in the Cleveland area. My experience tonight was subpar, after placing our order we waited about 90 minutes before we got our food. It was a Saturday night and most of the tables were filled but I really don't think that justifies a 90 minute wait. When the food finally came it was bright, flavorful, and delicious. I really hope this place can be successful. I'm giving three stars based on the fact that the food was good. The service though, was one star. My hope is that when I come back they will have gotten a little bit more organized."}
{"text":"Thought my husband and I would check out this rather new restaurant.  I got something familiar and my husband tried something new (momo). Both were to our liking. Service was adequate, for example, the waitress had a difficult time explaining something on the menu, water glass empty, etc.   Be forewarned however, the portions are huge! I want to return to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Been wanting to give Himalayan a try and I was duly impressed.  Housed in the spot that used to be Cuisine du Cambode, they have cleaned up the space with white walls and nice pictures from the mountains.  They have eliminated the couple of parking spots right in front by adding a curb, but there is some street parking available.   I went in for the lunch buffet; at $9.99 a great way to try a bunch of different items.  The buffet has 2 soups, about 4 chicken dishes and 4 vegie items, plus you get a basket of fresh naan bread.  The tomato soup was rich and nicely spiced with enough zip to tingle your tongue.  The mixed vegies still had enough crunch and were hearty.  The lentils were mild and smooth.  To me the highlight was the vegetable chow mein, which I would describe as more of a lo mein type of dish; the flavor was excellent with soft noodles that I had to go back for.   The naan was fresh and crispy with a light texture.   To finish the meal there was a mild rice pudding with a nice touch of sweetness.  All of the food was really good, with similarities to Indian food, but the spices were a bit different and Himalaya is not afraid to lean into the spicy and heat areas which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Welcome to CLE, Himalayan Restaurant. Seriously good food. It has been years since I've had Himalayan cuisine. One word of caution if you're not a big spicy food fan, ask for assistance picking out your dish because thing labeled \"mild\" are actually pretty spicy. I can't imagine what  things labeled spicy actually taste like! Nonetheless everything we had was good and service was impeccable.  We started out with samosas which were delicious. If you are dining with more than two people, you may want to get two orders. I ordered the chicken shahi korma. Again, pretty spicy but tasty. The chiken tikka was the fave of our dishes. Lamb curry was also delicious. We ordered garlic naan to accompany our food and a strawberry lassi. We ordered more of each because both were great.  They have a weekday lunch buffet. I can't wait to try that!"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot.  I visited the  restaurant on June 1, 2018, at 5:00 PM for dinner. My wife and I have gone here several times, usually about once every two weeks, or maybe three times a month. I myself, quite often for lunch.  That particular evening, when I came in, there were two obnoxious loudmouths yelling at the top of their lungs in some foreign language, and jumping around like idiots. They had no menus, and didn't look like they were going to order anything. Nobody working there seem to have any interest in telling them to be quiet, but I noticed that the waitress seemed to be  uneasy and distracted by them; I had to ask for water after I was seated. It made me wonder if they were punks trying for a shakedown.    I decided that I couldn't eat in such an atmosphere, and told her to cancel my order. I don't plan on going back; the food is great, but, to repeat myself, I can't eat in an unpleasant, disruptive atmosphere. Went to their competitor and had a terrific meal in a great atmosphere.   I sent them an email recounting what happened.  Their website says they would respond within 24 hours, but it's been four days. There are too many other great places to eat in the area for me to return there."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying- \"I dig this place\"!  If you like culinary adventures, you must try this  Indian- Napali spot on Cleveland's  westside!.  Being somewhat familiar with Indian food and totally clueless as to what Nepali food really is, I was glad to see they have a lunch buffet so I could sample a variety of things.  Some of my favorites... Chicken Makhani, Chicken Biryani and Vegetable Pokora.  Not to mention the warm Naan bread. YUM!  Lunch buffett was $7.99.  I will definitely go back again.  It's a new place, I hope they can maintain the quality.   Try them out!"}
{"text":"Food was good and plentiful, mixed vegetarian appetizer similar to most Indian restaurants - with the exception of the chili peppers- fried in a batter akin to a corn dog. Entrees were well seasoned- lots of fresh ginger. Prices were reasonable. Our biggest disappointment was that Momo's were not available- we arrived about 7:30 on a Saturday and were told they were out.   Could have done without the heavy plastic overlay on the tables- serving pieces stuck to it as we moved dishes around on the table, and I just don't like plastic...."}
{"text":"Amazing Nepali/ Indian restaurant. I usually go for the Nepali dumplings (momos) and they are pretty amazing. The chowmein (fried noodles with a selection of meat) is very tasty as well. Cant wait to try out their buffet. Glad this place opened up in the area. Will be eating here frequently. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"service was a little slow the but food was so delicious! we ordered several dishes to share and loved every one. garlic naan was incredible. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I read some pretty good reviews of this restaurant so I thought of giving it a try and there I was for lunch on a cloudy Sunday noon. The place is easy to locate but I did have a tough time finding a parking spot.  The first impression I had when I entered was just like most of the Indian restaurants. The place is cozy and clean. There was one hostess helping everyone getting seated and setting up tables,etc.  Coming to the main thing for which everyone visits a restaurant: FOOD I tried almost everything they had in their buffet spread as the numbr of dishes was OKish... For starters, I had samosa, chili pakora and onion pakora.. The filling of the samosa was decent but the crust was not up to the mark. The pakoras was average too. The chutneys that came with the fried items were good. I also tried a tandoori chicken and it was on the better side. I believe they smoked the chicken after cooking and that gave it a nice flavor. I tried their Himalayan soup which, to me, tasted more like a vegetable gravy minus big chunks of veggies.  I tried all the vegetarian and non vegetarian curries they had ( Paneer Zalfrezi, mix veg, Himalayan Chicken and Butter chicken). The curries were decent but a bit high on salt for my liking. Chicken pieces in butter chicken were extremely hard to break and it was the saltiest of the lot. The vegetable chowmein was their best dish of all, naan followed very closely.  Plain rice was heavily spiced with exotic spices which gave it a very strong flavor. I would prefer it absolutely plain. Chicken biryani was nicely flavored and spiced up. For dessert, they has rice kheer ( a type of rice pudding). It was extremely plain and would have been better if some dry fruits were added to it.  What disappointed me the most was the absence of any type of momos (dumplings) from the buffet. The primary reason I went there was for momos. Overall, for $10.79 ($ 9.99 plus taxes) it is still a decent deal."}
{"text":"Best Indian we have had on W Side. This is my families new go to Indian take out. Nice Clean location, pleasant service"}
{"text":"A short time ago I ate more then I should have. Even though I was stuffed I decided I had to try Himalayan Restaurant. The Himalayan soup is outstanding and has a mild amount of character. It is delicious! No room for anything else this time but it is great! Glad I came here."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for the lunch buffet and I'm glad I did. Be warned though their spicy is the real deal. It brought tears to my eyes. The food was fresh and they are super friendly. I would start with the buffet and go back for the dumplings."}
{"text":"Honestly... eh. I tried them twice and was disappointed both times. I had chicken tikka masala and the sauce was super runny, I prefer India Garden. The second time I got lamb vindaloo and it was meh. The waitress seemed like she didn't give a damn about our business, it was weird. Felt very unwelcome."}
