{"text":"Very delicious food!  Pretty big servings and nice variety on the plate. It was my first time there and the server was extra nice and very helpful with the menu.  Their meat and bread is fresh and made from scratch.  Loved the spices they use, very rich. Humus is absolutely amazing as well as the yogurt dressing they provide on the side.  Place is very clean and quiet, and the music is traditional Persian. Important thing is that you dont feel out of place as you might in other traditional restaurants, very friendly place with great service. Also, prices are very cheap.  :-)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I had a coupon for a free kabob so I thought I would give it a shot. Wow, just wow. Amazing. Not only was the place clean, it smelled delicious walking in, the people were very nice and happy to strike up a conversation, and the food was off the charts. I have never had shawarma like that, it was just spicy enough to keep it interesting with curry flavors and tender beef. I wasn't even that hungry but I ate it all. They give you a great variety of food in their combos too. Salad, hummus, stuffed grape leaves, much better than how others do it with your main dish wrapped in foil and a pile of over cooked pilaf. I will be coming back to give them more business for sure. Help this small business out and get yourself some killer food."}
{"text":"I've only had the Gyros sandwich/wrap but it was delicious! My only suggestion is to ask for extra taziki sauce but that's more of a preference."}
{"text":"Delicious kabobs and fresh bread...  And Free Wifi...what else do i need:)?"}
{"text":"bought a groupon voucher for this restaurant, as soon as my wife and I entered there  was a strong odor of sewage like smell, which explains why the restaurant was completly empty of patrons other the the owner sitting on a table.  Our groupon voucher was declined by the cashier stating that we had to use it at their other location at Henderson which is about 30 miles away, although the groupon voucher did not state this, the cashier admitted that the goupon voucher was valid but not at this location as he put it, \" we have two stores you have to go to the other one\" I informed the  cashier that this was not stipulated in the goupon order and the restaurant is empty anyway and why not just take our order since there is no one in here at 2;00 pm? , nevertheless he said no cant take it. Then on my way out the owner sitting on a table even attempted to add insult to me by saying: \"DONT FORGET YOUR PAPER YOU LEFT ON THE TABLE\" he was referring to a flyer that my two year old had in his hand and left it at the table.       I did however inform the owner that he can just go ahead and keep the paper."}
{"text":"Best kabob in Henderson. I will be back for sure. The staff if very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon whilst out running errands. Very impressed. Wife had chicken and Sis and I had beef. Everything was great. To start with the service was quick and friendly. The meats were flavorful; the ladies raved about the rice and they don't even like rice!  Oh, we started with bread (you can see them making it) and some of the best hummus ever. Very filling meal so had to get the baklava as takeaway (it was delish as well)."}
{"text":"Great portions- freshly made, no UNLV discount and no wi-fi. A business across to UNLV should offer both! Ill be back, but would be back sooner if they had wifi!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food!! loved the ground chicken kabob, fast and friendly service, they have amazing ice cream, so light and you can taste the rose water flavor."}
{"text":"This place has made a complete 360 from the previous owners! Had a delicious steak shawarma with fries and some excellent hummus. Their baklava was also amazing! Service was very friendly and attentive and the prices were very reasonable. They even have a discount for students. Will definitly be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple more times since my first visit and I've grown to really like this place.   I normally get the same chicken tenderloin kabob plate. The other time, I got the bbq chicken and this last time I got the Beef tenderloin. Both have good flavors. I love dolmas so I get those everytime -- for $1.99 you can't go wrong! Since the first time, they have definitely eased up on the olive oil which I thought was delicious but had waaaay too much of it. I enjoy them much more now.. We also got the side salad which was terrible.. the cucumbers were all grey and it didn't look or taste fresh at all.. what do you expect for a $1.99 side salad, I guess. Their hummus is delish and is topped with paprika and black olives.  I find myself wanting to eat here more often than I thought I would.."}
{"text":"I pick up carryout every time I'm in this part of town. I had the $9.99 special and a baklava. The special consists of your choice of 2 skewers of ground meat on rice, bread, and some onions and greens. I had the chicken and lamb. Both tasted great. I believe they make the bread right there, and it is excellent;  some of the best Mediterranean I've had in this city.  The baklava was sweet and tasty.  The staff are very friendly, and although the food is cooked while you wait, it is a very reasonable wait. If you like Mediterranean at all, this is a must try."}
{"text":"Dirty,Dirty ,It's not kabab ,it's junk ,they add lot of food color to cheap meat,very oily ,low quality rice , I been there 2 week s ago ,after the guy bring the food ,I ask the owner to refund the money ,He swipe the credit card  and give me the receipted for refund but after 2 weeks no money back to my account ,beware if you went there make sure ,they don't give you fake refund receipt,This is baddest experience I had in restaurant,Don't put your Health on risk."}
{"text":"So you know a place is good when you keep coming back without realizing that you've been here three weeks in a row. Flame Kabob is an unassuming restaurant that serves quality Persian food. We have been passing by this place for a while until the hubby decided it might be worth a try since we were hungry and lived close by. The only downside is it is not really fast food -- so be prepared for a bit of a wait. That being said your food is made to order so everything is fresh.  We usually get the lamb kabideh and it is finger licken good :D. The dolmeh and yogurt are also super tasty. We almost passed it up but glad we didn't!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and they gave me beef. Then I took it back, and the guy all but accused me of trying to get a free meal (I'm guessing) because I had eaten one bite. Thanks so much for taking my $20 and making me eat beef, which I haven't done for 20 years. I understand that people make mistakes, especially when language is an issue, but in the future please correct them properly."}
{"text":"You can not believe how terrible is this place food ! Not fresh meat, no tasty !! Worst experience ever!!  Never ever try it"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I sometimes eat it almost four times a week. I absolutely love it.  I usually order the Chicken Shish Kabob combo, the number 5, and it tastes just as delicious every single time. The quality of the chicken is phenomenal and it  is SO tender. I love squeezing lemon on my meal and adding the green chutney. So lemony and yummy!   The rice, chicken, and pita bread combination is out-of-this-world! The pita bread is also freshly baked, so it does take a bit longer. I rather have to wait 10 extra minutes and have quality pita bread than microwave heated pita bread!  I've ordered this meal for my entire family and they all enjoy it as much as I do. THE CHICKEN SHISH KABOBS ARE A GO! I will definitely keep visiting this place again and again. And again..."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and has not disappointed us one bit.  The food was delicious and the service is outstanding, thanks Israel. Ps try the green sauce, soooo good!"}
{"text":"i mean no ill will. but i got feeling unwell after eating here.  it tasted  very good and was made fresh and the place looked clean, so i feel bad giving it a bad rating but based on how many very fast trips i had to make to the restroom not long after visiting, i cant give it a higher rating at this time... I may actually try it again in the future  after a cooling off period of a few months and get brave and try again and tell myself  that maybe some ingredient was just off or just had a bug in it and my number was up for getting a touch intestinal trouble, but at this moment I'm a little gun shy to go back any time soon. It can happen in the best restaurants, and it looks like a lot of people loved their meals so I'm happy they enjoyed the complete experience, but since this happened to me, i feel a duty to report it. it happened nov of 2013 a few months ago so maybe the problem is contained or just came in a batch of vegetables etc. this is my hope.  otherwise, I liked the staff, i liked the selection, i liked the murals on the wall. it seems like a very large place for the number of folks eating there the evening i did but I'm thinking its a lunch time rush kind of place."}
{"text":"Incredible food, amazing service!  One of the few places that serves up lamb kabobs without including beef in it, which is great for people like me who don't eat beef.  The lamb and chicken kabobs are delicious, and the persian rice is so fragrant and flavoUrful.  The pita bread is made fresh in-house, and while a little more dry than I am usually used to, it has the rustic feel and taste that goes great with their kabobs. I also like the yogurt-mint-dill dip that comes with the kabobs. Ihaven't tried their lunch combos, but they're very reasonably priced, so I will definitely check it out soon."}
{"text":"Is it closed? I went here about a month ago. If it is.... GOOD!  I went there because my kids have been there with their dad. I have always wanted to try it and they begged me to take them. Needless to say, it was extremely disappointing. I LOVE this kind of food, and have been to places that knocked my socks off. This was nowhere near. I placed my order according to what I saw with the pictures on the menu, getting a chicken plate, lamb plate, and beef plate. All total was a little over $30. It took FOREVER (about 25 minutes) to cook my food. We were the only ones in there. Should that have been a sign? FINALLY they finished, and we were hungry because it smelled so good. When I got home and opened the boxes, I was shocked. I watched these guys cook my food. I should have watched them box it up too. OMG there was literally 6 pieces of meat in each container. When they were cooking, each skewer was about 18 inches long and half of it was meat. Where was the rest of the meat that they cooked??? And even my kids looked at it and said the same thing. They go there a lot and said that usually the container is full. UMMM yeah. Even if this place is not closed, I will NOT be going there again. I got totally ripped off!! They were not busy, so maybe they were trying to save a buck.  But I have four kids and I was taking them out for a special treat. We don't eat out that much and they really wanted to go there.  I even left a tip in the jar. Now reading the other reviews, I wish I hadn't.  I am a waitress and it will be a cold day in he-- before my bosses keep any of my tips for themselves. UGH"}
{"text":"Stopped by after work today. Ordered steak kabob and hummus and baba ganoush. The girl who took my order (I phoned in) was pleasant and understood me perfectly, as I her.  When I left a $2 tip in the tip jar, she proceeded to tell me those tips are going to the boss. I found that odd and asked why the tips weren't split among the employees and she just smiled and said that's the way it is. I was going to take the $2 out and give it to her. Looks like greed just finds it's way... Anyway, the food was decent. Steak tender with great flavor; rice was colorful, light , and flavorful; baba ganoush DAMN GOOD! The hummus could be a little creamier, but has a nice amount of oil to keep it smooth. Also has a nice roasted, smoky flavor and a little darker than regular hummus. Sliced olives on top a nice touch. 3 stars until I try more food."}
{"text":"I'm not Greek or Middle Eastern.  I'm not that experienced with the cuisine.  Thus, the authenticity that others take about is lost on me, because I don't care.  I have an average american palette.   To me the food was okay.  The food deserves 3 stars, but the price for what you gives, earns the 2 stars I posted.    I tried the chicken kabob and the beef shawarma.  I wouldn't call the three spinach leave they give you a salad.  The hummus is decent.  I'm not Greek, but I've made comparable myself.  I wonder if the saffron rice, really contain saffron or just a coloring agent.  They bake their own (flat) bread, but that doesn't make it noteworthy tastewise.  I might come back for the lunch special during the day, but not for dinner, there is comparable for cheaper near me."}
{"text":"Best veggie kabob I've ever had! And the rose tea is delicious! And that green sauce - yummy! The people were also very friendly making for an all around good experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and their food is out of this world!! The food is so good and fresh! Customer service is great since its under a new management !!! Love the people that work there! Cant wait to go with my friends there for their hookah nights!!"}
{"text":"Anyone that thinks this place serves good gyros, has never had good gyros and needs to have their head examined..  Half a pita with something that looks like steak-ums does not a gyro make.  I don't know what kind of meat that was, but it wasn't gyro meat. And when someone asks for fries to be boxed separately, don't just put them in the styro containers smaller compartment, box them SEPARATELY! The place was virtually empty when I walked in long after anything resembling a lunch rush could have possibly happened, and tables were still dirty..  The cashier or manager or whatever was friendly but that does not make me ever want to go back in there.."}
{"text":"I had gone in with a friend of mine for lunch a few days ago. The food was okay like any other reviewer would inform you of, but I felt very very uncomfortable as we were the only two in there and they would stare at us relentlessly, it was at a point in which we decided to eat in the tables outside of the building rather than inside."}
{"text":"Food tastes amazing here. If you are in rush, I would order online pick up as this place tend to get really busy."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I usually get the #1 chicken kabob and it's delicious.  Prices are very reasonable and the staff is efficient and friendly.  Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas I yelped this place and I'm glad I did because this is the best Middle Eastern food I've had for their prices. I'm very picky since my family makes the same dishes but this place is so good it reminds me of home. I've become a regular now and I like this place so much I decided to write my first yelp review. I love their lunch specials. They have awesome lamb, beef, and chicken kabobs. I always got to get their rose water tea when I'm there. The owner or manager there is so friendly and always makes sure my order comes out great. This is by far my favorite place in Vegas off the strip! Oh ya and no large crowds so I could enjoy my food in peace without a long wait to get my order! I just had lunch their today 10 min. ago and now I'm ready to start my day!"}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch.  Appetizer tray was excellent.  And the grape leaves made by Essam's mom were very good.... oh yeah, try the rose water, very refreshing.  Hummus was one of the best I've tasted"}
{"text":"I love this place!! They make the best koobideh. Will be back for sure! This place was recommended to me by so many. I'm not easily impressed. Love Love."}
{"text":"Walk in and had no clue what I was looking too eat but the cashier was very helpful and I order the lamb and chicken kabob with humus and I loved it. The price was very fair so I left there happy and full."}
{"text":"So damn good! Stumbled upon this place randomly. So glad we did. If we lived here we would be regulars. Had the lamb and vegetable plate. They had only one flavor of ice cream. Pistachio Saffron. Mixed a baklava into it for a total sugar sweet bomb!"}
{"text":"I had the falafel special (#13 I believe) I don't eat dairy/meat so this was spot on  No garlic sauce because she said they use dairy in it but the falafels were so good and the 2 sauces they make on the side where you grab them yourself are so good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here after a trip to Restaurant Depot.  Walked in to a nice and clean environment - ordered  Baba Ghanoush as an appetizer.  It was amazing, nice and creamy with great flavor.  Served with their homemade flat bread.  Yummy.  The manager brought us out that amazing green, almost salsa, the name escapes me - but whatever it was, it could almost drink it.  It was great.  I had the chicken kabob and my boyfriend had the beef - both very tender, flavorful and was just the right amount.  The food was served on a half piece of bread, with colorful rice and lettuce on top of the bread.  Not quite sure how to eat it properly, we just dug in and tore off and ate.  Great service, the food took about 5-10 minutes to come out but I am happy to wait knowing the food is made to order.  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I am impressed, yet again, by a Vegas strip mall food establishment!  The food was very tasty, though I docked a star because the rice was just... bland?  Maybe overdone?  It just wasn't the perfect rice I'd expect from a kabob joint.  The service was also wonderful, and I definitely recommend it overall!  Great value, too."}
{"text":"I thought the food was delicious came on the recommendation of my hair stylist and he didn't steer us wrong!!!  Ample portion for dinner at reasonable price. Food was fresh and I couldn't stop eating it!! The service was excellent"}
{"text":"I come to this place a lot.  Sam is the man and the quality of lamb kabob is amazing.  You can't beat the price.   Plus they got free Wi-Fi and plush couches to lounge on afterwards and have some tea and do some work.   I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This food was excellent and fresh! My family had 3 orders of the ground lamb and we all loved it. The lentil soup is excellent as well. Theres a fabulous combo right now for 2 ground kabobs for only 12 dollars. Order seasoned or feta fries too! And shout out to the rice! Though it's kind of new, the service is excellent! Our server/ person who took our order was very kind and attentive. This small place really surprised us!"}
{"text":"The quality of food was awful, I ordered soltani kabab there. The meat was overcooked and so tough !! Also the owner gives costumers low quality plastic fork, spoon and small plates which made eating that hard meat even worse! The amosphere of restaurant was dark, cold and so depressing with old dirty curtians that reminds me Miss Hawisham's house in great expectation movie. Do not burn your money by choosing this terrible restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty. There are roaches in the dining and restroom areas. They refused to refund my order. The people who work there are rude and useless.   There is no reason to waste your time or money on eating here."}
{"text":"The worst food EVER. Rice tested old. Chicken was some what ok compare to the other junk on my plate. On a scale of 1 to 10 the chicken was a 2. 10 being the best. Shirazi salad you could wash the paint off my car with the juice/dressing in it. So called cherry drink tested nothing like cherry. It's matter of fact I have no idea what the taste was. All I know I had to eat the bread to get rid of the test.  The salad that came with the food looked old and it was old. MacDonald would have been a better pick and I hate MCD."}
{"text":"My first time here and it wasn't that bad. I love Mediterranean food and i wanted to try something I haven't tried before so i went with the Lamb n Chicken Shwarma combo. The meat was good as was the side sauces n rice. Pita bread was warm n delicious. Food took about 12 min but they said it was cooked to order with fresh ingredients so idk.   As for the restaurant itself, it was kind of plain and needs remodeling. It felt like i was in a cheap dollar store. I would probably go again only cuz the food was pretty good. I heard their special tea was good so maybe ill try that next time i go."}
{"text":"First off , I didn't even get to try the food.  I purchased a daily deal and because of the cashiers( we think owner) rudeness in which he didn't except our voucher, we will never go to this place.  I was mortified by his gentlemens rudeness and unwillingness to honor our voucher.  It wasn't as if we were ordering just the amount on our voucher, but we ordered practically double the amount.  Customer service is key, and if they keep treating people like they did us, they will not succeed."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last month,  and we've tried a good variety of their menu.   So far,  nothing,  and I do mean nothing we've had was less than Superb.  They have specials that are a good deal however if you are using a coupon such as  Restaurant.com or Groupon you can't get the specials at the special price.   They have fresh Rose Water and Sour Cherry iced teas that are also excellent.   I guess my only complaint is that as far as I know they do not offer delivery...  But that's just a need on my part to say something that is \"critical\".   The staff treats us like family.   Gotta love that.   Overall,  a gold star place.   I'll be back here...  Often. Oh...  And when they say \"saffron\"  they mean it.   They showed me their supply...  Picture attached."}
{"text":"I tried there 2 kabob special 1 lamb 1 beef it was the worst I ever had the rice even taste horrible first time in my life I threw away that much food. It wasn't even worth taking home . Don't eat there"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the prices are a bit high. It's definitely worth a try but not going to be a staple because of the prices."}
{"text":"These guys are great. It takes alot for my wife to eat anything other than american food. This is one of the few places she likes. The lamb tenderloin shish kabob is my favorite. My wife likes the chicken kabobs. The service is great and the staff is friendly. Most of all it's CLEAN. Thank you guys. Keep up the good work. You definitely have our business."}
{"text":"Very generous portions but people the flavors and condiments are SO good. Give it a try! In addition the people are very kind."}
{"text":"In my quest for no-carb eating, I stopped in at Flame Kabob. Besides the cashier being slow (we literally had to repeat EVERYTHING like four or five times), I really liked the Kubideh--I think I had the chicken one. The Shirazi salad was good as well. I wish I could say the Baba Ghanosh was good, but I didn't have it.. I just wanted to type Baba Ghanosh!  Some nice lounge-y type seats inside and outside the restaurant, but the decor looks like they robbed a tract home of all its cheesy tile/stone."}
{"text":"Wasn't a good kabob experience. Ordered a wrap, it was filled with rice, with a thick layer of bread, with a piece of meat. The taste wasn't as good as many other places for the money I paid."}
{"text":"The kabobs are quite tasty.  Rice is totally bland.  Overall pretty good.  But the customer service was horrible!  Half the staff were talking on their cell phones right behind the counter in plain site of everyone.  Took awhile for one of them to drop their phone conversation to actually take our order.  No apology, not even a greeting, they just walked to the register and looked at me."}
{"text":"This restaurant's atmosphere is something else, set in a small complex \"underground\", it has more of a corner home \"hip\" feel to it. Of course, atmosphere is only a plus the real reason why I came here was for their kabobs.  They have an amazing menu full of different combinations and meats and exotic foods I have never heard of. I ordered what was known to me; the Chicken Kabob plate. However, when ordering the owner, or atleast what I presume to be the owner, talked me up to getting the Lamb Kabob plate, with no fee! This was amazing because lamb is much more expensive on the menu, $6.99 chicken vs $8.99 lamb, I did not complain and happily took the upgrade.  While waiting for my food I comfortably sat down in a chair, specified because they had a lounge area to the side with couches and chairs - something you would see out of a Hookah lounge.   The food came and my first impression was that it was BEAUTIFUL. The plate was crafted beautifully, and if I figure out how to upload a photo I will. The salad was lackluster at best but that was so minimal that it did not hinder my dining experince. I still ate it. The safron rice was delicious and fresh, the Lamb Kabob laid beautifully on top of the rice looking fresh and ready to be eaten. This is the main dish and rightfully so! It was tender and melted in my mouth with a little bit of chewing. It was delicious. The pita bread and cilantro sauce was just out of this world. If I could, I would have ordered two more orders of the bread because of how delicious it was.  All in all, this place was very delicious and very close to the University, it's a good walk, good food, reasonably priced and has some college kid discounts, like a free drink or water. I will definetly be coming back and this time for a big Chicken Gyro!"}
{"text":"I am so excited about this place.  I tried Flame Kabob a couple days after eating and Paymon's and this blew them away.  Their koobideh is better than Paymon's or Habib's, but without the price of Paymon's or the uncomfortable bow-tied servers and forced upscale feeling of Habib's.  The atmosphere is like a Chipotle style place, with a walk up counter and tables, and they bring your food out to you when it's ready.  We tried the chicken and beef koobideh and the beef tenderloin (not sure if i have that name right).  All were great, but I liked the chicken the most.  Also have pretty good hummus, great shirazi salad too!   Never bother with the the more expensive places just to get some decent kabobs again!"}
{"text":"It's in a little abandoned strip mall and its a little hole in the wall, but I really liked it. Walked there from campus. This place was my first gyro of all time and I happy it took my gyro virginity. Get the lamb gyro with fries and a diet raspberry snapple. Quality for like 6.99."}
{"text":"I liked their food. Delicious and good pricing. I enjoyed more than their Maryland Pkwy place."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  The hummus and pita bread are a must and the chicken kabob is the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Not great. Forgot to give me a lot of items in my to go order. Flavor leaves a lot to be desired as well."}
{"text":"Falefel and Gyro sandwiches were delicious! We will be back. Thank you Sam."}
{"text":"The dude that works here closed the store at 10 instead of 10:30 and kicked the us out. Who does that to a customer? Then he agreed to use a deal and after 5 min of waiting requested $6 because the deal couldn't be used with the special. What the what? This was one of the most strange services I have ever received. I hope the owner sees this review and has an answer for the worse customer service ever."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall kind of place, but so so good. If you want tasty flavorful Mediterranean food, this is the spot !!! Staff were super nice and helpful and everything was prepared to order."}
{"text":"Horrible dirty place, see the local news story they did regarding food handling and kitchen. Its sickening."}
{"text":"Very dirty place, poor service, and found a hair in the food. I was not impressed and when the owner Manouch was notified he did nothing. I had them take the food back and did not order again. Searched through google and found that they had a series of violations for food handling and storage. EVERYONE PLEASE GOOGLE BEFORE GOING HERE AND SEE THE NEWS INTERVIEW. Be very afraid"}
{"text":"I was in town for couple of nights, and i ate there twice. Overall the quality of food was excellent, the restaurant was immaculate and super clean; it seems like they recently renovated the whole place. Customer service was great and very friendly. Being a middle eastern i highly recommend trying out the shawerma sandwich with fries, it was a new mix for me but it turned out great. They had this new Hummus recipe that was different than any hummus i have ever had in my life, and it was delicious. Most importantly the kabob plate; the meat was fresh and the seasoning was on point and authentic. They also have a variety of great sauces i would definitely try with your food. And if you got room for dessert, go with the baklava."}
{"text":"A tad pricey, but the quality of food is worth it.  The steak kabob was tender and cooked perfectly medium rare.  However, the ground meat kabob such as the ground chicken kabob, you get twice as much meat for the price, but the spices that are used are good."}
{"text":"Pretty good. When I walked in the owner was standing in front of the cash register and was talking on the phone, he then got off the house phone and onto his cell phone. All the while, I'm sitting there waiting SEVERAL minutes while I watch my 30 minute lunch break widdle away. I was about to walk out when finally, after literally 5 minutes, the owner finally found time for a customer rather than arguing with a vendor on the phone.  Although he still seemed rather annoyed I was there.    I ordered the ground chicken kabob and the shirazi salad. The kobob and rice were good. I like Kabob Grill on Sunset & Pecos better, although the portions here were much bigger. The flat bread is made fresh in house, which is a bonus, but the customer service from the owner sucked.  UPDATE 9/10/10:  My coworker loves this place so I figured I would give it another shot. We went in today and both ordered our lunches to go. She received her lunch wrapped up to go in about 10 mins which is normal since everything is cooked to order. Since I had ordered before her I figured mine should be coming up any minute. I waited. and waited. and waited.   At this point I checked my receipt and it had been 20 mins from the time I had ordered. The manager who had handed my friend her to go bag (different from the manager before) walked towards our table; I figured he was going to give us one of those \"your food is coming right up\" but he walked right past without saying anything. So I waited. and waited.  Clearly my food had to be coming right up since the manager knew I was waiting. I looked to my left and saw a group who had ordered after me all enjoying their food. The manager then returned to the kitchen. I was still waiting.   After 25 mins I went back up to the counter with my receipt asking when my food would be ready. The girl who had taken my order gave me a look of confusion, blankly looked around the kitchen and then at her manager. The manager also gave a look of confusion and blankly looked around the kitchen. He turned around and there was my food, all wrapped up in bag ready to go, just sitting there. No one had called out my number or bothered to let me know it was ready. They had just set it aside and left me waiting.   When I said to the manager I had been waiting 25 mins (which he had plainly seen himself) he didn't seem to care. Food is decent but their customer service sucks!"}
{"text":"First time i stopped by i tried the chicken shawrma also the appetizer sampler ( 3 flafel, humus and baba ghanosh ) and the bread was made fresh  worth to give it a shot"}
{"text":"I have a traveling job and have seen and eaten at far and wide places. With that premise, I must admit that this place serves the best of the Kababs, I have ever eaten!  When I eat any of their beef, lamb or chicken kababs, the first bite into the juicy flavorful meat makes me close my eyes and savor every morsel of it! Don't forget to try their Humus and of course the rice is super good too!  Another interesting part is right opposite the street, you can see the McCarran airport landing strip and it is exactly that very spot where the planes touch down...so if you want to take some nice pictures of planes, this is the place."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town. Very nice owners. Food is very carefully served. These guys operate with love."}
{"text":"They have the best authentic persian food ! They have this rose tea that is simply amazing I would and will be going back it was a little hot but it's well worth it! Food is simply amazing"}
{"text":"Really good kabobs. Clean restaurant.  Not crazy about location but food is worth it. I get chicken and beef special for $10. Great prices and it's a good business lunch spot."}
{"text":"I love to eat here. Food is always great and good quality, my parents always come and eat here because it's their favorite! It's great that their meat is Halal. There are vegetarian options and many side dishes you can get, my favorite being their hummus. Service is great and I will for sure be coming back with some friends."}
{"text":"An excellent, well-priced menu. Quite attentive and accommodating staff.  Very tasty food and generous portions. Very clean kitchen area. An all-time favorite."}
{"text":"Had a 50 guest dinner catered by Flame Kabob a few months back. Spoke with the owner a couple weeks before to set everything up. Got a great price and everything was ready on time as promised. Multiple times throughout the night I received complements on the food. Everything was warm and fresh. Planning to host another dinner in the near future and will keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"Flame Kabob is en fuego!!  The new Spring Valley location of Flame Kabob doesn't disappoint.  The interior is outfitted in brick, lusciously hand-painted ethereal wisps of detail, and a few beautiful oil paintings in regal brass frames.  It's bright, clean, and refreshing, much like the flavors you'll find in the authentic Persian cuisine.  I went with the Schawarma (beef and lamb).  It came wrapped in a wonderful Taftoon Bread (Persian pita, but better)  The bread was rolled out from the dough, and cooked in a clay oven right before my eyes.  Cue the 70's porn music...(bow-chicka-bow-wow!)    Also accompanying this huge Persian pleasure feast was some tomato, seasoned onion, lettuce, Tahini, fresh hummus, and dolmeh.  Dolmeh is Persian Dolmades for those of you familiar with Greek food.  It is a grape leaves stuffed with rice, onion, oil, saffron, and other fantastic flavors I couldn't figure out.  I finished this one, and immediately regretted not ordering more.  It was as satisfying as pizza rolls were when you were 12, or pizza rolls now if you're a kid at heart.    The schawarma itself was light in flavor, yet filling.  I had trouble finishing the meal and I was starving.  Notes of lemon, good olive oil, and the lamb and beef danced around beautifully with each bite I took.  I tried it with both the hummus and the tahini, but honestly, neither were needed, the flavor profile was perfect.  I would recommend ordering an extra side of the Taftoon Bread and dip your face off (nicholas cage movie reference anyone?)    This is a family run vacation from the greasy, typical, and always disappointing.  I feel bad even using these words in the review, this place is great and you need to get your Perzh-on!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, food was okay, had the chicken and beef shwarma. Favors are decent, rice was good. But, this is the first place I've ever been to that doesn't have regular water, you want water, you have to buy a bottle!, WTF?  I know the water in Vegas isn't the best tasting around but really!!! Was a last minute find and I didn't use Yelp to review prior to going in. For the money there is much better out there."}
{"text":"I dont like putting 1 stars. But this place was nasty. The AC was not working the employees were all sweating. It was dirty everywhere including the tables and chairs. Food is NASTY. We spent $35 for 1 plate one hummus and dolma \"Rip-Off\". It doesn't make sense for a Mediterranean restaurant to serve plastic cheap utensils with hard to cut kabobs. Oh and before I forget, they put oil on the meat during the cooking process so people can eat it. Since its so dry and bland. I will NEVER go back !!!"}
{"text":"First of all the service was extremely bad and unpleasant;I ordered my food and it took too long and I also ordered soup they didn't bring it to us and did not refund us,when I came to ask for some cups the cashier took too long to see what I wanted as he was talking on the phone for too long. Secondly the food portions were bad as the meat(kabob) portion was bigger than the rice's portion.  I do not recommend this restaurant for anybody"}
{"text":"Mom and pop place, nothing extra ordinary. Food taste good , lamb was chewy . Not bad for the price. May be going back, but the gf was not excited."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is fresh.  Family run, local business and they care that the food is flavorful, fresh, and healthy.  Tried it out after a family member or friend at a fabulous coffee shop recommended it.  Tried it out and have ordered food at least 10 times since.  Food has been consistently delish!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great for the Health Conscious!  If you can tell from my other reviews, an occasional healthy meal is needed in my diet. On this particular day I was definitely looking for a healthy alternative to my normal grub fest. Decided that Flame Kabob would probably do.  Do they did. Although my order was very limited in variety, Shirazi Salad (Cucumber, Tomato, onion and parsley in lemon and olive oil)  and Hummus, I was very satisfied both in taste and quantity. The bread that is served along side is made to order and cooked in a traditional oven and is outstanding.  I plan on coming back to order a full meal in the very near future and hope to be able to give them the whole row of five stars in my updated review....stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Meat were tender and marinated well. Staff is nice and friendly. Garlic sauce is to die for. Price is reasonable. Place is not dirty. They make food from scratch.   Im really surprised they only got 4 stars, this place is very good.   Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great place if you're hungry! The servings are full and they have many options. Also, the place looked clean enough but unfortunately I had heard bad things before.   I liked the food options they gave and the server was nice enough. Looked a little bored but for the short interaction we had, his attitude sufficed. :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to come while waiting for a friend to arrive at Airport, or just to watch the planes take off and land. The Baba Ghanoush was fantastic, as well as the thick hummus. The Dolmeh are fresh. As it says on the menu \"always fresh no heat lamps, no microwaves, no freezers.\" The Middle Eastern family eating close by seemed to enjoy the food as well. This place is looking to branch out to a chain(thus the chain feel) but this is the only one...so far. This place is going to give paymon's a run for its money. Can't wait to go back. loved it!"}
{"text":"Welcoming friendly staff. Great food! Fast service. Clean facility.. what more could you ask for?! Highly recommend this place to anyone craving Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I had number 1 (beef kabob kubideh) . For the price I paid, it was a lot of food. The beef was nice and juicy and the meat is organic and halal."}
{"text":"I went in to Flame Kabob for the first time to redeem a coupon for a free kabob and wound up adding a full lamb kabob platter.  The owner was incredibly personable and took great pride in his food, chatting with us about the origin of his produce as we waited a short time for our order to be prepared.  I have to say I was highly impressed!  The food's flavor and texture was fantastic and the drink selection (with free refills) was immense.  I highly recommend the lamb kabobs and the sour cherry iced tea and look forward to returning to this little restaurant in the near future."}
{"text":"At 12:20 on a weekday I was the only person in the place.  That should have told me something right there.  I placed my order, the grill had to be heated first (because why have the grill on when you don't have any business, right??)  Waited for the food to be cooked.  Got the Ground Chicken Kabobs.  They tasted like there was a whole lot more filler than chicken in them.  And then, I felt sick to my stomach the rest of the day.  Threw out the menu I brought back to the office with me, and threw out the frequent buyer punch card cause I'm NOT going back THERE!"}
{"text":"The food is always very good. The baklava is home made by the owners mom and it's incredible. They are always friendly and I enjoy coming here. The pistachio saffron ice cream is to die for!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and low prices. I ordered the Gyro Special and it was delicious. They don't skimp on the gyro meat or veggies. A good place to go to for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical but was quickly put at ease and impressed with the friendly staff, the presentation of the food, and of course the taste.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed w flavor. Got the combo chicken and lamb for lunch and it was really average. The spicy flavor was really meek and didn't give it a good flavor. The value wasn't there for a lunch place. $10 per plate roughly.. With a name like \"Flame\" I was hoping it was going to be a bunch of tasty Kabobs.. but not to be had.."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I love the Kabob - offically Kubideh -  with the mast-o-kahir.  The fresh baked bread (Sorry can't remember authentic name), is wonderful.  Lunch for two for under $15 is a great deal.  I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous.  I love Gyros and this place opened close to home - I was stoked!  Finally got a chance to try it out and went in to order a Gyro.  I walked to the register and said I will take a Gyro sandwich.  I was told that I couldn't buy just a sandwich unless I had a coupon (????).  I was confused and asked what do you mean - I just want a sandwich.  He preceded to tell me that I could not order just a sandwich.  I informed him that I didn't want the other stuff and I would just throw them away and I got a deer in the headlights look so I asked for the owners phone number.  I called the owner and he informed me of the same policy.  It reminded me of the Jack Nicholson Five Easy Pieces schtick about holding the chicken    Needless to say, I ended up buying a Gyro sandwich (only) at Kyklos at the mall."}
{"text":"Since ive moved here from LA this is my favorite Mediterranean spot in Henderson. Coming from an area in LA where Mediterranean is very popular and authentic. I have to say this place is really good. Anyone looking for some authentic food, I recommend trying this spot. They have recently remodeled and its definitely more appealing and welcoming from the inside. Outside is normal looking but it goes from night to day as soon as you walk in."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and great energy. Food was tasty, very delicious, and prepared fast! Even though they forgot our falafel, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great prices Great Food Had chicken kabob & beef kabob.  Very Good  Taftoon. Like home Shirazi nothing Special Lentil soup. Good Ash: good  Service : excellent & very nice  Clean Environment.   Will Return soon.  :-))))"}
{"text":"Once again we are back at Flaming kabob this is the place to be when you're traveling through Henderson best customer service the food is phenomenal as always fresh very quiet nice place to just sit down and enjoy your food fellow yelpers you got to try this place thanks again guys see you guys soon"}
{"text":"Wow, generally speaking, this is probably one of the most crooked places I've been to in Vegas! Please note, do not buy the Groupon here, you will get hoodwinked!! I've never had so much trouble using one until I came to this spot.  First, I would like to say that the employees are not at fault for the confusion, I think the owner of this location is the main culprit in the poor customer service. They are creating ridiculous rules for their customers. So the groupon is for 5 for 10. On my first visit, the tall guy wouldn't add tax into the total price of the meal. I was like \"fine\". I was able to macguyver my ordering until the total before tax was 9.98. They guy was like \"our minimum is 10 dollars before you can use it\" I was thinking \"what a great way to nickel and dime your customers\"! The tall guy was rude and confrontational to a customer in front of me.   The next day, I came back to use up the groupon and fortunately the tall guy wasn't working at that time. I wasn't impressed with the food during the last visit, so just decided to order sides and dessert. I was then told that I could not use the groupon because it was not a \"food item\".... ... ....... ..............  So ice cream and sides aren't food? Apparently not I guess. He then told me the groupon is available only for the numbered items, 1-14, on the menu, no sides, drinks, salads or anything else..  I was about to bust out my Cris Carter, \"Cmon man!\" The shorter guy with glasses proceeded to apologize saying those are the rules set by the management there. I understood.  Food wise, there is nothing to talk about here, everything is mediocre. Very bland and disappointing. I do have to say the Rose tea was really good.  I've done the math here. Mediocre food + shady, non-customer oriented iron handed management with a concern only with a bottom line = 2 stars!! And I thought I was being generous. In the words of Terminus \"Never again\"."}
{"text":"This place makes such yummy food. I tried the chicken kabob plate and it was a delight. The hummus and pita bread are good as well. Also their spicy sauce is amazing with the kabob. The workers were also really nice and attentive. Great experience here. Will come back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"The foods not consistent. I ate here a few months ago and the food was great but yesterday it wasn't. The koobideh was dry.   The restaurant is old and needs an update. They took out the nasty booths which was a good move but there is a lot of empty space.   Ok for take out but eating there is a depressing. That whole strip mall needs to be town down."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to the Flame Kabob very much. I have since learned from those times when I stuffed myself with the mix and match combo. I now order the #9 which is a Beef Kubideh wrap.  You can also get in chicken.  It is very similar to a Gyro but must more heartier as the rice is wrapped up in it.  It is important to consume your food as quickly as possible because as it cools the flavor and textures do change.  What I enjoy most is chilling out with an iced tea, eating my meal, chit chatting about whatever and watching the planes land at LAS.  As another Yelper said arrive shortly after they open at 11:00 because it will be super busy at 12:00."}
{"text":"Being Greek and having a Persian background from family I tried to keep expectations in check when I found this place. (Even though I was pretty excited when I saw that this little shopping center in my neighborhood was finally getting some culture-including the Palm Mediterranean market and the Pho place) Either way, it really went beyond my expectations and I was impressed.  Prices are reasonable, esp since you get a nice sized piece of bread, salad, rice and some veggies. I had the lamb kubideh w/ dolmas and the lamb tenderloin (on separate occasions). Both were good, but I REALLY enjoyed the ground lamb, it was more juicy and flavorful. I was also fairly impressed with the dolmas-and that's comparing it to my Yia Yia's (greek for grandmother).   I'm really happy that I've found a neighborhood place to get a tasty fix of middle eastern food that is also reasonable, clean and healthy.  If I didn't spend most of my lunch funds around UNLV so much I'd be regular!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken kabob.    The only thing that I enjoyed was the kabob itself.     The white sauce had too much anise.    Not exactly \"fast\" food as you have to wait longer and nor was the $14   price with small drink.    Sour cherry was good though too sweet for my taste"}
{"text":"We stop by The Flame every time we are in this area. We really love the food! It's always very fresh and totally delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I only tried the beef/lamb schwarma, so perhaps other items are better.  This is a Persian restaurant, not a Greek restaurant.  The meat was way too spicy for me.  I don't mean hot spicy, I mean TONS of spice on each bite.  So if that is what you like, go for it.  I like the Greek version better."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place for about 3 years. It has changed hands several times since then.  It was tack inside but the food was great and the sauces fresh. Now it's not so good. The rice is terrible and the kubideh dry.  The mint sauce was expired and drying out in the container , I asked for fresh one and they said they did not have any. Without the mint sauce the food is tasteless and dry.  The bread was undercooked and tasted like dough.  The kitchen was filthy. People prepping and serving were not wearing an apron. I give this restaurant three months tops before it closes or is sold to yet someone else."}
{"text":"The Persian Saffron and Rose Water ice cream with crushed pistachios and their Persian Rose Water iced tea here at Flame Kabob are the stars here. Im a fan of rosy floral notes in my teas and dessert. So my attention was paid more to tea and ice cream! I haven't had the chance to try the meats or have a full meal just yet.  I was originally introduced to Persian ice cream back in the 80's.The one I had here was just as authentic as how my friend's mom made it. Big plus ice cream is made from scratch! Saffron and Rose was fragrant when I took off the lid of the cup. The two flavors go well together.    The placard signs on the street advertising Gyro lunch special for $5.99 is what caught my eye and lead me here initially. Besides Gyros,Beef,Chicken and lamb kabobs, they have 3 different kinds of soup, sides like Babaghanoush, Hummus and Dolmeh.  Hummus was good, spiced just right for me. Texture, smooth hardly any graininess, almost whipped light, wasnt the thick pasty kind. The flat bread tasted good too. It was made to order,so it was nice and warm when they served it to me.   Dolmeh was perfect snack size portion. Served chilled on bed of greens topped with a sliced tomato.  The menu prices varies here from the deal mentioned above, to reasonable under 10 dollar combo meals up to the pricey (IMO) $20 for 2 lamb combo deal. Yeah..dunno about that.    It's a small fast/casual restaurant. No table service. Order and pay at counter. Dining area is simple set up down one side of the wall with couple tables and 1 long table for larger group. The place was fairly clean, but felt a bit cluttered. Food prep area appeared to be clean as well.   Staff friendly. Everybody knows what they are doing. My order came out fairly quick.  This new Flame Kabob location is: Warm Springs Promenade. The backside of the restaurant faces Marks St near Big Lots.   So far it's A+ ok for me! I know I will be a bigger fan when I get around to trying the kabobs!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I try to eat lunch here at least once a week.  I've now tried the Beef and Lamb Kabob, comes with Mast O' Khiar (Cucumber and yogurt salad), white rice, Shirazi Salad, and Pita bread.  A great value for the price! When I eat lunch there, I normally spend less than $10.00, and am full until the next day!  The same guy has been there, behind the counter, every time I've been there. His service goes above and beyond expectations. He's a very nice guy, and has remembered me every time I've gone in there. If I could give this business 10 stars, I would. Clean and welcoming environment, excellent food, and superior service."}
{"text":"The food was great ... this is very a Greek place we frequent.  I'm going to definitely add this restaurant into my rotation!"}
{"text":"Usually when I have a falafel, I review those chickpeas, but in this case the bread is the clear standout. It is not a Pita Bread, but the menu says Persian Bread and its like a flatbread. In this case it was hot and fresh out of the oven, but it still was able to fold and form a sandwich around the small pellets of falafel and lettuce, tomato also. Falafel was on top of this bread becuase it wasn't a pita so that was different. I went in for the $3.99 special (which is just sandwich), but for $5.99, you get great fluffy rice, one dolma which was perfect and then a small side of marinated onions which were great for the falafel. The Tzitica sauce was good, but you will need more than what they give you. It is tasty. Looks like kabobs are the specialty and the falafel itself was also way above average - brownish in color inside, hot, small and well spiced. A very good falafel in a town of pretenders and its not even all abiout the falafel."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken, lamb, and beef kabobs. Baklava and pistachio and saffron ice cream. it's authentic with the persian music playing in the background. Coming from LA, where there are lots of Persian restaurants, my standards are a little higher. The kabobs were a little on the drier side but the rice was nice and fluffy.  The desserts were amazing but i did notice on the package that they were all shipped from LA. Overall, friendly service.."}
{"text":"Walking in, there was one woman ahead of us. We ordered the 4 meals, 2 #13s, a #6, and something else that I can't quite remember.  Keep in mind, if you would like to add feta cheese, or some extra sauce, it's $2. PER CUP. Our food was almost $70. We waited thirty minutes for our food.  The shwarma was okay. All I tasted was the spice. The sandwich didn't have much meat in it.... it had lots of lettuce, and a boatload of tomato. The meat was coated with spices, and the meat itself, tasted nothing like beef or lamb...it was dense..   There wasn't any \"brightness\". Just all tasted the same. Some citrus would have really helped it. I noticed that other people in my party got limes in their boxes.....I didn't.   Also, the tomato in my sandwich had the butt end of the tomato...you know, the top where the stem was....That was left on , and put in my sandwich. Not very appetizing , biting down on that.  The bread that they served with it was burnt on the bottom. Only a few slices were even edible.   I noticed that they did serve gyros here, but being this close to the Great Greek, I'd much rather pop over there for a gyro."}
{"text":"This is such a unique restaurant with such a unique theme and idea. I absolutely love it. It is probably one of my favorite restaurants ever. The steak is amazing and so is the chicken and I can not wait to try the lamb on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Food is full of flavor. I am in love with this spot. You can tell they cooked the food with love despite it being fast food. I will definitely be revisiting this spot when i'm in this area!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a freaking rip off. 12 dollars for a meal in a crap hole like this. The food quality and portions suck, I wouldn't mind if I left there satisfied. I could go to a nice sit down restaurant in Dearborn, Michigan and eat like a king for 12 dollars and have food to take home. Oh, that's right, in Dearborn the food is cooked by Arabic people(Syrian, Labanese, Iraqui) These so called \"Persian\" people who try to mask the fact that they are really IRANIAN because the general public is too stupid to catch on."}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas last year during Christmas and spent all our time eating on the \"strip.\"  This year we wanted to try out the local eateries. I read reviews of local restaurants on Yelp and our family of 8 tried out various eating places outside the strip during this vacation.  Our first stop upon our arrival in Las Vegas was at Flame Kabob on December 21st. The food here was great and we all enjoyed it immensely.  Everything was freshly made. Our  thanks to all the posters who suggested this place."}
{"text":"Good but far from Great.  Not sure if it's the Persian style but the food here just doesnt compare to my usual middle eastern eateries.  On the plus side the Hummus is quite possibly the BEST HUMMUS i've ever had. If i could i would buy a 16oz drink cup size of it and suck it through a straw.  The number 13 Shredded Beef and Lamb specialty plate is reasonably priced at 8.99, one of the few lamb dishes to remain the same cost from the to go menu to the main board.   On the side you get a small mixed green salad, a wedge of lemon, a glop of hummus (soo good..), a dolmeh, a small container of yogurt with cucumber sauce, and your...i guess it was a wrap.   The dolmeh was good but when paired with the yogurt sauce whoa that was something.   The wrap itself left something to be desired. I did enjoy the taftoon bread, it had a nice freshness to it and was different from the pita i'm used to. The meat was seasoned a little too well. Near the end of my meal i could hardly recall if there was any lamb in it seeing as the spices were so heavy it masked any individual taste of the meat itself. What little hummus and cucumber yogurt i had left were thrown on the wrap and it did improve the taste. Toward the end i reached for a bottle of franks red hot to liven things up a bit.   Also ordered a Lamb & Beef Gyro. I missed the lunch special by an hour so instead of 3.99 for gyro only i had to pay the standard price for the entire meal. Not really a problem.  Ali at Kebab Korner has spoiled me. Even when he tried to singe my taste buds by making his famous super gyro 'burn my ass' (his actual words to his staff \"one super gyro, super spicy! BURN HIS ASS!!') with it's level of spiciness it just made me want more.  This gyro is extremely mellow, the meat was a bit dry and inside covered with yogurt cucumber sauce. It was good but it to me it just tasted shallow and empty compared to Kebab Korner.  Being considerably closer than Kebab Korner i might consider coming back a few time to take advantage of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"This place is a rare find.  Real FRESH food. Gyros sish kabobs. Excellent food and friendy people.  All the food is made to order so it is NOT fast food but it is well worth the wait.  I grabbed a menu so I can call ahead and pick it up.  They will deliver for orders over $100.   It is so nice to find a place where quality comes before speed or price.  Try it, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Where to start...Persian cold ice teas, sour cherry and Rosewater are fantastic.  Appetizers: BabaGanoush and the Hummus are perfectly made. Entrees: ground lamb kabob is best in Vegas. Stews are fantastic and \"Ash\" soup is great. Decor is great but styrofoam plates don't meet the same high standard of the food. Entree prices between $7-$15 with appetizers between $2-$5. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy! So fresh and light!!  I loved it.. Michelle E.  took me here for lunch and I love it!  The tender meats and yummy sauce are making me drool right now.   I had the Ground Beef Kubideh Kabob combo- #1 which comes with the 1 beef kabob, fresh taftoon bread, side salad, grilled tomato, and saffron rice.    The portion was huge and didn't think that I would finish the entire thing... but of course I did.  The thing about that though, is that I didn't have to roll myself out, or feel like I ate car.  It was THAT good! :D  The second time around, did not disappoint.   I ordered the same thing... but per Michelle E.'s recommendation I HAD to try the baba ghanoush.   VERY YUMMY!!!!  Smoky but very oily.   It's very similar to grilled eggplant... but mushier.  :P  I will come again!   It's definitely opened my eyes to other Mediterranean spots!"}
{"text":"Very helpful staff, food prepared after ordering, very flavorful. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Last night I went to their new location on Maryland Pkwy and Harmon across the street from UNLV.    The owner, Manou (sp), was working the cash register and he was so nice; a great chatter.  I asked him who had better gyros, him or Paymon's (also located on Maryland near UNLV).  He said I would have to be the judge of that.  Flame Kabob wins hands down! It was so good. So flavorful.  So fresh.  I also ordered the baba ganoush, which was AMAZING.  A place to add to my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"If you are trying to impress a date with the \"decor\"... This is not the place.  If you want amazing flavor... You have found it!  If you want \"fast\"food. This is not the place.  If you want \"fresh\" food... This is the place!  Pay the extra 3.00 for the tenderloin (ground meat is just not as good). Best bet is to share a plate that has all 3 (beef chicken lamb). The saffron rice is excellent (not hard, not watery, just right). Hard to decide which is better (beef or chicken). The lamb is great, just not normal palate (the adventurous will love it). Best was that the flavor was not overpowering, yet was infused throughout.  No need to add salt or pepper.  \"Flavorful\" describes this the best.  Again, don't go for the decor... You WILL be disappointed.  Go for the food... You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! The best Mediterranean food I've eaten. The ingredients are so fresh and delicious. I cannot express how tasteful the food was. The workers were all extremely nice and outgoing.  Highly recommend trying Flame kabob. Yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the most amazing Persian food I've had! Awesome service, the owner was so kind and gave us complimentary drinks and homemade Baklava (that his mom makes) for being first timers at the establishment! Love love loved it!!"}
{"text":"Let me start from the moment we walked in... A handsome man with huge smile  greeted us ask if we were \" new\" to restaurant.  When we said yes he immediate started explaining the menu. We choose #8 to split and dolmeh as an appetizer. Everything was made fresh and to order.  There was a couple from Jordan at table next to us so I knew we weren't going to be disappointed. The dolmeh came over some fresh not packaged lettuce with a couple of slices of tomatoe. I could of drank the dressing!!! Liked it so much my smiling handsome man friend gave me the recipe. He not only explained in detail he showed me the bottle he made it in to help me with proportions.. When our food came presented to perfection, he surprised us with a little extra treat..  Food was fabulous, customer appreciation was superb and his momma's baklava was his gift to us as we left.  Thank you for making our evening so sweet..."}
{"text":"Everything was very tasty. I have ordered soup and lamb kebab. Clean place. Recommend place!"}
{"text":"We love Flame Kabob! it is fast and inexpensive for the quality of food. We took our Iranian friend there (he was visiting from California) and he loved the food. It is just a small place but you can order it in and it's always ready when you get there. The portion sizes always give me two meals out of them. I love the lamb kabob but everything is really good here. The babaganoush, the spices are not too strong and always, always have to have my rose water tea! Love that refreshing taste. The service is fast and very very friendly. Do not skip on desert as the baklava is made by the mom and is so delicious! It's usually too sweet for me but this one is like the ones I used to eat during my childhood. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Just started working close bye. OMG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this place is AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll be eating here allot. Today had the chicken Kabob with Hummus = Fantastic !!!!!!!!!!!! and the fresh flatbread is also GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kind and helpful staff, clean environment, and most importantly the food was absolutely delicious. My sister and I ordered the steak shawarma and the beef,lamb,chicken kabobs. I would recommend it! The steak shawarma comes with a side, we got fries which were tasty. The kabob plate was a healthy serving that came with rice and salad and definitely had some leftovers to take home. They gave us free pistachio saffron ice cream, which was so sweet of them, and was delicious. It's really hard to find pistachio saffron ice cream so I was beyond excited that they had is available."}
{"text":"This place can only be described as awful and disgusting. I came here based on it's proximity to UNLV (I always see the sign when I drive past) but it is UNACCEPTABLE on so many levels. Go to Kabob Express on the corner of Tropicana and Eastern instead, it's not that much further.  I should have had a bad feeling when the place was deserted at dinner time on Saturday night. It looks gross from outside - really no frills, under a creepy walkway, across from an abandoned store. When we walked up and I still wanted to go in, my friends joking said, \"Wow, you're feeling adventurous!\" which can give you a better idea of how gross this place actually is.  The inside was no better. Everything was covered in filth and it looked like nobody had cleaned in a week. We moved several times and couldn't find a table without remnants of food, rice and dirt. The condiments on the table were old, crusted over and just looking at them made me sick to my stomach! This place needs an inspection ASAP. It is definitely not up to health codes by anybody's standards.  We ate in and the owner refused to give me a glass of water. This is an immediate red flag for me at ANY restaurant. He clearly had cups and there was clearly a soda fountain with a water spout. Is making an extra dollar off a plastic water bottle that important to your business that you can't properly serve your paying customers?  All the plates, cups, utensils were styrofoam. It felt like we were eating at a homeless shelter, except the food was overpriced and I was denied water, which I'm sure homeless people are allowed.  I ordered a chicken salad and my friends ordered shish kabob plates. All the portions were TINY!! My chicken salad literally had ONE SQUARE of chicken. One, single (think like 1 inch square) piece of chicken was on my salad that I paid $6 for. There wasn't even a good amount of salad but it was all drenched in a greasy cheap Italian-like dressing.  Don't ever go here. This place should be shut down. There is better food in the area."}
{"text":"A really good example of Kabob. The green sauce is wonderful, spicy, but not hot. It is full of flavor, mint, parsley, cumin, garlic, cilantro, and a million tasty things. It's a small place but the food could be served in a four star establishment. If these guys had a nice big reasturant, they could take Las Vegas by storm. For now we can eat the fantastic food and hang out in this little place with the people who live here. I recommend the chicken and the lamb kabob. Order a hummus and falafel plate. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So very impressed with this little place. The food was just amazing, the place was cool and quiet, and the staff was so lively and fun. I had a great time socializing with the sweet girl at the register and enjoying the amazing meal I just couldn't stop eating. It was great, they'll see me there, very often."}
{"text":"Meat made on the fire grill tastes delicious. My first time here definitely going to come back to try the platers. The chicken shawarma sandwich was good.  Maybe something missing but am grateful for the food, people that prepared and appreciate the service."}
{"text":"One word- YUM! My husband is a huge fan of Persian food and when he found out about this place, we went the next day.  We went in with high expectations, and Flame Kabob did not disappoint.  At our table we had everything from Kabobs to Schwarma and everything was absolutely wonderful! The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The saffron rice is some of the best I've had and the bread, my god the bread! Made to order in what looked like some sort of clay oven.  Heavenly!  We will definitely be going back to Flame Kabob again and again!"}
{"text":"I look at the 5-star reviews that abound on this listing and wonder if they went to the same restaurant I did.  We stopped by for dinner on a early Sunday evening. There were no other customers, so we were able to sit immediately. The interior of the place is bit odd. There are shingles on the fairly unappetizing putty gray walls. And the floors were slightly dirty. Bits of food laying around. Altogether not HORRIBLE, but off putting.  Ordered Chicken Shish Kabob plate and Two (Chicken and Beef) Skewer combo. The food is okay. Plenty of rice, but really just okay.  In short, you'll get food that is okay. As in you can eat it, but you won't be particularly happy you did. That's about it. Unless they improve their food quality I'd expect they won't be able to get many people to return."}
{"text":"Delicious. BBQ chicken kabob was excellent. The chicken had plenty of flavor in itself and the bbq sauce on top was a nice accompaniment. Served on a bed of saffron rice with toasted pita bread and a little side salad it was an absolute treat of a lunch. My wife got the chicken shawarma and it really stole the show. Beautifully cooked chicken, toasted bread, hummus, and a side salad all for $9.   Indulged in the baklava and it was a delicious note to end the meal with. If they ask you if you want 2 of them $5 do yourself a favor and say yes please!  Also, the added bonus was the nice service we received. Our cashier/server went out of his way to bring us napkins when he saw we didn't have any already. Granted, nice a huge deal but the little touches like that are what makes a place stand out in my mind. Well, that and the amazingly tasty food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Before I moved to las Vegas I lived in glendale California which is home of the Armenians. That means there is a kebab place on every corner, Iv eaten a lot of this food. This place is right up there with some of the best  Iv ever eaten.  The seasoning is great, the spicy pickled onions are amazing. The people who work there are really  nice, great customer service.  My wife and I took  a chance driving by and we saw it as a sign because we were just talking about how there are no kebab places out in vegas, kinda eerie but it all worked out for the best. I'll be back, the flavors are amazing. Authentic. Fyi I had the  chicken shish  kebab and my wife and the beef shwarma sandwich both excellent. That sandwich  was good size too. If u don't know what shwarma or tahini sauce is, ask them, then try it, it's all good."}
{"text":"Fresh, homemade pita that is amazing. Sauces (hummus and Tzatziki) were both excellent. Some of the freshest and delicious Mediterranean we've tried out here and really friendly service to finish. Definitely planning to go back."}
{"text":"The steak shawarma is to die for! Full of flavor and very authentic. This is close to home and work and is a go to spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! High-quality meat and great service. Israel is very nice and friendly. I recommend this place to all of my family and friends!"}
{"text":"We came around closing time from the airport desperate for some food. They were kind enough to accommodate us.  Food was really good!!  We got the chicken shawarma - I loved the spices on the chicken! So different than what I've tasted before!  Also got a chicken kubideh wrap. Was tasty, unique and had rice in it too!   Overall, a really good place to eat! Not the best regarding ambience and the location but then again, we were there really late when all the stores around them were also closed.   Recommend the chicken shawarma and chicken kubideh wrap!"}
{"text":"Food was  ok. The lamb kabobs were tasty but the rice had no favor. They are not happy when you tell them you have a groupon. With the groupon you can't order any of the mix grills. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"It feels great knowing that the owner remembers us from the last time, super friendly and amazing food at all times. Great place to study and to step out of the campus for a bit."}
{"text":"I asked the gentleman that helped me (I think he's the owner) for a lo-carb plate.  He made a nice falafel, hummus, green  salad with olives and he even added a grape leaf with rice.  It was all yummy!  He gave a slightly spicy green sauce they have available at the counter.  Delicious.  I work across the street and it was very quick for a lunch hour.  They have a kinds of other specialities I want to try like wraps that look tasty and good deals."}
{"text":"The food is halal/kosher and excellent.  It's cooked fresh on the spot, but that means there's a twenty minute wait. Best to call in and order in advance. We carry out at least once every two weeks."}
{"text":"Really good food. The staff were awesome! Falafel amazing. Good vegetarian options -sample plater is meatless and tasty"}
{"text":"Amazing and healthy food! The yogurt drinks (Original especially) are amazing and worth it. Don't be discouraged by the pomegranate chicken."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice because it's close to my house and both times everything was delicious. He also has A relish that he makes that's very unique and a green sauce that you really should try. I had the lamb kebab and it was cooked perfectly. The dish comes with a yogurt sauce and a vegetable salad. I will keep coming back and tasting everything. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"What a hidden secret! I'm a die hard foodie and I can be a food snob..... This was soooo good! They even had fresh pita made to order! The food was fresh and Authentic.... The ground skewers and Chicken Sharma so Authentic and amazing! The love subway tiles in restaurants and I was surprised the style.... I think it appeals to everyone... Service was great... I really felt like this was team effort to put out there best food ... I felt good when entered and was thanked when I left... You can tell they appreciate the business! Great job Flame kabob!"}
{"text":"Their food is great! Yes, the price can seem high, until you realize what you're eating! The meats are all kosher and come from outside the US. This is a must try"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!  It doesn't look like much from the outside they have a very casual inside decor!  However, the food is amazing and delicious!!!  The owner is very hands on from what we could tell taking orders and going over menu items if you have a question, will recommend items based on your likes!   I ordered the kabob combo of Kubideh  of lamb and chicken!  It comes with persian rice and salad and pita bread,  The lamb was fantastic great taste the chicken was good but the lamb was better I will try the steak next time.  We also ordered a side of baba ganoush.  It was delicious and fresh made.  Great roasted taste to the eggplant and the pita bread is made fresh.   They have plenty to choose from and a good selection if you are vegetarian!!  Will definitely be back, plus they are going to be opening more one in Henderson and one in Summerlin!!"}
{"text":"I'm a little paranoid writing this review because 1) I'm no expert on Persian food and 2) three of the other four reviews are not great.  Am I that far off??  I thought it was great!  $10 for juicy, succulent chicken tenderloin, beautiful tri-color saffron rice, pita bread, mixed green salad, and some onion salad thing.  A bit expensive for lunch, but DELICIOUS!    It did take about 15 minutes to prep my order (and nobody has that kind of time at lunch), but overall, worth it.  Clean, bright environment with marble flooring, charming little chandeliers, and an attempt at rustic painting on the wall.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was there last night with my son and had the most amazing experience there!!  The kind gentleman at the counter asked if we had dined with them before.  I told him it was our first visit and he walked through the whole menu with us and gave us great recommendations.  We ordered a couple of combos with beef and chicken that were so delicious.  We also tried the hummus and Baba Ghanoush that were out of this world.  The meals came with this amazing bread that we watched him prepare and bake in front of us ( really cool to watch!) .  This place rocks!! Between the amazing team that works there to the delicious food .. We will be back:) Thank-you for being so kind and for the amazing meal!"}
{"text":"The lamb meat is very well prepared and taste amazing. I had a Gyro and it was stuffed full. The employees were nice and professional. The ambience is calm and relaxing despite being across the street from the airport.  I would recommend you try arriving before the lunch time rush. If you get here after 1130ish you may be waiting awhile."}
{"text":"The baba ghanoush is incredible! ... and an absolute bargain at $2.49.  I am quite a connoisseur of this mediterranean specialty and this version is exceptional.  The owner told me that is a 100+ year old recipe, and it truly shows. I also had the chicken shawarma and it was very good too. Worth at least 4 stars, easily. And the staff is very caring and friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was very yummy! Excellent quality and taste, just a bit on the pricier side for a fast/casual place. Cost about $12 for a single lamb kabob meal. Used the mail coupon for an extra kabob, which made it more worth it. Lunch seems like a better price $4-6 for a gyro. My friend got a gyro and it was huge for the price! Great deal. I will get this next time. Also came with rice, a few bites of lettuce and a dolmeh."}
{"text":"Super good food! Ordered food online for pick up. Arrived and was greeted by friendly staff. Highly recommended. Thank you"}
{"text":"What can I say? Yummy. The menu is small but everything is freshly made and delicious. There is a little bit of a wait while they cook everything up but it's worth it.   If you had a friend who invited you over their house for dinner, that's what their food is like. Providing that your friend is a good cook that is, lol. They are also Halal if that is important to you. The selection features the usual kabobs, ground and chunks of lean meat cooked on swords. All excellent. They also have pistachio saffron ice cream, yum!  This is a counter service place but if you want to eat in there are really nice tables. And the staff is very friendly too. Only wish they were nearer to the house because I'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"I love the food from this place.  Always freshly made to order and the owner waits on you himself.  Very friendly and the atmosphere is legit.  Don't let the empty neighboring spots scare you.  They just opened not too long ago, so they are trying to garner some satisfied customers and they're doing a good job of it.  Their baklava is handmade and is cooked fresh everyday.  Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten as this restaurant several times during the past year.  The food is usually pretty good, maybe 3 out of 5 stars on average.  Today I used a restaurant.com voucher.  $25 towards $40 worth of food, however, read on for the unethical practices the owner of this restaurant put in place when attempting to use this voucher...  The restaurant.com voucher is a joke.  The restaurant automatically includes 18% gratuity on top of the bill.  This establishment is strictly counter-service, who is the tip for???  Also, specials are not allowed as part of the voucher redemption and most of what my party wanted was \"considered\" a special.  I felt penalized for trying to use the voucher.  I will never recommend this establishment for their unethical practices and because they made me feel like a piece of trash.  The fact that you have to spend $40 on a $25 voucher is one thing, but to not allow specials and factor in an unethical gratuity of 18% at a restaurant with no servers and strictly counter service shows that this owner has ZERO dignity as a small business owner and he should think twice before trying to lure patrons into an establishment that only allows \"one\" serving of it's special sauce per order!  A joke by any standard and when you refuse to cater to your customers, you deserve NOT to be in business.  Nothing but a HORRIBLE review for this jerk owner!!!"}
{"text":"12/8/17.  When I am in the area this is my kabob spot. Friendly, great food and fast service. I have been coming here for over a year and really love the food. Tried the ground lamb meal yesterday and it is really good.  I had thought about the veggie or chicken meals and got a surprized reaction from the young man that took my order. Most people order one and not considere the other. I just love both so it was a hard decision till I saw ground lamb. The cucumber salad was excelent and finished first. The tziki was so good I asked for more to take home with what was not eaten at the restaurant and the young man gave me a small container to tale with me at no charge. I should have bought extra flat bread because it was sooo good and by the time I got home 2 hours later that was a regretthat won't happen again ;) If you are looking for great food, service and clean location make this your go to place."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly owners.  I'm working my way through the menu.  I've been for lunch and dinner several times.  Everything is excellent.  The fresh baked bread done by hand is a specialty.  The tenderloin kabob is fantastic.  I took home some bread and hummus courtesy of one of the owners, Israel, and I am enjoying it as I write this.  Great value for this level of quality!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least four times now.  This place is great.  I really like the beef Koobedeh (kabob).  Very nicely done.  Much better than more expensive Persian restaurants here in LV.  The Must-o-mucir (yogurt with shallots dip) is A+.  I drive out from Summerlin to enjoy this Persian food.  The bread will blow you away too!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Persian/Middle Eastern food on the cheap.  If you want a nice casual, fast food experience with restaurant quality food, then this is the spot.  Lunch with a drink is easily under 8-9 bucks.  The food is served fresh and is packed with flavor.  I usually order the Kubideh combo which comes with 2 skewers opting with the Ground chicken and Ground lamb.  So much food for only 8-9 bucks."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time today, and will definitely return soon. The customer service was great, the restaurant was clean and the smell-amazing.      I ordered 2 chicken  Kubidehs for $11.99 which my husband and I shared.  The presentation and portions were generous for such a reasonable price. I really liked the saffron rice  and there was a side of onion and parsley to mix in with it. The salad also had a really nice kick to it; not sure what that extra taste was but it worked. The fresh Taftoon Bread was good especially dipped into the green sauce.      The next time I want to try the lamb and some Persian ice cream. I highly suggest visiting Flame Kabob,great location, ample parking, excellent customer service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I've had gyros in many places but I can sincerely tell you that this place makes the best gyros I have ever tasted and The Baklava delicious I will definitely return to this place and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.. owner/host was fabulous. Warm and welcoming , happy to educate any on the merits and tastes of Persian cuisine. Definitely will return for the food and the warm welcome! Thank you for opening a restaurant here in Henderson NV!  We had the 3 meat Kabob plate.. all were fantastic, the taftoon bread was fresh warm and delicious. Sampled the Rose Water tea and Sour Cherry tea both thirst quenching and wonderful unsweetened."}
{"text":"Two times for lunch in one week. If that doesn't say something, I don't know what will. Their inexpensive lunch specials are what brought me in, the flavorful, fresh food is what brought me back a second time around.   I tried the Chicken Kubideh Kabob ($3.99)- a flavorful, well-seasoned ground chicken kabob served on a freshly-made pita bread with some greens, a slice of lemon, and a side of cucumber & mint yogurt sauce.   Next visit I chose the Gyro ($3.99)- slices of beef/lamb, fresh tomatoes, greens & the same yogurt sauce wrapped in a warm pita bread. The gyro came w/ raw onions and a lemon slice. The portion size was generous. I thought the meat slices were a tad too salty, but the refreshing yogurt sauce balanced the gyro out.   If you're in this part of town and are in the mood for Greek food, go here. The quality is good, the ingredients are fresh and the prices are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been to this new location a handful of times already. Everything was perfect each time. The owner is incredibly sweet and is very passionate and proud for his business. I live at Sunrise Mountain in North Vegas but it is well worth the trip. I do prefer the new location to the old location just because I enjoy the look of the new location better, and because it's right by Lakeshore. As I write this review, I plan on heading there for dinner tonight, and taking a friend to try it out!"}
{"text":"Went there today and very disappointed. Used to be real authentic but now tastes and looks like pre manufactured food. Garden Cafe near by is the new place! Authentic! I"}
{"text":"It won't surprise you to learn that Rex Marvin is a man of the world. A student of living.  A man who grabs a hold of life like Tiger Woods does a white slutty breast.  I have dry humped this planet and no amount of trying to shake me off has worked yet.  I have survived it all.  Faberge Egg addiction. She-male mother figures. Waking up in the morgue 5 times. Two attempted autopsies. 3 years tied up in Rick James's basement. 4 years tied up in some Austrian guy's basement with his daughter and their 4 kids. Crippling Endust addiction. 4 minutes of a Paulie Shore stand up performance. Driving to Delaware with Artie Lange to score heroin. Tongue kissing Madonna (I was sick for 3 months.)   Where do you go for sanctuary, you ask? How do you escape the fate that has tossed you around like Charlie Sheen does a hooker in a hotel room?  Easy. The kindest, nicest place on earth...no...not Disney World...those midgets will knife you for almost no provocation. One comment about them being cursed by the Devil and an attempted exorcism to help them grow and suddenly they go all Jeffery Dahmer on you. I was lucky to escape.  No. I go to Tripoli, Libya.  I walk around. I listen to the happy sounds...the children playing their favorite \"who looks more like Gaddafi/Kim Kardashian Without Electrolysis and a Fat Butt contest.\" I came in 3rd two years ago. Magical.  If you listen really closely you can hear the sound of the secret police torturing a man for saying that things just aren't all that great. Infidel. The smell of spices and dissention filled the nostrils.  I met Gaddafi once.  Interesting fellow. Spent 11 hours telling me how he should have been casted as Joey on Friends.  He blamed the ghost of Ethel Merman. Kept screaming about how she told him to \"just be himself.\"  At least the food was good.  The lamb kabob's were amazing. I thought about them a lot. For reasons that I can't fully explain...a mix up about what my \"Camel Riding\" business really was forced me to leave. The recent news made me think of all the great times...and the bad...like how no one showed up for my Briss.  It was the worst 37th birthday I ever had. Me and a guy who claimed to be a Moyle holding a machete.  He looked a lot like Tom Arnold with a beard...but I doubt Tom Arnold could book that kind of gig anymore.   Anyway...I thought  about the food.   Well...I can finally have peace...well...let's not get crazy. I still have other issues...but I can get go to a good Kabob stand.  It isn't perfect. It isn't Tripoli in the summertime...the sound of the stadium filled with beheadings and Bee Gee's music...no...not that good.  What about the food. Well, the Gyro is spectacular. It is really the best thing on the menu and it is like 7 bucks with a drink.  The lamb kabob is excellent, but the beef kabob is poorly seasoned and ends up tasting like a well done hamburger.  The chicken kabob is very good but often a little dry.  Stick with the lamb.  The hummus is good, but not spicy enough for Rex.  The tabouli is spot on excellent.  The free chutney is so flavorful it is a perfect complement to the kabobs.  The shish is just like the kabobs...lamb great but the beef is better than the kabobs.  One complaint that I can't forget...the rice goes from bad to awful. It is ALWAYS overdone. ALWAYS!  I can't understand it. It's rice. They flame broil meat like a champ...but damn is the rice bad. I don't get it. Great portion sizes of everything, just the rice is really brutal some days. Crunchy rice is never right. Ever. (Don't say  deep fried rice balls...they are horrible.)  The atmosphere is really good and at night you can see the planes land and the view of the strip is perfect.  There is a car park for the airport and I often \"acquire\" a car and park there and eat my food.    The owners are a little squeamish about self flagellation...but that is how I mark the Day of Ashura and if they don't like it well then they can take it up with the dude we all pray to...Captain Kangaroo. I love you Captain...I will never stop beating myself for my mistakes. No matter what they say. Mr. Green Jeans can go F himself!  LONG LIVE THE CAPTAIN!!"}
{"text":"I should probably dock them half a star but I just can't.  The food is fresh, delicious and overall high quality. The staff are friendly and professional and the atmosphere is fine. The only thing they might need is a business manager because they do tend to run out of things.  The lentil soup has a wonderful cilantro flavor to it and the meat on the platter is as good or better than I've had at any dinner house, but for a very reasonable price. The platter normally includes tzatziki sauce but I prefer their garlic sauce. Oh and they have rose water, which I felt added a nice touch of authenticity. I definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Worst kabob ever! The kabob was spicy and didn't come with a grilled tomato. Persian kabob is not spicy and always is served with grilled tomato. The portion was small and the price was too high for what they serve. They also serve their kabob in a plastic container. This is NOT Persian food."}
{"text":"I stopped in today with my mom for a quick bite to eat, and was actually pleasently surprised.  We both ordered the $9.99 Kubideh special, which offered a choice of two meats (Beef, Chicken, or Lamb) along with a small helping of spinach, greens, and onions as well as a good amount of saffron rice and a large piece of Taftoon bread.   We both chose the combo of Chicken and Lamb, and were surprised at how large the portion was in comparison to the pictures on the menu. My mom and I could have easily split one plate and been perfectly full.  The taste of the food itself was pretty good as well. The Lamb had a nice bold flavor, and the Chicken tasted as though it had some sort of curry powder on it. The Taftoon bread was pretty tasty, though a little dry. I wasn't too crazy on the rice though, which was nice in its texture, but lacked the taste I was hoping for.   I must say, that despite being pretty tasty, most of the meat smelled fairly rank. I'm a big fan of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cusine, but the aroma coming off of this meet smelled of pure flatulence. A small price to pay for tasty food.  One of the highlights of this place though was the wonderful service. The workers were extremely helpful, and even brought us a free order of their Baklava and Zulbia desserts, which were also both pretty tasty.  Overall, this place is definently worth checking out. Just remember when ordering that the $9.99 special is definently food enough for two people, so if you're ordering for one opt for the cheap meals that give you just one Kubideh."}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 kabob (chicken koubideh) and it was alright. The portion was big and the price was decent but I was not all too impressed. The chicken was a bit on the dry side. On the upside, the bread was made fresh (you can see them in the back) and the people working here provide the best customer service. The girl working the front is a damn champ. Running around making sure everyone was taken care of and ringing up customers at the same time.   I'll come by again on another occasion and try other dishes so I can get a baseline."}
{"text":"Wow!  Not your average kabob restaurant!  Amazing service. Excellent food. Was very busy but they took care of everyone with a smile. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Got a to-go order today. I got the #4, Tenderloin Beef Shish Kabob. The kabob was flavorful and really hit the spot. The food was great! The food is also halal (muslim kosher).   Awesome that they have a location on West Side of town now.   The interior is immaculate and the food prep area is set up so that you can watch what is going on.   They are offering a coupon for a free kabob (ground beef only ) with the purchase of any entree. The coupon expires on 4/30/2011 is is for dine in only.   Will definitely be frequenting this place on an on-going basis."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I tried it for the first time and I love it the food is so good!! Will come back soon!! Thank u!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very fresh! The hummus and the baba ganoush were really really tasty! Loved the seasoning on the fries!"}
{"text":"Shawarma! Lamb shish kabob. Tabouli. Hummus. It's all so good. We were gifted a free sample of the Taouli. It was a nice surprise. They treat repeat costumers well for sure. I can't get the delcious flavor of the lamb shish kabob off my mind. I'm afraid I'll get tired of it if I go there too often but it's hard to restrain myself. Everything taste so fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I have driven by Flame Kabob countless times in the course of dropping packages off at USPS, but the timing just hadn't worked out.  Last night, we were heading out to drop off some packages and were looking for somewhere to eat afterwards.   I pulled up Restaurant.com and found a $25 off $35 for Flame Kabob - just what I was looking for! The restaurant is well-lit, stands out on the corner of its building, and is spacious.  The design is...  let's use \"eclectic\".  Assorted granite tabletops and faux rock wall decor lend to a Mediterranean feel, as do the bumpin' beats laid behind sultry \"Arabic\" vocals (I barely speak Spanish) playing overhead (at an interestingly reasonable volume).    On the large Flatscreen TV which manages to not look TOO out of place, CNN aka The Anderson Cooper Network was broadcasting news of the Libyan uprising.  It strangely juxtaposed with the music, making me wish all news were Autotuned for our enjoyment.  The help was... well, helplful if not all that personable.  He seemed a bit irritated with us although we were the only people in the store and still ended up spending $40 for 3 people (after coupon, but also after the 18% grat was added, which wasn't really a grat, but just more income for the restaurant... meh.)  On to the food:  We ordered Hummus ($2.49), Baba Ghanoush ($1.99), Tabouli ($1.99), and uhh... the yogurt and cucmber sauce/dip (Mast-O-Khiar - $2.49) along with some extra bread ($1.99) to start .  Our \"appetizers\" came up within about 8-10 minutes and we were off to the races, stuffing our face with as much deliciousness as we could, and it was all delicious!  The hummus had great flavor, and I actually ate Baba Ghanoush and Tabouli, neither of which I normally ever touch.  Even the bread itself was notably tasty, a rare treat and much appreciated!  The main courses were (we all shared): Ground Beef Kabob plate ($6.99) Ground Chicken Kabob plate ($6.99) Ground Lamb Kabob plate ($7.99) Tenderloin Chicken Kabob plate ($8.99)  ALL came with a giant pita (half of a 12\"), tons of what they underwhelmingly call \"Saffron Rice\" (which is actually some of the most attractive, subtly flavorful, and well-cooked rice I've ever had... there's got to be a name for that!  \"Wicked Awesome Rice\", perhaps?)  Both chicken plates got gobbled up before anyone could discuss  how they'd be divided (Fork Wars!)  On to the beef, which was perfectly seasoned (not OVERseasoned as is alllll too common in Mediterranean places).  Everything was tender, perfectly cooked, and seriously - I can't say enough about their getting the seasoning right.  Finally, a place that doesn't think \"Brian needs another cup of salt in him!\"  It was late in the day, so I'm going light on the lamb... Yes, Lamb is gamey, but done right and perfectly fresh, it's not as gamey as what I ate (I had to eat most of it - I'm our \"garbage disposal\"...   After fulfilling my disposal duties (the lamb wasn't THAT bad... just full of lamb-y flavor!),  on came the dessert - Baklava ($1.99).  How good was it?  We bought phyllo dough, butter, pistachios and honey before we got home after being reminded just how much Baklava can DRIP WITH DELICIOUSNESS!!!  Yes, I licked the honey out of the container - what about it!?  For our $10 tip, we didn't really get any \"service\", but this isn't that type of place... the open kitchen (awesome) was quick to let us know when our food was up (also awesome).  We considered leaving our disposable everything on the table but opted to haul it to the trash ourselved (darned morals - although we did leave a good bit of rice on the table).   On the way out, we walked past a few bags of trash which hadn't made their way to the dumpster just yet... Nothing \"shocking\", it was late, they were nearing closing, but really... you can't just take the extra steps to the dumpster when almost no one's in the restaurant?  Overall, great place, good specials (not available with Restaurant.com coupon), a little in the middle of nowhere but if you're on Sunset by the  airport, there's few places to eat and this is a reaaaally good one.    Their full menu is on their home page (awesome, and a rare treat... I don't care about your atmosphere and blahhhh. I'm hungry!)   For those who read to the bottom, the Peach soda ($1.99 for 12oz) was great - you're welcome!"}
{"text":"I give it 10 out of 5 stars! I am a ver selective eater, who watches what to eat. It better be worth any calories or fat ! This is unbelievably delicious persian food!

Yup and it has a hint of rosewater  Don't second guess this, go now it's great"}
{"text":"First time coming here with my husband for lunch today (Labor Day) and glad we did. We got hungry after early shopping trip.   Food was amazing and service from the Owner, Sam and Chef Melvin was great.   We ordered the Chicken Shesh Kabob and beef kabob both were delicious.  Now we have a new go to place to eat and take family and friends."}
{"text":"By far the worst persian restaurant we have ever been to. My wife and I were visiting Vegas so we thought it was nice to have persian food while there. We ordered couple of major dishes. lamb kabob and the combination kabob. my wife and I could not even eat the lamb and it went straight to the trash. The other dish was dry, tastless and low quality. $15 dish looked like a $5 lunch special dish! but we finished half of it anyways. We suspect they purposely gave us a low quality food becasue of restaurant.com certificate we had. But why would anyone do this? Just horrible quality. My wife was so mad we didn't even complain and left to eat somewhere else. Complete waste of money. Shame on the owner of this business for runing this joke. Gives persians a bad name. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Don't let the rather unassuming exterior fool you when you're walking by, this place is worth checking out!  My husband and I were in the area and saw the kabob sign, so we decided to come in and check it out. We ended up ordering the gyro special instead because it looked so good! I'm sure their kabobs are just as good though! Not to mention, the prices are very reasonable!  It was quite busy and there was a party of 12-15 that the staff was attending to while we were in line waiting to order. It wasn't even that long of a wait, but they apologized profusely and thanked us for our patience, and gave us drinks on the house. That was totally unexpected and I thought it was a nice gesture! The staff was incredibly nice, and service was quick! We received our order in less than 10 minutes.  I will definitely be coming back in the future to try the rest of their menu items."}
{"text":"I've actually been here twice, and the falafel was great. I wanted to particularly give it 5 stars based on my second visit. I go to school across the street and was totally craving one of their falafel sandwiches. When I got there, he said they were out of them (I guess they make them daily). I was bummed because I'm vegetarian and falafel is the best dish at a Mediterranean restaurant. The gentleman at the register was awesome enough to have them prepare a batch fresh for me (so long as I didn't mind waiting a little longer for them to prep it). Great food, great service, and the price is good."}
{"text":"Went here for some quick take out for dinner. I ended up getting the lamb gyro with rice which was pretty tasty and cheap! I think I only paid about $7 for my meal. The gyro could have used a bit more meat in it since it was mainly stuffed with veggies and other fillers. The rice was good, but some portions had no flavor at all. Compared to some other places like Greek Bistro or the Great Greek, I would rank this place behind both in terms of flavor.   All in all, this place is worth checking out if you want some cheap Mediterranean style food. This place is located in the plaza with Denny's and is next door to the Jiu Jitsu place."}
{"text":"The kebabs and salads were awesome! The food is fresh and healthy! The facility was clean! The staff was professional and really helpful when it came to questions about the food and yogurt drinks!   The chef even replaced my ground chicken kebabs because some of the meat fell off. It reminded me being overseas and eating the local food! Excellent"}
{"text":"New to the area ans wanted to try this place it was really good and the gyros were huge and yummy.  We also got the sirloin and chicken kabobs so great.  Ordered though grub hub.   Had a great experince and will deffinately be eating here agin."}
{"text":"I was craving for gyro wrap but unfortunately, The Great Greek was closed.  Why close on Sunday??? So within the same square was Flame Kabob.  We decided to try out this place, especially since I do have a coupon for a free kabob.  -Gyro wrap with fries: Yes, they freshly made the wrap (taftoon bread), but it was kind of dry. -Persian Rose Water Iced Tea:  I like this tea very much.  I am a huge fan of rose water, rose tea, rose icecream. -Persian Saffron and Rose Water Ice Cream:  Perhaps I set super high expectation for this.  There was only a hint of saffron and rose in this very icy icecream.  We haven't been back yet...but I suspect not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is abhorrent in almost every way.  I had previously been twice with friends and I wasn't too impressed with the food and thought the service was a bit slow.  Also the location is a bit skeezy.  Recently I've been twice and now this place is one of few restaurants anywhere that I will never ever go back to.  I bought a couple of Groupons a while back and they were about to expire so I wanted to use them.  I went on Monday in the afternoon and had to wait about 5 minutes for the cashier to get off the phone to take my order.  I presented my Groupon and then he informed me that if I bought certain items while using the Groupon, the price would go up.  For example one of their meals that was $12.99 without the Groupon would be $16.99 with the Groupon.  I guess partnering with Groupon and then overcharging is one way to increase business without losing money in the short term, but you do it at the expense of pissing off new customers.  Anyway I ordered a two kabob plates without salads (just meat, bread, and rice) and some dolmeh to go.  The place was entirely empty when I came in but a couple of others came in after me.  After about 10 minutes the dolmeh was brought out to me on a plate and I had to remind them that it was an order to go, so they took it back.  After over 20 minutes my order was ready to go.  However both plates contained salads so I had to spend another 5 minutes dumping the salad out.  As far as the food goes, the BBQ chicken kabob was repulsive -- the chicken itself was OK but the sauce on it and the rice was disgusting.  The beef kabob was really fatty/gristly and I had to spit half of it out.  My girlfriend, who I gave the dolmeh to, said that there was a weird red sauce in the dolmeh she hadn't seen before and she thought maybe the tomatoes were bad quality and dyed red.  I still had one more Groupon to go, so I went on Wednesday.  This time the cashier from Monday was there, but the main cashier was an older man (the owner perhaps?).  I got my Groupon out and he said that I could not use it for take out, it was dine-in only.  I showed him the details of it and that it was valid for take-out and he said \"OK well then if you use it we have to charge you 15% gratuity.\"  At that point I just left.    So, long story short, the people who are here are trying to drum up business by partnering with Groupon, Yelp, Restaurant.com and then when the customers arrive they are being charged more up front for many menu items, possibly being restricted to dining-in only when that's not stated ahead of time, and then being charged gratuity on top of everything, possibly even for take-out (if they allow it!).    I love middle-eastern food and kabobs but you can do a lot better than this.  Bad food, bad customer service, and screwing customers on prices.  Who would want to take their business to a place like this?"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't tried this place before... This place is good, very good portions and reasonably priced!! We had the 3 tenderloin skewer and it was so good!!! We will come back!!! The lady was so nice and friendly ...You have to try it!!! My brother is picky as hell and he liked it"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and very clean dining room! The chicken Shawarma is so flavorful and the Hummus is to die for! The two gentlemen that helped us were very friendly and informative when explaining the menu. I know where we will be going for lunch every time we are in Vegas! Even took hummus togo and some tabouli salad!"}
{"text":"while siting around searching grub hub I came across Flame Kabob and decided to give them a try. I went with the skewer combo of ground chicken(1) , ground beef(1) and it come with saffron rice and some veggies with some pita. Everything was good, rice was a little bland but no bad.  I went back again a few days later for the same order and tried the steak skewer. I wasn't a fan of the steak, I asked for it medium and it was over cooked and the flavor just wasn't as good as the ground beef. I will be a return customer but I will stick with the ones I like."}
{"text":"It is rare when I take the time to write a review but The Flame Kabob is worth writing about. I stumbled on this little place while in the area: I visit at least twice a month but never noticed it. I was immediately greeted by a very friendly man at the register. I explained I wanted a small dish and he recommended the #1. Chicken Kabob with Safron rice, small salad and pita bread. While I was ordering I was also greeted by a very pretty and friendly female (sorry I didn't get their names). Their hospitality made me feel very very comfortable but I was looking forward to tasting the food. Nothing like a freshly grilled Kabob right?! This place definitely did not disappoint! Delicious! They even offered me a sample of their freshly cooked lentil soup...it was bursting with flavors like cilantro, onion and numerous herbs. Amazing! If you're looking for a fancy setting, go to the strip. If you're looking for real good food go to this place!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and service was superb. The green sauce they have for free is a must try. The only reason why I gave it a four star is because they were doing some kind of renovation to the corner of the restaurant and cushions were everywhere. Sore for the eyes hahaha."}
{"text":"Got sick 3 times. Should have learned the first....maybe the second time but was hoping it was an isolated incident, maybe just me.....as much as I used to love this place Im not risking that again. Dont know what happened and can only speculate...."}
{"text":"This was a great find!!  They offer a great variety of choices at great prices; even for a local place I expected to pay a lot more.  The lamb is delicious and everything was seasoned to perfection but I think my favorite part was their custom made sauces!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great customer service. Beef kabob plate was delicious. I love this little hidden place right across from unlv"}
{"text":"This place has the best food. I love the hummus and the chicken kabob. The salad is good too. Great place to try something new. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Im persian i know what a persian food taste like. What they serve here has nothing to do with persian food. Horrible food, very cheap and low place. Expensive menu for the worst food. We will never ever eat at this place again. If you claim the taste of persia you better be at least close, what you serve here is very very ordinary arabic type kabob. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good food here! The sour cherry tea was amazing, the owner says it is a special recipe so I will have to come back and get it from him.  I had the lamb, I guess it is marinated for 3 days before it is cooked and it was very tender. The hubby had the chicken and it was tender as well. The nan bread and hummus were dish..  Place is pretty big, but it was quiet when we went, looks very clean and the chairs are padded (a nice touch) looks like there is outside dining as well.."}
{"text":"it is ok. nice that they use fresh in house made bread for gyro but if you are going to pick up a quick bite @ lunch it can get pretty busy and they are not the fastest."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special Gyro. It was ok. For the price it was great value and would go again if I am craving a Gyro and am in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Cozy atmosphere. Good customer service. Great for family trip, but I went here with my wife on a date night. Location is good, very close to the freeway. The chicken was absolutely tasty. I wanted to leave a favorable review, they earned it. Full recommendation."}
{"text":"Kabobs are very well. The personnel are very respectful. It is a little expensive but good for its price as an Iranian dish. It is also Halal. It seems that other branches are closed; so don't be misled."}
{"text":"Good kabobs. Lamb, chicken, beef, gyros and hummus. $9 for a plate with one kabob, rice, greens and pita bread. It takes them a little while to prepare the food but the wait is worth it. Try the persian ice tea."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in, the owner welcomed me with a smile and took the time to explain the menu to me. I ordered the chicken shawarma, steak shawarma and the lamb kabob with rice and salad (tomatoe and cucumber salad), Dolma, hummus and of course, baklava. All of these items were amazing. The items were very well priced for the quality that is given. (I know some people complained about the price or portion, but the quality of the food with the exotic spices justifies them)    The owner was talking to me while I was waiting and telling me about his background. So the people factor is there and the friendly & homely environment you would expect from a middle eastern restaurant. This place is a must try! I will definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had the beef kabob plate and pistachio ice cream. Lovely with awesome service. Not sure they know what medium rare means, but the food tasted fantastic regardless."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite while waiting to pick-up a friend at the airport. It was fresh, fast, and not too pricey. Also, I'm not sure what the green sauce is on the counter but I recommend you put it on everything - rice, chicken, salad, etc. It's the perfect blend of herbs and spices!   TIP: Since this location overlooks the LAS runway, I got to watch my friend's plane land. I knew she landed right on time - and headed off to the pick-up spot before she even text from the runway."}
{"text":"If you're not local or you don't drive around Vegas, it would be hard for you to find this place.  It's on the other side of the Airport on Sunset.  I was visiting a client and saw this place on the way there and it seemed busy during lunch time and after the meeting went over the tried it.  The price was great, you can get a mix plate for under $10!!! and they give you enough for a big guy like me!!!  I would recommend the beef kubideh and BBQ chicken shish, mmmmmm craving it just thinking about it.  I would definitely make this my stop every time I visit my client in the area!"}
{"text":"This review is for the name change of Fresh Kabob, but option for this name wasnt available at the time. It's taken me a few weeks to get my thought down since I have been extremely busy, but it was a good meal, so I felt I needed to give the review it deserved. We got felafel( been on a felafel kick lately),a gyro, and the beef tenderloin kabob. Every thing was awesome. Except the tenderloin was a little on the rough side. May have just been a mistake that time, but it still tasted good. Next time, and yes, there will be a next time, I'm sure the tenderloin will make me happy."}
{"text":"I've been looking everywhere for middle eastern food and I'm so glad I found this place.  1. Service is amazing. Everyone is so friendly and it's family owned.  2. The quality of food/meat is really good.  3. I had both their chicken and beef, both were delicious.  4. You must try their pistachio and saffron ice cream. They make it in the store"}
{"text":"Wow. How did I just now find this place? I never go through this area but now I definitely have a reason to. I ordered the gyro with salad and it was supurb! The service was fast and courteous. I will be back and will be recommending this to my friends."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the customer service was great. The owner suggested side hot sauce to try and they were great. Very friendly pleople here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything from service to food. Best mediteranian food spot in town! SERIOUSLY! GIVE IT A GO"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious and made fresh everyday give it a shot the workers are friendly and the owner even friendlier gives genuine service every time I go and they are always fast and consistent"}
{"text":"New to Vegas...Found Flames Kabob because it is close to my school G Skin n Beauty gotta say Awesome food, great service, friendly staff...Def coming back! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the place is pretty big and clean. I went with my family and the staff was nice and knowledgeable but its a little pricey compared to my regular kabob spot."}
{"text":"So glad they had lamb, chicken was not over cooked or under cook. The lime made it something extra Speaical. I was full and will go back for more. The environment was not loud, super clean and friendly workers... The boss had a cute smile ;)"}
{"text":"Deffinetly nothing special.  Ordered one beef and one lamb kabob to go.  They were exactly the same.  Not sure if it was lamb or beef but dry, overcooked and tasteless.  The pita bread was ok.  If only they included something in the bag to put on it.  Since my $20 purchase was sealed in a to go bag, I did not think to ask if I needed any sauce (green stuff on the counter).  Wound up giving the kabob to my dog.  He seemed to love it btw.   Hummus was good."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times. Their gyros arent anything special and im not a huge shawarma fan. My guy says its good tho. So what do i know. However their falafel is in point!! Loved it! Definitely a spot to check out."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (19 of 365).  Yum!  My first time here today and I loved it!    1 star = for their easy to follow menu.  You have options, but easy ones.  Beef, Chicken, Lamb, or Veggie in a Kabob or Kubideh Kabob.    2 stars = the smell.  When you walk into the restaurant, you know your food is going to taste good because the awesome BBQ smell!  3 stars = fresh persian bread.  Yum!  It comes w/ all the entrees and they give you a nice big portion to eat with your food.  I love bread!  4 stars = for the fixings that come w/ your entree; lemon, roasted tomato (great addition to your meat), fresh onion - especially because I love onion, and rice.  Rice could be a little more tastier.    5 stars = for the meat!  As soon as I took a bite, I was in heaven; the meat is so flavorful and so tasteful!  I loved every bite of my Beef Kubideh Kabob.  Such a simple kabob, but tasted to so good!  It was even good with the green salsa they provide.    Their entree portions are perfect!  I was extremely pleased with this place and will definitely be back for lunch soon!  MIght even stop by to pick up some for din din tonight!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and well prepared food.  We used a restaurant.com coupon so it was cheap for us.  I can see how some people would say it is a bit expensive.  The scenery of watching the airport traffic is great!!! The only complaint is that we had to wait 20 minutes for our food at a \"non-waiter\" restaurant."}
{"text":"The service I received was great. I enjoyed my kabobs as they were paired with rice and a dipping sauce. I've eaten here a couple times and I haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and I can honestly say, I'm very impressed! I'm eating one of the best kabobs I've had in Vegas! Their home made rose unsweetened ice tea is s must have! Very friendly staff! I'm definitely coming back ! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Ordered the number 4 - chicken, rice, pita, and cucumber/tomato salad. Would have loved to had more flavoring on the chicken! It was moist and had potential but I found I couldn't eat it by itself - just no flavor! Had to eat it with some rice, or dip it in the sauce. Rice was good. Salad was a little oily for my liking. Hubby's meal looked better and the fries were pretty good. I'm sure other meals have better outcomes!"}
{"text":"This place is great, plain and simple. Let me start with the people working there. Extremely friendly and nice. I am very happy to get greeted by smiles and hellos when I open the door. I slaughter the pronunciation on most of the words and the people behind the counter are very courteous in trying to understand my butchering of the name of the food items ;)  Next up, the food, I have been here 8-9 times in the past few months and I have yet to have a bad dish or experience. Everything here is fresh and made to order. The kabobs are outstanding, great seasoning and amazing taste. The taftoon bread is out of this world. Great crisp on the one side and great chew on the other (much like great wood fire pizza!). I usually always get a side order of mast-o-khiar, it's so good! Think of it as a tzatziki sauce (I prefer mast-o-khiar over tzatziki any day because the consistency of the sauce is much better).  Next up is the service, this place is not a fast food place, they do not have a drive thru or a dollar menu, with that being said, they should catch a break on people complaining about the time waiting for food. I usually call ahead then pick up, but that's just me. My advice is, try this place out if you want quality, legit Persian food. People there work extremely hard and you can clearly see that when you go in there. I'm tired of seeing so much negativity on this website. The people here are extremely hard working, genuine, nice people and to see people chastise them over something so trivial drives me up a wall! Listen to your mother, if you don't have anything nice to say, keep it to yourself."}
{"text":"Should've listened to my gut instincts and not gone in. Took out all the meat in my \"steak\" shawarma. Barely edible tough, and gristlely."}
{"text":"*FIRST NOTE* We had a Groupon for this location. We had $20 to use. The owner told us that to use the Groupon, we had to each buy a drink and pay a 15% gratuity on the bill. The Fine Print on Groupon says nothing about having to buy drinks and adding a 15% gratuity. I know this guy was scamming us, but I paid the difference to just get this over with.  We ordered a beef shish kabob and a beef and lamb shwarma. The food took a little while to come out to us. The food was not bad at all. The beef shish kabob was actually pretty tasty. The shwarma had a bit too much gristle. The saffron rice was okay, nothing to write home about. Pita bread and hummus was good, didn't find it too oily, although I have heard complaints on that. The owner did even come by and give us extra pita bread. He also had us try the green sauce which wasn't too bad, it had a nice spice to it (though I had seen it earlier and commented that it looked old). The owner also mentioned that the beef was imported from some country like Australia and said it had no hormones. That I didn't believe, this coming from the owner who had already scammed us into buying drinks and gratuity.   One good note from the owning scamming us to get drinks was trying the sour cherry iced tea. That was delicious. I'm not normally an iced tea drinker as I prefer more sugary drinks but this was a great blend of flavor and light taste. Definitely the best part of the experience.  Though, the place is only going to get two stars however. The fact that the owner scammed us into spending more money gives insight on how the whole operation is run. It's true, businesses that run Groupons do NOT make money of those. They actually are more likely to lose money in the short term as they are giving away food. The point of this is to increase foot traffic and get people in the door and have a nice experience so they can tell their friends.   What the owner is doing is alienating the people who do use these deals. This may be acceptable in the short term, but in the long term, they will have very little repeat business.  Plus, this location had been on Dirty Dining only a month previously, where he mentioned that some of the meat is pre cooked (so why would he talk about the importation of great beef if it's imported?) and the green sauce in that episode had been out for 11 days. Just seems like the owner trying to talk his way out of things.   I can understand where the owner is coming from. The strip mall where this restaurant is located is a dead zone. Nothing really survives in the space. The atmosphere around the location is abysmal and just down right spooky at time at how quiet it is. The inside of the actual restaurant is also like that, with the lack of patrons and the quietness of the music.   Overall, the food wasn't bad and I would have been up for a return visit, but questionable tactics by ownership has really dampened any chance for that."}
{"text":"Food is great for the price and made fresh, not sure about the meat to me meat fresh is just butchered, I like to get the Lamb. It has a family owned feel to it ( I think it is, not sure)"}
{"text":"Lunch:  Beef & lamb shawarma. Comes with pita, hummus, tzatziki, salad and...onion salad? with lemon wedge.  Meat was a bit on the tough side & heavily seasoned. A bit spicy--guess I'm a wimp today. Needed the tzatziki.  Other than that I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Was having the worst day,  ordered to this location instead of the one near me,  and they were cool enough to send our order to the right location even though it was already done.  Great food too, but it's that kind of customer service that makes me come back again"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. all staff were so friendly and l loved their chicken and beef kabob. The baklava was homemade. the best baklava l have ever eaten in the Us."}
{"text":"Really great tasting Persian food (that we tried due to the lure of free baklavah mentioned on their flyer)! The kubidehs are so tender and flavourful and goes well with either rice or the warm and freshly made bread. The beef and lamb shawarma is tender, with just the right touch of spices and served with hummus, yogurt and veggies -- be forewarned, the serving is HUGE and can satisfy two adults."}
{"text":"Very good gyro and great price! Would have gave 5 stars but sometimes they run out of fresh made pita bread and give you the store bought crap."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, we'll go back in the future I'm sure. We got the falafel wrap, chicken shawarma wrap, and gyro, all of them were tasty and generous portions. Prices on those were very good considering they came with a side of rice, french fries or salad. I'm not sure the menu info is up to date on yelp, I posted a couple pics of their menu so check the photos section for accurate info. Oh I almost forgot, the pistachio saffron ice cream, SOOOOO good! :)"}
{"text":"Tried Flame Kabob today for the first time.  The place was nice and clean, and the staff was friendly and welcoming.  I ordered a side of tabbouleh and the beef/lamb shawarma plate.  Everything tasted pretty good overall.  The tabbouleh had very little parsley in it, though, so that was kind of strange for me.  Also, the shawarama was a little fattier than I'm used to seeing.  Seems like shawarma is usually pretty lean, but this had a lot of noticeable fat.  Portions were decent.  Not sure if I will go back to Flame Kabob, probably not."}
{"text":"Joojeh Kabob!!  Ok so Ive gone to FK before, but this time I was totally saddened by the experience! I went into this place sooo excited, I remember eating it before and it was yummy and sooo savory! This time, NOT THE CASE! I paid 11$ for Joojeh Kabobs meal... imo thats super over-priced! Especially considering the fact I got 1 small pos kabob! It was literally 4 tiny pieces and I was pissed off the entire time I was eating it!  Upon entering FK, totally in a hella sketchy area, you enter a giant place below office buildings. I went to the counter and asked for my beloved chicken breast kabobs. Now last time I had them the meal came with 2... this time it was 1 and the price was 11$!! Normally it was only around 9! I got to work and opened my food box and was like, WTF! The chicken was over cooked and was not seasoned at all! I was soooooo disappointed! The rice also was not great and super plain! The only saving grace was the pita bread!   I was def not impressed : ("}
{"text":"OMg... So we were craving Greek but apparently it was closed on Sun... So I saw a sign for the Flame Kabob & said what the heck I'll try it... soooo Sooo soooo happy we stopped because this place is bomb!! I've never had Persian food which is similar to Greek but w more spices! It was fantabulous! They were super friendly & even gave a side to try other things like the dolmeh which is the stuffed grape leaves.  We had the chicken shawarma wrap w veggies & sides of hummus & dolmeh.. So good!!! I very much recommend this place who is willing to try a little more *spice* The owner is super friendly & definitely backs up what she says.. The wrap is made w Taftoon Bread which is made fresh daily.  Happy eating! I was happy"}
{"text":"After my FIRST visit to Flame Kabob, I wouldn't recommend this place. There MUST be some place in Vegas that serves outstanding Mediterranean food at a good value.  In this case, I searched online again and found out about Flame Kabob from Restaurant.com.  I subscribe to their service and wanted to use a $10 coupon.  The plan was to spend the required $15 to use the coupon, which should have covered the check.    When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the POSTED prices varied from the ACTUAL prices.  The manager defiantly told me he had the right to change his prices anytime he chose.  While I agreed, I submitted he should probably update his menus.  Next, when I placed my order, the manager argued with me when I asked for a combo with NO fries or rice.  I just didn't want the carbs, and I didn't ask for anything ADDITIONAL.  This simple request seemed to be much-too-much, however; it didn't need to turn into a debate.  Afterwards, when I attempted to use my $10 discount certificate, the store manager scoffed at me, complaining how too many people want to use coupons...uh, then WHY do you use them as a marketing tool?!?!?!  Finally, while the food was tasty, the portions were a bit stingy, and I was soured by the whole encounter with the manager."}
{"text":"I have to say that the Falafel wrap is amazing!  The seasoned fries were crispy and delicious. They have recently revamped the dining area and the decor is laid back and comfortable for a leisurely lunch.  They have several lunch specials which provide plenty of bang for your buck. I highly recommend giving them a try for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was greeted and welcomed in. The guy that helped me was very friendly and obviously takes great pride in their food. He offered a brief overview of the menu. He made some suggestions, but in a way that wasn't pushy at all.   I chose the Beef Tenderloin Shish Kabob plate. The steak was tender, juicy, and full of flavor. It had a flavor that was unique to other steak tenderloins I've had that must be a spice blend they use in the preparation. The small green salad had a very tasty dressing on it that had a slight hint of mint that I enjoyed. The rice was prepared well and very good. I also enjoyed the mix of onions and parsley that I was able to mix with the meat and rice for more flavor. The cucumber sauce on the side was really good and like the salad dressing tasted like it had a hint of mint. I was also given a sample of hummus to try out. Unfortunately, this wasn't my favorite, but it was a personal preference. The flavor seemed a bit strong, but I'm sure would appeal to other people for that reason. The bread was tasty.   The highlight was the ice cream I had for dessert. It was saffron, pistachio, and rose water. The combination of flavors really intrigued me and the guy that helped me promised that it was really good. He was right! Wow. This was a surprisingly tasty combination. I kept thinking that the person that came up with this is a genius.   Tasty food and great service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for a falafel, I haven't had one since my friend made one for me in 2007. I was not disappointed! Order was made fresh, and at the time of order. I enjoyed the salad and baclava, delicious!  I will definitely come back when in the area.  *The only question I have, is what is in the shakers on the table? It was good and I want to know where I can get some for home."}
{"text":"I am not sure why it is a one dollar sign establishment. For a family of 5 with 3 being under six years old we spent over $55. This was without drinks.   The service was mediocre at best. The chicken kabob did have good flavor and the humus wasn't too bad. However we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Went in today to order gyro.  Me: can i get gyro with fries Cashier: yes thats the #13  Me: ok no tomato no rice but with fries After waiting 15 minutes for my food to cook and him trying to figure out my restaurant.com certificate i asked him if the gyro had fries.  Cashier: you dont have gyro you ordered shawrma.  Me: no i didnt i ordered gyro you told me it was the #13.  Cashier: this is better.   Ummmm ok. I take it home my husband hated it.  I travel the 15 minutes again to return it and when i get there im told that i owe them a dollar and got a lesson on how to order, that i can only order 1-14 with my restaurant.com gift certificate. That if i order for someone else i should make sure what they want. Seeing as i said gyro 5 times i can totally see how that was mixed up.  To the owner: f--k you and your crap restaurant. Who the hell are you to tell me how to order? Maybe you should train your staff for the next two weeks that you will be open. If you made any kind of money you wouldnt be asking me for a $1.00. If i want greek food ill go to the GREAT GREEK which is right near jasons deli in your parking lot. Thanks for wasting my time with your BS food. P.s its gross."}
{"text":"Over priced for the extremely small portions, they have foam compartment plates that they put ONIONS to fill 1 section so they don't have to give more food!(onions are cheaper) The salad amount on these plates was seriously 1 forkful (what a joke) I actually liked the salad-too bad I only got 1 forkful of it. The hummus was just enough to SMEAR across the bottom of the compartment, if you scrape it out you might get 3-4 spoons of it. The sandwich with about 5 little chunks of WAY OVER SEASONED meat was all lettuce (more like a 1/2 sandwich size) There were 2 workers & 4 customers, it took 25 minutes for our sandwiches to be cooked=you can NOT make this a quick lunch place! The tabouli ... I paid $2.99 received a 1/2 full/empty container & I had to bring it home to make it taste right = very bland & watery. My father in law is a vegetarian & since this is close to our house we thought \"maybe we'll take him here for when he visits\" NO WAY!!! This cost over $25 for 2 waters, 2 very slight lunches & one 1/2 full tabouli...what a rip off! We'll be taking him to Yalla's, not as close but huge portions, better food & it doesn't take 25mins to get your food on Styrofoam compartment plates....we actually get REAL plates at Yalla's & nice portions. NEVER AGAIN will we go to Flame Kabob... I should have known when it was so empty inside the restaurant even though it was lunch time."}
{"text":"On vacation. Dropped in. Ordered the falafel sandwich. Waited forever even though there were no other customers at the counter or seated. Then I noticed the guy had no gloves on and constantly running his fingers through his hair. Falafel arrived burnt and tasteless and he would not offer a refund. The place smelled had a B rating too. Stay away. Go directly across the street wonderful Greek restaurant there. STAY AWAY! Honestly, if I could give a minus five stars I would."}
{"text":"The food was at its right temperature, well proportioned, and was of average wait for the food to be prepared. I enjoyed it and will be back again. This place is a lil different but it's still good."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, hummus and bread side is delicious and the food is wonderful.  I don't live anywhere near this place or this side of town BUT I would come over here for this food.  Will definitely make it a stopping point when I'm in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"All I can say is OMG! Im like a fat kid eating cake! This place has the most delicious, flavorful Mediterranean food I have ever eaten. Lots of hospitality, thank you flame kabob for the wonderful food."}
{"text":"Just saw this place the other day driving past CSN. I wanted to try this place because I was craving kabobs. Prices seem reasonable for most items. I had the lamb kabob and koobideh for $16.99 and a drink, so a twenty dollar lunch (A little more than I would have liked). Service was a little slow but everything is made to order including the bread. When my food arrived everything was good and cooked to the right temperature (not well done) but could use a little more seasoning for my tastes. I would come back if I ever get the craving for kabobs again and its not too far away."}
{"text":"The lady at the cashier was very helpful and explained the whole menu to us being it was our first time there. We decided to get #14 Chicken Gyro Wrap. It came with salad, hummus, taftoon bread, tzatziki and dolmeh.  It was absolutely delicious! Good lunch portion. We also ordered a side of fries- YUM! They also threw in an extra portion of warm dolmeh and hummus on the side as an appetizer while we waited for our food. Great service and food! I'll definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick somewhat healthy place for dinner before getting to the airport..  this was the perfect stop!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place even though my sister has been a few times before me.  It was pretty good, seems like everything is made fresh to order.  They have a good variety of foods to choose from and offer some lunch specials which do not seem to be too bad on price.  This is a place which if you like a taste of Persia or the middle east, you should definately give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love it) everything is fresh and halal, which was very important for us muslims... I had veggie kabob, it was delicious and not expensive , thank u"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My friends and I have to stop by at least once a week to get our fix. The koobideh chicken and lamb are so delicious and they pair so well with the sauce! I love the staff, always accommodating and love how they always remember us. One of my favorite places in town!!"}
{"text":"This review is only about the service haven't even eaten the food. We bought a groupon to try this deal and upon saying that the man working said we couldn't get any of the 5 specials listed it all had to be full priced items. So we relooked at what we wanted and started asking more questions, every sauce every extra thing was more money..this place does a horrible job at serving the customer. They don't even have water cups. The man was so unhelpful and had no concern in helping us enjoy our first time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Called in for take out because I am on break from work... got there not ready at the time they said it would be. They were neither sorry nor pleasant.  Got my food, back to work ..I noticed they forgot tzaziki sauce on my falafel. .. I called,  again, neither sorry nor pleasant.  Bad service period!    Food was not the worse. Definitely not good either. Falafel was dry and lacked texture  The pita they boast about is just ok  Also had a gyro salad, lettuce quality was not good. Gyro itself was kinda good. Overall ok dish. Not worth the $13 though.  I dont like this place or management.  I knew this the moment I walked in."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few months ago but forgot to Yelp it for some reason. I had high hopes. It's close to my work and could have been a regular lunch destination. Unfortunately, I have not returned and don't plan to any time soon.  I believe I ordered the Beef and Lamb Mixed Platter. I can't put my finger on it, but it just wasn't satisfying. Perhaps it was a little too dry for me. It wasn't terrible by any stretch, but just as my star rating says, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"The food is healthy and tasty, spice and flavor.  I love this place and eat there a lot.  Nice people too. Love it   Price is right"}
{"text":"I came here with my family just a few hours ago. Even though we only eat halal, I expected a lot more out of this place. My mom had a voucher from restaurant.com for 25$ and we had to buy a minimum of 37.5$ to use it which was no big deal for the 4 of us. But when we went to go order our food, the owner told my mom and I that in order for us to use the voucher, we had to each buy our own drink or water ($8.00 total) and then added another 15% gratuity tax. I looked at the receipt after I read some other post just a few moments ago, and the cashier did charge us 8.99$ for a gyro that is listed as 5.99$ on the menu. Even after eliminating the voucher, we handed another 36$.  As for the food, it was okay. Nothing spectacular to make me go running back in there again...ever. If you are looking for better priced and AMAZING food, I highly recommend Kabob Express (Eastern & Tropicana) and Kabob Korner (downtown LV). The service is amazing, the food is even better and it's all worth it for the price!    No offense to the owner, but you are running a BUSINESS. Do not tell me that you opened up your restaurant in front of the university so that students such as myself who are looking for halal food will have a place to eat. If you aren't willing to work at keeping your customers happy, we will find another place to eat."}
{"text":"The best kabob place around! Sad the eastern location closed, so I go to the one by UNLV now. I like that they have a great selection of vegetarian dishes!  Food is so good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located directly across from a McCarran Airport runway. As we entered the restaurant an airplane landed and it felt as if the restaurant was situated in the middle of the airport.  We each ordered the lamb kabob which came with a colorful rice mixture, baby lettuce leaves and taftoon.  The lamb was gamey and way overdone, the rice was bland, the baby lettuce leaves were undressed and the taftoon came right out of a bag.  The final insult was when a gratuity of 20% was added to our bill though we ordered and picked up our meals at the counter."}
{"text":"Okay, so let's set the scene: Hubs and I spent two days in the glitz and glamor of the strip, then three days looking at a big hole in the ground (the Grand Canyon), then drove back to Vegas for one more night before getting back to the comforts of home.  However, we were pretty burnt out by that point on the whole strip experience, and walked from our hotel to what we hoped would be the type of Vegas experience that the locals have.  Hello, Flame Kabob.  Clean, friendly, and homey, with a local Iranian family visiting with the servers and owners for an early meal.  We ordered our meals (a kubideh for me and a chicken kebab for Hubs) and brought ice cream back to our hotel room for later.  This place offered excellent food for cheap, and while it wasn't gourmet food, it was fast, tasty, and filling.  My lamb kubideh was delicious, flavored with full coriander seeds (the other reviewer that suggested the sauce was right on the money - it has a little kick to it but also has a little mint in it), and my husband's chicken kebab turned out moist and perfectly cooked.  The meal did seem a little carb heavy, but the flatbread was quite nice.  All of the entrees come with saffron rice, onion, a small mixed salad, and a grilled tomato.  The only downside was that the rice was a little unevenly cooked.  Finally, we took home a bucket of the Persian ice cream, which was pistachio and saffron.  Definitely a unique flavor, and while it wasn't quite to our liking, it was a window into another culture.  Four stars for the excellent value for the money, the clean, cafe-like atmosphere, and the tastiness of the food."}
{"text":"My lady and I visited this restaurant to grab a gyro on my way to work. She went to the restroom and saw a huge cockroach twitching around on the floor.   Once she returned to the table the food arrived and we took it back to the counter untouched to get a refund. The man at the counter \"Das\" refused to give us a refund. According to him having ROACHES in your building doesnt affect the food in the kitchen.   Don't eat Gyros with ROACH meat."}
{"text":"Just REALLY good food. We had the lamb kabob and pomegranate chicken. Absolutely delicious! Only complaint was the amount of pomegranate sauce that soaked into the rice, making it a little overwhelming. Bread and hummus was great, as was the rose iced tea. Great value with a coupon! Just wish I had more food. :) shady area and storefront but great hidden gem."}
{"text":"Oh my god !!! I am in love with this place , they have the best food i ever had in my entire life , literally i go there twice a week with my family, we have lunch there 2 times a week and everytime the food taste better and better , the staff are nicer . I really love this place its like a heaven to be honest , super nice staff , super super delicious food and they have a lot of different choices . The owners are so nice , whenever i come here i feel that im home"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing and the service is even better.   I've tried many different things on the menu but I usually order and highly recommend the Chicken Kubideh Kabob plate for $6.99. It comes with one decently proportioned Chicken Kubideh, Basmati Rice, Pita and a Side Salad. The food is made with great quality. The Taziki sauce is also very good here and they have complimentary Jalapeños and Green Spicy Sauce.   I've never had a bad experience here, all the workers are extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef tenderloin shish kabob. The beef was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare and was seasoned beautifully, 5 stars. The rice was buttery with good flavor, 4.5 stars. The authentic flat bread made on site is amazing 5 stars. The dressing on the salad was too strong for my taste, 2 stars, but my wife liked it. This beef kabob is the best I have ever eaten at any Middle Eastern/Greek place. The decor is typical mom and pop strip mall."}
{"text":"The food is so good. Fresh, wide variety, & the baklava is homemade by the owners mom! Yep you read that right, there is a nice little lady putting her love into food that you can take home & enjoy. Go get yourself some! The lentil soup is like nothing I've ever had, it isn't mushy & the spice combo is on point. Don't forget to try the green like salsa on the condiments bar inside. It is spicy but a true delight."}
{"text":"It's hot inside. Slightly cooler than the 105 outside, but hot enough to make me miss my car.  They haven't bothered to update their signs, so my soup and salad ended up costing me an unexpected $20. Yikes!   Being across from the college, you'd think this place would be packed. The food is actually quite good, just very expensive."}
{"text":"New favorite place! The food is so good I could have hurt myself eating it, gorging until my stomach exploded or I suffered multiple foodgasms, whichever came first.   The man behind the counter was super sweet, patiently explaining everything to us newbies (I didn't have the heart to explain that I have had Persian before. My husband was really into it so I just let them chat.) Prices are on par, portions generous. I watched them prepare it. All is clean and above board. Fresh, on-the-spot. Did not see any of the issues that the other yelpers, who I am assuming are rival restaurateurs, saw.  It is very very flavorful with lots of sauces and anything extra that you could ask for, including an amazing green sauce that I could drink. So, Mr. Thought-it-was-too-bland needs to quit smoking.  As for the people who are incapable of reading the menu or their Groupon conditions (and every Groupon has insane conditions, they must, Groupon goes out of their way to screw the small business owner and while Groupon rakes in the dough, these struggling businesses actually lose money on people like you), I don't think the restaurant should have to suffer for your illiteracy. Go back to school, learn how to spell words like \"its\", then use your new skills to read the small print, then and only then write Yelp reviews.  Ok, back to the food: Can't wait to try everything on the menu. Organic, healthy, tasty, yum."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to try this place out after seeing it every time we come on this side of town to come by my aunts nail salon to bring my grandma to get her mani/pedi. And I was not disappointed at all. We shared the gyros, hummus, dolmeh, and shirazi salad. Every thing had great flavor. The beef gryo was delicious and so was the turkey. Only downfall was the bread was falling apart as you ate it. Other than that the flavor was amazing.  I love hummus and always order it when ever I see it on the menu. The hummus here was not gritty and had good flavor. The bread they served with it was good although some pieces were a little over cooked. The dolmeh was delicious! My first time trying it and I feel in love. The shirazi salad was so refreshing and light. Something I would love to make at home and have as a snack when at work. Especially now that I am pregnant. :) Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Talk about friendly customer service! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted nicely and immediately felt welcome. I came here with my baby girl and boyfriend. We tried the beef, chicken and lamb kabobs. All were great but my favorite by far was the ground beef. It was so tender, flavorful and delicious! The freshly made bread and hummus was great too. Even my baby girl loved it. We will definitely be back again for more!"}
{"text":"Best kabob place in the area! I have been here many times; finally getting around to posting a review. Have had all the different tenderloin kabobs, the chicken sandwich and the gyro--all delicious. The people are always so friendly and nice here--makes it so pleasant to visit! They used to include a grilled tomato with the kabob plates and they haven't recently; too bad I really liked the addition of it!"}
{"text":"Food was not good, price extremely high, insult to the injury there was mandatory 15 percent gratitude for no service. Had to order at the counter from menu on the wall, the food was delivered to our table on paper plates and plastic utensil, a food court type of service. Buyers be aware, ask for itemize bill before you pay."}
{"text":"Well first off, it was hard to find the restaurant because you have take downward steps to get to it. It is completely Persian themed and so I had big expectations. The place was clean and big. It has Arabian music playing in the background and a Persian underground theme. The staff were very friendly and informative. The wait time was alright. Not to late. The food was not warm though. Some plates were really hot, some were really cold. It lacked consistency. Some plates were filled with rice, but some had very little in them. Do not drink the glass soda, it tastes off and they will not exchange it. The meat is very flavorful while the rice lacked flavor. Three stars in total.   PROS: -good meat -good service -wait time was reasonable.   CONS- -Weird soda -inconsistency -lack of flavor in certain areas."}
{"text":"Just happen to be driving by Flame Kebob when my pregnancy hunger kicked in full force. My husband and and I decided to take a chance and boy are we grateful we did! My husband ordered the chicken kebob plate with french fries and I ordered the steak shawarma plate with rice. All I have to say is mind blown! Every last item on our plates was perfectly seasoned, very fresh and tasted delicious. I'm normally a very picky eater, never do I not make adjustments but again that pregnancy starvation was in full effect so I ordered the shawarma exactly the way it is supposed to be eaten. Best decision I've made all week. All of the flavors came together wonderfully. For an added bonus they have excellent customer service and a surprisingly spicy delicious picked onion with roasted jalapeño side for you to enjoy. Hands down I am a fan and will be back possibly as early as tomorrow. THIS IS A MUST TRY. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a joke..... After purchasing 65$ worth of food for my family it was a freaking joke.....so the young guy forgot to mention that there is no rice available at the moment and it was disgusting.....you get 6 tiny pieces.....coming from Afghanistan this is completely a joke.....the chicken breast are suppose to big and thick slices and no ends to the breast.....but we got cartilage and tiny burnt ends.....I will never come here again and none the less you would think you would compensate for not having rice....but the guy gave us a few more pieces of chicken breast and said there was nothing else....and the refund would take 5 business days instead of just giving us a cash refund. ugh I'm done never again"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot! Sam is as friendly and helpful as a person can be. Anything you try is going to be good. I'm addicted to their gyro. Addicted. The food is made fresh to order with Persian ice cream and rose water and even taftoon bread as sides. Great for a good quick meal or a sit down with the family!"}
{"text":"I had the Lamb Kubideh Kabob. It was flavorful and came with rice, salad, tziki, and an onion condiment. It takes a few minutes and it is more than worth the wait when items are freshly prepared! The rose ice tea was wonderful. I will be returning to try the chicken pomegranite stew next time, and of course I will be back for another kabob as well!   The decor s nice with the red walls and the prints, so ambiance is nice. It is self service for the drinks and utensils and the price reflects this, I am a fan!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome here. We got a variety of things, each one was delicious. The bread is freshly made. Try  this place out, you will not regret it!! :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The food taste like it cost more than it does. The guys that run it are super cool and to go orders are prepared quickly."}
{"text":"I like this place. The ground chicken kabob is very good though it could be a spicier.  Everything is super fresh and made to order, which can lead to long wait times but it's worth it.  Good prices and good food. Yes, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Omg!! Came here on a whim and was blown away by the food and the service. Everything we ordered was amazing--gyro and kabobs. The bread is fresh made and is so soft if melts in your mouth. The rice has such a good flavor it pairs well with everything. The owner was so friendly and when he found out it was our first time he let us sample various things. Overall a fantastic experience and we will be returning."}
{"text":"The quality of foods was awful, The shish kebab was tough and salty ! They use low quality plastic fork, spoon and small plates! Do not waste your money by choosing this restaurant. The prices are not logical at all!"}
{"text":"This place is NOT where you want to eat!!   1. Service is horrible!! Be Aware of Scams!! Please be aware to ALWAYS look at your receipt, the owner has been known to secretly add extra hidden charges, without your knowledge!! I.e. There was a Groupon deal for this location, so we purchased the $40 worth of food voucher, (note that Im an avid Groupon user, so I am fully aware of the rules/ regulations), we placed our order for $47 worth of food ($52 after taxes) and the owner was going place an additional 15% gratuity on top of our bill, just because he wanted to! NO WHERE on the Groupon deal does it state 15% gratuity would be added!! We asked WHY he was charging us extra and he stated \"because you use Groupon, and I no make money!! So I HAVE TO CHARGE EXTRA 15%\". That's a bunch of BS!!  Needless to say, we argued and walked out not buying a thing, because we were being scammed! As we were gathering our stuff to leave, another couple told us they were equally scammed by being charged extra because they used a Restaurant.com voucher! They too we're going to file a complaint. Here's the deal, If the owner wants to promote his business using Groupon, that is his prerogative, but he needs to respect and honor the rules and regulations!! He cannot create his own price adjustments after customers purchase the vouchers!! Hence, we walked out because we do not trust his business, and we didn't want to be taken advantage of!!   2. The Food is NOT Fresh!! Eat at your own risk...afterall it's not cheap anyway! We are locals and locals discuss business all the time!! Apparently this place had to shut down by the Food Department bc of it's LOW GRADE due to unsanitary conditions. It then reopened after Inspection Approval...I found this out after my incident described above...Not being able to eat here was a blessing in disguise, perhaps!  Here's the Interview from KTNV NEWS \"Dirty Dining\" and their Demerits!!!  http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Flame-Kabob-236810281.html   3. The place is filthy and unsanitary!! Again, Eat at your own risk!!   ****It's Unfortunate that this Business has Potential, BUT is not putting it to use!! The Owner needs to learn how to treat Customers respectfully and serve Fresh Food in a clean kitchen...bottom line!!   AGAIN...BEWARE...EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! =("}
{"text":"This spot is amazing i dont understand negative reviews such a great spot with authentic food loved it."}
{"text":"I drive by this joint on my way to the office every morning and thought hmmmm this might be good.... I read the reviews by fellow yelpers, so i decided to try it for lunch...  I ordered the GYRO,  it came with a handful of fries...  It didnt present very well,  it kinda looked like it was cut in half... It threw me off a little... The gyro was loaded with a good portion of meat, the usual toppings, the tziki sauce was not very good, kinda runny and there wasnt too much of it.  The price was 5.99, i guess this was a fair price for what i ordered...  My overall impression was, this was OK,, i have had better in the valley, but i have had worse..  I will try the other selections on their menu since it is very close to my office but will not get they gyro again... This rating is based on the GYRO, cause i definitely had better...  Give this place a try but dont get the gyro,,, I dont think its what they are good at... Hope this YELPS"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and found the staff very welcoming, the restaurant very clean, decor beautiful with granite table tops and beautiful tile - quite refreshing. Four of us dined and everything including the Shawarma Platter, Lamb Shish Kabob, Beef Shish Kabob, and the Veggie Kabob were mouthwatering, my personal favorite was the Shawarma and grilled tomatoes. Did I mention we shared a piece of Baklava that melted in our mouth? Might have been the best Baklava I've had.   Everything is always fresh, no microwaves and no freezers - what a great new place - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am amazed at the reviews for this place. I mean, are there shills just posting reviews? Are they giving out free food in exchange for a positive rating? Even if that were the case...I'd pass.  Several people in the office were chastising me for never choosing a location for lunch. Rather than simply accepting the abuse whilst producing, what may be, the most complicated spreadsheet in the history of spreadsheets, I relented and looked for a good place for a Gyro. Yelp, you rarely lead me astray...I searched for a nearby restaurant and Flame Kabob was our elected establishment to try.  My co-workers ordered the beef/lamb wrap and I got a Veggie Kabob cause I'm healthy like that. Holy Torched Onion On A Stick!! A few pepper slices, 2, yes, only 2 zucchini slices, and the rest was all over-seasoned onion. Pita, nasty sauce, and tri colored long grain rice.  For like $9? Are you kidding me?  Having been jilted from my noon time hunger, I gently peeked around the corner at my co-workers who instantly shot me glares that would make the paper shredder unnecessary. I then got a review that consisted of \"Yucky\" \"over-seasoned\" \"salty\" and \"gross. That is with the expletives omitted in case children are reading this.  On the bright side, I'm not going to be asked for suggestions anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer services. Like they said, if it looks good, it probably is. Hummus with olive oil is the best.  Very generous on the food portion and cheaper than any other falafel/Kabob place I go to.  Flame kabob in Henderson is the best."}
{"text":"This restaurant is set up fast food style with paper plates and plastic cups. Had we known this, we would have visited for lunch instead of date night. The food is pretty good, so we'll start with 4 stars, but we were shocked at how differently we were treated for using a restuarant.com certificate. The food was expensive, and they wouldn't let us order the advertised special because we were using the gift certificate. So in order to get the same type of thing we spent $15 per plate of Mediterranean meat and rice. Then the guy at the register (seemed like the owner) proudly announced that he was charging us 18% gratuity...REALLY...over $5 for a server we would never meet?  Instead we were handed 2 plastic cups and were expected to get our own water from the fountain and clear our paper plates from the table. Clearly they wouldn't expect a tip from other customers, but due to a clause in the certificate designed to help people, this owner saw an opportunity to make some extra cash. Even the sauce had a sign that said only one cup allowed per order. (The cups didn't hold more than a tablespoon.) The whole thing just gave us a creepy feeling. We wouldn't pay 18% gratuity to eat at a burger joint just because we had a coupon, but we could have spent $5 extra per person and gotten a rack of ribs and a sit down dining experience."}
{"text":"I just ate here with my parents while driving trough Las Vegas.  Being Persian ourselves, we were hoping for some Persian fare, and this didn't quite meet our expectations.  We ordered the number 10 beef combo (one skewer kubideh and one tenderloin) and weren't impressed with the taste, especially considering the price point. ($15!!)  My parents' first reaction was that this place isn't Persian but rather Arab, referring to the combination of spices they use.  Arab recipes tend to use spices like cumin while Persian recipes lean heavily on onion.  We did really like the fresh baked bread and the two yogurts -- maast-o-khiar and maast-o-moosir -- the yogurt was creamy and flavorful.  Service was good.  We got our food fairly quickly, and the staff was helpful and kind.  Overall, I give it 3-stars.  Decent food, not superb.  If you're Persian and are looking for Persian food, this probably won't satiate you.  But if you're looking for just a decent meal, then you'll do ok."}
{"text":"What's not to like when you mix flames with kababs? I have dined here twice. The first time demanded a second visit, but the second visit left us a little saddened and reminiscing about our first glorious visit. Dreaded inconsistency!  When the Flame is on, you can look forward to fresh, tender meats on sticks, piping hot fresh taftoon made in a special oven, and what I assume to be a tomatillo chutney that seriously kicks the butt of most tomatillo salsas I have experienced. Oh, and the Persian iced tea! The hummus is thick and tasty. The tabbouleh is nice. For me, the baba ghanoush is a little too smoky and tad oily.   When the Flame is off, the bread loses it magic. It is served not piping hot and under a salad which makes it soggy. Definitely request the bread on the side. On our second visit, the lamb lost its tenderness. I had the BBQ chicken, and it was good, but the rice was a little bland. Plus, the Persian iced tea had been replaced with Gold Peak! NOOOOOOOOO! Okay, maybe the Persian tea is there somewhere, but I did not see it.   The workers are gracious and definitely concerned with your culinary happiness. The space is not fancy, but it is clean and bright.  Conclusion: We probably won't trek back to this location, but the experience has been tasty enough to warrant a visit to the new one right down the street!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad. I got the lamb and beef mix and match special. Rice was bland.   He beef kabob tastes like canned beef you get in chef boyardee. Lamb was ok but missing flavor. The bread tastes like the ready to make pizza crusts to buy at walmart. Willing to try again and hopefully the food will be exactly or better than the one by the airport or unlv. Otherwise never going back"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.   Perfect kabobs.  Melt in your mouth. Perfectly seasoned rice.   I will definitely  visit on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I initially chose this place to eat randomly out of curiosity for me and my family so I ordered online for pickup. The wait time was 10-35 minutes. When I arrived the food was cold after only  20 minutes after ordering, portion for the price was ridiculous for 40$ dollars I could've really spent that somewhere else more wisely and gotten my \"Bang for my buck\" in the process."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times in one week so that should tell you something. The beef kabob was the most tender i have ever had in my life, it melts in your mouth. The staff are very friendly and the plave is very clean."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant just once... the quality of the food is not well enough for the price, actually it sucks... you will serve the food in plastic dishes and utensils, with a little bit of rice, yogurt and salad.  ( I emphasize that food comes with \"little bit\" of these sides ) The decoration of this damn place doesn't look like a high ranking restaurant... subway or chipotle decorations are much more better ... I don't recommend it at all.  compared to the other Persian restaurant which I've tried before, Flame Kabob in Las Vegas cause a very bad memory of Persian restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Had the 3 tenderloin kabob(beef,lamb,chicken) all were juicy and flavorful.. The manager brought me sample of hummus and 1 falafel to try.. Best falafel I've ever had in a while..Excellent wait time and great service.. Definitely will be back to try the shawerma wrap"}
{"text":"The chicken has great  spicy flavor.  Cheap specials.  Big servings.  Fresh pita and hummus."}
{"text":"Sam was super helpful and cool! The food... my god... I'm glad I went here instead of the other place I go to around school. Flavor is a bit different than I'm used to with Mediterranean food but IN A GOOD WAY! Definitely coming back for more kubideh :)"}
{"text":"This place is great!!  We been there a few times and we love it!! The falafel wrap is great and for us as Vegan a great option!!  The food is fresh and teasty.  So will continue going to this place."}
{"text":"Great service. The staff was very friendly the food was fast and incredible. Been looking for a place with good bread and hummus for a while and they had it. Also had all three kebabs (Lamb, chicken, and beef) and they were the best I've had in a long time. Go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We were warmly welcomed when we walked in. Israel andwered our questions about the menue as it was our 1st time visiting. He gave me a small cup so that I could sample the 2 versions of iced tea before ordering it. The food came quickly and was hot and delicious.  We will definately be returning soon."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I both have loved everything we've tried so far. Friendly staff. Makes me hungry thinking about it."}
{"text":"This place is running by new owner the menu changes slightly. I ordered beef kabab. It's served with bread slides, salad and rice. It really looked delicious. It was not Persian flavor it tasted more like Arab's or Turkish kabab. But it was so tender. Moreover, it's only Mediterranean restaurant  in walking distance of UNLV and offer student discount just show your rebel card!!!"}
{"text":"I loveeeee this place. I eat there at least twice a week & I'm still not tired of it & don't think I'll ever be! I'm a regular now, that every time I call to place my order they already know what I want & get it ready for me! I recommend Flame Kabob to everyone! I'm vegan so they cater to us!   *** I had to come back to update my review because their baklava is AMAZING!! I tried it for the first time yesterday it was soooo delicious & its vegan! So if you come here you deff have to try it, it's a must! Vegan falafel is still delicious as ever. As well as the veggie Kabob plate!****"}
{"text":"This is a chain right? So why does each place have a different special. I have read some of the good reviews about the one on Eastern and decided to try this location. Unlike the former, the latter does not do the $3.99 lunch special. That is ok, because their $5.99 gyro was still a good deal.  While I was ordering, it felt like the cashier was trying to pressure me into ordering more food than I needed. I might everything and often, but I know that a gyro is more than enough. Luckily I stuck to that mindset because the gyro was gigantic. The gentleman working the grill was generous with the amount of meat he shaved off. The sliced meat is then thrown into a frying pan. I was unable to identify if it was oil or a broth to finish the cooking process. I have a feeling that it was the first because the meat came out darker and a bit crisp. After it was finished it was thrown on top a pita with a liberal amount of tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of onions. The meat was salty, but the yogurt sauce, lemon, and their green sauce helped even out the flavors. Go to the other location if you are looking for variety in lunch specials."}
{"text":"Knowing that one of my friends has a common food allergy has not put a damper on our Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food affair. In fact, it  has only intensified our want to find all the good ones in town. This Flame Kabob has the lunch special between 11-3. There is a choice between the chicken or beef kubideh, felafel or gyro sandwich. I had tried the fourth option. This would be the second day in a row that I ordered the gyro and it was less salty or maybe they just gave me more tzatziki sauce. The bread is fresh and amazing. I got to see the guy make it to order.   The guy at the register was not pushy and let me order what I wished without up selling me to death. It is listed as a limited time deal, so give it a try."}
{"text":"I've recently began working in the area and came across this place by accident. Since I had a craving for a chicken skewer, I decided to stop. It is a comfortable place, clean and fairly unassuming. The service was fantastic and the guy behind the counter apologized for the wait (not long at all ) and even called me by name when I departed. All wonderful things... I got the chicken skewer and he added some veggies to it for me. The food was really good. The chicken was flavorful maybe a little bit dry but it didn't diminish it for me. I also got the appetizer plate. The falafel and hummus were yummy! Not a big babaghanoush fan so I wasn't so much into that but its more my palette not the flavor of the dish. Returned to work very satisfied.  All and all, a wonderful experience and I'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"today it was my first time in this restaurant , first I was welcome with a smile.then the cashier recommended me the number 5 Chicken Shish and number 4 beef shish beef shish ,well I tried both special for $18.99  !! wow it was very good choice !! the Chicken it was just amazing and the beef so juicy,tasty and tender , the rice sauce and bread where exellent definitely I'll be right back :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken kabob and a veggie kabob. It came with rice, bread, salad and two dressings. It was FANTASTIC. They made it to order and it had the authentic flame grilled taste and the appropriate chars on the food. Taste this food. It's top notch!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and public area. 2nd time here this week. Affordable and the food is Sssoooo Good! The Gyros were good and the Kabobs are awesome! Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"This review makes me sad....I had high hopes for this place but was sorely let down. I'll keep it simple. Nothing was seasoned. The meat was dryer than the desert we live in out here. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars rather than 1 is because the cashier helping was a sweetheart. His happy attitude was contagious and I left smiling not knowing what I was going to eat when I got home. Got home and sat down with my order and immediately realized that the colors looked off. Took a bite and instantly regretted spending my money..  Won't be returning... Such a shame since it's so close to home..."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but some of the prices are a little high.  The location itself is pretty nice.  They have really comfortable little couches, and coffee tables on the patio, and there's a fantastic view of the strip, and airport. My boyfriend ordered the shawarma.  It was delicious, and right around $9 which was just about fair.  It came with some hummus, and a small dolma.  I ordered a koobideh/lamb kebab combo that came with bread, rice, and a roasted tomato for $17ish.  The kebabs were awesome, but the price seemed a little high to me.  Looking over the menu AFTER we ate, I saw a mix and match any 2 koobideh kebab (ground beef, ground chicken, or ground lamb) for $9 deal.  I'll have to try that out the next time we stop by."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty delicious.  We got a beef kabob, and a chicken kabob this time, and they were both awesome.  Very juicy, and flavorful  The fresh flat bread they make there is really good as well. The interior is nice, and clean, and the service is great.  My only complaint with Flame Kabob used to be that their prices were a bit high, but that's not as much of an issue anymore.  They have $3.99 lunch specials on weekdays 11-3, and that's pretty damn reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been to a dozen kabob restaurants the last month while traveling for work. So I have plenty to compare this place to.   Service... One of the best!!! Price.... One of the best!!! Quantity... One of the best!!!  Flavor.... Lacking.   I really wanted to like this place because the price and service is great. The food however lacked flavor. It didn't taste bad, but it tasted like they ran out of spices that day.   If you come in hungry, you will definitely walk out full. I can't guarantee you'll walk out satisfied."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with good lunch specials, plus a discount for students. Sauce was tasty, plenty of meet in the gyro and the price is hard to beat. Definitely plan on frequenting this place!"}
{"text":"Place is very clean, food presentation is on point, and portions are balanced regarding price. Food is outstanding, try babagharoush and gyro!  Rosewater tea is delightful."}
{"text":"Nice and fresh food.The amount of salt and spices was well balanced.will definitely revisit"}
{"text":"Love the consistency of freshness in the food! cucumber salad is so delicious it mixed with olive oil vinaigrette and other spices! I love that the give you the option of shaved chicken or chicken Breast cubes! The salad is served separated from the chicken so that the salad doesn't get soggy I appreciate that!"}
{"text":"The hummus, falafel, rice, kabob's and everything here is home made. I have looked for a place like this for the past 12 years and finally found it. Best Arabic food in town. Good quality and FRESH..."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was excellent.  Fast food environment with very personable service by owner.  Great value for what you get.  Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"i am a UNLV student and i always stop here in between my classes for lunch. always had the gyro, but last time i tried the kabob #9 it was great to try something new in there, i had beef,lamb, and chicken ground all good but my favorite is lamb"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in on a Friday night around 8PM and it was a fairly slow evening. We were greeted right away and the ordering process went smooth. We ordered the appetizer sampler with less falafel and extra hummus, two ground meat skewers and three tenderloin skewers. The rice and salad was lacking a bit of flavor and the texture of the rice seemed a bit dry. I did enjoy the baba ganoush and hummus. The tenderloin skewers were good and I did not care too much for the ground meat skewers but that's just a personal preference."}
{"text":"I've been here before, but it was a while ago and the first couple times were mediocre. I decided to go here again out of convenience and I thought why not. I had noticed that since the last time I had been there,  they lowered the prices a bit. Lookin good already, I thought.  I proceeded to order the number 1 combo,  which is their ground beef kubideh. The guy who rang me up was very pleasant,  not just to me,  but to the others who were there. Perhaps they saw their negative reviews?   You need to try the rose tea and sour cherry teas. Delicious.  I got my order and jeeze, I don't remember the meat being this juicy and flavorful. I remembered it being slightly dry. Maybe the lunch hour has a different staff because dinner here was great. The yogurt was perfect, the bread was fluffy, and the rice was buttery. All very delicious. I could probably go without their salad though."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised...as one that cooks Persian and middle eastern I can and do find lots of faults in the flavor department in these kind of places but not here... The spices were right on, they actually use Basmati(slightly overcooked)...absolutely nothing to complain about...not my style. Now please keep in mind that this place is nothing fancy, no service, pay when you order plastic cutlery ( I had to commandeer a steak knife from the kitchen to cut the lamb kabob) Prices are on par with other middle eastern places for what is served...so I cannot claim its overpriced, but do expect to pay about $13-14 per person with a drink.  not exactly cheap for what you get. All in all......not half bad, I'll give it an A-"}
{"text":"I usually like to support Persian restaurant in any city I go or visit. Flame is a descent restaurant. The concept of this restaurant is more like a fast-food joint than a lunch/dinner place. For some reasons, I have a hard time assimilating fast food to Persian food. There food is fresh and the bread is homemade. Atmosphere 3/5: They built this restaurant in a way we feel like in a fast food joint. I like the windows to the kitchen so you can see the preparation of your order. The meat are prepared in advanced and left in a fridge. The atmosphere isn't bad, it's just not my favorite place to eat Persian food at the premise. Food 3/5: Food is fresh and good. I wouldn't give them the price of Best restaurant in town though. It's a great concept if you're looking to eat something cheap and fast. They have a quick turn around and the meat is halal. Service 3/5: I give them 3/5 because they are nice people. The restaurant is sort of self service so it is difficult to judge the service on that end.  Overall, a good place to eat cheap Persian food. A Sikh of Koubideh is for example $6.99 and two Sikh is $9.99. So not my favorite restaurant in Vegas but I will support them sometimes."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a free kabob so I obviously had to give this place a try. I went for the lamb kabob and a the taftoon bread. The food was made fresh and was ready in about 10-15 mintues.  I was especially excited to try to taftoon bread since it's made to order. It was huge and came out piping hot. It smelled so good, but sadly I was a bit disappointed. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was actually quite dense. And as it cooled, it just got tougher and tougher. The kabab was good and had a nice flavor, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one. Overall, decent food at decent prices."}
{"text":"Being raised in a Persian family, I can say I have eaten my fair share of good Persian food.  I have eaten at Flame Kabob on a number of occasions, and although it has been passable at times, my last experience with the food was terrible.   The rice is totally bland. Although it has a rich yellow color that should give the impression that Saffron was used, I am convinced it was clearly just food coloring.  I ordered 4 meals, and had every type of meat available for koobideh. The Lamb was dry and gritty, the chicken was distasteful, and the beef was also very dry.   I also had the Chelo Kabob, which is typically made from tenderloin. Although I would not expect it to use that cut of meat at a fast food style restaurant. That plate still cost 20 bucks and I am pretty confident they used chuck or top round.   Persian food is meant to be very tasty. It seems to me they are cutting corners and still charging a premium. I would hope there food quality goes back up."}
{"text":"I went into Flame Kabob for the first time today. I ordered the Beef Shish Kabob and a soda, it was $12 for the two. That right there was a bit too steep for lunch in my opinion so I hoped the meal would make up for that price. To my disappointment, it took FOREVER to get my food! I wasted half of my hour lunch just on ordering and waiting for the food to be done (note: I work next door practically!). The meat wasn't cooked throughout and the rice was just meh. The only thing that saved the meal was the freshly prepared taffoon bread. That was delish. So that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just one.  All things considered...I will definitely not return to this restaurant. It was worth a shot but I rather take my $12 somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in around 5:00pm, ordered a lamb kabob salad, the person behind the counter recommended a different version of the order I wanted which had more lamb than what I was originally ordered. Food presentation was stellar, the food was great, get the rose water."}
{"text":"Flavorful and delicious food! Love their green sauce, beef shish kabob and their fries are incredible!"}
{"text":"Everything here is organic and the meat has no hormones or anything . Everything is fresh made and soo good! Definitely coming back here when I come back to Vegas !"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean in Las Vegas! Definitely a hidden gem. The food is amazing and the staff is always wonderful! A+ all the way! I'd give 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I had the 2 meat kabob (chicken & lamb) with rice and a side veggie salad for $12. It was delicious. I do recommend you try the chicken, it was juicy and very tasty. They also have a very tasty and very refreshing fruit iced tea that I really liked. Israel helped us & was very attentive to our request.   I'd go back again.   Update: 11-8-17  I recently visited again, and had the same meal. The service, the menu board, the presentation of the meal and the delicious meal itself has gotten exponentially better. The staff were kind and welcoming.   When 5 stars isn't enough I had to write another review!   Thank you"}
{"text":"The Gyro was delicious as was the Shirazi Salad (only if you like LIME).  The kids loved the beef kabob.  The baklava was very, very good."}
{"text":"Having lived in Turkey for a while, I was pleased with the introduction to another regional taste of spices. Split the entree with the wife - had plenty for lunch.  BUT, the lunch specials posted on multiple signs on the street were not posted in the side. The order-taker had no idea of any lunch specials except the few posted on the wall. Also, the fountain drinks were not posted on the menu board, cans of soda were only ones visible."}
{"text":"Great restaurant... Clean, positive ambiance and a welcoming environment. Staff has always been helpful and prompt in processing orders.  The food is fresh, and the signature bread is freshly baked right before you order. The kabobs are tender, well marinated and overall, do justice to the authenticity of this Persian food staple.  My largest complaint with Flame Kabob is what seeks to be, oddly enough, a supply constraint. On 3 separate occasions, I have gone to the restaurant to order my favorite dish, the chicken kubideh plate, only to find out they ran out of chicken. To me, this is unacceptable, especially if it is such a popular dish. I hope they remedy the situation in the future."}
{"text":"I came here exactly 6 minutes after closing and asked if they had already closed since I had seen ppl eating in the dining area. Lucky for me, they allowed me to put my order in. It was my first time here and I was extremely excited to try this place since I've heard so much from friends. The gentleman that took my order kindly asked if I had been here before. I mentioned it was my first time and he gave me a free drink. More bonus points for that. They took my order after closing and I got a free drink. But did I mentioned the food?... Genius and delicious! Loved the lamb! Perfectly cooked and the chicken wasn't dry at all. Which surprised me as it was closing time. I'm definitely coming back and spreading the word. These ppl are dedicated to customer service and their satisfaction. I love this place and highly recommend it.  Cheers and hope this helps."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by here looking for some quick healthy food.  It's located in a shopping building.  There is plenty of parking behind the building.  It's across from a school.  They seem to cater to students.  There are plenty of student deals on the menu.    At this location, you order up front and then they deliver the food to you.  We came here late afternoon on a Friday and there were two other tables here.  The prices were decent for what you get.  I particularly love their drink selection.  I got a rose ice tea that I love!    Anyways, in the mood for kabobs in Vegas?  This place is good!"}
{"text":"The food is freshly made and tasty. It's pricey for what it is, but I return for the falafel wrap all the time. It's made by hand and a decent portion for lunch or dinner. The inside atmosphere could be better, but the majority of my orders are for delivery :) I understand the service might not be as overly friendly as many people expect, but after chatting with some of the employees they have been friendly and welcoming. I recommend the rose tea - it's likely something you haven't tried before."}
{"text":"Great food lamb is so amazing hard to find a kubideh place that's any good, my new kabob spot in Vegas"}
{"text":"So this is the original? I would've never guess as the location is tucked away in an underground mini mall across campus. I have always frequented the one on Sunset which is now no longer part of the chain/franchise.  I got the mix and match combo chicken and lamb (+3.00 extra) and a mini mast-akhir sauce.  First off I was bummed that there was an upgrade charge for the lamb. It wasn't that way at the other location. There were a few other subtitle difference between this location and the breakaway fresh kabob. 1. The upgrade charge mentioned above for the lamb. 2. The combo comes with a bit of mast-akhir sauce on your plate (no need for separate orders) 3. The side mast-akhir sauce comes with bread.  4. The mint chutney sauce is is Spicy!   The kebabs were packed full of flavor as I have come to expect. Nice flame grilled texture while at the same time moist. I enjoyed the dish here.  The only thing that was a bit of a miss was the bread, I was used to the lighter fluffy taftoon bread that's served at the other place, this one was a little more on the dense and firm side.   All and all a decent meal in a sketchy location"}
{"text":"Drove past CSN Charleston to the $5 car wash further down the street and saw the Grand Opening sign outside of Flame Kabob.  I recognized the name as the one on Sunset, which I have not been to.  So after washing the car and working up a sweat just vacuuming my car, I decided to head back and check out Flame Kabob.  The restaurant is fast casual Persian kabob chain restaurant.  Since it is still very new, the interior looks really clean and the tables and chairs are in good condition. The kitchen where the staff prepare and plate the food is very clean. If you want you can see them roll out the dough and bake the fresh bread.  Their menu is available for viewing online, so I didn't bother taking pictures of their menu.  But they also have pick two out of three kubideh (beef, chicken and lamb) for $9.99.  A sweet deal which I took advantage of.  The food took awhile to prepared, since it was made to order and didn't bother me due to my lack of time constraints. But for me it was totally worth it.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  The kubidef (beef and chicken) came off the special grill still steaming hot, and was delicious, flavorful and still very juicy and moist inside.  I also tried their Pistachio Rose Water Persian ice cream. It was good, with some pistachio pieces in the ice cream but the relatively dominant flavor is still rose water.  The cashier followed up with each diner to ask us about the food we ordered. And they will soon have 3rd location in Las Vegas.  The hours: Mon-Sat 11am - 9pm Sun 12pm - 8pm  Price - seems high but most Persian restaurants are. The pick two of three Kubideh (ground meat skewers) is a relatively good value though. Food - I enjoyed everything except their grilled tomato and their Saffron Rice (bland). The meats were hot and juicy, and still piping hot when they plated my food. Ice cream worth a try. Service - friendly  Overall 4 stars for me. And I will be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with my coworker. As I perused the menu I didn't see a lot of options and the prices aren't the best I've seen. Service was standard and efficient. I ordered the beef and lamb shawarma and my coworker went with the chicken shawarma.   They cook everything to order, which makes it take a little longer to prepare than most places, but it's worth the wait for freshness. The food was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but it definitely hit the spot. They serve generous portions and we were both stuffed after our meals."}
{"text":"We just went there to have persian food. It took 2 hours for them to bring our food, we ordered koobideh and shish kabob. The food was so bad, specifically shish kabob that we could not eat it at all. I don't recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"Saw it in strip mall while I was stopping by to get a Jiffy Smog.  The prices were sort of steep considering the portion size they were doling out.  The items did look good in the pictures but I walked in and no one was at the counter.  The place looked great and clean.  I waited a few minutes but with no one came, I thought maybe they were getting ready to close so I left.  I'll be back as everything looked good, and smelled good, I just didn't have anyone serving me in order to taste it."}
