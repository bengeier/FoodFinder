{"text":"Unfortunate name-they don't serve panini!  I stopped in looking for a nicely crisped, flattened panini sandwich but no luck here. Instead I had the Meatball sandwich, with a seriously large meatball, topped with peppers, onions and mushrooms on a soft, fresh bun.  This has to be one of the most tender, juicy meatballs I've encountered. I was essentially satisfied after eating the first half, but I couldn't stop. This sammy kept me full for hours!  They even sell their homemade sauce at the counter. I was tempted to grab a jar. Not that I needed to put it on anything, eating it with a spoon would have been fine."}
{"text":"Cute family owned business.  Very clean with an Italian flare.    I had the meatball sandwich.  It was juicy and hearty.  The flavour was okay, not great - but I chalk that up to personal preference.  I would try something else next time.    The portion size was good, there was a lot of meat in the sandwich.  Price wasn't bad.    A good spot for a home-made sandwich for lunch where you can watch the news while you eat."}
{"text":"This is a great little place with awesome Italian sandwiches. Since discovering it, I haven't gone anywhere else in Newmarket for this kind of food. It's fast and fresh and so satisfying when I'm hungry. My favourite is the eggplant parm sandwich with everything on it. The veal is also wonderful - tender and fresh. I love the homemade tomato sauce, such authentic flavour. I often see Nonna working in the kitchen preparing everything fresh and this just adds to the authentic homemade feel of the food and the atmosphere. Definitely a favourite for me, somewhere I choose often for lunch over the big name chains."}
