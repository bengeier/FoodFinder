{"text":"I could eat here 7 days a week. The BLT w/Avocado rocks!!!  Great service...Friendly people and generous portions. Did I mention they love their bacon. You can get bacon dipped in pancake syrup as an appetizer....how cool is that!"}
{"text":"Ok, I now regret my first review. We have been back 2 more times and had excellent food and service! The owners are the same that own Bridget's Blarney Stone in Ivesdale and had great conversation with the male owner. It's always nice to be able to speak to an owner to get a feel for things. I signed up for the Irish Beer Drinking Team too! Have taken friends and relatives and everyone was pleased."}
{"text":"I really like.this.place. Great.selection of spirits, prices are ok. Staff is.very.friendly.and.food is generally.good except.the.hamburgers.

{"text":"I drove from out of town to try \"something different'. I had a coworker that recommended 3 Ravens so I thought I would give it a try.  I was advised the wings were good but unfortunately I decided to go in another direction for my entree.  I ended up ordering the Cajun shrimp Alfredo. All I can say about the dish is it was possibly the worst food I've ever been served in a restaurant. If you go to this restaurant and can't find any salt for seasoning, it's because they put it all into this dish. It was absolutely inedible.  I know Cajun seasoning can be spicy / salty, but this was all salt with no spice.  Just horrible.  The waitress was nice but appeared to be inexperienced. She observed that I didn't eat the food and asked if I wanted a to go box. I told her \"no\" and mentioned it was not good at all. She then removed the plate and brought our bill. I could have been more upfront about the horrible food, so I don't really blame her for that.  I went with my wife and 16 year old son \"the garbage disposal\". He ordered a horseshoe made with a grilled cheese sandwich. He liked the grilled cheese but didn't eat the hamburger.  My wife ordered a ribeye sandwich that she described as mediocre. The only reason I gave a 2 star was because my wife didn't realize the ribeye came with blue cheese and the waitress was very polite and replaced it with a ribeye without blue cheese, even though it was my wife's fault.  I normally understand that you sometimes have a bad experience at a restaurant, and that does not always accurately reflect the business overall; however, I cannot see myself giving this particular restaurant another chance."}
{"text":"3 Ravens has something for everyone. The space is warm and cozy. The service at the bar is top notch. It truly feels like home. The dining room experience can be hit or miss at times. It can get pretty busy but the staff is always upfront about your wait time.  Great craft beer selection for a small town -- usually a few IPAS, local craft selections, and a seasonal variety. 47 & 74 from JT Walker's in Mahomet is one of my favorites.  I've never had food I didn't like. My favorite option is the bone-in wings with Ashley's fries (seasoned crinkle cut fries). The steak sandwiches are good and there are usually many interesting daily specials."}
{"text":"Why there is carpeting all through such a beautiful, old space such as the one this pub inhabits escapes me, especially since they specialize in greasy food and beer. I loved that they had an option on the menu to buy the cooks a drink for $12. Had we been there for a full meal later in the day we certainly would have. As for the food and drink, it's all relative to location. Would this place somehow magically be transported to downtown Chicago, it would lose at least one star. The Bloody Mary I had was good, as in nothing to complain about. There was an inventive offering of \"Tetris tots\" with bacon aoli, which was tasty, but after a few bites was just too greasy. The chips and salsa were passable. This is the Midwest, so I don't expect miracles in terms of chips and salsa. What was sort of bad was the absolute grime of the table top. It looked as though no one had cleaned it in ages. The waitress wiped it down but it looked just the same after she did so. Also, I paid our approximately $14 tab with a $20 and the waitress brought back a $5 and change, which either means she wasn't expecting a tip, or she was going for the whole $5. I'm probably being a bit picky on this point, but for some reason it annoyed me that she didn't bring $1s. I almost always tip 20%. Don't force me to tip you well over that or nothing at all, ok?"}
{"text":"Bravo.   Lunch at the Brown Bag, Dinner at 3 Ravens.   When you come back to this small town in the middle of nowhere, it's great to know that you won't go without quality food. I've been coming to this town once a year for almost 25 years (wife grew up here) and I've seen local restaurants come and go. But the perfect trifecta at the moment (and has been for the past few years) is a country cooked home breakfast, lunch at the Brown Bag and a Rib eye at 3 Ravens. Their Tuscan Chicken sandwich also has a great flavor profile.   It's nice to visit great folks AND have nice places like 3 Ravens to enjoy. Five stars for good food and JUST for being here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice variety of beers, quick service and fantastic prices! They have a funny note on the tables out front about how they can't serve alcohol only outdoors (local regulations, I assume), so that's good to know... Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Food is good, not great, but reasonably priced. You won't find a better place in Monticello though and the bar's ambiance is great!"}
{"text":"In a small town/area this is definitely the place to go. Good food, beer selection, and pleasant staff. Check it out if in question."}
{"text":"The food and service are great. My kids love the Ashley fries and hot fudge brownie ice cream desert."}
{"text":"The asiago crusted salmon was absolutely delicious.  My girlfriend really liked her Thai shrimp hoagie.  Service was very pleasant and timely.  The atmosphere is quaint.  A great find in a small town, perfect for dining after a long hike at nearby Alerton Park."}
{"text":"We stopped at Three Ravens on our way to drop our daughter off at 4H camp. We enjoyed our visit. For an appetizer we ordered ahi seared tuna and wasabi. It was cooked perfectly. The wasabi cucumber sauce was devine, my only suggestion would be to not serve it in a paper cup (just to keep up the facade of up- scale). We also ordered the pretzel and beer cheese appetizer. The cheese was to die for. I wanted to bring home a gallon. For drinks we ordered soda and tea and my husband ordered a bloody Mary. It was average and good.  My daughter ordered the bacon cheeseburger cooked medium with kettle chips (they brought crinkle cut fries instead, which was fine because we liked them better). Her burger was cooked perfectly and she said it was very good. You could tell the patty was hand made and not frozen. My husband ordered the country fried steak and potatoes. The serving size was huge and he said it was delicious. The potatoes were \"real\" and garlic smashed, they were fantastic. I ordered the portabello ribeye sandwich, medium rare. The mushrooms and sauce were delicious. The steak was okay. It was medium rare in some parts but in others it was raw and un-chewable. I ordered the kettle chips, I think if they were fresh they would have been good, however they were cold and had noticeably been prepared and stored in large batches. We will definitely be returning. It was a very good meal. Our total was 67.22."}
{"text":"So I would say for Monticello, this place is four stars....if 3 Ravens was plopped into the middle of Logan Square, however, much different story.   But I have a couple friends who live in this little town and 3 Ravens is definitely THE top choice around here. We brought 3 little ones in on Sunday to watch the Bears game and the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. They changed the TV channels for us, got us high chairs, kids cups...and put up with a couple very fussy babies towards the end of our meal. Thanks again 3 Ravens!!!  The food we had was pretty standard bar fare. Burgers that were hand made, not frozen was a great touch. My wife had the Tuscan chicken sandwich and enjoyed it thoroughly. I would come back here when we take a visit down to Monticello again, that's for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Great staff. Wife ordered the Brendan and I had the bleu cheese burger. Both awesome, fresh, and delicious. We also ordered Gorgonzola bacon fries which were phenomenal. It's a special item so who knows how long it'll last for but if you see it, order it, it's worth it. Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Welcoming staff and terrific service at Three Ravens. Not exactly the conventional bar fare. I recommend Parmesan garlic chicken wings, Ashley's fries, steak sandwiches, broccoli salad, and the craft beer. This is definitely the place to eat if visiting Monticello. Huge whisky selection as well."}
{"text":"Great place in the middle of mediocrity. Great service and amazing food with a large selection that will please anyone. Additionally, huge Irish whiskey and craft beer selection.   Definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Just ok. Of Monticello's offerings, this is the go-to from my experience. Burgers are probably the best option here. I ventured out for a special on their boneless wings, awful."}
{"text":"Ok, so maybe they don't make a huge effort to be the most interesting place, but I think it is the perfect type of restaurant for Monticello.  Yes, Montgomery's (which it replaced) had divine food, but it was a completely different type of restaurant.  (I've heard that Montgomery's chef is now at Buttita's in Champaign, which definitely explains the deliciousness.)   3 Ravens has awesome specials and pretty darn good prices.  I have never ordered something that I have not been tremendously happy with.  Their french fries are right up there with Wonderdogs in Champaign, which I consider to be the best fries around, hands down!  They have a pulled pork sandwich special on Sundays (and maybe Wednesdays) that is amazing in both flavor, tenderness and juiciness.  Their burgers are great (though being pregnant, I can't have the blue cheese burger right now, which I miss sooo much) and they have a great selection of (mainly Irish) beers on tap (which I also miss quite a bit :)  Their club sandwich is great, as is their shrimp basket and fish sandwich.  Those are my particular recommendations, but like I said, I've never been disappointed ordering something new.  I have a friend who foolishly ate the \"Triple Bypass\" in one go.  It was enough food to almost get sick just watching him and when he finished he looked like the perfect image of someone who had just finished the best meal of his life and was now ready to promptly explode.  Their service is great - attentive, but not annoying and friendly in the Cheers type way where you're a long term friend and client even if you're only there once.    They've got a few tv's in the dining room where I occasionally find myself enjoying a football game even though I don't watch sports and their decor is nice, somewhere between American bar, Irish pub and home.  I'm not positive, but I think the owners are also the owner's of an Ivesdale pub called Bridgette's Blarneystone, maybe? (Which I hear rave reviews about.)  In fact, after talking about it now, I want to go eat there at this exact moment.  It's just a nice place to go and grab a great meal for a reasonable price (Burger and fries average $7-10) We've also been there later at night (8 or 9 PM after days of building projects and sparse opportunities for food) and found that the food is just as good late as it is during more typical dining hours (I've found that that isn't always the case with pub/eateries, especially in small towns.)  Hooray 3 Ravens.  Though I'll miss you Montgomerey's, I will cherish your replacement with equal enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Food seems fine and good beer selection but wayyyyy too many flies. We couldn't even enjoy our food because there were so many flies. I think they need to take care of this problem before I'll want to return."}
{"text":"Three Ravens (Replaced Montgomery's in 2009)    May 2010 Monticello, IL                                                                  Many good items, a few only fair.  Love the baked BBQ Chicken Wings.  And good selection of beer.  Sort of a sports bar / casual restaurant.   I think the TVs in dining room are more of a distraction and keeps Ravens from being considered an upper middle level restaurant.    Service usually good, but can be iffy.    Prices are average.  Some good daily specials."}
{"text":"We were looking for an out of town treat, so decided to try the Three Ravens in Monticello. I'd read the menu online, but no reviews, and thought pub grub would add up to the comfort food we were after. We were there for dinner on a Wednesday night. Internet service (Frontier) was down, so they were taking cash or personal checks, but signs were posted and the bartender who greeted us also let us know.  The restaurant is right off the town square, with free parking out front. Its entrance leads into the bar with a door at the back that leads to a dining room on the right. The bar itself is a long thin room, with an actual bar counter and stools to the right and a high-top table up front. The dining room is comfortably large with plenty of seating; it hasn't changed much from previous restaurants in the space, except for Irish-themed decor (flags, a carved lyre). It's simple and clean, but not much on atmosphere. There are two televisions in the dining area (showing food programming when we dined there).   We ordered battered broccoli and cauliflower to dunk in a cheese-beer sauce as a starter. For entrees we ordered a special -- asparagus risotto (with mushrooms, red pepper, and pork belly) and beef tips over mashed potatoes. Both came with garlic bread and we added salads with blue cheese dressing, tomatoes, green peppers, and cheese. Sounds good, doesn't it? But the food, I'm sorry to say, is mediocre.   The salads used an iceberg lettuce blend, which I don't mind if the other elements pack in flavor. The tomatoes were tasteless, and I found the stem end of a tomato in my salad (eck). The lettuce and veggies were not seasoned. The blue cheese dressing was good, though -- the best element.   As for our starter, the veggies for dunking were not battered -- they had a kiss of some kind of light meal and were undercooked. Both the broccoli and cauliflower still had too much (rubbery) bite. The cheese sauce wasn't liquid enough for dipping (we had to shmear our veg in it), and the taste was bland -- very much like a jar cheese sauce from the grocery store. I would be surprised if it were made in-house.   My entree, the beef tips, was just okay. The beef was nicely braised (tender) but the wine-reduction sauce tasted as if it had been prepared and brought in by a vendor (its taste and texture were similar to the Salisbury steak gravy from a frozen dinner), despite the fresh onions and green peppers in it. The potatoes were warm, but not creamy or buttery (also under-seasoned). They were made from smashed red potatoes.   The asparagus risotto was a real miss. The risotto was made with rice that had been precooked and stored cold. We know this because my partner found clumps of unheated rice in the dish. The rice was also too starchy (it had turned to gummy gloop). In the entire entree, he also found only two small pieces of pork belly, both of which had not been properly rendered. The dish was under-seasoned. The best I can say of these entrees is that they came in generous portions.  The garlic bread was made with nice bread toasted perfectly (I believe it was a baguette cut on the bias). It had no garlic flavor. There were no garlic bits or even the perfume of rubbed garlic on the bread. My partner said he thought the butter might have a faint taste of garlic powder, but I couldn't detect it.  The price for our dinner with tip was over $50 (we had diet soda to drink -- $2 each). The food is not a value at that price, given the poor preparation and questionable ingredients. There's an attempt to honor the spirit of pub grub, but the talent in the kitchen and commitment to quality is lacking at this time.  The service was good, by the way, through most of the meal. At the very end, though, the waitress disappeared and did not come back. We had a difficult time getting her attention -- we weren't able to pay until 15 or 20 minutes after we finished our meal. She had moved on to other customers."}
{"text":"This is probably Piatt County's most interesting place, a pub and restaurant on the Courthouse Square, just west of the Courthouse.  It's main competition is the Daily Queen, so it doesn't take to much effort to be most interesting, however.  It replaced a valiant effort called Montgomery's. 3 Ravens opened in April, 2009."}
{"text":"This is a gem in a small rural area!  The apps were great!  We stopped there because of the reviews on yelp after dropping our son off at the local campgrounds for diabetes camp.  We even went back when we picked our son up and brought some local friends along.  The following items are a few that we ordered: pretzel and cheese app, battered mushrooms, chips and cheese, we sampled their specials, and kids menu with grilled cheese and chicken plank.  The kids ate their food!  Always a good sign.  The apps were awesome. My special with pasta and chicken was good but I did not love the chicken itself.  I mostly pushed that to the side.  The chips and queso were good but too spicy hot for my mild palate.  We will go back when in the area again!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently pretty good.  Atmosphere is fine.  I've seen some service complaints in other reviews,  I've never had awful service, can't say it's the best but the drink glass stays full and waitresses are around."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for some time. We arrived to complacent and unfriendly staff. We sat ourselves and our waitress was the only employee in the restaurant that had any sort of personality. I felt like we needed to take shoe laces and belts from the rest of the staff and put them on suicide watch. When I inquired about the beer selection, I was told I needed to walk back up to the bar to view it for myself as there was no list. The beer selection was poor and not what I was expecting from a 'pub'. We ordered Gorgonzola and bacon fries to start and I don't think that any portion of that app was made in house. Even the bacon tasted like it was out of a package. My date ordered a Ruben and cottage cheese. The Ruben was tasty enough but she was given a poor excuse for coleslaw in lieu of the cottage cheese she ordered. I ordered Thai Tuna Nachos and have to say that, with exception to the canned pineapple, it was excellent. Hence the second star. The ambiance was depressing and we both felt like running out of there after our meal. I had high hopes but won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a couple months now so I'm glad that after coming from Champaign, the food, service and atmosphere was, for the most part, worth it.  Normally, I start with my compliments but this time, I'll start with my two complaints. For starters, our server didn't seem to know the menu very well. In addition to not knowing whether or not the potato salad was a mustard potato salad, when asked for a recommendation on something to eat, the server mentioned something that was no longer on the menu and that we couldn't order. In addition, the beef on my Philly Cheesesteak was woefully underseasoned.   At the same time, these two snafus (which normally would very significantly taint my overall restaurant experience) were far outweighed by the good. Though the fries and other fried foods were most likely from a bag, I didn't mind because they came out crispy and not greasy. Despite having underseasoned meat, upon adding some salt, the Philly Cheesesteak was delicious and the roasted red peppers were a nice touch. 3 Ravens also had a decent beer selection - not quite a Blind Pig/Crane Alley selection, but respectable to be sure. I appreciated the addition of many Irish beers as well. On top of this, the service was pretty fantastic and the food came out quickly and hot.  3 Ravens is kind of a wheel-house style pub but what it sets out to do it does well. I had no problem giving out the four stars."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant! Has great food. Service can be slow at times. High prices"}
{"text":"We have been going to 3 ravens for a couple years now. Service can be hit or miss...some days it doesn't take long for food to come out, but other days it takes forever. Their burgers are incredible. Always amazing. The other food we have tried can be very bland. Stick to the burgers And you will leave happy."}
{"text":"I wanted this to be a good stop as we have been here before but the service tonight was just not there. They were semi busy but that doesn't explain the service....heard more complaining than anything else and the food wasn't the greatest. I'm glad my last experience was much better than today as it may be enough to get me to come back one more time. We shall see."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible! The food was ok, but service plays a big part in why customers return. Besides waiting to order our food 15 minutes after walking, it was impossible to get a refill. We weren't able to get a refill until after the waitress came by to take our empty plates. As we were signing for the credit card we were drinking our refill. The restaurant was NOT busy. We were seated about 2:15p. I can't recommend this place to anyone. I just cannot believe how hard it is to get attention from your waitress when there are only 4 parties in the entire dinning room."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in small town.  More diverse than you standard pub fair and the restaurant is in a separate room from the bar.  Always offering a weekly list of specials that cover unique appetizers, entrees and drinks. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I come here every time I'm in the area. They have fantastic food and a creative menu. The bartender was super friendly and made perfect beer suggestions. Prices are reasonable, and they have an excellent craft and imported beer selection. Don't miss it! Monticello is lucky to have a place this awesome."}
{"text":"Poor service..gross food..will never go back! Ordered steak..it was cold...waite staff was rude and almost nonexistent....my husband got sick after the meal...glad I didn't eat mine..also, dirty silverware was on the table when we got there..."}
