{"text":"Ordered Mr. Jim's for the first time. Mostly enjoyable minus the greasiness of the pizza as well as our Cin Stix. It leaked through the boxes, had to have newspaper under to protect our counter. It was so unbearable we had to set each slice on a paper towel so we didn't just eat grease. It didn't appear to be from the cheese or pepperoni, I have never seen such a greasy bottom of a pizza. Once the grease was soaked out, it was a delightful pizza. The Cin Stix were equally greasy though so I can't figure out what the deal was. Plan to give it another try, for the price, and vicinity to our home."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at Mr. Jim's writing this review. Such a disappointment with the service. I called 20 mins before I got here for a pickup order that was promised to me be ready in 20-25 mins, when I got here, the guy took my payment and said I 'll get it out to you as soon it's ready thinking that it is. I look back and to my surprise, he just started preparing my order and ended up waiting 20 additional minutes. I can see this pizza place from my backyard, but I think I'll go elsewhere from now on. Yes I know, just the little things"}
{"text":"Pizza is tough to get out here but the pizza here is very tasty.  I ordered it for my grandkids in Providence  at lunchtime on a Sunday quick and good - tasty a very varied pizza menu"}
{"text":"Mr jims was a nice place to get food but then management change and everything went to crap. 

Are there any adults working any more? I once went in and there was a child no more than 15 working with no one else there!! 

I could see the quality of the food diminishing.. What a shame"}
{"text":"Had Mr. Jim's more than I would like to admit in the month since I moved to the area.  The first time was minutes before close and staff was super friendly and helpful not at all rushing due to the time, oh yeah the pizza was good too.

The second time we called it in for delivery.  It arrived fast and hot no complaints.  We have oredered it a couple more times while we were getting settled in from the move and it has been consistently good.  

Venturing away from their pizza offerings we have also enjoyed their chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"I live here in Providence, and was actually online to see if anyone knew when the new Cafe was opening, as my husband is a brekfast person , and was SHOCKED to see some of the people writing awful reviews about Jims Pizza. I am not a YELPER like many of you are, as I have a busy schedule, being that my husband and I own ourselves 3 local business' in town, but I was so saddened to see what people were writing about this great place, I had to give my two cents.

To start, my family, especially my teenager and her friends have ordered Jims Pizza many times, and it is fantastic!  Always tastes fresh, crust is amazing, and it gets to our door of hungry teenagers fast.  Maybe the people complaining about Jims Pizza, are just use to eating junk food and the \"fast food craze\" and just got used to eating the cheap tasting pizza from places like Dominos and Pizza Hut, and their taste buds just cant realize what good pizza tastes like anymore, as Jims Pizza is great.  I always got great, friendly service as well.   I met the owner once, about 6 months ago, had a conversation with him, and he is a very nice man who works hard for his business.

Secondly, most of you probably never owned a business and while your review may just be a random sentence on the internet to you, but to a business owner its the ability to provide for his family and his loved ones. To us business owners, we put  our heart and sole into our business', its our dream.  Please don't give me the excuse \"the public has the right to know about   the service\" or \"maybe if we publicly give our input, they will change their recipe\"  While many of you may not know this, your asking a man to risk his business, cost him money so that MAYBE it will appeal to your taste buds.  As I said my husband and I own 3 local business', well, there use to be a 4th one, it  was a very popular local place in town, that many of you would be familiar with, but for reasons I am listing, I am choosing not to list it, nor give my \"real name\" as well, as after reading and knowing how some of you, including members of Providence decided to write awful things about Jims Pizza, I don't need you writing any of our business bad reviews, just to be spiteful. Anyways, it wasn't till we owned that fourth one, that we realized how many bad, spiteful, and jealous people there are in Las Vegas.  I thought the world was a better place than this.  We helped out people by the day, gave them our sweat and blood, and got crap from those same people we helped, it got so bad that when a building disaster occurred, we took it as a blessing to get out of it, and closed it, which hurt us deeply, but was time to focus on our other business, and move on. We couldn't be more happier, as I don't have to deal with the general public at that level as I did then, and while we miss some of our wonderful regulars that we created awesome memories with, there was just too many awful ones and many freeloaders.  Just please remember that there are many aspects to a business that many of you who work a 9-5 job don't understand, and won't. While it may seem easy to ask a business to change to your liking, even just a simple request, are not that easy and expensive to any business owner. Also for you that complained about the $2.50 delivery charge, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT JIMS PIZZA OVERHEAD IS, AND IF THAT HELPS HIM KEEP HIS DOORS OPEN, THEN HE NEEDS TO DO THAT.  YOU YELPERS SEEM TO ASK ALOT FROM THESE PEOPLE.  ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, I GUARENTEE THAT SOME OF THESE POSTS ARE WRITTEN FROM JIMS PIZZA COMPETITORS FRIENDS, FAMILY MEMBERS,REGULARS, AS IVE PERSONALLY HAD THAT HAPPEN TO ME.  COMPETITORS CAN BE CRUEL, SO FOR YOU THAT HAVEN'T TRIED JIMS PIZZA, PLEASE IGNORE THESE POSTS AS HALF OF THEM ARE PROBABLY WRITTEN FROM HIS COMPETITORS. AND TO YOU PEOPLE THAT ARE WRITING FALSE REVIEWS, ITS ONE THING TO SUPPORT YOUR FAVORITE PLACES, ITS ANOTHER THING TO BULLY HIS COMPETITOR AS YOUR DOING HERE. 

NEXT  FOR YOU THAT LIVE IN PROVIDENCE WRITING THESE REVIEWS I AM SHOCKED.  ALL OF US SHOULD BE GIVING THE LOCAL BUSINESS' IN PROVIDENCE OUR LOCAL SUPPORT AND GET BEHIND THEM! THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE LAS VEGAS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CULTURE OR SENSE OF COMMUNITY, AND THEY ARE RIGHT!  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THEIR PIZZA, MAYBE WRITE OR EMAIL THEM A LETTER, THERE IS NO REASON TO PUBLICALY HUMILATE A BUSINESS, AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, MOVE ON AND EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.  AFTER ALL, BEING A YELPER, IS NOT GOING TO GET YOU ANYWHERE, AS I NOTICED, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YOU, SO IF YOUR WANTING TO BE A FOOD CRITIC, GET A WEBSITE TO STAND OUT, OR A BLOG, AS YOUR NOT GOING TO STAND OUT HERE.  BEHIND THIS BUSINESS IS A PERSON, A FAMILY, SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU POST.  REGARDLESS, MY FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO EAT THEIR DELICOUS PIZZA, AND STAND BEHIND A LOCAL BUSINESS THAT IS HERE IN PROVIDENCE.  THANK YOU JIMS PIZZA FOR YOUR GOOD FOOD AND KIND SERVICE.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK"}
{"text":"We are from Utah and come down to Las Vegas every few months. Every time we come we get food from Mr Jim's and Cane's Chicken. Mr Jim's is  amazing Pizza. The plain cheese pizza is the best I've had. You can taste the quality of the ingredients in the cheese and the sauce. We just tried the hot wings and lasagna. We loved it!"}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and found this place after a long day.  The pizza was much better than the chains and he made a special pizza for our daughter who is allergic to cheese. The service was great and fast."}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall with amazing pizza!! Being from the east coast and finding it difficult to find good pizza here, my boyfriend and I were both pleasantly surprised by the taste!! It was delicious! The service was great too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Local ownership!  Great price!  Not sure why this place has anything less than a 4 star rating.  I have tried both the original crust sticky fingers  as well as the Delish (thinner, but not thin crust pizza).  I highly recommend the garlic parmesan crust - converts boring pizza crust into a tasty breadstick!!  Comparing quality and price to other pizza franchises - Mr. Jim's wins hands down.  Try it and you'll quickly replace whatever your previous \"go to\" pizza place was before."}
{"text":"Love this pizza. We order whenever we can. Much better than all the other pizza places in our area. I used to live in a town full out authentic Italian pizzas and the Premier Pizza could stand up to them any day. 
The Nacho sticks are amazing. Absolutely love them. They are thin cheesy and just plain yummy. They are very flavorful.
I have been in there on occasion and talk with the owners who are wonderful people; extremely hospitable. We have never had a problem with service. 
Love this place and will always order my pizza from them."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to be a skeptic and try Mr. Jim's out for myself. I ordered what appeared to be a good pizza and initially noticed that the price seemed a little high for a medium pizza($12). I do have to give them credit for having the pizza ready in a short matter of minutes, but after taking a bite out of one slice I quickly regretted my decision to give this place a chance. The pizza lacked flavor and tasted like it had experienced freezer burn, which I found curious because the box advertises fresh dough as being their trademark. Bottom line, if you are thinking about trying Mr. Jim's pizza don't. Save your money and order Dominoes, Pizza Hut, or I would even recommend Little Caesar's."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Mr. Jim's quite a few times.  After having consistent good service and delicious food, I decided it was time to write a review on Yelp.

We love that Mr. Jim's has something that everyone in my family loves.  With 6 people to please it can sometimes be hard.  The employee's are always very friendly and willing to create a pizza just about any way I want to order it!  

My favorite is something that is unique to Mr. Jim's and that is their nacho stixs.  The thin crust is so crunchy and perfect.  I always hate it when thin crust is floppy.  Not at Mr. Jim's!

We ate at Mr. Jim's one time while my parents were visiting from out of town and even my mom who is pretty picky when it comes to pizza declared it a place she needs to eat at every time she visits!

I also love that they always have a good special going on.  With the coupons you can get high quality pizza that is made fast and fresh for about the same cost as the other guys that have their pizza sitting in a heating box for hours.

We have moved out to North Las Vegas and still make the drive to get this pizza, probably our favorite pizza place in town."}
{"text":"Extremely unprofessional! The employees were calling a customer who left a bitch in front of me, another customer and their manager. One male employee told the manager they were putting a note on the woman's account to not take orders from her anymore. The manager said no and the employee told her he was bc she was a bitch all bc she's illiterate and can't read a menu right. The manager said we aren't going to do that and walked off. A couple minutes later the employee announced to everyone that he put a note on her account to not take orders from her again. Then a few other employees joined in on bad mouthing the customer. The manager came back to the front and I told her that I didn't appreciate her employees talking poorly of other customers in front of customers. The manager said she agreed and I said, but you let him proceed on and talk poorly. You also said for him not to put a note on her account and he did it anyways and announced it. She said she didn't think he did and I said he did bc you left and walked to the back and he stayed on the computer and announced shortly after that he put a note in her account. She said she would check and remove it to make sure she can order. I said you are the manager and your employees don't respect you. They are cussing about customers in front of customers and blowing you off and doing what they want. She said she's had problems with their language and doesn't like how they cuss up front like that and will address it. I said you are the manager, you set the tone. I told her when they were cussing you should have cut it off right there. The whole staff is a bunch of punk teenagers, the manager is a meek teenager herself that all the employees know they can walk all over, which was quite evident to what I witnessed while waiting on my pizza. Where are the adults at this establishment!!?? Clearly, these feeble minded children have a lack of respect for the job they were hired to do, the authority put in place and for the paying customers. Then to top it off as I was walking out to my vehicle with my pizza, one of the employees returning from a delivery came speeding through the parking spaces, didn't even slow down when they saw me and sped past within 2 ft of me to park in front of the pizza place. I am 8 months pregnant! What kind of ill-mannered circus is this business running here?!? Absolutely no respect! Also, I have NEVER written a review in my life, but this establishment was so incredibly unprofessional and a joke!!! I will NEVER come here again! Great 1st time experience! You should be proud of your business!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and normally amazing service.  The manager has gone out of his way to remake our order when he felt it was not up to their standards.  Out of the 5 or 6 times I have ordered here,  I have only had one experience recently that was not so great.  They forgot to make one of our pizzas and so I ended up waiting for 30 minutes after I had purposely ordered online to save time; which is why I didn't give 5 stars.   Additionally, if you order online,  you can apply their coupons and save.  However,  if you order online and forget to add the coupon,  they cannot make any changes to the total you paid.  As someone else mentioned,  they're website is not very user friendly,  especially if you are using a smart phone."}
{"text":"Delicious crust, very friendly workers, clean establishment, and SUPER convenient for NW Las Vegas. Ill definitely be coming here more often!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I have lived in Vegas for the past 11 months and have tried probably 17 pizza places but nothing tastes even close to home \"Boston\" or even half decent. All the generic little Cesar's and pizza huts & dominions are here but as a pizza lover i was looking for an out of the box little shop. & now i have found it. The customer service at order time was great the driver was exactly the 35 min that was quoted and the pizza was delicious !!!!!! Only minus was that I think someone forgot to put the BBQ sauce on our wings but I still give a five star because human error is a part of life and the pizza was just what I was searching for had enough cheese great taste and good crust ! Plus we had BBQ @ home and just added it on ! Thanks for the great pizza definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a three star for the pizza. It was really good. We had the parmigiana crust and it was bomb. We ordered the wings and they were nasty. Unfortunately the flavor was ok but the skin was totally soggy! So sad. We also got the spaghetti. The sauce was too sweet and tasted like it came straight from a can. Word of wisdom- just stick was the delicious pizza. It was very fast service too."}
{"text":"I had a pizza here once a long time ago before I moved down to the south side. Honestly it's pizza you can't mess it up. Maybe next time I am in the northwest I'll get another pie from here."}
{"text":"What the heck are all of you complaining about? this Is a great deal and the owner is always very friendly! The pizza is very good and always heavy on the toppings. I live right here in providence and an happy not to have to get a crappy pizza from Domino's all the way down on Durango. That place sux!! So what if the Kids were drinking soda and what not, their like 16 years old and do a pretty dang good job if you ask me. I had to sign up just to stick up for this new business in our neighborhood. Not too happy about the smoke shop, but what can you do.

Oh Yea It's $7.00 pizza people relax!"}
{"text":"Second time ordering some pizza for delivery-2 seconds from home and definitely the Sunday lazy factor set in.  Wasn't impressed the first time and a definite decision on the second time...unfortunately.

We ordered off a regular coupon we get $17.99-large pizza with 8 wings.  We ordered our pizza-light on the cheese, extra sauce, pepperoni and pineapple and wings hot.  This was the worst pizza we have ever had.  First off my \"extra sauce\" and \"light cheese\" ended up with a full jar of sauce poured on top of the pizza-you couldn't even see cheese.  The pizza was a red sauce mess minus the crust.  Soggy bottom crust was the same as I remember the last time.  Totally dough in the middle-and their crust is what they pride themselves on.  SMH.  You can't even hold a slice up without a limp tip. Lol. Wings....drum roll....were slimy.  They came 4 in a foil pouch and they were completely stuck to the foil.  My guess is they already had them packaged up and they throw them in an oven to reheat them?  The BF finished them off on the grill and they were ok after that.  

Best part to me was the $2.50 delivery charge!  For living in Providence and 2 secs away from the place really?  Shoot if the food was worth it....all day long for our laziness.  But no ...pure disappointment and bummer that this is the only spot right smack in our hood.  I am so sad to say that I gave this a second chance before my review and its a total bust.  Mr. Jim, read your reviews to know where to improve but until then we will order pizza elsewhere!  :("}
{"text":"Order from here like once a week. There are better pizzas out there, but, for the price its off the chain.

Cons-They could offer a wider variety of toppings.

Pros-Fresh dough for crust, Good value, friendly service, extra sauce on your pizza for free and great flavored crusts!

Advice- Get coupon codes off of the internet."}
{"text":"I think their pizza is great.  I'm a big believer in supporting small start-up businesses.  However, they really do need to limit their intro. messsage.  It's a tad bit annoying."}
{"text":"New to the area and tried Mr. Jim's for the first time this week.   Really liked the food - husband had a calzone and I had lasagna.   We are Italian and we really enjoyed it so well done Mr. Jim's.   The salads were a little over priced for what you get (lettuce and tomato only), but I still enjoyed it because it was fresh!   Definitely will be my \"go to\" pizza joint."}
{"text":"Ordered a few times, and enjoy the service and nice employees. One time we had an issue; however management resolved the issue and took care of it. Don't let the few bad reviews discourage you from ordering. Give them the opportunity to \"wow\" you and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"For 4th of July decided on pizza vs hot dogs or hamburgers.  Ordered On-Line for 5 o'clock delivery of two pizzas.  Doorbell rang right at 5!  Great service, great pizza!  Both had plenty of cheese, which we like; lots of pepperoni and jalapenos.  Couldn't be happier.  I like to give our neighbor business establishments my business all that I can and my neighboring Mr. Jim's never disappoints me.  Give them your business, you won't be sorry.  Sign up for On-line Coupons.  Great values."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza, salads, and the worst chicken wings I've ever eaten in Las Vegas.  We placed a large order for about 12 people and nobody in the group, including the children, liked the food.

There are several pizza chains nearby that offer better food, even the pizza pariah called Little Ceasars is better.  If you want good pizza try North End Pizza or Mark Rich's they both blow this place away."}
{"text":"Ever since Jim's has been in the neighborhood I've been a loyal customer!
I only tried them 3 years ago out of convenience and have not gone to another pizza place since! 
I love the variety in their specialty pizzas. My favorite as of late is the chicken premier, the white sauce with chicken and the crust is so delicious out of all the pizzas I've tried there I have not gotten tired of this one. No matter what your craving on a pizza, Mr Jim's does it better than any other pizza place! If you like a supreme pizza, try the sticky fingers! I like to add extra sauce on it and makes it that much better. 
And their D'lish pizza is just that! Delicious, and it's perfect if you want a large pizza low on calories and cheaper than the rest. Out of all the pizzas there, a D'Lish pizza with just pepperoni or just cheese is probably my favorite! It really is so good! Also be sure to their brownie bites, the owner always lets me try a sample :) and how could I forget the customer service is always pleasant and is probably a good reason it's my favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"This is the worst food I have ever had.  I got 2 different pizzas and I'm not joking when I say they were covered in hair. The crust is only good for shipping.  Straight up burnt card board.   Very unprofessional staff.  How anyone gives this place 4/5 stars....is b e Y o n d me.  I would suggest getting store bought pizzas. They are way better."}
{"text":"If you enjoy a good thick slice of pizza, this is your place.  Mr. Jim's has a thicker crust than most of the pizza places including the other pizza places in the area. Toppings and sauce are fresh. Mr. Jim's also tends to be one of the more generous places on toppings.  Just be aware when you are ordering there are two versions of pizza here: the Original and the D'Lish. The D'Lish is a thin crust version of their pie and has less fat. It has less cheese and less toppings, but remember its a thin crust pie.
They offer pizzas in four sizes, small to extra large.
I ordered the Sticky Fingers pizza with a small order of breadsticks. This has become a new favorite in my book. It is thick with a very tasty crust and a lot of toppings for the price. The breadsticks are basically the pizza dough with cheese on it, sounds plain but it is very delicious and quite filling.
I am originally from Northern NJ, probably one of the better places for pizza. So probably for me to say this, it means a lot. The one and only gripe is that the food is really greasy. Do not get me wrong, pizza grease is where the flavor comes from, but the grease was everywhere on the box.
Delivery is slightly above average. Time-wise was average, but I like the fact that the driver actually verifies the order you have. I know it sounds so minor, but it is something that makes them stick out from the other deliveries that I've gotten.
I recommend that you order online the first time to see the menu and get some pretty good coupons. Prices with the coupon tend to be lower than the other guys.
Ordering online is even better as a group because you can bill items separately. So if everyone just wants pizza but your foodie friend wants pizza, wings, bread, and dessert, you can mark what items are hers- and she can pay for those items separately.
So if you want some thick crust pizza with so many toppings that it collapses, this is your place."}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza I've had! Great customer service, and food shows up quickly. Always great quality, hot, fresh and so flavorful. It's definitely not your average greasy, bland, soggy delivery pizza. 10/10"}
{"text":"Average pizza.  Nothing crazy but it's decent.  The crust is very average.
Good that Providence has something in the pizza category."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Best I think I've ever had. Sad it's closed Sunday's now. That's when we can have the time off and get it to enjoy it. I upped my stars to 5 stars because of the service I received. Best pizzas in town and even better service. If there is ever an issue they are quick to fix it and make you happy!! Any bad reviews they obviously didn't address the problem because the service here is impeccable."}
{"text":"This place used to be good until it was run by underage workers. Kids that are under 16 are making the food.  When you ask to  speak with the manager he is no where to be found. I don't trust this business at all."}
{"text":"The sauce was excelent, but every thing else was highly average.  It was like eating a Little Caesars pizza with tasty sauce."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from Mr. Jim's a second time tonight and since it was a good experience twice in a row I figured I'd throw a good Yelp review up. The first time we ordered we had it delivered and the guy on the phone was super helpful in explaining the menu since we had never ordered from them before. Delivery was pretty quick and pizza was good. Tonight we got some take-out pizza and I got to see the inside of the kitchen and all the people working. Very nice guys and really clean kitchen...it's open so you can see all prep/cooking areas. We've bad both types of crust, once flavored with garlic and the other time plain. I liked them both but would get the flavored again. I've also had a salad which was good sized and fresh. 

I love that it is so close to us in Providence and a local business. Prices are fair. Definitely give it a try if you're looking for pizza. Oh...and they have Blue Bell ice cream which is awesome in and of itself."}
{"text":"We order from here all of the time and we have never had a problem.  The food is fresh and the bread sticks are sooooooo good.  I would definitely recommend.  The real shining star here are the employees.  Every single employee that I have interacted with was so kind and professional.  We regularly order delivery but occasionally we will go in, if we don't want to wait the standard 30-45 minute delivery time, and most of them are younger and so great! Only problem is that they aren't open on Sunday but I can live with that because they need time off too."}
{"text":"First time we ordered I got the thin crust and we thought it was just okay. We gave Mr. Jim's another go a few months ago with the original crust and garlic parmesan butter. Oh my! Seriously good stuff! My son is a fan of the double Pepperoni deluxe (I've added a pic) and my new favorite is the chicken premier. We probably order about once a week now. Check out the website for some good coupons."}
{"text":"The customer service was nice but it took forever to get to the register for a pick up. There were only 3 employees and a line of customers, should've been better staffed for a busy Friday night. Nonetheless I appreciate those 3 kids taking their jobs seriously.
 
The pizza itself wasn't to my liking at all. It was cold and dry. The chicken wasn't well done like I asked. I like to support the local shops instead of the big chain places but I won't be back again."}
{"text":"I've lived in Providence for 3 years and ordered pizza from here tonight. Why didn't anybody tell me I was missing out on good pizza?!  I'm a crust person and it's delicious!  My son loves it and even he said it was good. I know where to buy pizza for now on. The staff is very friendly too."}
{"text":"Second time around Pizza was great!!! You just need to tell them how you want a vegan pizza!!! The owner and his family have some of the best customer service around:)"}
{"text":"I paid $18 for an extra large \"sticky fingers\" pizza. It was essentially elementary school cafeteria pizza."}
{"text":"Somehow we managed to get a supreme pizza with all of the toppings in the center of the pizza. Crust was good. Just looked like a store bought frozen pizza. I really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza though."}
{"text":"This pizza is not good, call Streets of New York. I called Mr. Jim's twice and both times I got a recording instead of a human and I always have to give my info. Pizza is greasy and has no flavor!"}
{"text":"I like all kinds of pizza, and each good pizza place in Vegas has their own unique style. I would have to put Mr Jim's up there as one of my Top 5 pizzas I've ever eaten. I ordered the Original Crust Sticky Fingers with the Garlic Parmesan crust. The crust was perfect. The right amount of crisp on the bottom, yet the middle dough layer had the perfect chewy consistency: not too thick (like a Chicago style) and not too thin (like a New York style).
Also, the toppings were full and loaded, and the sauce was tangy and plenty. I never felt the pizza became dry, even after it started to cool down when I got to my last slice. You get your money's worth. 

The prices were decent for non-chain pizza restaurants. My only gripe is I wish it had a dine-in section. The place is a take-out only. But I'm here to rate the pizza, not the dine-in experience. 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Something about this pizza keeps me coming back. The double cheese stuffed crust is a must. Also if you join their mailing list they will send you some good coupons."}
{"text":"It's a new place in our neighborhood, so my family and I thought we'd give it a go. The only satisfactory thing that came from this establishment was the quoted wait time. With that stated, I'll begin on the pizza; The crust tasted like cardboard, and the sausage tasted like it fell victim to freezer burn. 

The gentleman who took the order, although courteous, was remarkably slow, which is hard to believe  seeing as there were no other patrons inside. The very visible employees in the back were texting and drinking soda straight out of the 2-liter bottle while preparing the pizza we ordered. 

If the pizza had been good, those are things that could be overlooked. Unfortunately, it was awful, and my stepmother got sick from the very little that she ate. We weren't able to finish the pizza. Needless to say, neither my family or I, will ever go back."}
{"text":"First time order at Mr Jim's Pizza and I have to say it was great. The order was done on the phone and the call was fast, courteous and accurate. They repeated my order to make sure it was right and I didn't have to worry about it.

I ordered 10 pizzas from Mr Jim's Pizza and they were all great. We had a big get together of mostly teenagers (picky eaters) and the group loved the pizza. My order consisted of 4 Pepperoni Deluxe (lots of cheese and pepperoni), 2 Meat Eaters (tons of different meats like bacon, italian sausage, etc.), 2 extra cheese (I could have ordered more of these because they went fast), and 2 Jimaterian (really good vegetarian). 

All of the pizza's were hot and fresh and eaten really quickly. When I went to pick up my order all 10 pizzas were ready on time and the staff was very friendly. I paid for my order and was out in just 1-2 minutes. The location was convenient to where I live and the pizza shop had easy parking. I also noticed that the place was really clean inside and the kitchen was open for viewing and was kept in really good shape. Employees were also very clean.

My group loved the pizza's, the crust, the extra cheese and all of the toppings. In terms of comparing them to other pizza shops - better than Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Little Caesars, and Papa John's. 

Had an excellent experience."}
{"text":"This is a really tough review to write because some things went right and others went really wrong.  

I ordered 10 pizza's to be delivered to a park for my daughter's 2nd birthday party.  I first called a few days ahead to see what there prices and specials might be for that type of order.  When speaking to the person on the phone they said we could do $6 cheese or pep, or 7.99 3 topping pizza's.  I asked him other questions like size, how many slices, crust options, etc.  and he handled all of those really well.  then I asked if they could deliver to a park and he said he would have to call me back in a few to ask his manager.  Odd, why was there no manager on duty or present at all times.  He did call me back in a few moments and said it would be no issue.  

I decided the best way to order the pizza was to drive down there and place the order and pay for it a day ahead.  This is where it gets interesting.  I am glad I went down there but also not because of what else was happening on a Friday afternoon at the store.  There was one other person waiting for an order on a bench.  So I approached the counter and started to speaking to Alex about what I needed.  He was quick to help me.  I started placing the order and telling him I need  pizza's delivered Saturday o a park.  He said no problem.  When I was giving him my order he was quoting 7.99 one topping and not the $6 pizza price or the 7.99 in store was listed as $8.50 for 3 topping.  He stated they gave me the school pricing? which I was not???  Anyway's I continued with my 10 pizza order and said call me when you get the pricing fixed up and I will be happy to pay for it with my debit card.  Alex did not have the access or maybe the training to apply the discount for the previous quoted pricing.  

That's not all this poor kid Alex was trying to deal with me while one other young women was in the back cooking and making pizza's.  The phone was ringing off the hook 2-3 times. The women who was waiting for her order began being impatient for waiting 40+ minutes for a pickup order that was waiting in the hot box for who know's how long.  She was pretty upset and I am not sure she will be back.  All Alex could do and did do to every guest on the phone is appologize.   \"I'm sorry were really busy\" \"i'm sorry I don't know why she didn't give you your pizza from the hot box\" \"I'm sorry I don't know why they gave you the wrong price\" .... and on and on.  This poor kid was working by himself with mind you on a Friday afternoon when people are ready to get dinner.  All of this confusion made me unsure if my order would arrive on time or at all for my daughter's birthday.  Oh yeah the manager called me about 9:45 pm to get my credit card info because \"they have had problems with people not being present before at park locations\"...???

  Where on earth was the manager or owner for that matter.  How do they expect to operate a successful business with out being present.  I am sure they lost several hundred dollars that day because they did not have the restaurant staffed properly for a FRIDAY night pizza delivery business.  On top of that, all over the lobby were flyers stating that they will be closed for the Sabbath starting in May.  It's one thing to be proud of your beliefs and what you stand for but when you start promoting that throughout your business.  On your door, counters, and every pizza box top you have in the building.  I think it would be easier to just hire somebody to work that day for you and just take the day off Larry H.  Your weekend of Friday, Saturday and Sunday consists of probably 50% of your weekly revenue and to just eliminate an entire day seems absurd.  Unbelievable!  It would be interesting to read the Mr Jim's Franchise agreement to see if that is even allowed with out approval from  the corporate office. 

For the record we did get our order at the time requested of 12:30-12:45.  The Driver showed up right on time.  The food was fresh and hot and every pizza was made as ordered.  The ingredients were good and the cheese seemed to be of good quality.  D'lish crust was very tasty.  Everyone at the party thought the pizza was very tasty and were very impressed.  I only told them of the good things about the business and where it was located and you might have some new fans of MR. Jim's.

  Too bad you might have some operational issues to address with your scheduling and training.  I am willing to give you another try.  I would start by ensuring having a responsible manager on duty at all times.  These 20 year old kids are not gonna bring your business success."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be ordering from here again.
Opened the pizza box to find the pizza pulled apart (i did eat one slice from the top part that's missing a section).
Mediocre taste at best. 
Ordered a salad with cheese and peppers and all I got was a plastic container of iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"We've ordered pizza from here 3 times so far and will continue to do so. It's tasty, better than the big name chains. We like the D'Lish crust better than the D'Luxe and adding the garlic/parmesan to the crust is great! Our orders have been available for pickup just when they said it would be. Ordering online is easy and convenient. We frequently order extra sauce on pizzas (just to get more nutrition in!) but when you do that at Mr. Jim's they add some extra globs of sauce to the top of the pizza, kind of weird. We've had zero problems or serious complaints here."}
{"text":"We've ordered a couple times since the original review. Pizza is really just mediocre, probably wouldn't order again. 
Original review: Pizza was good. Much better than your average chain. Good sauce, generous toppings. 
Had the bbq chicken pizza with the thin crust. Was very good. Also had a couple original crust with generous cheese. Would have preferred a larger sausage crumble. 
Very excited that they're in our neighborhood. Couple glitches with the order including much longer than quoted wait but to be expected for a new restaurant. Would definitely choose this over the typical chains."}
{"text":"Great pizza and reasonably priced. Our neighbors had us over for a beer, pizza and a hockey game. They ordered the pizza from Mr. Jim's that we had never had before. Happy to hear that is was a local pizza place that delivers here in providence. This will probably be our new go to weekend pizza place as we usually have on a regular basis. Pizza is fresh and hot with quality toppings. Pepperoni is the family favorite and theirs is delicious. The young man who delivered it was very polite and thanked us for his tip. That was a first for me ever in all the years that I have had food delivered to the house. Big fan and look forward to lots of future pizzas being delivered for the family to enjoy on weekend visits. A night that I don't have to cook or clean is my favorite night."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Comes out hot and ready to go in your mouth! The crust is really good and they have all kinds of sizes to accommodate different types of hunger :)"}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE IN VEGAS! 

Mr. Jim's had the best pizza! The crust is fantastic, it is perfect, not too thick but not thin. It's true it's all in the crust! I used to eat my pizza to the crust, now I eat mine and my husbands! LOL The sauce is pleasant. Nothing too exciting. We always order the pepperoni deluxe. EXTRA pepperoni and EXTRA cheesy. It's great! Add garlic butter to the crust and it's perfect. They usually have coupons online or in their emails so the price is reasonable. Love the staff!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Generic
Just another place that sells pizza. Lots of youngsters, but nothing negative. Great colors on the walls.

Service: Sorry not sorry
I asked for no olives on my pizza, but they still put olives on my pizza. Disappointed. I was in a hurry, so I could not reorder. 

Food: Not bad!
Despite messing up my order, they pizza was not bad. Just your basic pizza shop. Nothing stuck out.

Summary: Pretty good, but not amazing.
The fact that they messed up my order ruined it. However, this is probably the only pizza joint in the northwest part of town, so stop by if you can!"}
{"text":"Better than the 3 major franchises, but only ok. Crust is doey and some meats have an unusual initial taste, could be the cheese.  Wings are ok too, but a little different. Great delivery service though."}
{"text":"I have eaten here since it has opened and Mr. Jims Pizza uses lots of topping.I enjoy the pizza, breadsticks and salads. When I want to get away from the greasy then I come to Mr. Jims."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequently take even walks a decided to stop at Mr. Jim's Centennial Hills to order a small pizza off the menu. It will take about 15 minutes. After 3 customers came, ordered and left with order (20 minutes) I asked how's my pizza coming. Response, one of our employees messed up and we are making another pizza. My thoughts,\" you are the only person here, which employee messed up?, How do you mess up a pizza, by selling it to someone else. 

Next question when did you know the pizza was going to be delayed?  by now it's been 30 minutes and \"the pizza will be right out\". Ten minutes later I'm ready to cancel my order and walk out when he says \"oh it's coming right out of the oven now\". 30 minutes for a pizza. I worked in a pizza place when I was in HS it doesn't take 35 minutes for a pizza. I get my order and mention when the order is delayed you should at least let the customer know, so you at least appear to be attentive, looks at me with that adolescent stare and mouth open and says \"sorry\".  Yes I'm not sorry I won't be coming back either. Then the delivery guy who had walked in a few minutes ago suggest a complementary chocolate chip cookie as compensation."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza. Not great pizza. Nothing really extraordinary about it. It's ok and if you want delivery in Providence area its about your only option. I prefer less saucy pizza but I will eat it from time to time. Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"The crust was super tasty but I couldn't get past the greasiness of the pizza overall. 
Delivery was prompt and friendly and the online ordering option was nice. We will order again but I will be soaking grease off with paper towels! Guess that's what makes it taste so good, right? ;)"}
{"text":"This was SUPER good pizza!! I was scared to try this place for a year based on the reviews and I'm glad I finally tried it. I HATE the national chain mass produced pizza places... Dominos, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, etc. 
My pizza tasted fresh and clean and not at all greasy. I got the original crust and I'm loving it!!!"}
{"text":"Mr. Jim's Pizza recently supported our Cub Scout pack meeting.  The pizza ready on time and delicious.  This business is a great member of the community!  Please support them with your business! Thanks Mr. Jim's Pizza!"}
{"text":"Mr Jims really has the best pizza. Always fresh, hot and very tasty. Mine and my daughters favorite. The people are very friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered thin crust extra crispy for delivery. The pizza was perfect. The delivery in great timing. So many pizza places can't seem to get extra crispy right without burning the pizza. Mr Jims did a great job."}
{"text":"Don't mind negative reviews, people always write about negative experiences but never about positive ones.
Pizza here was good! the crust was nice and golden, we ordered the sticky fingers pizza and my boyfriend really enjoyed all the toppings in it. The wings were descent size but a little dry on the hot sauce. 
Customer service was good and the driver was really nice too. The pizza got to our house right on time of what they had quoted us (35 mins) when we placed the order and everything was nice and hot!
Thanks mr.jims! This was our first order from here and definitely not the last :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza- their double pepperoni pizza is AMAZING. Better than the chain pizza places--- will order from you guys again soon"}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza , fantastic service, and all for a reasonable price! Try it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Bad service,however semi decent food. I waited for 15 minutes while my clerk sat on his phone in the back,then my pizza was soggy."}
{"text":"Realtors find things ....we find homes, imperfection , dreams and when we're not, we eat once in a while.I drive all over this silver state and sometimes things just fall into my lap.  Mr Jim's Pizza ...little challenging in the parking lot ( Providence Master Community)
The sauce does it for me ! And sometimes you find Larry and have delightful conversation ."}
{"text":"First and probably last time I will ever eat from here. Kinda feel bad for giving such a bad review but I'm utterly discussed by the experience I had. I had ordered the Sticky Fingers Pizza D'Luxe from the coupon I got online. Said it would be 15 minutes for my order to be ready. So I went there to pick it up (since I heard they charge for delivery). Once I had brought it home, I sat down to eat my pizza and as I was going to take my first bite...there was a HAIR IN MY PIZZA!!! And I know it wasn't my hair because it had came from inside. I was totally grossed out by this nasty long black hair. Threw the pizza away and was disgusted by the whole meal. My mom on the other hand said the pizza was very greasy and tasted like frozen pizza. Needless to say we will never go back there."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is horrible!  I called and admitted to a mistake made by my 14 year old daughter in ordering a pizza.  They admitted that the pizza had not been delivered to my home.  Instead of meeting me half way, an employee by the name of Parker came to the phone after putting me on hold and stated, \"the pizza is leaving the store now, and they were going to note my account as costing the company a lot of money, and would never deliver to my home again!\"  How rude!  I have spent a lot of money at this store, but it is obvious they are willing to lose a good customer over a misunderstanding.  Never in my life have I worked with a company who was unwilling to assist a customer to make sure everyone walks away satisfied.  Mr. Jim's need to retrain their employees immediately on how to treat customers!!!"}
{"text":"Very much like little Caesar's or digorno frozen pizza, tastes really plain, not at all like a real \"mom and pop\" pizza. Will definitely never order again :/"}
{"text":"Their pizza is good. I like that they're local to Providence so orders get to me quickly. Their website is NOT easy to use and I hate having to call in my order."}
{"text":"Mr Jim's Pizza is the best pizza I have ever had and I totally recommend it !! They also delivery super quick and the desserts are so good!!"}
{"text":"Convenient location and yummy pizza. Always have 20% off coupons. Haven't had any problems when picking up or getting my pizza delivered."}
{"text":"Probably in the top 5 best tasting pizzas I've had. My wife also said their gluten free crusts are one of the best as well. As far as the wings are concerned, the chicken was descent meat but not top quality, and the sauce was just slightly above average."}
{"text":"I just finished my meal from Mr Jims.  I order 2 d'lish pizza's even after I read the terrible reviews on here.  I thought to myself, why not try it.  It's cheap its 2 minutes from my home.  There were Hairs all over both of my pizza's. I was disgusted to keep pulling hair after hair from my mouth.   I threw over half of each pizza away.  The rest of my family lucked out but they did not eat as many slices as I did.   I tried to leave feedback on their website but it kept failing when I would send it.  The pizza is super cheap ingedients.  Even for $7 its not worth it especially for all the hair.  No joke  Believe all the bad reviews. I can confirm them personally now.   The crew was nice.   The food is subpar in everyway.  Word of mouth is gonna shut this place down."}
{"text":"I've only ordered this twice since moving here but it really is great. My son says it's his favorite pizza around. I love their wheat crust option and the food is always hot when delivered. I've not had to wonder where the order is and have been extremely satisfied with the pizzas. Their regular crust is phenomenal (I always steal some of my son's pizza) and their white sauce is delicious. I like that the website includes an option for the tip if you're paying with a card as well. We'll continue to order from this place regularly!"}
{"text":"I want to give a shout out to Taylor for her amazing customer service from the time she took our order to delivering our Jim Sticks.  All the service is wonderful and the Jim sticks are the best especially with garlic butter.  Thank you Crystal for letting me acknowledge her to you and we recommend your establishment to everyone."}
{"text":"MrJims.Pizza has never failed me! Love the chunk of meat and taste of their pizza! All other pizza place are shady with their ingredients. Love all the discounts you get m, especially military discount! You'll never be disappointed with this place. Wouldn't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"First time here at Jim's just moved to the area from the bay. I must say the staff is super friendly and the pizza for the price is excellent. After reading other reviews I was not sure but Jim's has my vote! Keep up the good work and I will definitely be back. Pepperoni pineapple=winning!"}
{"text":"Mr Jims has yet to let me down. Despite having wait times every now and then, the pizza is well worth the wait. The staff is also extremely friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. They have good specials and you can order online. The sticky fingers  is my favorite. You get good pizza, for the price you pay. I think they make better pies than the pizza chains like; pizza hut, dominoes, papa johns to name a few."}
{"text":"The pizza here is not too bad, a little above average, good toppings but the crust is probably frozen and not fresh.  Their nacho stix are expensive pieces of dry cardboard with cheese and jalapenos, nasty.  Don't bother with those.
  The lower rating is due to the fact that we had to wait over an hour for a pickup order.  This is the second time we have been delayed and is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!! I have ordered from here before and I'm actually their only review on another reviewing website that *advises* you =).  At any rate, ordered tonight because I like to support my neighbors (this is locally owned) and I didn't feel like cooking. My order included a $.60 dipping sauce. After the delivery driver left, I realized I didn't get that sauce. I called up there and talked to the manager, Ben.  I explained the situation and said that I didn't want the driver to come all the way back but could they just credit my account for the next time to which he replied \"It's only $.60...\" and just stopped talking.  My husband overheard this and grabbed the phone and said \"I just spent $40 of my hard earned money at your store and this is how you treat me?\" then Ben said \"if your going to talk to me that way I will hang up\". My husband then said \"Now I want the delivery guy to bring it here\" and the manager hung up on him.  I will most definitely NOT be ordering from here again and I have reposted reviews on the other websites as well. Boo!!"}
{"text":"I was hoping that I would not have to write a bad review.  I am a regular Mr. Jim's customer, I like their food, and I have never had a problem with their establishment.  Until today. Short version: Mr. Jim's messed up on an order, a bad review was posted, and an uncalled for response full of assumptions, untruths, and excuses was posted in response.  Long version: My friend placed an order for our group and my husband picked it up on his way home. The pizza's were handed to him and he left.  He didn't know that wings had been ordered as well.  My friend called to get his wings and Mr. Jim's could not fix the situation.  So I did. I picked up the wings and everything was fine.  Until I read the response that Mr. Jim's posted to John's review. Please feel free to look it up. 

TO MR JIM'S PIZZA: 
1) My husband's initials are not A.L. Neither are mine.  I do not know where you pulled that from or why that would even be necessary to include in your response. 2) It doesn't matter who picks up the order, you should always double check it even if it is not a \"regular order.\" 3) In your response you say that John admitted he had been drinking...my friend had consumed two beers. You made it sound like he was a raging drunk. He's just responsible and didn't think that it appropriate to drive to fix your mistake. Again, relevant to your response why?! 4)Pick up order or not, if you messed it up you should have fixed it.  You later state that, \"You suppose you could have offered to deliver them.\" You suppose?! Of course you could have.  Then this whole mess and second one star review could have been avoided.  A simple, \"I'm sorry sir, I'll make a fresh batch to send with the next available driver,\" and everyone would have been happy. We would have been willing to wait an hour if you would have been willing to fix what you messed up. We understand busy business. We do not understand bad customer service. 5) I was annoyed at the situation. NOT my friend.  You both should have handled it differently.  I did say that he might have had a bad day. I did say I had not heard him speak bluntly to someone like that.  Does that justify your bad customer service? NO.  Is that an excuse to claim extortion on a yelp review? NO. You were correct in stating that I left without saying anything to the MEN in my group. They would not have been agreeable to me fixing what you should have.  6) John is a UNLV graduate and employee.  I shared that information with you so that you would know that he was both educated and is surrounded by and works with people that are also educated as well as respectful.  Of course he most definitely is used to people being respectful because we surround ourselves with other educated and respectful people. I did not call him a \"big shot\" thank you very much sir. Nor was his position used as any kind of leverage. Yet again...what does this have to do with your lack of customer service?! 7) I appreciated the apology and the brownie was delicious.  I fixed your mess up, including your lack of customer service, and accepted your apology and the proffered brownie.  Why did you feel the need to go onto a public forum and belittle your regular customers?  You have several negative reviews. It's my firm opinion that if you spent half as much time developing customer service skills as you apparently spend defending why you have no customer service, your reviews would improve! 8) We actually do yelp positive reviews to businesses frequently... when a business offers outstanding customer service.  We enjoy your pizza but there has been nothing about the service that has gone above and beyond the normal expected level to warrant going on an writing a glowing review.  9) My final comment here...why in the world would you think that throwing out your education would make this situation any better?  You had a second chance to make this right and instead you have dug a deeper hole AND manage to turn away another regular customer.  I'm deeply saddened by your reactions, I expected more from a business that seemed to have so much more to offer in the early operating stages.  Thank you for your time.  I sincerely hope that you can turn things around for your business and start focusing on customer service, kindness and consideration, and on appropriately fixing your negative reviews instead of childishly lashing out at loyal customers. 

Sincerely, 
M.N aka A.L"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty darn good. They have fast delivery and the prices are good.  It is nice because they are so close to my house. I would order from them again."}
{"text":"I like their pizza. It's just the right thickness for my taste. They aren't skimpy on the toppings or cheese; however they don't overdo it either. I could do without the attitude that one of their male employees gives over the phone, but everyone else seems nice so I'll let it slide. I do wish there was an eat in area though."}
{"text":"At first, I thought the pizza was just a bit better than okay, but my kids all LOVED it! Then I realized that the prices for the D'Lish pizza was even cheaper than Pizza Hut, so I started liking it more. 
My wife and I now enjoy their D'Luxe pizza with thicker crust and double toppings which is extra-specially good (and still reasonably priced) so we've continued to order on a near weekly basis.

We've also tried the Nacho Stix, Sticky Fingers pizza, and more! Everything is really, really good!
OH, then you have the service: Everyone we've encountered in the store has been extra friendly and helpful. Always a pleasant experience!

Months later, the kids are still loving Mr. Jim's. The prices are still reasonable. PLUS, they're located in Providence, so we don't have to travel far, deal with traffic, or otherwise. Win-Win for everyone!


One other thing: You can use an \"app\" called Level Up to pay, which gives you $2 off your order. A nice little treat for those with \"smart phones\". Of course, all the regular ways to pay (cash, credit card) still work."}
{"text":"Mr. Jims is a great carry out or delivery pizza shop. The staff is friendly and courteous. I love the pizza here! Both the thicker and thin crust options are delicious because the crust is just the right chewiness. Pricing is a bit more than the mass production pizza joints, but the quality and taste are totally worth it. Similarly, the wait is a tad longer, but they don't premake it wherr you buy it from a heat cabinet. This is fresh made and it's delicious!! My personal favorites are the sticky fingers and nacho sticks. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from this store.  I've enjoyed their pizza multiple times in the past, but they have grown faster than their management could handle.  The employees were rude taking the order then didn't deliver our order of chicken wings.  When I called back they said it was  \"on top of their stove\" and said that it was totally their fault for not including it with our order. 

What blows me away is that despite acknowledging it was their fault, they said they couldn't spare a delivery driver to bring it to us.  Unreal.  We paid for it.  They didn't give it to us.  Real businesses fix their mistakes.  The manager said it was my fault for not checking the order thoroughly before paying.  Perhaps, it was...but who does this?  This is a new business.  They used to be good, but they simply aren't anymore.

Please, spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area so of course I had to find some good pizza. So I ordered pizza delivery from Mr. Jim's. The order got to me pretty fast. Even my sons who are usually impatient commented on how fast the food arrived. The pizza was piping hot and fresh. I chose to have the special garlic butter crust which was ahhhhhhmazing. The wings were just ok. The kids really liked the cookie pie. We will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is alright, nothing amazing, but as it is the only pizza place in this area, I can see how people would frequent it.

First off, the pizza is small. Very small. And it is mostly crust, with a few bites of the cheesy bits.

Next, it is pretty darn pricey for what you get. For the same amount I could get a pizza twice as large at any of the other places down the street. 

It's alright, but I would rather make the 3 minute drive to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Mr Jim's Pizza in Providence! Best pizza in Vegas! Don't skimp on the Sauce, Cheese, or Meat! Great customer service too! Most definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Right by my house and so tasty. We always get the pepperoni deluxe and it's always delicious and fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Mr. Jim's Pizza is great for me because they offer gluten free pizzas. I don't have Celiac disease but I'm very sensitive to gluten and I've always felt fine after eating this pizza. The crust is one of the best gf crusts out there. Thank you for offering delicious gf options. We did order this pizza for delivery and once we got a regular crust instead so have to be careful on that."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Their wings are some of worst I have eaten. Not cooked all the way through and just oily."}
{"text":"The pizza here is among the best in Vegas. It's centered in the Providence area (NW side). Delivery is often faster than fast. My wife and I are frequent customers. Employees have always been kind to me. Prices are fair. Open M-Sat. 10-10. They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Good pizza, even better with garlic parmesan crust because it was like a breadstick. Ordered pepperoni deluxe and was happy with the amount extra pepperonis and cheese. Definitely a thick and heavy slice of pizza that fills you up. Customer service was friendly and good. Only downed a star because of some wicked heartburn my husband and I experienced."}
{"text":"I actually pretty surprised by how horrible the ratings are. We LOVE this pizza and so has everyone that has eaten it with us. We live in the area and get coupons.... We decided to give it a try and actually REALLY enjoy the crust. There was one pizza we asked for pepperoni and bacon..... The bacon was shopped so finely and PACKED with flavor. 
I've never had a bad experience!
We will continue to order from here. 
Never had an issue with staff.....although I could see where people placing pick up orders have some issues...we just haven't. Might just order one today actually......."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on Yelp and I almost didn't give this place a try, but I figured since its close and new to me, I wouldn't judge till I tried it. 
Honestly, I wouldn't say the pizza was gross or disgusting by any means. It was just okay... Some reviews mention how it tasted like frozen store bought pizza. I'd say that is very accurate. It wasn't gross, just didn't seem fresh. The crust had to be frozen before they made it. 
DO NOT get the chicken wings, I ate 1 and was finished. They taste just like those frozen chicken wings you get from the freezer section at Walmart. No Bueno!"}
