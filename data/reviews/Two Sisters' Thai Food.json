{"text":"This restaurant has growing pains..  The restaurant was clean and colorful.  The kitchen sits in the middle of the restaurant and the aromas are everywhere.. I ordered spring rolls as an appetizer.  They appeared on the bill but not on the table. I like my dinner spicy.. \"Thai hot\".. My phad  thai came with no spices and I should have sent it back.. I've eaten in many Thai restaurants and don't hesitate to ask for the spice rack to give my dinner more kick.. Every spice rack has always included thai peppers in fish sauce but for some reason this was missing..  The scallions in the phad  thai were almost non-existent too.  My dining companion ordered curry that was overly sweet and scant on the meat.  I may go back but not really anytime soon.."}
{"text":"Authentic Thailand in your bowl. This is not only the best and most authentic Thai food I've discovered here in the Valley, but it is very affordable, the quantities are great and the two sisters who own and operate this restaurant (thus the name) are exceedingly nice, helpful and friendly. I come here every two weeks when I'm across the street getting my scooter serviced. So happy I discovered it. It is one of the few places where you can truly get extra Thai hot, if desired. I love the vegetable tom yum. You have to check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The food is still very good - as described by others - but something has happened in the year or so we've been coming here.....the one sister who is left keeps losing staff, and each time we go, the service is worse.....totally disorganized, you have to ask repeatedly for everything - to order, for utensils, for sauce, for water, for the check!   It makes me sad to have to say it -but good food or not, it's getting awfully frustrating to go here!"}
{"text":"I've tried them all.....ALL of them.  Two Sisters is the absolute best from appetizer to soup to entree to dessert.  It is the cleanest in this city including Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese spots.  They do the cooking where you can watch what is happening!  I love this little place."}
{"text":"Lovely place and friendly service. Good was quick and hot..very tasty and good flavor.  We ran  in and got to go meal and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. We will be back and sit down for a real meal. This place came recommended and well worth it."}
{"text":"My Massaman Curry tasted like peanut paste, I couldn't tell if there was any coconut milk in it at all. It was just poor quality in my opinion."}
{"text":"I found this place while hungry ad driving down Cave creek road. I ordered the Pad Thai for lunch.... Fantastic!"}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner on a Tuesday night...we were the only customer in there. Eggroll for appetizer was delicious. The BBQ Thai chicken was delicious but the yellow chicken curry was alright. I still think the Thai Basil in Tempe has the best yellow curry...even the other Thai Basil location doesn't have it the same. Anyway, going back to Two Sister's, the service was good, the food is good but lacking an authentic Thai ambience."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The spring rolls and the panang curry were delicious.  Very nice service.  Will definitely go back.  More simple decore - not fancy but the food more than makes up for it!  Recommended."}
{"text":"Two Sisters is so close to home I could walk there. I drive by it twice a day and have wanted to give it a try for a while. Last night I finally did. The prices are right in line with other nearby Thai places and the food is as good or better. I agree with most reviewers - the egg roll is amazing. I was dunking it in the sweet and sour and scorching the inside of my mouth (and I swear I saw smoke) and didn't stop until it was gone - and I have a doctorate. Also ordered the basil fried rice and pad see ew, both with chicken at a level 3. They were hot in a different way, a supremely delicious way. I called in our order just after 8 and it was ready in a flash. I highly recommend Two Sisters. Apparently they also aced the health inspection. We'll be back soon. Who knows, we may even walk next time."}
{"text":"Dinner for two, dining in: Fresh Rolls with shrimp for appetizer (adding shrimp $3, not so sure was worth it for 4 smallish pieces, but the rolls were fresh and tasty), pork satay (yum!), massaman curry. All very good.  The atmosphere was a bit awkward at best, but not enough to stop me from going back.  Excited to have a solid Thai food option nearby!"}
{"text":"Massaman curry, Pad Thai, BBQ Chicken and Thai iced tea are all favorites and all were delicious.  We went about 7:30 in the evening and there were few other diners.  The food was prepared in the nearby kitchen and brought to the table piping hot and ready to go.  I generally skip dessert, but the waiter mentioned that mangos were in season and that Mango Sticky Rice was available.  It was the perfect finish to a wonderful meal.  There was plenty left over, so will have a wonderful lunch today!  Highly recommended gem of a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  1-5 hot.  3 is medium, 4 - is just enough you make you sweat.  BYOB is also a plus. No cork fee.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best Thai food that I have ever eaten.  Great lunch specials and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Very good!!!!!   Yellow curry, steamed veggies, and veggie fried rice = all tasty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent and sweet ladies.  Wife is gluten free and so far so good.  Pad Thai was recommended and delicious"}
{"text":"The worst thai food I have ever had! Save your money.. I was excited that they are  aware of gluten free but the food was not good. The pad thai noodles were one big gelatinous pile really not edible, spring rolls were ok but in my to go order they didn't give me any sauce, the chicken in curry was dry & overcooked. This was waste of $30!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!    Came here last weekend on a Sunday night and didn't realize they were closing for the evening.  The owner opened the door and said to please come in with such sincerity.   We ended up deciding to stay and are so glad we did!   Got their egg rolls, Thai tea, massaman curry and fried rice.  It was all delicious!   Going back tonight :)"}
{"text":"Was driving pass, saw this thai restaurant. And its happen to be dinner time. The place was nice and neat. We ordered green curry and pad won sen. Though im not a spicy food guy. But the green curry was great. If you want it more spicy, let the chef know when ordering. It's simply great food !!!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night and it was completely empty when we arrived at 7 PM.   Food was about average thai - we ordered a fresh roll, thai basil rice, egg fried rice, bbq chicken and sweet and sour chicken.  The peanut sauce for the fresh role was impressive while everything else was pretty average.  I'd like to have seen more than onions and tomatoes in the fried rices.   Good prices though.   The waiter left a little something to be desired as he was not overly friendly.  The layout of the restaurant is odd and feels incomplete as if they never finished the remodel.  Decent for a quick bite but probably won't do again for a restaurant feel."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!   We have enjoyed everything we've ordered.  They were also very accommodating around my son's allergies."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. The pad see ew and the soups are my favorite. Also, probably the best egg roll I've ever had."}
{"text":"This little joint is a big GEM. The fresh rolls and peanut sauce were wonderful. We had the Panang Curry and Pad Thai, both were awesome. Normally restaurants chinch on the meats but I had so much chicken breast meat it brought a smile to my face and the Pad had Shrimp and Chicken!!! In a strip center, kinda bare interior but the staff rocks and the food is off the hook!!! Do yourself a favor and try Two Sisters!!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken saute. Food was pretty good . Place didn't look fancy but not bad. Would come back. Have 4 star cuz it's not the best Thai food I've had."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time I thought the food was very very good. Had the greatest flavor to it. I had some kind of noodle dish can't remember the name of it and eggrolls both were delicious I would've given it another star except the service was so very slow.  person I was with went there also for the first time. He raved about it and wants to go back. So if they could only work on speeding up their service they'd be all set. That wouldn't stop me from going back though"}
{"text":"We have eaten in and taken out several times.  The owners are very friendly.  While we were waiting for take out one night, they gave our daughter an appetizer to curb her hunger.  It was so good, we had to take some to go!  Each time we have been there, the food has been excellent.  Last night's Tom Ka Gai was delicious!"}
{"text":"we had a wonderful first experience at 2 Sisters Thai Food. My hubby and I went last night 12/2/13 and totally enjoyed dinner. The Thai Tea was awesome! The meal was fantastic. The place is clean. We met the manager and had a great experience. The Spring Rolls were the best I've had. I ordered the Ginger Chicken and it was wonderful. Portions are a good size, and pricing was fairly decent $8.99 for the plate. We will be returning and possibly bring more family members with us. They also have filtered water, so a lemon is not needed to make the water drinkable. They have a lunch special of $6.99, dine in or to go."}
{"text":"The hubs and I are ardent fans of Thai cuisine so decided to hit up this place on a Friday night. Called in to book a reservation but was told that wasn't necessary as they wouldn't be super packed anyway. I probably should've picked up my cue on that but decided to head up there anyway since it's got amazing reviews on yelp.  The place was empty on a Friday night with just one table occupied in that tiny setting. Right from 830pm to 930pm and the place closes at 10pm. This was strange since the place got such raves here on yelp. We started off with the chicken satay and egg rolls. The satay was dredged in oil and turmeric(being a South Indian I'd still say that's so overpowering) and wasn't in the traditional skewer fashion. Minus one for that. And the peanut sauce that it came with was just a clumpy mess not even dippable. A total disappointment. The egg rolls just had some strange piping hot lettuce filling with absolutely no flavor. I'd prefer a Panda Express roll to this.  For the main course we ordered the massaman curry with chicken which came with rice and the pad woon sen. The massaman curry was more on the thinner side but had good flavor. However the chicken pieces tasted really old and I couldn't take more than a bite of it. The pad woon sen which is the silver noodle was the worst of all. The pad woon sen comes with chicken, shrimp and egg in the noodles. It was loaded with the stale chicken but not even a single piece of egg or shrimp. What's up with that sisters? And all the food came with absolutely no garnish or presentation. Direct from pan to plate to the customer. The lackadaisical approach to food and presentation is definitely a turn off. If I preferred food with no art, presentation and staleness for $40 I'd probably be able to buy on an upside of 20 + frozen dinners and maybe the meat would still taste fresh. Overall one of our most horrible experiences in terms of food. I'd rate it just one star if I could but the server was super friendly and attentive so an extra star for that! This place would be in our never to go list!"}
{"text":"Someone recommended we stop by and try Two Sister's Thai food.     We stopped in and had a wonderful dining experience.  The Thai food itself was the best I have ever had.  The Pad Thai and Drunken noodles were fantastic.  The Masuman curry was truly amazing.    Apparently everything is made from scratch.     The service was warm, friendly and efficient.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"Yum....the people so nice and spotlessly clean.  I had the thai chicken noodle soup and it was fabulous.  Huge portion loaded with stuff. My sister had the green curry and loved it."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE the yellow curry! Delicious spring rolls as well. My husband ordered the masmasa curry and really liked it. Service is fast and friendly.  We will be regulars."}
{"text":"I loved my dish the 2 times I have been there.  My other guest liked it once and the other time probably gave it 3 or 4 out of 5.  Staff was very nice.  I thought they made a good effort to work for our business."}
{"text":"The beef was actually cut steak!!! Awesome surprise. Normally you go to a place and they have that pre cut meat that is pretty generic but this place had fresh everything. Definitely a good experience. I came over to the restaurant from a recommendation of another local shop near here... If I am ever around I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Top notch, no complains here. The food was fresh, tasty, with large portions. The service was warm and inviting. I love seeing family owned restaurants. They cook from their experiences and from the heart.  Also, the water is great. Better than spring water! You can taste the difference in the food. My new favorite Thai place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've found that the best way to judge Thai restaurants (at least on the first visit) is by their Pad Thai, it's a simple dish. I read the good reviews of this place on Yelp and went in with high expectations. Unfortunately the Pad Thai was just awful and their curry was watery and only mediocre. Case in point, I've added a pic of what they call Pad Thai. Not coming back here.."}
{"text":"This restaurant in a quiet commercial section of eastern Moon Valley is one of my preferred Asian eateries. The staff makes you feel like you are a guest dining at their home, and you know from the flavors of the food that they use high quality ingredients and prepare the dishes with care. The place is larger and more spacious than it would seem from outside; interior is clean, plain and very basic - which is the case for a lot of establishments where it's all about the food - and wifi is available."}
{"text":"Thom Kha was good but I asked for medium spicy and it was not spicy at all.  The decor is strange. Old and drab.   I asked for two egg rolls and she gave me an order.  It was NOT cheap for what I got. A soup, a chicken curry and an order of egg rolls for 28 dollars.  Haven't tried the curry or egg rolls yet but I know I would never sit in there and eat.   Old carpet, cheap tables, smelled like fragrance soap."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to stop by and try out this new restaurant and finally did tonight. I will admit we were a little concerned when we saw no one else was there but so glad we decided to eat here. I love Thai food and this met all my expectations and then some. The sisters are so kind. The boys even liked it. I hope more people come in here. They deserve the success :D"}
{"text":"My visit was during lunch. There were four tables dining and the waiter was not on his \"A\" game, nor was the restaurant. My party had two people dining and we ordered as follows, Thai Iced Tea. Over sweet, but perhaps an American way of serving it.  We ordered a satay and it was not threaded onto bamboo sticks and grilled as a traditional Thai would prepare the order. No, it was flat top grilled and thus did not part any flavors of the marinade and it was rather dry and boring. I live in Thailand, speak Thai and enjoy dining on Thai everyday. I ordered a yellow curry with pork and asked the waiter to have the \"Chef\"...as I kept hearing him call the cook., make my food just like as if you were in Thailand and your Mother was eating it. Well my meal was served without care and no follow up, Upon tasting the dish it was flavored with black pepper and no Thai chili's. The black pepper was used in an  excessive amount making the black pepper a star and my dish horrible.  My table mate ordered Green Curry with Chicken, which he got but it was flavored with an overpowering salt taste. We finished our Thai Iced teas and left our food in disgust. I told the Waiter the issue with the food and then the Owner and the \"Chef\". I was told I was mistaken.....that their meals were prepared correctly. I suggested that the \"Chef\" recheck the items and was told again I was ignorant at best. They had us pay for the meals, but that was the best part....paying so we could go elsewhere to dine. I would never step foot into their restaurant again and I will continue to blog them to steer fans of Thai food to another location to experience Thai Cuisine. Avoid this restaurant at all costs.."}
{"text":"WOW - if we could, we would eat here every day!!  Darn - work intervenes (grumble).  Awesome lunch specials, espec recommend the curries (all 5, of which they have one each day on the special board) !   The soups are great too, and the spring rolls are fresh, crisp, not greasy....just as you'd want them!   The sisters are lovely, and the service is always prompt and provided with extra smiles but not 'hovering'.  Restaurant seems spotlessly clean.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity provided.  We are regular customers now and hope others will continue to support them too!"}
{"text":"Bummer Update: had to change this from 5 stars to 3 stars unfortunately. I'm totally bummed because I wanted this place to be my new \"go to\" in Moon Valley. I have been here probably 10 times now and the first 3-5 times were excellent but something changed and the next 4-5 times were progressively worse. Each time I kept saying, \"maybe it was just an off night.\"  I've been getting the Pad See Ew after tasting my sister's but each time I've gotten it has been really dry. My wife has been getting the Massaman Curry and this latest pick up order was completely watery. Our last visit before this one we brought some friends and it was a disappointment then too unfortunately. They ran out of the correct noodles for the Pad See Ew for our friend so they used completely different noodles and didn't make mention of it until we said something. At which point they admitted to running out of the original one but didn't offer anything beyond that.   My only thoughts are that maybe one sister is a better cook than the other or that because they cook everything to order, they're not consistent. Regardless neither option really works for us.   We may give it one more shot before giving up but based on the last few experiences we're about to call it a bummer loss for us.   At the very least, the service is still nice though (except for maybe the time they gave our friend the wrong noodles)."}
{"text":"I've heard about Two Sisters' Thai Food for a while now - figured it was time to get over and check them out.  We started with the Sate appetizer (Chicken) - check the pic - it looked different than any Sate I've had before, but it tasted really good (and yes, it came with peanut sauce, I just didn't get it in the pic).  The Panang (beef) was also very tasty.  Since it was my first time, I ordered the spice level at 3 and a half (on a scale of 5, with 5 being 'Thai Hot') - I used to order a 4 the first time, but La Thai in Scottsdale cured me of that ;-) (yeah, it's really good, but wow!)  Anyway, Two Sisters' Thai is worth stopping in and grabbing a bite!"}
{"text":"After watching Multi Awarding Winning Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown in Northern Thailand I got the Impression that most Thai Food we eat is Americanized. I recall him saying on the show something like, \"Your not going to see your Pad Thai or Green Curry here!\"  Last time I was here  I had the Thai-Lao Chicken Curry uniquely flavored with Lao Basil and Dill. I remember the waitress told me that this was a dish that they DO EAT in Thailand.   This place isn't average.  This time we started with an egg roll. It was different and stuffed with a lot of fresh grated carrot and a little chicken. The dipping sauce was sweet and also spicy.  I had the Esan Style Red Curry with Chicken. Esan Style is made without Coconut Milk. I thought it was delicious. I haven't noticed this dish offered at other Thai Restaurants in the area.   They offer different styles of Thai here including Americanized.  The Take Out Menu has descriptions of the food and easier to order from than the menu you get seated with.  They offer brown rice but it's a half hour wait.  They have a Spectra water system that makes all their water like spring water and they say their food taste better and is healthier because of it.  The restaurant has Grade \"A\" Maricopa Health Inspections posted.  The Food make you feel like taking a trip to Thailand!"}
{"text":"love this place  Couldn't be happier to have found this place! The owner Is the sweetest lady and cooks the food herself. If you want spicy- you get spicy! If you want mild- you get mild! Or anything in between! Lunch was less than $10 and it came with delicious soup and egg rolls! DEFINITELY THE NEW PLACE TO GO FOR THAI!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about! Not sure why most Asian places I go are more cafeteria or kitchen style! Would love to see more trendy spendy and dining places!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and give this place a try.  They could be more hospitable to say the least number 1; the selection of food for their lunch menu was several choices unlike the competition of various other Thai Restaurants.  Having had the opportunity to explore Thai cuisine in other parts of the country, this is as close to the real deal as it comes.  I wish I had stopped by their place earlier but thank goodness it will be a regular.  Congratulations on your restaurant!"}
{"text":"Their website says they are closed, but still accepting \"to-go\" orders.   I call. Phone answered and immediately hung up.  I give them the benefit of the doubt, call again.  Staff person \"Hello, Two Sisters' Thai Food,\" Me: \"Hi, I would like to place a to-go order\" Staff \"Oh, sorry, we're closed. We're not taking any orders.\" Me: \"On your website it says you are open to to-go orders, is that no longer correct?\" Staff \"Oh no, not anymore. We don't take orders or make anything.\"  Guessing they are out of business, but not sure why they are still answering the phone?"}
{"text":"Went with the family and wasn't disappointed. Food was delicious, especially the curries and noodle dishes. Only complaint was that the beef needed to be sliced thinner and not overcooked. Seasoning was complex and not too hot.  Was quite surprised to find out that the Two Sisters are both out of town at the present and the cooking was being done by one of the servers. She did a great job with the owners' recipes, and I can't wait to go back when the Sisters are back in the kitchen. Server was very pleasant and helpful. Ambiance is simple and clean but, in my opinion, they should lose the Thai dancer video going in the background. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"My partner has to have gluten free foods and my two sister's has plenty of choices. We tried the BBQ beef , the ginger chicken and the lard na. All three were very good.  The place was clean and the service good. Prices range from $8.99 to $12.99 I\" ll be back soon,"}
{"text":"I was in the area and saw on the Yelp app that Two Sisters' Thai Food was near by. So I stopped in to check them out, I always get Pad Thai as my measure of what a Thai restaurant can do. My Pad Thai was good and came with chicken and shrimp; it was on point as far a flavor was concerned the noodles could have been a bit more al dente for my taste but rice noodles can be tricky. My husband ordered the Basil rice and it was perfect great flavor and nice pieces of sliced chicken.  This time we ordered to go but next time I will order for dining area since it had a nice vibe to it. While waiting on my order I noticed that they offer a nice weekly rotating lunch special that offers 3 different Entrees each day of the week; including an Egg roll or Spring roll and a small bowl of the soup of the day for $7.99 10:30-2:30."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, authentic, fresh, and wonderful personal service. One of my favorite Thai places in America"}
{"text":"Had take out for the first time here.  Good pad thai, excellent satay, good soup.    I will be back."}
{"text":"We were really hoping by the reviews this was going to be a home run for some tasty thai food. However, I would say it was just average. I was able to enjoy my order. My girlfriend had to go eat elsewhere due to her dinner was bad. I was starving and I even thought her food was prepared wrong w/ a bad taste. However the manager didn't charge for that meal and was nice about it. So, with that said.. they deserve a 3 star review. Work on the food and we might try it again. Maybe."}
{"text":"I was in town for some work and ran across this restaurant. I was just killing some time and didn't want to spend too much, so I just went with the lunch special - Tom Kha Gai soup, spring roll and vegetable stir fry. It was delicious. I wish I lived here and could visit more often! Fresh ingredients, great service and that soup. I would eat that soup as a meal by itself. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times. The pad Thai is always a smidge dry. I recommend getting it a little saucier. The shrimp are huge in it! The curries are great. The homemade spring rolls are fantastic.   Good place in a random strip mall."}
{"text":"Very authentic. Great flavors as well as selection. Mom and pop atmosphere. Loved it."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place!  The food is great: fresh, full of flavor, and genuine Thai.  The service is also good....  Just need better lighting in the restaurant.  The florescent lighting is a bit of a mood killer."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. My girlfriend started feeling a little under the weather right before we ordered and the nice ladies that own the place made her a special ginger garlic chicken and rice soup. Best thing off the menu!!! They also brought out hot tea. Nice!  Now best thing on the menu was the yellow curry chicken. Incredible!"}
{"text":"I just love their thai chicken basil fried rice and thai iced tea!! Very neat and pleasent place for having food!!"}
{"text":"This is as good as Thai gets.  We ordered soup, a curry stew, pad tai, and a fresh vegetable appetizer.  I personally wished I could jump into the soup, swim around, and drink until I exploded.  It was that good.  If ONLY we could have expanding stomachs for special occasions. Thai tea was perfect and the food was beyond delicious.  For a fun day, shop at the Humane Society thrift store, then stop for lunch just a 1/2 block down at Two Sisters' Thai Food.  I will be back often."}
{"text":"Bad, tacky customer service skills. Pad Thai very sticky, very soft noodles and very bland. Egg rolls fell apart as soon as I dipped in the sauce, but the sauce very good. I'm not sure about the décor... black chairs, black table cloth, candles??? Better off just to go to Reign of Thai on Thunderbird and Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Great Thai iced tea.  Had the beef noodle soup; pretty good and lots of food. The papaya salad, Esan style, was my favorite. Truly the most authentic papaya salad in a restaurant I've had since my trip to Thailand.  Very high quality fish sauce and flavor."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the atmosphere was bizarre. They had curtains between two rooms with random stuff everywhere.  It was scary I felt like I was in a haunted house.  I might come back but strictly for take out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time ever.  Their lunch menu was pretty standard (entree, spring roll, and soup) for $7. HOWEVER for each day you only have three choices! We literally went on the worst day ever (Thursday) where there was nothing of the three entrees that we wanted. The other days of the week looked pretty good though.    We ended up ordering the Pad See Ew and the Pad Thai off the main menu. My biggest gripe about these two were that they did not offer beef with it, just chicken, pork or shrimp. Both dishes tasted fresh as they were made immediately after we ordered, so that's a plus.  The pad thai had good flavor but it seemed mostly ketchup based.  I was not impressed with the pad see ew at all - the texture of the noodles was mushy and were very bland.  The broccoli was seasoned well and was the one redeeming quality about it.  Probably not a restaurant we would return to again -- although the staff was very friendly, attentive, and constantly refilling our water, the food was not worth it IMO."}
{"text":"Very good hot fresh Thai dishes and friendly ladies to serve you. They have special filtered water and that is a plus. Lots of things to try on the menu as I always test a new Thai place by their Pad Thai. Very good - ordered \"3\"spicy and it was just right. Next time I'll try another noodle dish and some soup. Sure, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious mmmm and the service was excellent. Def recommend if you're in the mood for something yummy for your tummy!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to order dinner to go on a Saturday at 630 and I was surprised to see I was the only one there. I had the fresh rolls and egg fried rice with chicken. The fresh rolls were fairly similar to Vietnamese spring rolls and were really delicious. They had avocado in them which was a nice addition. The rice was so good!! I had two small plates tonight and still have plenty for dinner tomorrow."}
{"text":"Two Sisters' Thai now appears to be under new ownership/management. Our most recent to-go order of pad thai and curry was mediocre at best and quite disappointing. The dining room is much upgraded over our previous visit, which is good, but I'm afraid the customer service problems remain.  The new owner doesn't seem to have much experience running a restaurant, so for what it's worth I like to offer him the following advice:  Don't attempt to joke around with customers you don't know.  Don't talk politics or anything else controversial with customers, unless they initiate it.  Keep your voice down, as in such a small space, there's no need to yell orders and instructions to the kitchen. and Try to look at your interactions with customers from their perspective, and you may come away with a different view of yourself and your business."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good service. Very clean Plan on returning every week"}
{"text":"I went here last night and got the panang curry, veggie spring rolls and a thai iced tea. Everything was so delicious!!! I got a level 3 on the panang curry and it was pretty spicy but very delicious, so if you don't like spicy make sure to get a 1 or a 2. The sauce that comes with the spring rolls is sweet and spicy and so yummy! I also highly recommend the thai iced tea.  The service was great as well, it's a nice little family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The best thai food in Arizona! Everything is made to order and very fresh. The owner is the sweetest woman and always comes to say hi before cooking the food. I always get the fresh rolls and the stir fry with chicken and brown rice. It's healthy and absolutely delicious. The portions are also very large. I always share a dish with my mom. Highly recommend!! I also love that the water is filtered."}
{"text":"We 'accidentially' landed in Two Sisters Thai Food for lunch. What an awesome find!!!  Their lunch special consists of a curry, a noodle or rice dish and a vegetarian dish. Each come with soup, an egg or spring roll. The waiter asked these two white girls how hot and we both took a 5!!!  He assured us it wasn't too spicy and he was right!!  We both had the yellow chicken curry and it was the most flavorable curry I've ever had. Grateful it's just down the street, we plan to make this at least a weekly lunch stop if not more. They've only been open a little more than a month, I'd say the prior reviews were just experiencing some growing pains.  Give it another try, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Yes they cook everything when you order it. Better than a buffet. This is a real sit down restaurant. It takes time to make."}
{"text":"This is the first bad review I have ever written, however I was so disappointed that I was compelled to write this...I ordered spicy fried rice with shrimp.  The shrimp was fishy tasting and undercooked, the rice was not spicy and bland, the few veggies in it were not fresh...I'm not a picky eater but this was BAD!  I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Best Curry chicken that I have had.  We had the lunch special and everything about it was superb...the price, the soup, the amount.  Can't wait to go back for lunch.  Even the coffee was yummy."}
{"text":"My wife each had their Panang Curry for lunch today.  She went with the mild spice and I selected their moderate spice #3.  The taste of the meal was great and the spice was awesome.  We also had one of their soups and it was awesome.  The spring roll was very tasty."}
{"text":"Simple but very nice neighborhood thai family run restaurant: mom, sister & brother works there's etc. They don't serve alcohol but allow you to bring your own drinks if you choose very accommodating and they  have a great variety menu items - food comes out quickly & to order."}
{"text":"Since my first review, I've eaten here many more times. Still great. Still addicted. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great Thai food and the black tea is incredible!!! If you are thinking of coming here do yourself a favor and make it happen. Seafood soup is really great"}
{"text":"I love this place because they are open til 10. I love it even more because the two woman working the night I came in to dine were absolutely adorable and sweet! Reminded me of my mom so much ahha. Didn't speak clear English but didn't fail to give us great service. We came in the last 45 mins before they were closing (I felt bad but I was totally craving Thai food!) All smiles, positive energy, and the food was amazing. Omg the basil fried rice is to die for! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm ready to write about this fantastic place.  I've eaten here about 4-5 times now and every time, I like it more.  My new favorite dish is the pad see ew with shrimp.  I am a wuss so I always order it at a 1 spice level.  The first time we came, they were about to close, unbeknownst to us, but they insisted that we come in to eat.  That, within itself was rare and extremely kind of them to do so.  That won us over.  Their Thai iced tea is delicious, their eggrolls are crunchy and tasty.  The server/manager is friendly and prompt.  My husband and brother chat with him every time we are there and we learn something new with each visit.  We have definitely chosen this place over Pete's Thai (down the street) by a landslide.  So happy that it's here and we hope that it stays!  Support your local restaurants!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Food, friendly staff, and quick takeout! Tom kha gai soup and cashew shrimp were enough for 2 people! Don't forget to order a Thai tea! Yum!"}
