{"text":"Anthony is fabulous. He has a great sense of food and how to match it with people and environment.  He helped us throw a pizza party for 10 boys. He taught us how to properly heat and use our wood fired pizza oven, how to make amazing dough, how to prepare the oven for pizza cooking, how to make, dress and cook the pizzas in the oven. Each of the kids thought the pizzas were the best they had ever had. He was easy going, instructive and fun.   Oh, btw, he also showed me know to make pizza oven roasted rosemary chicken using the residual heat. It's now one of our go-to dishes that always follows a pizza night!  Anthony is a 5 Star show!"}
