{"text":"This is my happy place!  Discovered it about 3 weeks ago and I've been here 6 times.  My husband and I have tried the philly, gyro and burger. For me... I can't stay away from that Philly... the perfect ratio of mushroom, onion cheese and juicy meat.  It all blends together to a perfect, almost creamy bite every time.  Everything is made to order so it's really hot and fresh.  I love the steak fries that are always well seasoned.  The restaurant itself is very clean and the staff are very nice and polite.

I keep telling myself I'm going to try the gyro salad but I'll save that for after the new year when I get on the scale after the holidays.  For now I'm blissfully happy just thinking about this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Kabobs and Philly Cheesesteak were great.  Service was great and so pleasant.  Thank You and we will be back"}
{"text":"Better than the cheesesteak I had in Philly. Flavorful.  The right ratio of meet and cheese.  I love the chicken Philly and the fries are fresh.  The owner is awesome.  He goes out of his way to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"It was the worst place I've been to in along time!  The service was slow.  The employees were rude and when we got home our food was cold and we live right down the street!  We called to complain and the owner said he would gladly refund us our money just bring our receipt by.  That's funny, we paid in cash and they didn't give us a receipt!!!   I would never go back.  There are way too many other choices around here.  Just thought we'd give them a chance!  We did!"}
{"text":"The food was disgusting! I ordered food & they left food out of my order & the lady I talked to did everything short of calling me a liar. The service is the worst I have ever seen. My food was cold, they did not give me everything I ordered, & the lady who I spoke with is the only reason I will never, ever eat there again. Take my advice.... go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Worst Greek salad ever. The guy didn't know how to make one.  He put in weird ingredients that doesnt go into a Greek salad. He put in white onions not red, corn nibblets, pickles, green olives, black canned olives, some green beans. It was supposed to come with a side, and I wasn't offered one.  It was my first and last time. It did have feta,lettuce, tom, cucumber and oil and vinegar."}
{"text":"They were closing up but invited us in anyway. Everything was put away and they still said they will take our order. We're getting it to go so. I'll have to comment on how good or not so good later ;-)

After I read the reviews about how salty the fries were, I asked the guy behind the counter if he already prepared them.  He had, so I mentioned to him I was going to ask him to go light on the fries.  He said he would pick out the the light ones LOL

We brought our food home and it was pipping hot!  I have to say this was the best Philly Steak Sandwich I've tasted since I was in Philadelphia many many many years ago 1980's!!! 

I bought 2 combo's, #2 on the menu.  Sandwich, fries and a soda.  My son upgraded his sandwich to a foot long. The price came to $24.00 and some change.  The sandwich was awesome!!! Fries are over seasoned so if you can ask for NO season, or lightly seasoned!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I consider myself a picky person and this place is amazing! Expect to wait a little while, because they make the food while you wait! No heat lamps keeping cheese steak warm! Delicious food made to order! I was incredibly impressed! I got the philly cheese steak with chicken instead of beef, fries and a drink for $8! I have no idea what they do to this chicken to make it so delicious and moist, sing it lullabies? Bribe it with candy? No clue, but whatever it is, it works! My husband got the chicken salad for $7. The chicken salad was HUGE! And came with a TON of chicken on top!!! He kept raving about the pickled veggies on his salad. I did. It get any because they were \"too good to share!\" This was our first visit, we will be coming back!

I forgot to even mention the bread! Oh, the bread! It is super super soft, and tastes like it  was baked in the oven of God himself, by cherubs. Incredibly good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been waiting for this place to open for-ev-er and when we finally saw that it was open, we were ecstatic........The next night he went in there to get us a couple of Philly's and fries and see what else they have. First off, their menu is two thirds greek/mediterranean food. They should change their name to Gyro Express. Second of all, the philly he got wasn't that good and they offer only one size (unlike, say, Capriotti's). Thirdly, I got the philly wrap which was a disaster. Now the menu says philly wrap with salad, but the salad is ON the wrap. Imagine ooooey gooooey warm greasy philly meat and cheese lumped on top of some shredded lettuce, cucumber, and carrots. Disgusting to say the absolute least. We will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Our first time eating there and what we got were AWESOME fries and great service. Those are the only two things that I can say positively about Philly Steak Express (oh and maybe that the hockey game was on the tv, in Vegas, hockey is rare). Got the good home and I started in on my gyro and \"ok\" is the best way to describe it. The pita was good, the meat was dry and the sauce was just glopped on top. I have had better gyros from the mall food court. My husband had the cheesesteak and he said it was \"eh\". We also got the chocolate bark (which I thought were thin brownies) to share. He ate his and said it tasted a bit tangy. I took one bite and got a giant strand of hair. When I looked at the packaging, there was a little sticker that had written on it \"Best by 2/27/2014\". It's March 5th. I'm not even going to bother with taking the bark back because of the $3 it cost, but seriously! Check the package guys! I totally learned my lesson. We won't be getting food from there any time soon.
Also, and it's not the places fault, the parking there is AWFUL. 7:30 on a Wednesday night and there was only one spot open."}
{"text":"the best philly  steak and gyro in las vegas they challenge all philly steak in town .since i try the gyro ,now i go there some times   twice  a day .love it they are the best of the best ."}
{"text":"Casual-fast environment. This restaurant has EXTREMELY DELICIOUS gyros!! Wow, I will definitely be back.  The patio area will be nice to utilize when weather permits.  The service was a little slow, but well worth the wait. The food is fantastic! Clean environment, super friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is really good!! Had the gyro and it was good!!! Next time will definitely try the Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"Well the food was actually pretty good.. Problem is the person that seems to be the owner was being scammed by a customer and he thought it appropriate to curse this person regardless of other customers and namely baby Mya... I was not impressed with his behavior nor did i appreciate it!! Only 3, stars for bad behavior..."}
{"text":"Great family owned spot! I might not be the biggest fan of their philly but kabob combos are as good as it can get for less than $10 a plate. Always leave full :)"}
{"text":"Service was poor as the workers were rude to my boyfriend & I. Not only that, but they also tried to get away with charging us $3 more than what we were supposed to because they tried to say we ordered a combo but they didn't even give us the drink?? Shady.
Not only were we disappointed by the service, but the food as well. I ordered the Greek salad, which I thought was a safe bet, but I guess not. There was more cheese than lettuce, and the 'balsamic vinaigrette'? More vinegar than anything. I ate about 2-3 bites and I stopped because I simply couldn't eat it. My stomach now hurts, I'm still hungry, and I'm $15 poorer. 
My boyfriend ordered the gyro, and was disappointed as well, described his food as too salty and tasted more like Mexican food than anything. 

It is safe to say we will never be coming back here again. If you decide to try it, hope you have a better experience than we did!"}
{"text":"We had the steak philly and the chicken salad. The food was prepared fresh and it took a little longer than expected. However, it was worth the extra wait! The staff was friendly and the food tasted great! We'll be back"}
{"text":"Took my little girls here for lunch. Food was great and service was solid. I'm thinking its a family run business. If so... The young man on the grill and the young lady working the counter need raises.

They both busted their butts to get the food out and keep the customers happy. 

With 4 Kegs getting shut down by the health department... This is my new Philly Cheese Steak place."}
{"text":"I Love Phily Stake Express 
This place is to die for!!! Omg the phillies were amazing I got the #1 under $10 perfect prize a whole lot of food, I'd recommend anyone around this place to try it out for yourself you won't regret!!!"}
{"text":"Small little joint, nice place to stop in for a quick lunch break or to get off the couch in your day off. I had a gyro and fries--a very Americanized version of a classic gyro, but really tasty nonetheless. Meal was nice and hot when served, and the salad and cucumber sauce on top was  wonderfully fresh. The staff is really friendly as well. 10/10 would go back. The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because I haven't tried anything else yet."}
{"text":"I finally found the best Philly Cheesesteak sandwich in the West Coast! I grew up from the East and I know how good cheesesteak are, and it is very difficult to find a good one in town. Pop's, and Caps are nothing compared to this! 
They make everything fresh, never frozen or pressed. Using real meat and fresh ingredients really does make the difference. I recommend trying both Philly Steaks and chicken, and their fries are so delicious  that will make your taste bud dance with delights!"}
{"text":"Always a good place to stop and eat a really good philly steak. And I love the chicke kabob and rice. If your on their side of town definitely worth a shot. The guys that work there treat the customer right."}
{"text":"Lamb Gyros and Chicken wraps are both delicious.
Steak Fries are also..guys are very friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"First time I've been to this place. I'm sure I will be coming back the Philly Cheese Steak is really good."}
{"text":"Philly steak sandwiches are sooo good! Customer service top notch! Will be back over and over!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Philly. I always ask them to add jalapenos to make it spicy for the extra kick and love. For those eating halal, please note that beef philly is not halal but everything else is halal per the owner."}
{"text":"Love their chicken Philly! I don't like a lot of bread so it is super awesome that they do wraps! Their fries are good and fresh! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is either a huge hit or complete miss. Unfortunately it was a complete disaster for me. I ordered a kebab and fries, takeout. Not only was the wait a bit long, but there were actual homeless people sitting inside, not eating and then walking in and out to see their friends sleeping outside. This honestly didn't turn me off that much because I still had faith that their food would be good considering how long they took to cook it. The kebab itself was decent except it was so spicy to the point where I couldn't eat very much (not to mention that their menu said nothing about this meal being spicy) and the fries were the frozen preseason type that is pretty much everywhere except they pretty much dumped a whole bottle of cajun seasoning on it. So much to where I could pick up a fry and dump seasoning everywhere. Overall I would say I wouldn't come back but my dad really liked it so it's really up to you if you're looking to take a chance on this place"}
{"text":"Las Vegas is approximately 2300 miles west of Philadelphia. After trying one of their Philly Cheese concoctions, my conclusion  is that no one from this place has ever visited the city of brotherly love. Starting with mushy warmed bread my sandwich was just awful. No point expanding on  this . I will never return and suggest that if anyone craves, Philly Cheese, find another place. This one sure ain't it!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I really like the cheesesteak sandwich here. The fries are great, seasoned perfectly, a smaller portion of fries though.... But I could stand to eat less fries. :) 
The combo is the way to go."}
{"text":"The gyro was good but the pita fell apart instantly during the first bite if I wanted to eat my gyro with a fork I would have ordered a salad."}
{"text":"Philly CheeseSteak Salad! 

I'm sold! Very tasty and healthy, will definitely have lunch here again before the week is over!"}
{"text":"I must say I have been in Vegas for 13 years and this is by far the best cheese steak I have tasted. The owner is very nice and really appreciated my business. I suggest you check this place out. The prices are reasonable food is good what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Horrible service and horrible food! They should not be allowed to call this a Philly cheese steak. Do not recommend anyone wasting their time or money!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch because I  got tired of fast food. Philly steak express is excellent . I had the gyro and fries combo. They give plenty of meat in the gyro.I definitely will be back to try the philly cheese steak . I believe it's the owners that are working here and they are very friendly and welcoming also the dinning area is  very clean. Just wish I would have stopped here sooner. Thanks guys for making me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly employees and managers. Service is pretty fast too, they got new owners around a month ago so reviews about poor service prior too that can be ignored. 

 It's a really nice family owned restaurant now. There's not one thing on the menu that I could criticize. Every thing is delicious. You honestly could not go wrong with anything you decide to order. My personal favorite is the gyro sandwich, they purchase all the bread and vegetables daily so it's super fresh. Definitely see myself becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost 3 years now. Love this place!  Huge fan of their gyros and Philly cheese steaks. The owner is very personable. He has remembered my wife and I since our first visit. Overall the food is fantastic and quick. And staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Philly steak is awful period. Not even close to good quality. Also leaves a nasty aftertaste in mouth."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this spot has a 4 1/2 star review. The food is absolutely fantastic! They have the best Philly cheesesteak in town. I promise you this spot will beat pops or any other cheesesteak place. 
The owner is always working hard to keep the business running + he always makes the best steaks!"}
{"text":"Great food. I hade the Philly steak and fries combo $8. Pretty good deal considering the portions. The fries were great, but the philly steak was insane. Highly recommended. I will be back"}
{"text":"Two stars because the service was good. Food was gross though! Mystery meat that I guess was supposed to be steak. It was just nasty!!"}
{"text":"The staff's customer service skills need some work (i.e. say hello to people when they walk in, thank them for their order, etc..).  The food on the other hand was very good.  I ordered the #2 combo (Philly Steak, fries and soda for $7.99).  The sandwich was the perfect size for lunch and VERY tasty.  They use steak fries which I'm not a huge fan of, but that's far from a deal-breaker for me.  However, I would like to have seen another handful of fries.  The portion of fries they give you just doesn't coincide with the sandwich.  Overall it was very good and since they're right across the street from work I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go during my lunch break. I strongly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried it yet."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect based on the reviews but I was in the mood for a gyros!!  I'm glad I came. The pita sandwich is delicious!!!  I'm picky about sauce and they delivered On flavor and the amount they put on it.  It's a good thing I saw some of the reviews posted about their seasoning for the fries.... It's a bit spicy so I'm glad I asked for mild seasoning.  Overall a good meal outside in their nicely decorated fenced in seating area.  I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken kebab and rice. My lunch was not accompanied by a salad, fresh lemon or pita bread. Just plain rice and plain dry chicken served on a white Styrofoam plate,  it could not have been more unappealing. Including a bottle of water my lunch was 12.99  and I left most of it there. Not worth half of what I paid."}
{"text":"My husband got the philly steak and I got the gyro. It was actually pretty good! My husband said it was the best philly he's had in awhile!"}
{"text":"Phillysteak is the best one I've tried in this area love the seasoning bread is hot and soft . def a good spot"}
{"text":"Amazing place great food, anyone looking forward into having a great philly steak this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! Their sandwiches are delicious and the staff is great. These guys will do whatever it takes to ensure you're happy with your meal. 
I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"They skimp you on the gyro meat and vegetables.  The fries are way over seasoned.
If you want a real Philly, go next door to North End pizza.   It's almost twice the size and much tastier."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had the cheesesteak meal, the fries are thick cut and they don't skimp on the meat for the sandwich. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"So when I saw the Philly sign go up I was super excited!  Philly cheese steaks are one of my most favorite food groups!  Yes I said food groups!!!  ;)  That sign was up for sooo long before this place opened.  Everytime I drove by I did a quick glance over to see if there was a big OPEN sign in the front.  Finally they graced the Centennial area with their presence and opened their doors.  I gave it a bit to let them work on their kinks and so Saturday we finally made time to try it out.

Their menu is BAM right in front of you.  The wording is big so there's no need to squint which is a great thing.  Nothing worse than not being able to see the menu's small print.  The items are very simple and to the point so much in fact that they forgot to put what side dishes they have or drinks that they carry.  Right away I asked if they had a kids menu...nope no kids menu.  The girl at the counter got a little flustered explaining things they could make our daughter.  Nothing for kids really.   Minus one star for that.  Big bummer.  Immediately I knew our meal would be strained because I knew my poor girl was gonna sit there watching us eat while her stomach was growling.  I would have thought they would have hotdogs if anything.  Something to consider guys!!  Just saying.

I ordered a chicken philly combo.  It said it comes with a side but remember they don't list sides.  I don't remember what else they offered but I ordered mine with fries.  The BF ordered the steak philly combo with onions and mushrooms with fries.  Immediately he asked if they had American cheese and YES they had it.  Not having it is a huge deal breaker with the BF.  While we were ordering the girl was friendly.  The cook (owner?) said nothing to us even though he was standing right in front of us.  My biggest pet peeve-especially if he is the owner.  

So anyways, the food came out and looked amazeballs except that I could count the fries that I had- 9 fries. (sad face)  Then daughter started digging on my fries.  What? Hey wait a minute!  I want those.  I quickly gave her some money to order her some fries.  Poor girl. LOL  $2.00 for fries.  

The sandwiches were so - lets just say - FANTASTIC!  The bread was fresh, a little flaky but enough substance that it didn't get soggy.  My chicken was cooked perfectly and it all was so flavorful. The fries were good.  I'm not a big fan of steak fries but the seasoning on them was pretty great-like a sweet/salty taste.  

The restaurant itself was really hot.  The front of the place is all windows which probably makes it hard to keep cool?  I'm guessing.  But it was hot.  Ick.  The place was really clean and the girl wiped tables when she wasn't busy.  Sunny 106.5 was playing in the background.  I hate that music and many small restaurants resort to that-I guess because they think it is universal.  But Journey did come on at one point and all was good.  There were several other people there while we were there which is always great!  Imma big fan of helping the local small businesses!!!

I cannot wait to go back!  Next time I will considering taking it to go (if the temp hasn't changed in there) and getting some BK for the daughter prior. ;)  

***definitely consider a pack of dogs for the kids!  You don't want to exclude people when the whole family can enjoy the meal!  Just a helpful suggestion.  ;)"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate, I love Philly cheese steaks, but when I walk into this place, no one that works here seems to have a single bit of pride for what they do here. No one is usually up at the front unless they are busy. If it's empty, it'll take 3-5 min until you see a sign of life from behind the counter. I am fine with waiting for amazing food, I am also very fine with great deals. The issue here is that they have flyers at their register for food deals, like the Chicken Philly combo for $5.99. Yet, when I try to order it, they say that deal has expired. Well sir, you are working at this establishment, and you are advertising deals that you aren't offering? Don't make an excuse to me that you have flyers up at the register only so people can have it for the phone number. It's extremely insulting and sad. Very disappointing. You haven't lost my business, but I would be much more concerned with being respected and honorable in this community. Don't fool us with food offers and then not honor them. Remove them from the general public, or make new ones."}
{"text":"As I was reading previous reviews, I noticed one in particular. They mentioned the workers handle food without gloves. As I am writing this, I'm waiting for my food and looking for any signs of gloves. None at all. And the workers aren't wearing them as they're making our gyros. That's a violation against health code and on your food handling. 
Besides this, I have to say the food is delicious (maybe it's the extra germs from their hands lol) but nonetheless they are always friendly and serve my favorite fries."}
{"text":"Everything is always great. I'm a regular customer here but this is my first review. Food is always fresh, delicious and made to order. I think the guy that cooks is the owner and he's just awesome too...makes everyone feel like you're eating at your family's house."}
{"text":"We got a gyro and a salad tonight. Both were excellent. The prices are reasonable. It is setup like a cafe but also has a large patio. When I walked in tonight I was the only customer but it got busy by the time I left. My food was ready in a reasonable time frame. The gyro was especially delicious.  

The business had all the feel of a mom and pop. I prefer to patronize those types of establishments and will return soon."}
{"text":"I went Sat. morning no one there except for the working man. Asked how its goin, delicious thots runnin thru my head. Made my order, got the best sandwich. Would repeat and refer those to this spot. Pricey, yes, but the quality was there."}
{"text":"Great phillys made to order  stays warm for to go orders.  Gyro are good to as close as I can get to the ones I grew up with. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"I was a little worried due to the price but my 1st bite that went away.
Totally worth it! 
We got the meal deal of philly with fries and a drink. 
Fries were great too. 
One beef and one chicken and i have no idea what one i liked better. 
Will for sure order from here again"}
{"text":"The guys working the grill and register were phenomenal and very polite! Food was perfection and fresh! We got a beef gyro and a cheese steak combo and both were amazingly good! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pros:  good, quality ingredients and friendly service
Cons:  no flavor, they need to punch up the flavor, add some salt while cooking the meat and veggies.  Fries need to be cooked longer.

I really wanted to like them..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Especially after reading the 5 star reviews!  Everything was too spicy to eat and what was edible had sub par flavor. 

Ordered:
Burger: Not good quality meat and weird spices added not on par with what a burger should taste like.  
Kabob: Rice was dry and had no taste, kabobs, no steak as an option, only beef. Spicy after kick. 
Gyro: The ONLY saving grace was he pita bread which was good. The meat wasn't bad, but again too spicy. 
Philly Steak: NOT GOOD!   For being their title dish it was NOT a Philly Steak at all!  It was insanely spicy, too spicy to even take more than 1 bite of, which is not at all a cheese steak sandwich!  The bread looked good but looks can be deceiving. The fries as well were doused in some sort of seasoning that just made them inedible. 

We will not be returning. Sadly."}
{"text":"Not at all happy about my experience with them tonight. I ordered a cheesesteak with no peppers or onions-and saw the cashier write it down on the receipt. Another dude comes out and makes my food. Fast forward 20 minutes--I get home and open it up to find my sandwich full of onions peppers and shrooms. Sweet. Roommate took a bite and said it tasted ok.  Also ordered a Greek salad... Who puts broccoli in a Greek salad??"}
{"text":"Super disappointed after reading all the great reviews. Food wasn't phenomenal, but the dirt and grime in the restaurant put a bad taste in my mouth. Our tray hadn't been cleaned in ages, it was sticky and covered with grease from patrons before us. There were black flakes in the ice, which usually means the ice machine hasn't been cleaned and is moldy inside. :( I was so excited to try the gyro, but found the sauce bland and the sandwich stuffed with so much lettuce it wasn't enjoyable. Dang..I will keep searching for the best gyro around and hope that someone that has control reads this and has the restaurant deep cleaned!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here to grab a quick lunch, and I can honestly say that this was a tasty and filling meal.  As someone who has had quite a few authentic phillys,  I'm a self-proclaimed philly steak snob and can be pretty critical of sandwiches. 

When I walked in I was greeted by a friendly young woman. I ordered a regular beef philly which comes with mushrooms, grilled onions, and cheese (I opted for white American cheese).  The bread was perfect, it had a good texture so it wasn't falling apart and it was also soft.  The meat was pretty good too.....However, I'm going to have to take off a few stars because I think the meat could have used more seasoning. Based off of previous reviews, I can see why the owners blanded it down a bit which is a shame.

As I was waiting for my food to be cooked something extremely odd happened. Two dogs ran into the restaurant and back through the kitchen.  These dogs, which had escaped from the dog grooming place next door, were being chased by an older man who was STRUGGLING to keep up.  Although the dogs were only in the building for a few moments, the philly steak owners (who were pretty upset) made sure to thoroughly clean everything before proceeding to cook.  This gave them an A+ in my book.  

If the owners could manage to lower the prices a bit and add more flavor to the meat, then they would have me as a regular! Until then, I'll return to try out some of the other options on the menu and still recommend that people check the place out if they're looking for a convenient bite to eat."}
{"text":"Needed something to eat for lunch. Decided to not go healthy & try this place out.
I ordered a philly cheese steak sandwich with everything on it (meat, cheese, mushrooms, grilled onions)Cashier asked if I wanted to make it spicy with jalapeños & I said sure.
Waited about 10 minutes for my sandwich. My sandwich came out at the same time as the person after me. Place wasn't busy on a Wednesday around early lunch time. Sandwich came out piping hot so I had to wait a few more minutes for it to cool down.
The sandwich looked big. And it was! I was stuffed at the end. I couldn't imagine getting the meal with added fries... and I can eat!
LOTS of meat & it was delicious. Great flavor & very tender. The meat kept falling out as I was eating so that tells you there was A LOT! The jalapeños added a kick for sure! I wouldn't add them unless you really like spicy. 
Overall the sandwich met my expectations of how a philly should taste. Not my absolute favorite ever, but if you're looking for a PHILLY SANDWICH in the NW, this place will do the trick."}
{"text":"Don't expect FAST because they aren't cooking pre-made meals. They serve delicious fresh from scratch food with friendly service.
The ground beef kabob combo comes with a good size portion of yummy salad and even more tasty rice. The Philly cheese steak is delicious and the combo comes with perfectly seasoned steak fries.
Looking forward to exploring more of the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best philly cheesesteak  sandwiches I've had. Every bite was piping hot which I like. I've had pops a few times and for some reason I like this one better. Their plates are also a really good option and their Gyros are also great. Their beef on the cheese steaks seems a bit more fresh and tasty and possibly not frozen like most. Definitely found a new go to place near the house and I will say it's worth the drive if not close.  Now I feel like I need to try more items on their menu as everything we ordered was good. Their bread also made a difference. My philly had the grilled onions and mushrooms and was awesome."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite! Grilled meats were tender and juicy - single refill only for drinks."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak is excellent, a little ranch or sour cream makes it really good.
The fries are excellent, the spice they put on them gives a little kick to them.
A must try !!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted fresh veggies and kabobs and we are glad we found this place -- we have been back 3 days in a row!  The beef kabob ($8.99 with rice and fresh salad and a yummy cucumber sauce) and ground beef kabobs were fantastic - tasty and tender.  The chicken kabobs were also just as tasty, but I prefer beef.  My husband has had the Philly Cheese steak ( 3 days in a row -- they give you plenty of meat, sliced mushrooms and onions.  He especially loves the bread they use -- they serve all the sandwiches hot and juicy - with much of the meat juices so very tasty!  

Their prices are reasonable and have a $10 footlong Philly steak sandwich that you much try.  The salads and veggies are crisp and fresh and their meats are tasty and tender, and served hot.  You will need a few minutes before you eat as it is that fresh and hot.  Very nice staff - friendly and helpful.  This is our new go to place!

BTW, as we were there, several other groups of customers came in for togo bags and to dine in.  They have a patio you can use for parties or large groups, and have clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Great beef, chicken or ground beef kabobs ($8.99-9.99 plate)! Hubby loves the Philly cheese steak sandwiches ($10.99). We have never been here when there hasn't been folks having a meal.  Go early as they at times run out of the beef kabobs but the chicken and ground beef ones are just as good!"}
{"text":"Being from Philadelphia.. of course I had to check this place out! I love my city, but even more than that I love a Philly cheese steak. When I fly home to see my family I have to get a cheese steak and PRONTO! 
My brother and I walked into this place and were quickly greeted by 2 nice young men and proceeded to order our steaks. Again.. being from Philadelphia we are very particular about how we order a cheese steak. (If you're not from Philly you wouldn't understand) Any how.. we gathered that they wouldn't understand exactly how we ordered a steak and did the best we could. After our order, we got our food and went home to eat.
Although I can't be too hard on them, I will say the cheese steak was ok and my brother agreed. They are not the cheese steaks we are so used to eating when we are home, but I'd have to be ABSOLUTELY CRAVING a cheese steak if I were to go back to these guys."}
{"text":"One the best steak sandwiches I ever had. Just like Las Vegas in Nevada.. This place is the vegas for Halal food available in the city. 

The food was delicious. Although Kabobs and sandwiches, very good place for quick stopover off the freeway. Will definitely visit again and highly recommend if someone looking for tasty halal food."}
{"text":"I had a Philly cheesesteak with mushrooms. It was pretty good. Definitely filling for when you wanna get drunk or stuffed on a sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped by on whim, and now will be one of my local favorites.  Awesome food and excellent service.  Huge flavor in the cheese steak, and pretty incredible when you throw in some jalapenos.  Gyros were maybe better than the Greek restaurants around here (and I like those!).  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great location! Awful meat quality ! I had the Philly steak & cheese. Very greasy and the meat quality will make you feel like you just had fast food."}
{"text":"I been here 3x and it's good overall. Small little joint and food cooked on the spot. It's steak, pasteurized cheese, grilled onions, and a roll. I would keep going back. The portions have been good in my experience. I walk out full. Only gripe I guess is food take a while to be served but I guess that's what's to be expected for being cooked from scratch."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for better service. Excellent and fast food. We got a gyro and a Philly. Perfect comfort food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Wow. I've been there twice now and I can honestly say these guys make a fantastic Philly cheese steak sandwich. One of the best I've ever eaten. I highly recommend the 12 inch beef Philly with mushrooms and onions for 10 bucks! A great deal and a great sandwich. Support these guys so they don't disappear in a few months. I'll be back to try the kabobs soon and I'll probably end up ordering a Philly too."}
{"text":"Yesterday after having my nails done I walked next door to this little place and got myself a good ole philly cheese steak (to go). 

Upon entering I was greeted with a friendly hello from both men behind the counter. One   of them was cooking and he took a second to turn around and ask me if I knew what I would like to eat. Another guy quickly came over and rang me up. I was then invited to sit and wait. I'd say I waited about 5 minutes for my food. Not a bad wait time in my opinion, especially considering there were a good handful of people there waiting for their orders. 

Like other reviewers mentioned, the cheese steak was a bit peppery. But ya know, I didn't mind it, I actually enjoyed it. Something about that coupled with the ooey gooey cheese and warm, soft, and chewy bread...yummy!!! 

Was I completely wow'd here? Not quite. Did my experience deserve 5 stars? Sure. Will I be back? Yes! 

What did wow me here was how the gentleman behind the counter took an attitude (complete with an eye and neck role) from a woman whose child's order was incorrect. I thought he handled it nicely, didn't argue with her, just apologized and fixed it promptly. Now, someone who can resist throwing a cheesesteak or gyro at someone's throat when they're being over the top....that's an A+ in my book. 

Oh and lastly, I saw another Yelper mention they thought the menu was odd because there were got dogs and quesadillas on the menu...I did see that too, on the kids menu. 

Okay, maybe I was wow'd."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for a damn sandwich.  No complimentary anything for the ridiculously long wait, not even an apology. They didn't even know what food went to what guests and had to ask the dining room as a whole who ordered what. On top of all that when we got to the house and unpacked the food we discovered we were missing food.

They should do less bs-ing in the back and behind the counter, drop the attitude, and get on their jobs. The food itself wasn't bad but not worth going through all that for."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write these guys a review forever!

Best place we've found to get great quality phillies, burgers, and gyros. Always cooked and seasoned perfectly. Fries are delicious. Service is always exceptional!

And they have this magic way of keeping the food hot. I don't know how they do it, but no matter how long it took for us to get home (even if we had to stop by the store or run some other errand before we brought our food home), the food was always still piping hot when we opened the container. Amazing!!!

We are so sad that we had to move to a different part of town. One day we will make the crazy long drive up there again, because they are SO worth it. 


*Contrary to another post I read that stated the menu is \"chaotic\", the menu is actually very straightforward and simple."}
{"text":"Right down the street from my work. Best philly and gyro I've had in town! I've had just about everything on the menu, it's all delicious. Made to order, and hot. Cooks and cashiers are friendly. Only thing I can say: Wish they had a delivery service, and wish they put their hours and website on Google. =)"}
{"text":"This place has great philly steaks and gyros. Their fries are delicious with the seasoning. Not sure why people think it's spicy bc it's not at all. The portions are huge and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"I went there expecting a decent gyro, and all I got was a piece of crap. I'm sure their cheesesteaks are good, but DO NOT order their gyros if you want a good gyro."}
{"text":"The Wait is over. Now I have a better place to be served with great food. I loved the kebab and Gyro. The food was awesome, clean and loved the fries"}
{"text":"Got to give it to these guys for setting up shop across from Streets of New York.  The menu is different, of course, and a bit hap-hazard.  Cheese Steaks, Ka-bobs, Gyros and Burgers; quite the mix, but the service is good and the food is fresh.  I opted for the Cheese Steak.  Now any good Philadelphian will tell you there are two things that make a good cheese steak: The Bread and the Wiz...I am Wiz fan and although they don't use it  the sandwich was still pretty good.  The Bread had a nice flavor, not quite from the east coast, but still pretty good.  Onions and Mushrooms are standard and if you get the combo, then the deal is complete with Steak Fries and Fountain Drink for under 10 bucks.  Not bad.  All in All this place has got it pretty good for a quick lunch craving.  Now if they only delivered."}
{"text":"We were intrigued by this place because i haven't seen a philly cheesesteak place in Vegas since Pop's, so i was excited to try this place out. They also sell gyros which is interesting. Ordered a chicken philly cheesesteak & it was soo yummy! I was really impressed because the bread was so soft, did not harden during our meal which that is usually what rolls or french breads do but that meal i am impressed with..the chicken fingers not so much. Ordered a 3 pieces chicken fingers with fries. I enjoyed the fries. The chicken fingers on the menu looked like it is panko battered which resulted in me wanting to try it..plus the photo had a honey mustard on the side. I guess u can say im sold to advertisement but my meal looked nothing like the photo. My meal was just plain chicken fingers you can get at a station casino, as for the honey mustard on the side like advertised... they don't have honey mustard.  I would only come here for the cheesesteaks! Which im glad, because it is in their title."}
{"text":"Went there with the family yesterday and it was delicious. My husband and I had a Philly steak and my daughter had a cheeseburger. At first I thought the Philly was small but it was more than enough. The taste was really good and the fries are good as well. My daughter said her burger is good as well. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Nice little place! The food is good for a little independent place and if you're looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Very good! Ordered a lamb gyro and steak fries to go, very good portions they put plenty of lamb in the gyro.. great flavors.. Will be ordering here again.."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Sorry :-( I was definitely turned off by how the cashier pronounced \"Gyro\". Right then...I knew  I was I trouble. Not authentic!! 

I ordered a salad. Very bland and the cucumber sauce was watered down. Where is the feta? No feta on my \"Greek salad\"??? I'll never come back. 

The business seemed very unorganized bad chaotic. I witnessed several patrons ask about missing food and incorrect orders. 

Need I say more? Yuck. What a waste..."}
{"text":"Took about 30 minutes to get my combo #1 Philly steak sandwich and fries. And then the food was nasty like they used pasteurized cheese product it made me nauseous and I didn't enjoy it. I am the type of person who eats all my food and I got 1/3 of the way the the sandwich and tossed it.. by the way it was such a small portion of a sandwich... Gross."}
{"text":"Best ever. Great food Great customer service and clean. That's all I can say!!! If you haven't tried it it's a must try."}
{"text":"Limited menu but the Philly Steak was really good, and only 5.99. Great price, great food. Will be going back."}
{"text":"The menu is chaotic: gyros and burritos and salads and kabobs, not to mention the namesake philly steaks. But the kabobs aren't available in steak and the gyros aren't available in lamb. But they do currently have a well-priced salmon kabob special ($11).

Considering the very mixed reviews for the phillys, I opted for salads here. The gyro salad was a handful of lettuce, three strips of meat, and three or four cucumber and tomato pieces. The takeout box was half empty. The additional Greek salad my friend ordered had no feta. Seriously? 

Restaurant is a walkup counter. Large patio for outdoor seating. Prices are low. A guy dining in exclaimed that he was from Philadelphia and the food was rockin'. I'm underwhelmed enough with the salads to be disinterested in trying more options. YMMV."}
{"text":"I was really craving a philly cheesesteak and I found this place close to home so I came here. Especially because I didn't want to put on my face. I got a beef cheesesteak and it was really good!!! The girl who was working the register, Im assuming is the owner's daughter, was very nice - cute and bubbly. The manfriend got beef kabobs and they were pretty good too. The kabobs were really meaty and had this flavor (secret recipe they said lol) that made the kabob  awesome. I liked how it didn't come on sticks because I am clumsy as hell and always hurt myself. I am definitely going to come back more often!"}
{"text":"WE RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! This place was amazing.  The set up was cute; the service fast; food was fresh; the people were so kind.  The family has eaten some of the best philly cheese steaks and this is at the top of their list.  We don't need to be in PA to eat great subs.  LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"I really liked my salad. I ordered a chicken salad and my husband had the Philly cheese steak. He said it only had onions and mushrooms. He would've liked bell peppers on it. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. And super good food. Price is fair. Would eat here everyday. Check this place out."}
{"text":"The food is cold salad. And  hot, good, and plenty  all is good fresh. Had the chicken wrap  had to cut in half b just to man handle it . Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"What a great surprise! I love being able to write a great review for a great company, I love this place! Normally the pictures are always better than the real thing but not here... The real thing is better than the pictures. The Philly cheesesteak is cooked to perfection... no kidding and the flavor just the best. I want everyone reading this review to try this place and you will be surprised and happy."}
{"text":"They get give stars because they are great at what they do.

Compared to most places like this, this place is clean, quick and has a friendly staff. 

We got 3 Chicken Philly's for $14.99, an order of cheesy potato bites and a drink for just under $24. We probably won't get the potato bites again, but they threw in a few fries which were very good. 

I'd definitely recommend you check the place out, everything is pretty good."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good. The philly cheese was tasty. The beef that was used was tender chunks of meat rather then the thin sliced beef. I was very skeptical but will go back for sure. I only gave 4 stars because of the size vs. Price. 8.00 is alot for a 6\" with nothing else. Close to 10 if you want frys and a drink."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak for my husband and chicken kabob for me. Delicious. ... and super busy."}
{"text":"Great food great service affordable prices steak fries are to die for I love steak fries this place does it right"}
{"text":"Solid spot. Good food, good atmosphere. A nice thing too is that's it not too pricey. Staff was excellent with service as well!"}
{"text":"I was weary of trying this place out at first. I love philly cheese steaks and some are just okay. This was not one of them!! It was soo good! I am hooked!! They make everything fresh to order. Even the steak fries had a ton of flavor!! This is my new addiction! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Last minute quick dinner stop. Food is good, and the lady that takes your order was just so sweet.  I really like this place."}
{"text":"Oh my god, well worth the wait! The flavors on that chicken kabob were amazing! And that Philly  I ate it too fast to even snag a picture! Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the Yelp reviews.
Pros: sandwich was much larger than I expected, bread was soft, plenty of meat and cheese, reasonably priced, and it was still hot when I got home to eat it.
Cons: The flavor of the meat was really weird, the seasoning was not what I think of when I think Philly Steak.  I thought it was awful!!!  I couldn't finish eating it.
No Opinion:  I intended to ask for my fries without spice but forgot, so I didn't eat them, that's on me. 
I would give them another try on some of their other dishes but definitely not the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"The Chicken Gyro was so good. Loved the fries also. I want to go back and just get the chicken kabobs because the chicken was so yummy.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yelp, can a brother get half stars around here.   I didn't feel right giving this place 3 stars but I don't really think it deserves 4 stars.   

The wife and I split the foot long cheesesteak.   The pros: a hefty amount of tender meat (better than most places I've been too), the bread was fresh and quality, and the veggies were fairly soft and flavorful.   I hate when they give you raw veggies on a cheesesteak or steak sandwich.   That makes me want to facepunch the sandwich.  

The major con and basically the only negative was how salty it was.   I know I gave it 4 stars but it was more of a 3 1/2 experience.  Better than the average cheesesteak for sure.   A bit on the expensive side to me for a sandwich.   But I have to admit that at least it's filling and big.  Doubt I'll be back between the $11 price tag and how incredibly salty it is."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a try since its so close to my house. Right when we walked in, there was a lady who was the only one eating and the rest of the space was empty. 
The menu's font is large and clear so you can't miss it. It took me a minute to figure out what to order though. 
I was craving for a chicken gyro, which I tried to find, but instead I asked the cashier to opt for the gyro meat to chicken.
Honestly, the chicken was way too salty for me, but the bread was soft, warm and chewy. I wish I could've ordered the dill sauce on the side, cause it was a little bit too much.
The wait time for a to-go order took about at least 20 minutes. While waiting, I can see other people coming in. The cashier didn't look too happy either.
Overall, I didn't like it. I'm sure they will work it out, since they've only been open for a few months."}
{"text":"We just moved here so we are still getting to know what there is around us.  Last night my boyfriend said he wanted a sandwich and I remembered seeing this place.  I called an order in and was told it would be ready in 5 minutes!  I got there, the guy at the counter was super nice.  My boyfriend got a regular Philly cheese steak and I asked the guy if he could make me a veggie one even though I didn't see it on the menu and he said ya of course they could, he told me exactly what would be on, I asked if he could omit a few things and he said yes.  The sandwich was so good!  One of the best veggie cheese steaks that I have had!  The fries were super good too!  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak.  Restaurant name itself is very misleading though.  Cheesesteak was a small portion of the menu.  They seem to specialize in everything but cheesesteaks.  They also have burritos, kabobs, burgers, souvlaki, chicken fingers.  Weird.  But good.  Will have to try the other items and see how this place really is."}
{"text":"We go here once a month. My nail place is in same shopping center. I get more excited about going there thdn getting my nails done. I believe its family owned. Great friendly service and the phili's are out of this world. Live this place"}
{"text":"I must state first that I am from Philly so I have high standards for the Philly Cheese Steak. Although this place is a good local comfort food joint, it is yet again another place that calims they can make a Philly Cheese Steak and they miss the mark. It was not the worst offender, and the service was good but the steak was waaaaaay overspiced with something I couldn't even figure what it was. In addition this spice was all over the fries as well and a few bites in my mouth was burning. Now, it may be that the cook was just heavy handed that day but it was a real turn off and tasted nothing like home.  That being said, I would like to go back and try them again asking for no spice before  the meat hits the grill. In the meantime, like other reviewers have mentioned Pop's on Decatur is way better, I would even say closest to authentic. Pop's knows Philly because he knows to offer whiz, which if you're from Philly you know that is really what an authenic Cheese steak is."}
{"text":"Philly Steak Express was my why not try something new each week spot plus something to review. The first impression must admit with the little patio area out front, bunch of plants around, and on perfect day definitely great spot chill over lunch or dinner. Once you walk in noting that going blow you away. It feels like small deli shop with basic menu up on top, on one side have refrigerator with sliding door with all the different beverages, and most part all the food comes in baskets. Previous reviews it is interesting that they have gyros, philly steak sandwich, and even basic fried food for kids. Diversity would say check. Most of the items can combo up I did with my Gyro on Pita bread. The combos come sixth fries and drink. The drink kind of weird. The guy never told me what I wanted or told me anything. I just assume grab your beverage of choice from the refrigerator. The guy was friendly and the service was great. Just would be nice if had idea about my combo drink.

The fries were okay nothing really special the seasonings were good. The gyro the meat was good. The toppings were fresh, refreshing, and adding body to the whole dish. The only thing is the pita thought  was little overcooked or crispy rather then nice quick heat pita on both side action. Overall would say that it was ok Gyro. The price if there one thing that stands out is everything for the most part under ten dollars even if you combo up. You get decent portion. The food is ok. Nothing that going blow your mind.

Overall nothing really that stood out for me. If looking for something quick, cheap, and filling Philly Steak is good option."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for Philly Cheese Steak!! Their sandwiches are made to order and it comes out super hot & fresh. Their steak fries are bomb too. Self serve condiments. They have daily specials so keep an eye out for that on their menu board."}
{"text":"I went in to get a gyro for lunch.  There was no one ahead of me at the counter, so I looked at the menu for about twenty seconds and stepped up to order.  The employee behind the counter stepped up in front of me near the register, reached down below the register and picked up his cell phone.  He proceeded to complete a text message and then decided to look up and acknowledge me.  I asked if he was really sending a text when a customer was standing directly in front of him waiting to order.  He apologized and said it was his mother.  I told him he was obviously too busy to help a customer and he should get back to texting.  I left and will not return."}
{"text":"It's been mentioned elsewhere, the name is very misleading.  Cheesesteaks are only a tiny portion of the menu, and I can guarantee you that they've never had a real one.  I couldn't even see the cheese on my sandwich and oh dear lord was it spicy.  I'm not sure what they soaked the thing in, but it was hot.  Not a terrible sandwich, just not even remotely a Philly Cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Good food but the service was horrible.  Tried them again just in case and same horrible service. They messed up my order then wanted to charge me for their mistakes. Really? And charging customers for drink refills!  Wow.. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"So so good!! Hubby had the gyro with fries and I had the kabobs and salad.  The fries were steak fries and so crispy and crunchy. Hubby wished there was just a little more lettuce in the gyro. My salad and kabobs were perfect!! Both portions were large!  Great service and friendly!! We will be going back and will try the pizza and philly cheesesteak"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great people! The mint colored walls and the food network on TV gives a very relaxing welcoming feeling. Of course the Philly cheesesteak and the gyros are amazing, but try the NY 1/4lb burger, with Swiss and American cheese, handmade patties and house seasonings. It's the best in town!!"}
{"text":"Both food and customer service were outstanding. The owner, John, takes pride in his philly's and it shows. Will definitely become a regular customer here."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting this place to be a Mediterrianian joint. However their Meddy food was delish! I got the Chicken Kabob with both salad and rice. My girlfriend got the Philly she loved it but, for me it was a little on the salty side."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try thanks to great reviews from my fellow Yelpers. It did not disappoint. The beef Kebab platter was very very good. The beef was extremely tender and delicious. It actually had a pretty delicate taste to it. I also enjoyed the rice and that came with it. My wife had the signature sandwich and it did not disappoint either. The cheese was extremely melty and amazing. One of my kids had the cheeseburger. He said it was good as well. The only downside was we ate late so the food gave me heartburn. But that was my own fault haha. The price was not good either. I paid less than an arm and a leg to feed 7 people. That's always a plus in my book. The place is very small inside. But it's nice. This place will be getting some business from us in the future. Next time I go I will take more pictures. I was just picking up an order that we had called in."}
{"text":"Decent food but bad service. Don't ask for any substitutions or changes because they will just give you a dumb look or tell you they don't have it although you can see that they do have it in plain sight. My wife couldn't add mushrooms to her burger because \"they couldn't do that\" although it is already added in the philly cheese steak, and when I asked for mustard I was told they didn't have any although there was a big yellow bottle sitting next to the grill which really resembled a bottle of mustard. Will not be returning to this place unless I can bring my own mustard for my sandwich."}
{"text":"Just moved to Las Vegas. These phillies are so good that I will not try another place. This is my go-to Philly in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Recently brought my kids here to celebrate the last day of school. The Philly is really good here and worth the wait. Didn't know this, but if you get the combo they put some kind of dry seasoning on the fries after they are cooked. Wish I would of known that as I would of ordered mine plain. Everything came out really hot and fresh. The temperature of the restaurant is really warm, almost boarding on hot. The cashier needs a little more training as she didn't even talk to us,make suggestions, or say hello or thank you."}
{"text":"The quantity of food you get for the price is amazing and the food is delicious! I love that they have the option of putting the philly steak, onions and mushrooms on a salad (the number 3) since I eat low carb, but the sandwich version with fries looks great too. Friendly service, every time I've been there!"}
{"text":"Oh.My.Gosh- we just came across this place and stopped in to pick up some dinner. The steak philly sandwiches are stupid amazing and the cheesy potato balls deelish!!!! The customer service from everyone was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Even w limited menu, it so good. Today was my first time i had a gyro and it was ridiculous good.  Lots of sauce and very full.  Fries were well seasoned.  
I need to come back to  the philly next.  My girl says it bomb too.  Nice little gem up by the freeway. Totally worth trying this place out!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, just because they support our  troops. Service was fast and the food was good"}
{"text":"Called to have a menu sent to us so our office could order lunch.  Girl on phone said they don't have a menu online, they don't have a fax machine to fax me a menu.  Said I can come and pick one up - how inconvenient.  Could hardly understand girl on phone.  If they want more business they would post their menu online and be more friendly when customers, who want to support their establishment call in."}
{"text":"First time here today.... I will most definitely go back! Sooooo good!! We ordered beef gyro, philly cheesesteak, and chicken fingers. Fresh, hot, and oh so yummy"}
{"text":"Great little place, service was excellent and good selection and taste over the top. If your near go eat here."}
{"text":"I underestimated this place. Great Phillysteaks and gyros. Friendly staff. They are very proud of their  food. Don't forget to ask for military discount."}
{"text":"Place is great. Food comes out super quick and cooked right in front of you. This is my second time first had the burger was excellent and now the cheese steak. The steak is tender not tough and the cheese is melted in perfectly and evenly. The BREAD is amazing on the Philly it really reminded me of back home."}
{"text":"We're looking for something new to try for lunch.  So we thought why not help out a local business.  I thought the Philly was average.  Not amazing.  The customer service was really good.  Very nice and very clean.  If I was in the neighborhood I would stop in but, I would not drive across town."}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for month's.  Tonight was the night I have become an official fan of Philly Steak Express.  Definitely seemed like a small mom and pop shop gettin there hustle on.  Vegas is such a difficult market to open a restaurant in simply because of the number of competitors.  There are like 20-40 restaurants at every intersection.  

Menu was simple with a choice between Philly Cheese Steaks, Gyros, Burgers, Dogs, and various fried goodies.  I went with the business namesake the \"Philly Cheese steak.  I had them add green peppers and banana peppers to my \"Philly\" but they had several other topping's to choose from like jalapeno's, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, etc...  

My \"Philly\" came out rather quickly and there was a steady flow of guests that were being served even though they technically closed at 9 pm.  Most chain restaurants would lock up and turn guests away.  Not Johnny he knows he has to get every last dollar even if its closing time.  This sandwich was wrapped tight in foil and was so hot I could not even pick it up even with my asbestos finger tips.  I had to munch on the seasoned steak fries just to give that \"Philly\" a moment to chill.  Once I had a chance to take a bite first thing I noticed was that the meat was well seasoned and tender.  This was no \"Carl Buddig\" beef. 

Great sandwich overall and I will be back for a return visit to try the Gyro.  Another detail about my visit was that this place was clean in the dining area and drink station.  The first place I stopped in the same shopping center had an obvious refrigerator malfunction and I did not want to leave with a rumbly tummy."}
{"text":"We got some chicken cheese steaks today. It's a mile down the road from my house so on our way home we decided to try it! The chicken was pretty dry and the size was a little smaller than usual. The cheese was fine and seasoned decently. The rolls are really weird. I don't think it's really meant for a cheese steak. I'd prefer Jersey Mikes honestly."}
{"text":"I so far have had the philly steak. Best one i had in vegas.   The gyros are so tasty and i love the chicken kabob and rice.  Very very good food here.  Dont sleep on this spot!!!!  Really delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place for the Philly and fat steak fries,,,I always tell myself I will try something different next time I go in there,, but I get a smell of the philly when I'm there and its over, philly again! The guys working are always fast and friendly. Surprised it's not busier in here, my fiance and I love it!!"}
{"text":"Messed up my order. Asked for no cheese on steak sandwich and while they notated that on the box they clearly added cheese. Getting home and seeing a messed up order is the worst!"}
{"text":"My husband is an executive chef, and is very hard to please when it comes to food. He ordered the Philly cheesesteak and for the first time I heard him say he will be coming back for more! Phenomenal food! I ordered the gyros and fries, which came out piping hot, fresh off the grill... absolutely tasty! This is one of the best gyros I have ever had! Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I have a philly steak: Small sandwich for $10. Not juicey meat, plastic like cheese, very small amount of bell peppers and onions and the bell peppers were raw. My fave part was the French bread that's good but I could buy it at Walmart for a dollar. It was very quiet. Very small amount of fries. Customer service wasn't friendly, didn't say hi/bye."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. Whether you're opting for healthy or to indulge there's so much to choose from. Some of my 'go tos' are the Philly Steak, chicken salad and gyro. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Their food is really good and they want to make you happy.  It is also nice to support true American entrepreneurs."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it is hands down my favorite place to get a Philly!! All other things aside - the food is by far 5 stars! All menu items are well priced and the sandwiches are very large portions. I ushally try and split the Philly with my daughter because there is no way I can eat it all myself. The potato bites are like little deep fried gifts to myself!! They are delicious but soooo bad for your diet.

Major Bonus Points:  I get my Chicken Philly with no mushrooms / only onions and they always remember my picky ass!!  

Chicken Philly Specials -  2/$12 or 3/$15
Potato bites - $5
Gyro Salad - $10"}
{"text":"The Philly Steak was delicious, my experience was lackluster.  I ordered online, then left my office, went into the garage, drove to the shop... and... nothing... When I said I'd placed an online order, the guy behind the counter told me \"Oh, we don't really check the app when we get busy.\"  That kind of seems counter-productive, because I used the app to avoid the lunch rush.  Yeah.  So he checked the app.  Then clicked on my order, I got a little pop up on my phone, and the other guy started making my sandwich.  I sat in the dining area for about 10 - 15 minutes total.  

Once I finally got my sandwich, I went back to my office.  And I ate my lunch.  At that point I was pretty happy.  The sandwich was good, the fries were hot and had some good seasoning on them.  I also got a can of soda. ($9.99 total)  The bread was soft, but the crust had some good tooth to it.  The meat was juicy.  It was real sliced steak.  I saw them cook it while I was sitting there.  The mushrooms were fresh and delicious.  I skipped the onions.  The cheese was the white American slices, not cheese sauce, but it was still pretty amazing.  

It was a solid lunch, and it took me the better part of the afternoon to eat the entire sandwich and some of the fries.  I enjoyed it immensely."}
{"text":"Literally located right off the 215 and Durango exit, this place sits among other businesses like a 7-11, a dog grooming place, and other restaurants.

Now for the reason why I came here. Any place that is that has the words Philly Steak in it should be a surefire place to get a good Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich right? Eh, not this place.

I got the Philly Steak Combo ($8.99). Comes with fries and a drink. The sandwich has thinly sliced grilled steak, mushrooms, onions, and cheese. I asked for extra onions and they said ok. When I got my sandwich there were hardly any onions. I was gonna go up and show them but I was already on a time constraint. The sandwich itself is about 6 inches long. The fries were steak fries, you know, the thick kind. They put some kind of seasoning on it which I thought should of been more for that gave the fries way more flavor than the sandwich itself.

Service was average. You order, pay, and then pick up your food when called. Everything else you get yourself like napkins, ketchup, etc.

Overall, I was not too impressed. The size and not too much flavor plus the \"extra onions\" that I didnt get really did not wow me here. If I come here next time I think I will get the Burger Combo which is a half pound beef patty which is only $6.99 according to their menu. Hopefully, that will have more flavor than their cheese steak.

{"text":"All around amazing and delecious food. 5 Stars for speed, taste , qulity and price. Staff all seem pretty friendly and chill. Cant wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.... Tried the cheesesteak, beef kabobs, and gyro.  The good news is the cheesesteak was a decent sandwich by my Philadelphian standards...lol
      However, the good news ends there.  We found the service extremely slow and lacking.  The Mediterranean selections were very subpar compared to some of the shwarma places around town.  My wife's beef kabob was just chunks of chewy beef with no vegetables or stick.  The beef was very tough and didnt taste like a shish kabob.
       The gyro selection is beef or chicken meat...no lamb like a normal gyro place offers.  The beef gyro was passable, but didnt taste exactly like I felt a gyro should and, again, we've had better gyros at other places in town.  Ironically, they have a picture of lamb meat on a spit on the door...but no lamb on the menu.
        Overall, the food was just OK.  They charge for refills on the soda and were kind of chincy on the fries...Speaking of the fries, they come with a spicy seasoning which you automatically will get unless you know to tell them otherwise.  Didn't really agree with all the 5 star reviews and don't think I'd go out of my way to return again"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim with the wife and this was great! Made from scratch and it wasn't too long of a wait, maybe 15/20 minutes for three sandwiches. I would definitely go back, the philly cheese steak sandwich and the gyro were great!"}
{"text":"For a new place it's great... be warned the Philly beef is spicy. If your not a fan of spicy food order with out seasoning. 

I was tilted on writing on a low star review but wait to see how the situation was handled. Owner is a great guy offered to remake my food with out issue!! That's unusual. 

I was expecting a heated debate, handled the situation quickly and made sure he had all the details correct before cooking my food. Again unusual. 

Will deff be back!!"}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheese Steak in Vegas...period dot. If you like a little spice, add jalapeños to your steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Always tasty.  I wish the guy would have told me about the 3 chicken sandwich special. I bought 2 without the deal and paid more then the 3.  That didn't really make sense.   The sandwiches are delicious and yummy fries."}
{"text":"Their philly cheese steak is \"close to the one from Philly\" according to my Philly native husband.
That's really all I can say about their food. 
Their service on the other hand, could be, should be better.

Am I the only one looking for friendly smile from cashier or non-hostile attitude on the phone?!

I called around 9:30pm. They close at 10pm.
I asked \"May I place a to-go order please?\" And the guy on the phone said \"We're closing in 15 min. Can you make it here (before then) or no?\"

\"or no?\" ?! 

Really? Well, No, I could make it there before your business officially close though?!
He didn't want to offer any type of accommodation.
I mean, he could've said something like \"we need to start making your food now, as we are getting ready to close, is that okay? \", not \"or no?\". You know what I mean?!

So yeah, okay food, bad customer service. 3 star is for their food, and convenience of location."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We used to drive across town to Pop's.  However, we always brought it home for 2 reasons.  One, the outdoor area is loud and seems dirty and two, the are under seasoned.

The cheese steaks here are well seasoned and the fries are great. So happy to have one closer. I never eat in so the service doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. My favorite spot for me and my family! The manager Homaira is such a sweet lady. The food is spot on and very delicious. If it is your first time trying I recommend the Philly Steak or Gyro. Those are my 2 favorites. The food is nicely seasoned and hot and ready for you. The costumer service is incredible. Very nice people. I most definitely recommend this place 100% you won't regret it."}
{"text":"THE BEST EVER!!!!YOU JUST HAVE TO COME IN AND TRY THE BEST Philly's Cheesesteak!!!!!!! Love the place, We were looking for a late night restaurant and this place was open and omg is amazing! You need to try it!!you'll be hooked! Customer service is great the food takes a little long but once you get it WOW!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went a few weeks ago and they were dead, the service was great and so was the food.
We went again this past Friday and they were extremely busy. Customer service sucked, we waited for 45 minutes for 1 gyro and 1 Philly, they pied so much sauce on the gyro that it was like a soup the temperature on them both were so so could have been hotter, I STILL recommend this place as long as they aren't busy."}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak for my husband and he loved it along with the steak fries..  I ordered the chicken fingers.. Not impressed.. But excited to try the other things on the menu"}
{"text":"We love a good gyro and Philly cheesesteak sandwich, so we were excited to try this place. I had the Greek salad with gyro meat and tsatsiki. I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious addition of corn and pickled carrots. They did not skimp on meat or feta cheese. My kids tried the cheesesteaks and loved them. The fries are nothing special and lack salt, but everything else was great. I can't wait to go back and try a kabob. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Got a flyer on my door a few weeks ago and since I'm a huge fan of philly cheese steak sandwiches I told myself I'd have to stop in soon. I've been to many places in the valley that claim to have the best philly cheese steaks and I've only been pleased with 1. (UNTIL NOW) this place is clean with great customer service and a \"TO DIE FOR\" philly cheese steak sandwich, Succulent, mouth watering, and seasoned to perfection. I will be back very very soon. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves an authentic PCS."}
{"text":"Worst philly steak ive had. People who cook should wear gloves. The cook at the tme i went to order my food kept answering his cell phone while cooking, very unsanitary. Will never come back to this place"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here last week. I tried the Philly, and she got a Gyro. We also got a burger to share.

The Philly and Gyro were delicious. But for me the superstar was the cheeseburger. It was absolutely delicious. It is the best burger I have had in town,  and I have been all over this city. If you come here, you have to try the burger.

As far as service, great as well. The owner really makes you feel welcome. On our first visit, he said we would love the food and we would be back, and he was right. We came back there days later. 

Delicious food. Good service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and noticed their sign.

It is located in the same parking lot that used to house the Slidin-Thru, which I was under whelmed with, but they're gone and forgotten. I digress.

Back to the Philly Steak Express, aptly named, they make Philly steak sandwiches and because of how Philly steaks are made, they are made quickly. They also make gyros and kabobs.

I ordered the Philly steak, fries and a drink, $7.99.

The sandwich was good, shaved beef fried with onions, served on a roll. The portion of fries was extremely small, I would guess 8 small steak fries. The fries were season coated, it was a visual conclusion, since it didn't seem to impart any flavor to the fries. it came with a small drink.

I would eat there again, I'm no authority on Philly steak sandwiches, but it was good. I think they should increase the portion of fries that come with the sandwich and add something, with flavor, to the season coat.

Update:

I went back and they have added burgers to the menu, I tried one, it was good. They have increased the number and size of the fries. the seasoning on the fries still lacks much taste,

Their website doesn't show the burger on the menu, but the sign in the store does."}
{"text":"Great place for fast good food.  Excellant service.  The best cheese steak and gyros..."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went to the Philly Steak Express and we were very excited to have a philly place in our part of town.  The restaurant is very simple and the menu board is hanging right on the back wall.  We noticed that some of the combo's you get allowed you to pick your sides but we never found any place to tell you what the sides were.  
The sandwich was really good and we definitely plan on going back, however I thought that the sandwich was kind of small.  When I get a philly steak sandwich I like to see the steak coming over the top and when you take a bit you should need several napkins.  This was perfectly contained inside the roll and was very easy to pick up and eat.  All though we found it very taste I would just like to see more of it.  The combo that we received came with fries.  The fries are coated with seasonings but we thought it was overly covered.  The fries almost had like a chalky taste to them from the amount of seasoning that they were covered in.  
The over all experience was good and like I said we plan on going back.  The two combos which included the sandwich, fries, and a drink only came to $17 and some change so for the price a very good sandwich."}
{"text":"The only great thing about this restaurant is the friendly chef. Me and my husband were sitting in the restaurant admiring his work. He was the only one working and the other employees were sitting down on there phones. What kind of customer service is that. But kudos to the chef he made great food and also ran the whole show by him self. I will recommend this restaurant to my family and friends and let them know to only go there is he is working."}
{"text":"This place is so good. There philly cheese steak is delicious and the gyros! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place just opened yesterday (8/6/15).   I had my expectations very low it was a real Philly Steak they served because it's impossible to find here. Those of you that are expecting seasoned beef steak with coarse sat, paprika, ground pepper, Garlic powder, onion powder, and dried thyme.  That's not how the beef is seasoned here.  The owner didn't mind that I asked for a #3 Philly Steak salad without onion.  It had chick peas, diced tomato, and salad dressing was really good!  They're ranch dressing on the side was also very good.  They have White & Orange American cheese. No provolone or mozzarella.

After I was done eating my salad I was reaching for an ice cold water from the frig.  Our food was take out and we live 2 miles up the road it wasn't long drive from the backside of Rhodes Ranch Golf Community.  I would go back again and try their chicken kabobs with a side of rice for $6.99. We came in around 7:15 pm on a Friday night (8/7/15).  We even ordered one of the specials for $2.99 on the back of the flyer to try. They have flyers at the register too. 

Great Customer service, food was hot and made to order. Very squeaky clean.  Love their open patio, it's very nice place and reasonably priced. Cheap eats."}
{"text":"Good cheese steaks and that's about all.  Slow, small portions, kids meals are gross"}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate to leave a one star review. The food here is really good, but there is just no excuse for giving me a SINGLE French fry with my order of chicken fingers."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned  the fries are GREAT (but a bit spicy...beware)  The philly cheese steak  sandwich is also very good...and LOADED with meat. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I  love  philly  steak  sandwiches!  this  was  my  first  visit,  and  unfortunately  my  last.  The  philly  meat  was  pretty  bland,  not  really  any  flavor.  I  paid  for  extra  cheese,  but  could  clearly  see  as  he  was  cooking  that  he  did  not  do  so.  After  telling  them,  they  opened  the  package  back  up  and  placed  it  on  and  closed  it  back  up.  the  sandwich  was  not  worth  the  price,  could  have  been  allot  better.  next  time  i'll  stick  to  pop's."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST gyro I have had in Las Vegas. You wouldn't think it's anything special by the looks of the place. Hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've had the philly cheese steak, gyro and the chicken kabobs! I love that it's super close to my work and that it's very reasonable price wise! The fries are also really good especially with the spice that's on them with a little ranch!!"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I love this place! We are always eager to come back! The food is fantastic! I've never been disappointed. We have gotten to speak to the owner a couple times, who is extremely nice and always remembers us when we come in. In fact, he knows my finance's \"usual\" by heart. Will be recommending this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"The outside patio is a really nice place to relax and eat your lunch, inside it is just a regular store nothing stands out to much. It was a little on the warm side but it is a food place and they make the food there so I understand it will be a little warm when they are cooking. I ordered the New York burger and to my surprise it was really good. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Cheap eats. If you can't handle spice or have kids they have no problem leaving the seasoning off the fries. Be careful about coming when it is busy. 2 employees is not enough to keep up with a rush."}
{"text":"The first time I went here they did not tell me that they added some type of seasoning which is spicy to their food and I almost could not eat what I had purchased. So let me tell you that if you do not like spice then you need to let them know not to added or ask what type of seasoning they use.  The cheesesteak is very good here; I only wish they would use more meat and cheese. I always pay for extra meat but I find that they don't give me extra cheese and I find that my sandwich is dry and for $9.99 my sandwich should not be dry. I recently bought the Gyro and that was not a good experience. It was salty and cut uneven and it just was not good. I will not have that again for me. Also I ordered fries and those were spicy and I was not expecting those to be spicy. So when I do go I order their cheesesteak with no seasoning with extra meat and I am satisfied.  This place I keep visiting and getting the same thing."}
{"text":"mmmmm yummy carb overload.  I came here twice and came here for the chicken philly steak.  it was delicious!  i seriously need to try the beef next time.  It had onion, mushroom and cheese on it.  yummy melted cheese.  mmmm i can see it now... making me hungry all over again.  So if you are watching your carb intake then you don't want to come here but if you want a great sandwich then this is the place to come.  everything is made to order so it's fresh off the grill."}
{"text":"Very clean friendly family owned Halal food joint of my choice my family likes to visit this place always great place to eat"}
{"text":"I have to say I have NEVER had an authentic Philly before, but I've had many Vegas versions.  There are many varieties out there, some drier than others, some smothered in cheese, and almost all of them undercook the green pepper if you ask for it.  THIS place, however, has my favorite Philly yet.  The meat is flavorful, the bread is grilled and delicious, and they use a reasonable amount of cheese.  What's more, their seasoned steak fries are a perfect complement to the sandwich.  The guys who run the place are super nice too; unlike many places in town they act like they truly appreciate your business.  I only have 2 complaints: you WILL leave smelling like onion if you wait for your food and I do wish they would go to fountain drinks instead of canned/bottled sodas.  Regardless, this is my go-to for a Philly in the NW!"}
{"text":"Still haven't had a philly steak from this place but their salads and kabob plates are really good but the gyro salad is my favorite so far. The customer service is always on point and they are nice! I seen people getting the philly steak and it looked delicious. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Philly i've had in Vegas!!! I got the philly cheese steak sandwich combo. Came with a fresh made to order philly cheese steak, a side of seasoned steak fries and a drink. Price is very reasonable. They also have chicken phillies and gyros. Will try a different item next time but hands down the philly steak has been one of the best I have tried. The owners are very friendly also. Give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"So far I would rate this as the best Philly steak sandwich I have had in town. Nice size portions that don't leave you completely bloated after eating and cooked to order. Staff was friendly and it seems evident that the staff of the small business do what it takes to win over repeat customers. Prices are quite reasonable as we'll with a combo meal just under $10. I would say it is definitely worth checking this place out if you are craving Philly Steak sandwiches or Gyros."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I think they have the best kebab in town. The beef gyro is also really good. They are called philly steak express because they offer other kinds of food other than middle eastern. I haven't tried any of the other foods, but that is soon to come. I have had issues with calling them at times to order food as I would get a busy tone. They may have fixed this issue now."}
{"text":"Awesome service, terrific lamb gyros as it should be, I love the fries! Military discount due to them being veterans!"}
{"text":"This place has yet to disappoint me. The lamb gryo is cooked perfect everytime. The staff is friendly and it's very clean. My picky son likes the nuggets."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for great freshly hot made a-la-carte sandwiches. Portions are very generous, and not to mention tasty meats marinated nicely. Anything on the menu is fantastic. My go to items are philly cheese steaks  and their Gyros are amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new management and I can definitely tell. Myra greets you with a smile and is pleasant throughout my whole visit. Most importantly the food is fantastic and came out in a timely manner. Highly recommend the gyro and Philly steak."}
{"text":"They aren't fighting amongst themselves which is good. It is as slow as can be but the cheesesteaks are good."}
{"text":"Love their cheese steaks. Suggestion: if you have a special order. (Ex- no mushroom, extra cheese) write it down for them. I think they are still learning English...but I'm impressed. They were so so nice. Better than other competitors' cheesesteaks!"}
{"text":"We love the food here!  We come at least once a week and have brought a few friends too. My son loves the philly. I love love love the burger!  It has seasoned meat, yummo!  All of us love the gyro.  Great fries. It's always busy. Really good prices, good portions."}
{"text":"Discovered this place hile driving around. Philly Steak is freaky good and made from scratch so there's about 10 min wait. Wifey and I shared the foot long. She said its better than sex.....ouch!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Philly Steak Express since they have opened. The staff is always very friendly and they don't have any issue with customizing my sandwich. I like to add lettuce, tomatoes and other items to my philly and this place doesn't charge extra for these items. I really like this policy.    The portion size is always huge and I usually cannot finish the entire sandwich with fries. Speaking of their fries, they are delicious. The seasoning is perfect on the piping hot steak fries!  This place is always clean except for one thing that I've noticed this morning. I went at around 11 when they opened and I've noticed that both trash bins were full. There is no way that this many customers ate in the morning. Most likely, the nighttime staff didn't throw out the trash. This is unacceptable.  In any case, the food is always good here and I'll return. One other thing to mention is that they have both a television and radio station playing at the same time. This is very distracting. Perhaps turn the volume off on one."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best philly steaks in Vegas: guaranteed! The gyros are amazing too! I love this place but it's so hidden in that little business complex next to the 7/11 and butcher store, but it's a hidden gem that's worth visiting. Yeah it's a tiny bit pricy in my opinion, but worth every penny because I can't think of a better place to get a Philly Steak! I love it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had low expectations coming into this place but we live around the corner and we had coupons! I am from philly so I know a decent cheese steak when I eat one. This was very good for a west coast cheese steak! I asked for no seasoning after reading prior reviews about the spice being too much. There was a lot of meat in the sandwich and the bread was very airy and good!!! The fires were very good and I liked the seasoning on them! We also had a beef gyro & that was really good too! Some bites had a little too much seasoning but still tasty. Food was very good & we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great philly wrap and fresh chicken wings! Nice people.  Place was clean and inviting"}
{"text":"Ever since the first time I came to this place I have absolutely loved the food I come back every week for the New York Burger combination and I believe it's the best burger in town. The owners and workers are all very nice the menu is very good and the restaurant is clean and the hours work for me."}
{"text":"I've gone here multiple times & have never been disappointed! I've never personally ordered the philly, but I've had bites! Its good. I loveeee the steak gyros though. They're so fresh & amazing  the bread is always so soft and fresh, the meat always has great flavor and is soft, not chewy. The fries come with a seasoning that is good in moderation. They can have a heavy hand on the fry seasoning but its good! Has a little spice to it but not much. Just gives the fries good flavor. 
I've ordered their chicken fingers before and those were amazing as well. I was pleasantly shocked. They're ranch is creamy goodness  
I recommend if you're in the area looking for a yummy spot to try! 
Dont expect fast service because you will wait about 10-20 mins for your food. But its sooooo worth it!!"}
{"text":"Indescribable Philly cheesesteak sandwiches. My partner and I get eat them on our lazy nights in and we wish we could eat here more often. The sandwiches are pricey and that's the only thing holding us back from eating here every night. The staff is super friendly and the wait isn't long at all. It's all fresh."}
{"text":"Good food, love the Philly cheese steaks, the support the troops decor, and classic Americana makes for a good atmosphere too."}
{"text":"We went here after realizing that the food trucks that are usually at Fort Apache and Sunset on Friday nights, were at first Friday. I'm glad we made this choice! We got chicken fingers, a philly beef and a beef gyro and everything was excellent. The chicken fingers had a light batter and they were very moist and tender. The philly beef was tender, very well seasoned, just cheesy enough without being overwhelming and the portions of meat were generous! The gyro was also very delicious (maybe a little bit too much tzatziki sauce). The fries were thick but nicely seasoned, I usually don't like thick fries but these were lightly crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside; they weren't dense.  The staff was friendly and the food came fairly quickly. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing assortment of food, if you haven't tried the food drop everything your doing and go get yourself the best sandwich in Vegas and my favorite the famous philly cheese steak. Forget all the fake shops around town this is the only good quality spot around vegas. Get get yourself some real food."}
{"text":"Food quality is terrible. Philly steak was bland, cook got the order wrong and took him 30 minutes to correct. I know what a real philly steak tastes like and you won't find anything remotely close to that at this establishment.  Dining experience as a whole was terrible. Not returning."}
{"text":"I have ate a ton of cheesesteaks in my day. I have tried damn near all of them in Las Vegas. I used to eat Pops or Triple Play. They were good but when I found Philly Steak Express I was knocked out. There cheesesteaks have so much favor. The cheese melts in your mouth. The steak has a very subtle spice that suprises you when you bite it. The bread is soft with a nice flavor. Fresh cut mushrooms was a great bonus.  So happy they didn't come from a can. The onions are fresh also and cooked into the meat providing a nice combo. The fries are thick steak fries with a nice seasoning. The service is outstanding. They are fast and friendly and always make conversation with there guests. Try them out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I eat here a time or two a month because it's conveniently located between work and home. They have great food that is made fresh, to order. I love their fries with spicy ketchup and their sandwiches are so filling! The woman at the counter is really sweet too. I usually get my food to go for convenience, but also because everything in the restaurant needs a really good cleaning. The doors, especially usually need a thorough wipe down. If it weren't for that, I'd probably eat here weekly and weigh a lot more.. Check it out. You're tummy will be happy!"}
{"text":"I would have loved to review this place but they were supposed to be open at 10:00 am and were not.  Got there at 10:15 am and doors locked but open sign blinking on and off.  They didn't even answer the phone.  Went next door and got a sandwich instead and when we left the deli, the Philly Express store was open.  Shameful."}
{"text":"This place was reccomended to me by my boss. I recently moved here at the beginning of the year and was looking for a quick gyro shop to go to. You would never guess by the name that they have gyros though. lol. The guys that work there don't talk very much. They just take your order and get your food done.  It's efficient. 

I really like this place for the gyros --I like to think I know my gyros as well... I've traveled to various places in Greece and the bread that they use is very on par with that.  The meat is very juicy and succulent.  I also enjoy the taziki sauce.  It's more cucumber flavored than dill -which I don't mind. My SO always orders the Philly Cheese Steaks and he says they're fairly delicious too.  The service is alright and the tables are a little sticky.  It's just a little hole in the wall place to get your food though, so you really shouldn't expect the best of the best.  This is a great place for what it is. It's quick and great food.  We generally like to get take away here."}
{"text":"What a great little find! It's a small little sandwich shop near Tropicana and Fort Apache. No, it's nothing fancy but the food is excellent and the service is super friendly! I hard time deciding between a gyro or a cheesesteak but decided the place had to be named after its best dish. The beef cheesesteak was delicious. The bread was soft and fluffy, the onions and mushrooms were perfectly sautéed and the steak meat was tender and juicy. Simply perfect! Plus it came out super quick. Think this is a great place to pick up a quick lunch. 

Friendly service, quick food and yummy sandwiches? Yep! I can't wait to go back. I'll have to give their gyros a try next time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here quite often since they opened. And while I am not accustomed to a Philly steak from Philly, I must say I'm very satisfied with their rendition, meaty,  flavorful, and cheesy blanketed by a moist hoggie.  And when I'm feeling nelstolgic I go for a Gyro, which takes me back to the Imbiss in Germany where I would get a Döner.  Staff is friendly and welcoming.  And if steak is not for you, they have tender juicy chicken and Greek salads. A must try for all."}
{"text":"Kabobs with rice! that is the only thing on this menu I would suggest. The salad is horrible. Which a salad should be easy. The chicken fingers don't waste your time. We've tried this place 3 times because the kabobs are good. But all other dishes were a waste of time. The Philly cheese steak is ok not fabulous."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and seems like we always get a gyro combo and 10wings med. And its always been delicious!! Would of given the place 5 stars but for some reason when eating in this place it doesnt vent very well inside and we always leave smelling like greese and smoke! Even if we just take out it seems that way too. Other than that the food has always been good no complaints there!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and the food has been great. Service is always good and the place is always clean. If you want a gyro or philly steak...kabobs this is a good spot on the southwest side of town."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I took our dog to get groomed right next door and decided to stop in and have a Philly Cheese Steak. The shop was nice and we'll kept I think they recently opened. The menu is simple with a couple different items available ala carte or in a combo. For a philly cheese steak (w/cheese,mushrooms,and onions), fries, and a drink we only paid $7.99 each for the combo, which I thought was reasonably priced. The staff was friendly and it seemed like a family owned restaurant. They cook your food to order and they call you when it's ready. The sandwich was hot and fresh and it was really good.  The bread was phenomenal lightly toasted and soft. The sandwich was by far the best I have ever had. They served us two kinds of fries, steak fries and crinkle cut with I think a Cajun seasoning. The only downside about our visit was that half our fries were cold and it seemed as if they mixed the fresh fries with the old. My boyfriend was a little upset with the lack of fries but I thought there was plenty as I was full once I was done."}
{"text":"Love the food everybody in their super nice make you feel like you are Family and the food is always fresh"}
{"text":"The Philly Cheese steak was excellent. The gyros were delicious as well. The service was fast and friendly.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm really conflicted because the food was absolutely amazing, but this place comes no where near \"express\". We waited about 30 minutes for a gyro and a philly cheese steak, there were only two other guests in front of us so in no way should it have taken that long. Once the food came it was nice and hot, you could tell it came fresh off the grill and the fries were perfectly crispy with a yummy seasoning on top. That's one really good thing about this place and probably why the the wait is a little longer, all the meat is super fresh and cooked to order. I will be returning for sure but maybe placing an order in advance over the phone."}
{"text":"Stereotypical hole-in-the-wall place with great food.  The Philly Cheese steak was amazing and the Gyro was good as well.  Felt a little pricey at a bit over $8 per sandwich after taxes but not completely unreasonable and it tasted good so that's the most important thing."}
{"text":"My husband went here for lunch today and he can't stop talking about how great it is. The best gyro he's had by far since we moved to Vegas 3 yrs ago!"}
{"text":"Based on good and lukewarm reviews, I went in here to try a Gyro and Fries. I have to agree with the lukewarm people about the taste of the food. The fries were okay, the flavoring didn't balance the thick starchy nature of the fries. The Gyro was also tasty but very salty. The salt, I believe is coming from the way the meat was prepared. I will probably try it again later to see if my opinion changes. Overall not amazing but not bad! Definitely good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place. Super slow the employees here move like they have no life in them. I order the #1 with fries and drink. Which is clearly stated on their menu board. The employee has the audacity to lie to me and say we didn't order any fries and the #1 only comes with drinks. Please don't go here if you want to get conned. What I don't like is that they leave their ranch out and it's luke warm after being refrigerated. Nothing was stocked there. No forks. Food wise I've had better."}
{"text":"Had the Beef Cheesesteak and it was delicious. The beef tasted great and the bun was super soft. The steak fries were great too, loved the seasoning. Will definitely come back... 

.... Keep coming back. One of my favorite lunch spots now."}
{"text":"We love the Philly cheesesteak wraps, but they have cut back BIG TIME on the fries!!! They use to give you a decent portion of fries now they give you a very small portion! Get ready to wait for your food too! They are so slow. They only cook one order at a time. The food is good, but if I see a few people in there I go somewhere else! It's good but not worth the extremely long wait times!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Portion sizes are on the smaller side.  I'd grant more stars if it weren't for the poor service.  What I'm about to describe has happened to me numerous times here, and I've witnessed it happen to countless others as well... people who order well after I do often get served way ahead of me.  My order is generally for one person, max of two people, and the item(s) ordered are always simple -- not to mention, sometimes, exactly the same as what others behind me end up ordering.  And yet they get served first.  This happens all the time here.  

Will likely not return...unless I see an \"under new management\" sign."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken kabob and fries it was not worth the $11.  When I was ordering the guy charging me kept  going to the grill to cook the food. I'm like, you gonna charge me or cook the food?! It's my second time at this place  they take too long to serve even though there is 2 customers here."}
{"text":"It was mine and my bf first time here, only came because his mom and sister said it was a good place so we decided to give it a shot. I'm sorry but when you post a picture of white tender chicken and when you get bits of brown greasy chicken in front of you instead and it's not what it looks like in the photo that's false advertisement. On top of that the food made me, my bf, and his mom sick about an hour later. Chicken was horrible, gyros not up to par, customer service was not good at all. Nightmare experience overall, what do you expect when you try and mix Philly's and gyros in one shot. Your doing too much."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get philly cheese steaks, gyros, and kabob! The service is fast and the workers are so friendly! They make everything from scratch so the food is always fresh. There is outdoor and indoor seating. They can cater from 10-40 people if you reserve ahead of time. Again, this place is a great place to grab lunch and dinner! I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous...food is fantastic here. Always fresh and made to order. I always get the $9.99 special..Philly Cheesesteak, steak fries and a drink. The steak fries are cooked perfectly. I can't say enough about this place. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Restaurant is very clean. Try it one time and I know you will be back."}
{"text":"They give a good amount of food for a reasonable price. The philly steaks are pretty good, and their spice adds a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly. Food was delicious!! Just the timing to make it was a little longer than expected. But overall I am satisfied! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I had been here twice but will not go again.  The Philly cheesesteak was fine, but the salad was below average.  The mix salad had an odd combination of some canned veggies and didn't live up to expectation.

Ultimately, I am not going back because of the service I received trying to get a free cup of water to go with my meal.  I went back and forth with both the guy at the counter and the manager as they kept trying to make me buy a bottle of water instead of drinking from the tap.  I even offered to pay a small fee just for a regular fountain cup and they still wouldn't budge.  They insisted I pay full price for the big cup, even though I was just getting water.  They mentioned that the water at the fountain was somehow \"bad\" but the sodas were fine.  Don't they know that the fountain soda has the same water in it??  I finally got my way, but it was infuriating and enough to make me not want to go back."}
{"text":"Over 40 minutes to get the worst, over salted, cat food gyro I've ever had.  Should have went to7-11, they have better service and better tasting mystery meat."}
{"text":"Went back to Philly Steak Express again because I was a bit underwhelmed the last visit.  I had to either get a REAL beef Philly Steak or at the very least try their much talked about gyro.

Ended up going with the gyro combo for $8.99 to go.  Comes with a gyro, fries & a soda.  Took a bit to get the order done but dang it smelled pretty good.  Got it home and luckily it wasn't a total disappointment.

Fries were delicious!  Yeah, I know, fries.  But their seasoning make them tasty as all heck.  The gyro itself landed right in the middle for me.  Granted the sucker was large, loaded!  The pita was nice & supple.  Meat was I think a mixture of beef & lamb so it was flavorful and was a decent portion.  I wish the lettuce was romaine instead of iceberg.  Tomato was ok but could have been cut smaller.  Red onions!  Raw red onions!  Philly Steak Express added what seemed to be an entire half of a red onion to my gyro!  They're lucky I love me some onions, but the wifey took one whiff and was like, \"No thank you!\"  Their tzatziki sauce leaves something to be desired though, it was bland.  I was hoping for more of a cucumber & dill punch, which really brings the flavor home on a good gyro.  Overall, the gyro could use some work but it's headed in the right direction.

Next time, I will definitely go for the damn Philly Steak!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Philly Cheese Steak Express three times now, and there's a reason I keep coming back. The signature sandwich here is frankly awesome. The bread is the ideal combo of crusty and chewy, the cheese gets a nice even melt, and the meat is seasoned and cooked to absolute perfection. I've also had the salad, chicken fingers, rice and kabobs, and they're all good to great. 

So...why is this only a three-star review?

It's because the name of the restaurant is only three-quarters correct. Philly Cheese Steak? Absolutely. \"Express\"? Absolutely not. 

This place is only a few months old, but they still seem to be having a pretty serious problem with service speed. It honestly doesn't seem like they've mastered the fine art of \"making more than one order at a time.\" I have never waited less than 20 minutes for my sandwich, fries, and soda. Which, even though the food is worth it, is kind of ridiculous. If you only have an hour for lunch, and you stop here? You're going to be VERY lucky to make it back in time. 

How long are you going to wait? Well, I'm here now. Waiting for a sandwich, fries, and a soda. And I've so far made a restroom trip, then sat down to wait...and I've written this entire review on my phone in in the amount of time I've been waiting: about 15 minutes. 

Okay...after another six minutes, I have my food. And it's gonna be delicious. But I remembered something else: This is also the third time in three visits that I've been handed my order, and had to remind them they hadn't given me the drink yet. 

So: Bottom line: Food is fantastic. But the service is consistently slow and spotty. So come here, but make time, and pack your patience."}
{"text":"It was a rocky start for these guys when they first opened. I'm glad they have persevered through the awkward period where everything that may go wrong goes wrong and some customers expect everything to be perfect as they are....
But still, this place has improved and serves really good food. 

I really like the owner, I can see that he really wants his customers to be happy and satisfied.

It's always good to visit here."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out today for lunch but they were closed at 12:30pm. Posted hours are noon til 9 pm. Felt like the time I went for soup in NYC at the soup nazi's place. His sign read be back in August but it was October. Anyhow got  to try Squeeze in instead.

Please post accurate biz hours."}
{"text":"They have really great food, however don't expect food to come out quick. Sometimes service is amazing and other times it's pretty meh. Still it's a really good food spot if you just want to chat and have lunch with someone."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the place was clean and organized. The food was delicious! I got a gyro and it was very good. The price is also very good."}
{"text":"Good Philly Cheese Steak for $5.99    not the biggest, but good and hits the spot.  Simple menu with Philly Cheese Steaks, Gyros and Kabobs."}
{"text":"Ordered 10 wings hot and 4 fingers medium to go for $18. First off the price was pretty high but I thought the wings would be the bomb. No sauce on either order, when I got home I had to use Franks hot sauce to get some flavor. The guy added fries to both orders which I didn't ask for. My first time here and my last time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is delicious. I especially love their hot pastrami! AMAZING!!! The fries, the philly chicken and beef sandwiches are so good! My husband loves their chicken kabobs! All I can say is it's a must try! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain! The service is extremely nice as well. Family owned and operated. I come here at least once a week. ADDICTED!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken philly rocks!  Service is ok and a lil slow but the food is good.  It's a convenient little spot to get in and out of.  My boyfriend had the regular philly and said it was salty.  They do salt the heck out of their food.  So be clear if you want them to stay lite on the salt."}
{"text":"The service is lacking, unfriendly and unappreciative.  Ive been in twice.  First time I had to explain what I wanted a few times and I asked for jalapeños in addition to the normal toppings. There was no immediate communication to the cook of my additional topping. When I got home I was charged for it but no jalapeños.  My second visit, I had to repeat my order 3 times and then once again directly to the cook (again no communication to the cook by register guy); I paid and had to ask for my change as the register guy took my money and immediately turned around and left; I ordered a combo which I again had to say 3 times, and no one gave me a cup for my soda.  So when I asked for my cup their response was, \"so you didnt get it\"?. Never a thank you or Im sorry I don't understand.  I give them a 2 only because the fries are good.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The Philly Steak Express is a luxury I tend to treat myself to only on special occasions. Its an emotional relationship between me and the steak on the rare moments I am drained or I am PMSing. I have the craving I get in my car drive to the shop and binge away. I don't feel guilty afterwards. Its delicious."}
{"text":"First off I love the food here, it's always fresh and good. The staff is barely competent unless the owners are here. Today I ordered a sandwich plain and when I drive across town to pick it up naturally it's not plain. The girl is incredibly rude and says that she didn't hear me. Any of the regular staff knows my order but this chic acts like I'm lying, then the cook says to my why didn't you say something, MF I did. I'll be sure to make sure all my customers know about this experience."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yummy!

First let me state that I have never eaten a cheesesteak in Philly, so I can't compare these to those.  What I can say is that the cheesesteaks I have eaten here are super tasty!  I have been here twice and I have enjoyed the cheesesteaks both times.  I even got a craving for one, which is why I ended up there the second time.  That should say something right there!

Both times I have been to this location, I had to get the cheesesteak combo.  For $7.99, you get a yummy cheesesteak, fries, and a soda.  It is just the right size for me and I totally pig out on that basket of goodness!  They season the meat with something that really sets it apart from other cheesesteaks I have had in the past.  It is almost like Cajun seasoning, but not quite.  It is really good though!  The fries here are super fat steak fries and come with seasoning on them as well.  They have been cooked perfectly both times.  I would go back for the fries alone!
  
My hubby really likes the gyros here as well.  The also do chicken options on the menu items, for those of you out there not into beef.  They also have wraps, kabobs and salads, so there is really something for everyone.  I haven' tried these items because I am in love with the cheesesteaks though.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This place has the best quality Philly steak cheese sandwiches, which I believe is very hard to find out here in Vegas. Great customer!!  Every time I come here the food is ready fast and delicious!"}
{"text":"My first thought was \"ooo, a philly cheese steak sounds delicious\". Their \"Philly steak\" sandwich is not a \"Philly Cheese Steak\". Though, it is a pretty delicious sandwich regardless. 

The meat has some sort of seasoning that tastes Moroccan or Mediterranean of sorts. I think they should just get rid of the \"philly\" name and just say \"Steak sub\". Also, there's a giant sign up front that says \"foot long\", but keep in mind that's different than what's on the menu. The menu doesn't really tell you that the sub is only a 6\".

Also, having gyro, Greek salads, and kabobs gives the place a whole different feel than a traditional American steak sub place.

Overall, it's good food, but the concept is confused."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way home after reading reviews. Ordered Philly steak with fries and drink. No mushrooms. 

Smelled so good on the way home I had to break into my to-go box and grab a fry!   Thick cut steak fries with season salt. Nice and crispy, not too greasy. 

Got home and dove into my sandwich. Everything was packaged to retain the heat. The steak was super tender. So tender, I am a little suspicious as to if it really is steak???  Meat cooked nicely to stay juicy. Onions were diced and caramelized. Bun was fresh. Cheese was abundant and pleasantly gooey!  Seasoned a little heavy with black pepper giving it a little kick, but I like it that way. 

All in all, good experience. Reasonable prices. The Philly comes in one size but it was plenty for me with leftovers. The place seemed clean and well kept. I'll be back to try more things in the menu but the steak is a winner!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good.  They did make a mistake on our order but they made up for it without question ..... We didn't even complain.  I loved that it was very clean and bright and you could see how fresh the toppings were.  They had amazing customer service and with a smile.  The hot dogs were awesome very good quality,  the gyro was delicious. Even there version of the quesadilla was very good.  Thank you for the awesome service.  The only suggestion I would like to make is having crushed red pepper.. That would be the cherry on top."}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant and I loved the atmosphere ! I can feel the team work and Sophia was amazing ! I am very indecisive she was patient with me and smiled the entire time ! I will be back thanks to Sophia and her hospitality!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Philly Steak Express. You'd think it would be for the Philly Steak but nah, it's the wings and fries! My second favorite when they're out of wings is a big fat burger. Yelp asked if they have dessert and I replied no, but I notice that someone is delivering an Italian ice custard in their display case. I've tried the Philly Steak and it's good and tender and I wouldn't hesitate to try it. The bad side to PSE is the ice machine is always on the fritz, come-on: just replace it already. Also the bathrooms look semi-sketchy. This restaurant reminds me of the east coasts restaurants that I've seen in the movies. Never had a chance to visit up there and I'm a Cali-girl by birth. This is my neighborhood food joint and my family loves it."}
{"text":"This place is great! I tried it one day after I left the nail shop and it has been great every time I go. They make everything fresh. The staff is always friendly and they treat you like neighbors. You can get a combo with fries or a salad."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always been good. Good food, good prices, close to the house. The first time I tried the hamburger and fries combo and it was great. You can see them cooking your food and it's obvious they do a good job at keeping things sanitary, I like that. The second time I tried the Philly Cheesesteak combo and it was fantastic, couldn't ask for better. Today I went in and thought I'd try the Gyro, John behind the counter said I would enjoy it, that it and the cheesesteak was their specialty. He was right, that was the best Gyro I ever had! Good job, John!"}
{"text":"Try the Kabob and rice. Super tasty. Real middle eastern flavor at its best. The owner is very nice too and engaged in conversation with me. Overall a great lunch spot for sure."}
{"text":"This place offers a wide variety of food, from philly-steak sandwiches as the name indicates, to middle eastern kabobs and gyros. We came for the later stuff; we had a ground beef kabob platter and a beef gyro. Servings were pretty generous, the rice accompanying the kabob is one of the best we've had in a Mediterranean eatery in the area, and the kabob soft and well seasoned. The gyro was equally good. Service was friendly, it would be much better if customers were acknowledged and greeted when they arrived, with a smile if possible, instead of just staring at them."}
{"text":"Amazing philly steaks and Gyro's Definitely recommend this place! The staff is super friendly and helpful being my first time I didn't kno what to get and recommendations were delicious! Super clean inside also can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy. We've always ordered their phillys. Cheesy, meaty, and juicy. The fries are crispy and seasoned with season salt. The staff is really friendly and prices are great."}
{"text":"I tried them a few times when they first opened and I was far from impressed. The staff wasn't friendly or helpful and the food was usually over seasoned. I recently heard the original owner sold it so I decided to give them one more chance hoping new owners would know how to make better food. I'm happy to say I was right! The new owner is MUCH nicer than the previous, staff is friendly and the food is good! It's like night and day in a very good way!! Congrats to the new owner for doing a good job!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Tried the burger before & it was just as great as before as was the Philly ~ but the fries are SPECTACULAR!
My favorite kind (hard to find) seasoned perfectly steak fries cooked through so they're crispy & not greasy - yum!!!
Adorable kid working there is a business owner in training & does a great job. 
Keep up the Good work! With so many choices in the area it is quite competitive so I hope they'll be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Take a drive to Pops on Decatur. It beats this establishment. The guy threw on some Lawry's salt to the fries. C'mon. This place sucks. Another foreigner  guy trying to make a buck off us with a cook top. No skills or passion. Move on."}
{"text":"Such amazing Quality of food, everything has great favor. I enjoy the food here so much I drove 20 mins just to pick some up. The owner is also the nicest person you will meet here in Vegas. So please come down and try it all"}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak with fries and it was amazing. The fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the Philly Cheese Steak is to die for. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. I will be trying the Kabob next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"First time here......haven't had a beef Philly in a long time.  Wow, this is exactly what I was craving.  The bread was so fresh and the sandwich was delicious.  Very friendly staff, too.  Quick, convenient, excellent service AND food...what more could you ask for?

I will definitely be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I saw the sign for Philly Steaks and decided to stop and give this place a try.  I read some of the reviews prior to coming I and they were mixed so the best way to judge is to give it a try and form my own opinion.

They have salads, chicken fingers, kabobs, gyros and Philly Steaks, so a little different then what I experienced in the places it tried in Philly.  The staff here today was mother/daughter and not from Philly....

I was greeted right away and my order was taken.  There was a large order placed just as I came in and the service was pretty fast as they did not wait long for their order....

The steaks are prepared the way you see it in Philly which is a plus so far...

The combo which is what I ordered came with a 6 inch sandwich, so it was only half a sandwich and a small order of fries with a drink.  The steak does not taste the same as you would expect from a normal philly but it was ok.  The fries are like steak fries and you get maybe 10 fries, so it's not a big order and this meal will not fill you up for a long period of time but it will fill you up for a little while.  I would not rate this as the best but also not the worst,  I have had worse in this town.  

So in closing, using Philly in your name does not make this a traditional Philly Steak but it will work if you have nothing else available."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!!! I would absolutely recommend. Good selection of food--I ordered chicken kabob and they gave a big portion with rice and salad. I will be visiting again for sure"}
{"text":"So. I've been to this place three times in two days. It's amazing. So delicious. The STEAK FRIES ARE SO FREAKING GOOD. They owner is so sweet, always gives me extra cheese and the location is very near my job and you can get a soda, fries, and the best Philly cheese steak in the world for $10. Go eat here."}
{"text":"Came in for a philly steak sandwich, and it was great.  We ordered the potato bites on the side.  The food is flavorful.  I'll be back to try more menu items in the future."}
{"text":"Food is great...and you know how I like my meat - HALAL. 
I've been here a few times so it's finally time for a review. 
Philly Steak Express is great for the halal fam except for it's a bit misleading...cause you can't even eat the Philly cheesesteak (it ain't halal!). I usually get the cheeseburger cause I'm the confused woman who is pretty damn basic. If the cheeseburger is good, that's when I know other menu items are too. 

PROS: 
1. Staff is nice! 

2. Separate bathrooms for both genders. 

3. Clean establishment. 

However, there are some CONS to this place. 
1. The menu says they are open till 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays - but we witnessed many customers who came in at 8:20pm being told that they close in 10 minutes. So why does the menu say otherwise? #pleasefixthis 

2. The menu items are just a tad overpriced when compared to other halal American food places in Vegas. If you wanna know which ones, check out my other reviews. 

3. If you get a fountain drink, there is a limit of 1 refill."}
{"text":"I don't understand how ppl give this place a rating above 3 stars. Ordered a chicken philly which was super salty and tasted like no other philly sandwich I've ever had, which isn't a good thing."}
{"text":"Random find, gave it a try and have been back twice.  The key to their success (beyond the food) is their willingness to custom prepare your food.  No request is too small.  Prices are fair and value is excellent.  Treat yourself to delicious Philly steak and incredible gyros!  Wish they would place the beverage fountain within customer reach.

Go try PSE.  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident while looking for a place to eat lunch.  When I walked in and nobody was eating inside or outside, I get worried!  I really wanted to get some kabob a try.  I ordered the chicken kabob with a salad to eat in the store.  The meal was large enough for two people!  The food was tasty and the portions large.  I would come back here again but try the beef kabob."}
{"text":"So I thought I'd give this place a try. Bad idea. Showed up 20 minutes after they opened and they still weren't ready. The gyro meat wasn't on the spit and warmed up so they had to cut it off and heat it up on the flat top. They also brought out the 5 gallon container of their yogurt dill sauce to fill up the line, which tasted bland and too liquidy.  Took 10 minutes to make my gyro. Took it home to eat and they put about a pound of white onions and mound of iceberg lettuce. I scraped about 3/4 of the onions and lettuce off because it fell off anyway. I could close it. And when I was able to it was soggy and fell apart anyway because of the water sauce. Save your money. Go up the street. I'm a little upset because it kinda ruined my lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place the Philly Cheesesteak are the best I had since visiting Philly. It was fast & fresh. The guys were nice. I only wished they delivered, but its worth the drive on a lazy day."}
{"text":"Can I get some sandwich with my salt please??   Sorry, but the sodium content of my sandwich probably shot my blood pressure through the roof.   But thanks for making the sandwich super meaty and using a soft hero bread vessel to store it on (no sarcasm even though it felt like it).  I just finished eating my 6 inch sandwich and my belly is satisfied.  So those keeping score at home, that's 1 for a filling tender meat sandwich but also 1 for hypertension.  Will I be back....   eh.   I'd say like 75% not."}
{"text":"It was one of best cheesesteak I've had in town. It was better then Capriottis  and cheaper. If you looking for real Philly cheesesteak this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Always hot and fresh. Cheesesteak & Gryos are freaking delicious and they aren't expensive. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I went here on July 7, 2013. We had been waiting for it to open and were excited to try it. My husband got a steak wrap and I got a chicken wrap. Both were delicious, but especially the steak wrap. Both came with veggies inside, like sauteed zucchini, broccoli, and chickpeas. That was a huge, unexpected bonus. I assumed it would be a fatty, cheesy thing but it wasn't. Both were very large though, which is good or bad, depending on your perspective and the amount of self-control you have.

Major plus: they had a highchair.

Negative: they didn't have free cups for water. If you want water, you have to buy a sodia cup or a bottled water. That's a terrible way to save money, especially in Las Vegas.

I plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Sadly I won't be back! Been here a few times for their gyro sandwich, today it was served on some overheated, old greasy pita! Barely ate much before I couldn't make myself eat anymore! Really sad, and this place isn't close to me so I drove a few miles for this rancid sandwich. Regretting that I ate as much as I did, feeling sick now!"}
{"text":"Very very good Philly sandwiches Gyros And burgers highly recommend it.
It's our family's little spot close to home."}
{"text":"Nice clean but smokey place, inexpensive relatively. Great Philly Steak #1 . Check it out and try it."}
{"text":"Cheap, friendly, fast, locally owned. Can you ask for more? I got two #1s... Philly steak with mushrooms and onions no cheese with fries crispy. First they use real beef. Second real mushrooms. The have a house spice that adds a delightful tingle on your tongue. The bread was super airy... Almost a pretzel bun on the outside but lighter in the middle. The standard size is about. 8 inches of thick goodness! ( keep it clean people) comes with a medium serving of steak fries seasoned with their secret seasoning and a 20 oz coke product... All for $7.99. They have only been open two weeks but the owners are young and energetic. I love this little place and hope it flourishes!"}
{"text":"This place was so yummy! The guy working was very friendly and gave my sister and I free drinks; the wait time was average but worth it. I love the philly cheese steaks here  my mom comes in all the time!"}
{"text":"My parents and I came in for lunch in the middle of the week. We got a Philly Steak, Lamb Gyro, and Chicken Gyro. The staff was welcoming, and the food came out quickly (but still made-to-order!). Their meats are juicy and well-seasoned without being too salty. Each of us enjoyed our orders, but my favorite is the lamb gyro! I especially love that the gyro is from an authentic vertical rotisserie. The reason for 4 stars is that they put raw onion on the gyro that are pretty strong. I may ask if they can grill them next time."}
{"text":"Great food. Everything is made fresh to order. Everything is very hot when you get it.. Why people want warm food from fast food places over this I won't ever understand..  People have said its slow here but those people are the idiots I'm talking about. Used to fries and burgers ready as soon as they order it.  Great food decent prices. Only criticism is they need to turn up the AC.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week with my boyfriend. I even came here on Christmas Day. Love the lamb gyros and chicken fingers. My boyfriend always gets the Philly steak. Everything is always 10/10. Kind of pricey for a combo but the portions are nice. It's a very laid back environment."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time last night a friend wanted this to go. I can tell its a family owned business very nice people. I ordered the number 1 it was only 9 bucks for a combo that's not bad. My food came out very quick which is always a plus. I really like the seasoned fries and the sandwich was good just needed a little seasoning salt. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We stumbled upon this little establishment when we saw a picture of a Gyro on their window.  I've had both their Philly Steak and the Gyro and they are made to order with fresh ingredients.  The combos come with a drink and steak fries.  The steak fries are seasoned with season salt, crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside.

Since moving to Las Vegas I haven't really found a good Gyro spot that makes em like Chicago (where I'm from). Chicago makes awesome Gyros and there is a place to get them on every corner.  Philly Steak Express hits the spot and I'm always satisfied.  

The guys that work there are down to earth people from Detroit.  I love their persona and the fact that they call everyone \"bro\". Based on the decor you feel like they really support the troops and the local surroundings.  If you are in the North West don't forget to try this little spot out!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch place ! Average prices I expect to pay $10 for a sandwich , fries and a drink . More then enough food and pretty tasty ...I had the Philly steak  I will be back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious. You can't go wrong with any choice. Gyros, hamburgers, Philly steaks!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Food was hot and ready when I arrived. I got the beef Philly combo. From some reviews I thought it would be a smaller portion but it was more than enough for me. The steak fries are big but I still got plenty. They were seasoned well as well as the Philly meat. The meat does have a bit of a kick to it but I didn't mind it all, slightly salty but still tasty. The cheese was super gooey like I like it. Overall I would return again to eat here!"}
{"text":"I had the cheese steak with fries. It was fresh and hot. Good prices for the combo The lady working was very friendly and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is like judgemental service I've ever experience maybe it's just im wearing my sweater where I work @ .. i mean I'm here coz my bf wanted Philly steak and im just ordering and the lady was on the phone and just smiled , I ordered #2 the sandwich only and she ask me where I work @ since I'm wearing my sweater so I told her and she told me that \"our gyros are better\" and im like ok like I really don't care and then she added \"customer says\" and i responded ok since I don't care im just here to order food not compare and since I didn't order gyro I pretty much shut my mouth smh .."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Philly sandwiches I've ever had. We got the chicken Philly, which I've never had before, and got it as a wrap, which I've never done, and it was bomb.com"}
{"text":"I'd say 3 and a half. Food is always good but needs more FLAVOR and fries need to be cooked longer. Make your own ranch also.... much better tasting. Philly's are delicious though. Just need a bit more flavor. Employees are always super nice 2."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and came in with an Entertainment coupon. I ordered two Philly steaks and when I tried to use the coupon, the cashier pointed to his own coupon just like mine and written on it were the words, \"We no longer accept Entertainment coupons!\" He explained that they were under new ownership and not obligated to honor it. I was in shock as a frequent user of these coupons, this was a first. Businesses know these things pay for themselves and happily pay money to be in the Entertainment Book to attract new customers, and here this place is already in there for free, and is rejecting new business. How myopic can you get? I could have been a life-long customer as it's right by the school where I work. These guys have redefined stupidity and with such lack of business acumen, I don't see them lasting long."}
{"text":"The menu is simple. Its cheeseteak, wrap, gyro, kebob plate and chicken fingers. 

The BF and I got to-go for us and his mom. 

We shared :

Philly cheese steak - this was a pretty good cheese steak. I'm no Philly expert nor claim to be but I liked the soft rolls they use and the flavor was good. 

The BF got a combo which here comes with a drink and some steak fries. I saw complaints of them being over seasoned in previous reciews but these were not. Not much came to a order so I wish I ordered my own. 

Beef/lamb gyro - this was just OK. It wasnt bad but just had better ones. The meat was a tad salty. I think Ill grab cheesesteak too instead of us splitting these two sandwiches. 

Prices were inexpensive and its close by my house. The MIL loved her cheesesteak so Im sure our family will be back for more."}
{"text":"Okay so this place was new to the area and I decided to give it a chance. Shortly I realized my reasoning for NOT being open to trying NEW small food businesses in Vegas. There were about 5 people ahead of me and I waited 30 minutes for a \"philly cheese steak\" which actually turned out to be cheap, salty, fatty, Nitrate filled roast beef. No Peppers/onions, no REAL cheese, they use cheap white American cheese and little hoagies. The guy making the food prepared EVERYONE'S meals WITHOUT gloves, nor did he wash his hands (not that it matters, he even swiped sweat off his face) and he was the same guy behind the Register touching dirty money! I tossed the sandwich in the parking lot cus I didnt wanna make a scene over 4 bucks.  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Amazing that's all I can really say!! Hands-down you want the best Philly cheesesteak in Las Vegas forget Capriotti's forget pops this is the real deal I get the number one Philly cheese onions mushrooms fries with seasoning and a Coke under $10 very very good size of Philly tasty every bite worth it 100% best Philly in town"}
{"text":"I like the gyros THERE but always in a hurry to get it out I like the meat well done. Seems To b a problem !!!!! But orders to go are never what r suppose to b this last time half the meat I usually get no lettuce no tomatoes and I only wanted no onion"}
{"text":"Very salty and super greasy. The bread was okay. I'm disappointed that they didn't have provolone or mozzarella cheese and no green peppers.  The meat didn't have any taste other than salt. The fries were cold. There were about 3 pieces of mushroom.  I didn't wait long because I called it in thankfully.  I probably won't go back. The prices changed from the flyer they originally gave us a few months ago.  I am not impressed. I've definitely had better philly steaks from other places."}
{"text":"Only giving a star so I can leave a review. I would never come back here. The service was really slow and the cheesesteaks were not good at all. Both of us started to feel immediately sick. The fries were too raw on the inside as well. Being from Philadelphia this place does not even come close to what a cheesesteak should be. The rolls are elspggy and the meat is salty."}
{"text":"Ordered some takeout from this place...it wasn't bad...but it wasn't very noteworthy either.  A-OK is the right feeling behind the review.

Tried their Gyro sandwich and Gyro fries since my Sister was boasting about it.

The gyro meat here has an interesting taste...more like a skillet char vs the rotisserie style, but my sister said they do have the spit here.  It also seemed a bit on the salty side but overall enjoyable to eat.

The fries were pretty plain-jane boring though.  For gyro fries, they only added meat.  None of the cucumber/Tzatziki sauce, no veggies, nothing but plain meat on the fries.  And since I had the complaint above about it being a bit on the salty end, it was a little bit of a bummer.

At least the prices are very cheap though...nobody's gonna break the bank giving it a go.

I should come back and try their Philly Steak...after all, that is what they named their place after...presume that's what their specialty is!  I only ordered the Gyro since it was raved about :/"}
{"text":"This is a good philly. Based on filling is how I usually judge Philly cheesesteaks. They use white american cheese but they're bomb. The price you also can't beat $10 you get 10inch philly fries and a drink. I'll be back for sure since it's in my side of town. As far as the bread goes I don't think it's bad but I don't think it's the best. I think this is just my opinion alone but if you can relate then cool I personally like a chewy toasted bread when it comes to phillys. But if you're going to use soft bread then I want it super fluffy and soft. If that makes sense. Still it's solid and they have other Mediterranean dishes too like gyros and stuff."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Our favorite place to go for a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and Burgers.  They serve steak fries with their own special blend of top secret  seasoning, it's out of this world.  Large portions for the price."}
{"text":"So far I tried the Philly cheesesteak and fries. I must say the bread was really good it seemed like it was steamed because it was really soft. The meat was good. However I don't really feel like it was a philly since it didn't have provolone cheese but American yellow cheese instead. Even still, it was pretty good. The fries are ok. Not a big fan of the seasoning."}
{"text":"One of the best cheesesteaks I've had since living in Las Vegas. They had my takeout order ready very quickly on a Sunday right before a playoff game. I will definitely be back for the cheesesteak combo."}
{"text":"Rude. I love this place they are so nice. Too bad theres one punk chef that wanted to scowl at me while he walks out the dining room wipes his sweaty forehead and goes to smoke a cigarette on the patio where clearly the business owner has placed a no smoking sign all the while messing up my order. Great cold and rushed food. And when my order is ready i asked if he owned the place. They said they are a family owned restaraunt. And i said well that guy sure acts like he owns it. Low class ill spend money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We literally just finished eating and are immensely pleased. We both got the beef philly steak, mine with no onions or mushrooms and the hubby had his with bell peppers added. Both were really good. We ordered the combos so we also were able to try the fries. The spice on the fries is delicious. I was worried it would be too spicy because of some reviews, but neither the philly nor the fries were spicy, they just had great flavor. My husband is picky on cheesesteaks and he really liked this one.

My only concern is that we didn't receive a receipt. My husband didn't even think about it until he got home and I asked for it to log in our budget. I saw a previous post stating that they were charging 8.5% tax when the tax should only be 8.15%. But alas, I cannot confirm or deny whether this is happening.

Overall a great meal, I just want receipts in future."}
{"text":"Military discount but they should remove the word express from their name. Kitchen layout is not most efficient."}
{"text":"This is a poor excuse for a cheesesteak the cheese steak was hard and overly greasy had no flavor the cheese burger tasted like rubber my knife what it even cut it I gave their food to my dog and she wouldn't even eat it"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I don't think I'll return. Paid about $20 for two gyro meals where the gyros were pretty inedible. Asked for no onions, which was followed. However, there wasn't sauce advertised on their photos, or at least not the pile of sauce I encountered mixed with far too much lettuce. The pita was low quality, soggy, and fell apart when I tried to pick it up. Only highlights being decent service and really good fries. Has a lot of potential, but this was not a great experience."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE BEWARE!!!!!! I order to sandwich and asked the lady who took my order if there was any cucumber in the sandwich because I'm allergic to it, she replied No. Upon receiving my sandwich it looked ok, so I took a bite and noticed a tiny bit of cucumber  in the dressing, I immediately stopped and eating and told her there is cucumber in it, my lips began to tingle and itch and instead of saying sorry the man who made the sandwich argued with me about the stupid pic which didn't show cucumber and how \"I just didn't like it\" which I replied to say no, I'M ALLERGIC, he continued to argue about nonsense, my husband kept say no big deal she'll eat the other sandwich we ordered. What I find ludicrous is we had already paid, we weren't asking for a discount, just say sorry. The lady who even took my order even told him she didn't know that there was cucumber present. All in all, it's just bad business that could have resulted into a hospital visit.  When you mess up, and the customer nicely lets you know, don't argue with them and just say sorry. We defiantly not go back and make sure others know about them. Be careful!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came upon this place accidentally, but we will be returning. Our food was prepared quickly, with all fresh ingredients in a super clean kitchen.  Our food was seasoned perfectly, the bread was perfect for the philly and the gyro sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! They have gyros, chicken Gyros, shish kabobs, wraps, and the chicken is absolutely amazing. If you haven't eaten here, you need to stop and eat. I am a very picky eater and will not eat at many restaurant around Las Vegas due to their unsanitary nature or horrible Food Service. At Philly Cheese Steak Express, I get a variety of food that is absolutely delicious and freshly made! This place is as clean as it gets when it comes to restaurant standard. Stop by...you'll see!"}
{"text":"I love their Philly Cheese steaks and my wife gets their lamb gyros. They are really good and fresh to order. This is a real hidden gem up in the Centennial area. If you want what time me tastes like a genuine Philly Cheeses steak you gotta try them out and they are super affordable.  I used to live around the corner and saw the ace but never went but now I am a fan and I love just down the way but I will definitely make this a frequent spot to eat at."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for gyros and the white sauce was amazing. The staff was very pleasant and I would go back over and over."}
{"text":"Food was hot, fresh and very tasty!  Exceeded our expectations and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the service, which was lacking. There were about five young people working behind the counter. The guy who took our order had no personality at all. There was no greeting, explanation of their menu, or even a smile. He asked what we wanted, without making eye contact, and set our trays on the counter and walked away when our food was up. It also appeared that the girl working in the back was wearing pajama pants. I am all for a laid back atmosphere, but pj's is a little too laid back for my taste. Now for the food. The menu is quite strange here. The menu options included Philly sandwiches, gyro, kabobs, burgers, hot dogs, and quesadillas. My boyfriend and I both opted for Philly's, as the name is what drew us here in the first place, and we were both equally disappointed. My sandwich was covered in so much pepper, I couldn't even finish it. My boyfriends sandwich on the other hand had absolutely no seasoning at all. The only enjoyable part of our meal were the fries, which were actually really tasty. We definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place as it is close to the house. My daughters and I tried: Philly steak sandwich, gyro, and the youngest had chicken nuggets. We ordered combos with fries and sodas and the total came to $22 and change. The chicken nuggets were a bit disappointing but the gyro and steak sandwich were delish. My only gripe on the steak sandwich was that it had a ton of pepper on it, which I don't mind but the kids found distasteful. I've been back twice since the first time and haven't had the pepper issue again. I like being able to get a decent gyro on this side of town, so I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I am not sure when they actually open but the sign was flashing open so we went in and it was a ghost town.  After standing there and moving the tables around to fit our family still nobody has greeted us or said I will be right with you.  The phone rang and we finally saw the first sign of life but still no acknowledgement to us standing in the restaurant.  So we decided to leave for a different place and I guess that jolted him into almost chasing us out of the store yelling for us to come back because he was really open.  I guess get there when you know people are already in there eating."}
{"text":"Been by here checking in on the cheesesteak n chicken n cheese. The food is decent in best terms, nothing to write home about but also not horrible. It's a good quick go to when trying to satisfy your craving for cheesesteaks.. I was a bit disappointed with the blah attitude of the employees every time I've stopped thru.. no smiles, no greetings, just took the order n Payment n that's it. Which is cool too but not too much incentive to rave about or compel me to continue to patronize this establishment. They use cheese sauce on sandwiches which isn't my fave at all..but in a crisis it will do for a ten dollar combo meal w fries n a drink"}
{"text":"On my lunch break with my classmates and my friend ordered the chicken kabob and I had the gyro and it was only $6 and filled FILLED with quality yummy lamb and the lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber sauce we so fresh!   Thank you!   I'll totally be back!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. I asked if they deliver the guy working said no. Then I saw there fly witch says they deliver. The service is okay not slow and not fast. The employee are not rude nor are they friendly. It was in a word blah service. However the cheese stake was good. 1 give the food a 4 and the service a 2"}
{"text":"The manager is a so rude like seriously, the food taste old and overlooked each time  this place is weak"}
{"text":"Just had a philly steak sandwich it was so delicious my mom had the chicken kabob I tried it too so good definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"Family Owned business and you can certainly tell that they take pride in there restaurant. And also the food is absolutely amazing best Philly Steak I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out today. Was pretty busy at lunch time. But only took them about 5 minutes to cook my meal. I got fries, a drink, and a Philly cheesesteak. Very very good!! Will definitely come back here. Delicious food and quick service."}
{"text":"Really nice family owned establishment. Always very clean, guys behind the counter are super nice. Food is always delicious and they're never busy.  Great place to eat if you're lucky enough to find it."}
{"text":"Steak philly and Gyro were awesome. Great seasoning and served hot. Price was also reasonable and both meals came with fries. Guys working the counter were awesome. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"If I had to compare, this place beats Outback's philly cheese steak. I would recommend ordering the number 1 combo with extra cheese, extra onions, and extra mushrooms. This place is not that expensive and worth your money. It's very filling!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. It's family friendly, clean, the food is great, and the prices are reasonable. I usually order the steak or chicken kabobs."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I am from California and went to get my son a haircut and I could smell the food and I decided to drop in. When you first walk up they have a beautiful patio to eat. I side was clean and had several tables and the people were so nice and helpful. They took the time to get the order right. We sat outside and they brought the food and drinks to us. The food was amazing it was delicious. We had the number #1 philly steak combo with fries and drink, the fries were awesome they were seasoned and tasted delicious. The sandwich was amazing every bite was full of meat and cheese and all the goodies I asked for. Number one thing I look for when I go eat somewhere is the place clean, second is the people are they nice and friendly, third when I sit to eat the flavor of the food and portion size. This place has it all! Portions are great! I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Sitting in the restaurant right now with my gf, just had the beef philly with steak fries and also tried the chicken kabob with rice. The philly was good, but nothing special.. I feel that Pop's on decatur was a better philly cheese steak experience. Although this philly wasn't the worst I've had in town. Good for the price $5.99. 

As for the chicken kabobs, they were actually pretty good, nice flavor and very moist. The only setback is they aren't really kabobs, just chicken chunks on a plate. 

All in all good place.. but like other reviewers stated, be ready to wait a while for your food. Seems like the staff is more about joking around with each other rather than getting your food out quickly."}
{"text":"This is great halal restaurant. The meat is very tender & the service is brilliant. So glad to find it. Eiman is very sweet & personable. We'll be back here again for sure. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have the best Philly cheesesteak sandwiches in town! They are always super friendly and all the food is made fresh to order. I was sent there by a friend to get food and ordered myself a sandwich and was blown away by how great it was! I would recommend to everyone they try this place at least once! You have no idea what you've been missing until you try the sandwiches here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time. It was fair. The philly has mostly bread and not much of anything else. The fries were over seasoned and worse part soggy. My wife ordered the Kabob and it was 1/6 of the size that was pictured and didn't even come on a stick like pictured.  We weren't thanked at anytime or given a receipt for the purchase. The \"cook\" was arguing with someone about a sign and was taking phone calls while cooking on his cell and failing to wash his hands after. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I like their cheesesteak but this place gets 1 hour for the fact that EVERYTIME THEY ARE BUSY they have The worst customer service and it's the older taller lady. 

She answers the phone so rudely or doesn't answer at all. 

Why do you answer saying 1 hour wait time , it's like she wants to discourage you from spending money at her facility. 

Look woman if you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen. Have some professionalism for gods sake."}
{"text":"It was average food. My husband asked for no mushrooms on his Philly steak but it was loaded when we got home. My gyro was ok."}
{"text":"I gave this one star because the staff were rude. We walked in and stood there for a considerable amount of time, out of the three staff that were working  nobody bothered to acknowledge us whatsoever. We turned around and left and will never go back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered Philly Cheesesteaks with Mushrooms here 5 or 6 times and we LOVE them.  Don't care if they're not authentic, just that they're good and hot and they are reasonably priced.  No complaints at all.
Sharon and Mark"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken cheesesteak combo and my son had a burger combo. My chicken was seasoned and cooked well AND served on a wheat roll-two thumbs up in my book! My son likes his burger. I'm usually not a fan of thick cut fries, but these had a yummy seasoning. I can definitely see this place in our rotation! Both for under $20!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat cause I've been hearing great things and the Yelp reviews. Couldn't have been happier. Being from the East Coast this was like being back home!!! The food was fresh and delicious and the counter help was very friendly and accommodating. If you're in the area stop by, you wont be disappointed. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go at all. The food is fast good and well priced. I highly recommend it. Always stop here or when I'm on the northwest side of town in the Centennial Hills area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite regular visits for lunch or dinner small place with great food and personable service grilling everything fresh like kabobs and Philly steak sandwiches fries or rice is good, gyros, burgers and  fingers also available.  Lots of options to eat in a square mile around here but I prefer here."}
{"text":"Service is great!! They make you feel welcome as you walk in the door.
Amazing sandwiches! Looking forward to coming back soon :)
Thank you to the staff"}
{"text":"So first off I've been coming here for over 5 years. This place doesn't have a single thing on the menu that I haven't ordered and loved! Best philly in town chicken or steak whatever your fancy. The Gyro is also phenomenal, you can get it traditionally or as a wrap or salad. Kids meals also so come down and feed the family! The owner and all the workers are extremely courteous and take pride in what they serve. I tip most times I can when I come by but I figured that this review should help them more than my measly few dollars. I'll be back again very soon, thanks!"}
{"text":"Best Philly I've had in Vegas there French fries are crispy and seasoned well! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken philly cheesesteak combo. It was so tasty. Fresh mushrooms and onions. The seasoning on the French fries is amazing and it's not to overwhelming! The fries are wedges freshly cooked. The portion size is perfect too! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had the Philly cheesesteak, my boyfriend had the gyro. Both were DELICIOUS! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cheese steaks were the best I've had in Vegas. Totally worth the 20 minute drive. Soda machine was out of ice and co2. Once that was fixed, everything was good!"}
{"text":"They have a great Philly Cheese Steak!  The salads & kabobs are also really good.  This is a great little lunch/dinner spot."}
