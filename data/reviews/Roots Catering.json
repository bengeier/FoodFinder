{"text":"Shelled out $10 for the driest chicken Caesar wrap I've ever had. Definitely would not return."}
{"text":"Last night we had a party for 16 catered by Roots..Nathan was the chef. It was superb .the presentation was meticulous, the food was very yummy, and it was nice to watch him prepare the various dishes and tell us where they had gotten all of the ingredients ; all locally sourced. The au gratin squash made in a skillet was especially good as was the grouper with tomato chutney( I got the recipe). I noticed the guests all cleaned their plates and went for seconds.
I have taken a few cooking classes at Roots and enjoyed each of them. I was not disappointed with the catering services and also noticed the kitchen was spotless at the end of the evening. Will definitely recommend them and use them in the future."}
{"text":"Usually get their tacos every Wednesday in uptown Charlotte at the corner or 3rd and Tryon. They also are sometimes at this location on Thursdays as well. Check them on Facebook to get their daily location. 

On the food...it's always really good. Keep in mind it's focused a bit more on healthy farm to table and their food is not smothered in cheese and grease to make it taste good. Anything they do with pork is always great. When they have chorizo tacos they aren't to be missed. Their potato tacos are always really good as well. I think the only thing that has been hit and miss is their chicken tacos. Not quite sure why. Maybe I'm just tired of chicken. Not to say their chicken tacos are bad I just don't end up liking them as much as the other ones I get.

Some people have already mentioned it but I'll do the same on their breakfast at Atherton market on Saturdays. Definitely worth the trip. 

Another plus is they are really nice folks and service is very good. I know it's a food truck but I've been to plenty of food trucks where people working there weren't all that nice. Makes a big difference to me. 

Sorry no pictures of my tacos today but I was really hungry. Trust me they were really tasty and very appetizing as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots uptown.  I stalk the Roots website almost daily to see if they'll be open in their usual spot in the parking lot at the corner of 3rd & Tryon (their days of operation are a little sporadic) and to see what yummy goodness they're offering that day.  Some of my best lunches have come from this inconspicuous little white cart.  They use only locally sourced ingredients to provide an inventive, gourmet spin on tacos, wraps and soups, etc.     

My favorite dishes were the grilled pork belly tacos with apple slaw (sinfully good) with a side of cilantro rice (which is always free with your taco purchase), and a decadent duck pot pie topped with puff pastry.  If these ever make an appearance again on their menu, I'll be the first in line! 

Tips: Go early as they can run out of popular items fairly fast.  They usually only offer two or three different dishes each day.  Also, this isn't quite 'fast food' - expect to wait a few minutes for your food unless you're ordering soup.  They have complimentary tea (cold or hot, depending on the season) you can help yourself too while you wait."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday at 11:15am. Took 30 minutes to get a sandwich. No apology from staff. They were out of three menu items. If they are busy, don't waste your time. Food quality was great, but not impressed by overall service."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I saw that RFF was going to be at food truck Friday. I really love the farm to table concept and as a culinary major I was thrilled to try, but I was very sadly disappointed. My friend and I both got different things and tried it all. We got the fried crispy green beans served with a horseradish aioli, grit covered shrimp taco and the coconut and garlic infused rice with black eyed peas. The taco was too dry, the rice was flavorless and beans were not cooked thoroughly and the green beans were soggy and soaked with oil. The only redeeming thing however, was the horseradish aioli, it made the green beans bearable and made me realize that the cooking techniques just needed to improve, otherwise the seasoning was great."}
{"text":"Roots catered our wedding and we could not have been happier with everything!! The food itself was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. Their attention to detail was so impressive and they truly listened to everything we wanted and delivered on it. Not only was the food great, their customer service is top notch. 

My mom asked if it would be possible to source as much food from Cabarrus County as possible and they went out of their way to make this happen. 

Their food truck is also phenomenal - I would highly recommend Roots for a casual meal or a catered event!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best lunch/breakfast I have ever had.  A must try.  Check out Roots at 3rd and Tryon for lunch Tues-Thurs, or Atherton Mill Market on Saturdays for breakfast.  If you live in Dilworth this will be your go-to breakfast place every Saturday!"}
{"text":"Gluten free option was a veggie burger with cooked veggies on a bed of greens. 
The burger was more of a scoop of unformed glob of veggie pudding. Not a great texture for a burger. 
The flavor was good, heavy curry flavor, on a \"bed\" ( small pinch of mixed lettuce for $7. 
No other options were available from the rude little server girl.... \"What was your question?\"  thanks for listening. 

I was at the IBM center this Tuesday for this spectacular debacle of a lunch."}
{"text":"The pork belly tacos are insanely good!!!! Sign up for their emails to keep up with the awesome menus! Oh and the breakfast they serve at the Atherton Mill market is crazy delicious too!"}
{"text":"Roots is deliciousness on wheels. They offer delicious locally-sourced food to uptown lunch goers from their truck every weekday until 1 at 3rd and Tryon and I've managed to track them down some dinners at Chow Down food truck rallies and elsewhere.  Understanding that you have to pop a squat elsewhere, this is my have of all food trucks.

My obsession with them started when we first tasted them at Yelpo de Mayo. Then the stalking began.  For a long while I held the title of mayor of this little food truck that could. Each day they offer 3 different lunch choices- typically 2 big ones and a smaller one or salad.  Sometimes they offer a soup too. It really won't do you too much good for me to list off my favorites because it truly changes every day and I haven't seen too many repeats.  They often offer a nice vegetarian alternative which is nice and don't overdo the current meat au courant, pork.  Some of my have veggie dishes have been a winter root vegetable pita with pumpkin hummus and apple risotto sliders.  You can view their inventive menu every day at their website but don't trust their social media unfortunately. 

They offer tea complimentary with the meal.  Generally they are efficient and the prices are reasonable.  My only complaint? They shut down at 1 sharp every day and I often get hungry at 1:15 (or have a meeting that precludes me from getting there before 1) and they're always gone. Doh! The other complaint is twice they've had cilantro in dishes but didn't have it listed on the menu which is dangerous for someone with allergies. I'm used to it with mexican or vietnamese, but they put it once in an italian dish which is why I didn't bother asking. Other than that, I love thee Roots."}
{"text":"When it comes to the world of sliders, Roots Farm Food does it right. Man were their sliders tasty. I tried the 14 hour beef brisket slider and the pork belly slider. Both just made to perfection. My friends had the falafal and they had they same response as I did. Clearly Roots takes pride in their food."}
{"text":"Great food truck with local, organic offerings! I had Roots for the first time at Sycamore Brewery's once a month breakfast! The staff were friendly and the service was relatively quick. I had the huevos Rancheros with local chorizo and it was absolutely amazing! The hash was a mixed of sweet potatoes, regular potatoes and peppers, and seasoned perfectly. My husband had the irish breakfast sandwich on brown bread which was also quite delicious. I look forward to trying more from Root's Farm! You also get $2 lunch with a yelp check in - score!"}
{"text":"I have had the chance to work with head chef Craig Barbour on two occasions and I look forward to working with him in the future. 

His food truck served 300 people at a backyard party and served delicious and reasonably priced food efficiently to all the guests. I only heard compliments from those in attendance. 

I have also used Craig for a private dinner for 4 people on New Years Eve. He took great care in providing a menu that met our desires, served food that was not only excellent, but prepared beautifully and was a pleasure to work with."}
{"text":"If you haven't had a chance to catch this truck uptown, you're truly missing a treat!  Taco Thursday's are truly an amazing experience offering 3 different types of tacos made from fresh local ingredient's.....yep you heard right...fresh and local!  They were offering 3 different tacos grilled chicken, chorizo, and roasted veggie.....of course I couldn't decide and tried all 3(don't judge me folks I am a true foodie:-).  Each taco had a different fresh and local veggie topping, like pickled onions or cucumber cilantro slaw.  The veggie taco, which was the star of the show for me consisted of turnips, butternut squash, onions, herbs and pink lady apples.......WOW!  I loved every bite of it and looking forward to Taco Thursday from this day forward......."}
{"text":"I just want to send a word of caution to anyone who wants to use Roots to cater a function.  We had a commitment from Roots to cater or wedding.  It was a very specific event with a 6 course custom menu that Craig the owner had crafted.  32 days before the wedding I get this email from Craig. 

\"Rick,
I am very sorry to tell you this, but we will not be able to cater your wedding.  As I told you in our tasting, I would be out of the country and that I would have my executive chef cook your food, however we were waiting on a previously booked event to confirm and they confirmed for your date and he will be required at that event due to its complexity.\"

So basically Craig new he had a larger client on the back burner, but continued to negotiate with us down to the food tasting and crafting of the menu. He was stringing us along and never mentioned the \"other client\".  He then bailed on us by email without ever bothering to speak to us in person at any time thereafter.  Completely unprofessional and uncaring about anything but the money in our case.  We had to scramble to find a new caterer for a custom menu 1 month before the wedding.  We did, and it was fantastic and less money than he was charging.  

Craig is young and will eventually learn what it takes to build a strong business... but as of now, buyer beware."}
{"text":"Got to drop back a STAR today. Even thought I love Roots, my tacos today were not  quite up there as they normally are. I got the Baby roots Taco and though full of root vegetables, it had white potatoes and would have been tastier with Sweet Potato. Just not much taste. I also got he Jerky Chicken taco, The chicken was a bit burnt tasting and had excess fat. And lastly, my tortillas were on the burnt side as well. However, I WILL be back next week! Still my favorite Wednesday lunch stop."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go the the Atherton market every Saturday to get breakfast from Roots. We love getting our food, sitting out in the sun and enjoying the market festivities. Some times there are animal adoptions going on. It is seriously my happy place. Farmers market, incredible food from a food truck and puppies? Incredible combination.  

The menu is always changing and we are both always pleasantly surprised. One time they had a pork tenderloin with a coffee rub....heaven. I was so sad when it was gone. I haven't gotten the chance to get lunch from them yet but if you follow them on facebook you can see where they are on a daily basis. The staff is always so nice and you can tell they put tons of though and creativity into their creations."}
{"text":"Had the polenta cake with poached egg and fresh veggies and bacon...It was INCREDIBLE! The flavors were amazing. The egg was perfectly poached and when combined with the perfect polenta cake, you could appreciate the flavors of the onion and peppered bacon in perfect harmony! This is a \"Do Not Miss\" food truck and a perfect way to start your Saturday morning at the Atherton Farmers Market"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 tuna tacos and 1 chicken. The chicken was, underwhelming. It was under-seasoned and over powered by the pepper salsa it was topped with. The menu said it came topped with queso, mine didn't. Overall, not bad, but not great.

I had very high hopes for those two tuna tacos, and maybe it was the high hopes that left me feeling lost. Topped with fairly decent (for Charlotte) spicy kimchi but over powered by the sweetness of the soy glaze. The tuna looks to be pan fried in panko, its over-salted for my taste but I know a lot of people who don't mind the extra salt. But worst of all it was cold, and that beautiful panko, soggy. Like it had been sitting in a refrigerator, for a while. Overall, will not order again unless cooked for order.

I know there is a lot of hard work that goes into the prep and delivery of food on a food truck, but if you aren't able to cook it on the truck, you just shouldn't have it on the menu.

That being said, it was my first time. I wasn't as happy as I could have been but I am more than willing to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Food cart done the right way! 

Awesome spot, if you work uptown and haven't tried this yet you're missing out. 

The food is always local and fresh, and the taste tells the story. Food items change regularly and you can check before walking over on their website. They also really follow the seasons which not many other spots uptown do during lunch.

The price is very reasonable and for the ammount of food you get it really one of the best deals uptown for lunch.

Always very nice service, a line always forms so getting there before 11:30 or after 1:00 will get you in and out in about 5."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed two of their Marinated Chicken Tacos and I am beyond pleased. These tacos were crazy tasty. Amazing food coming out of such a small stand. I walked from the office to their spot and back in heels...and I'd do it again for those damn tasty tacos."}
{"text":"Roots!

I've been looking forward to trying food from this well-known mobile kitchen for a long time now!

So I'm sipping a Countryside IPA (Sycamore shout out) before going out for dinner, when guess who pulls up? That's right, Roots! You guys totally read my mind.
Was it a tough decision? Absolutely not! I call them appetizers! Two Braised Pork Carnitas Tacos stewed in homemade tomatillo and green chile sauce. Heavenly!  And that little cup of sorbet packed a punch of flavor! Intense fresh strawberry zing! My mouth is still watering!

Wanna see some pretty pictures?! Visit their website and check out their catering pictures! You will say \"wow!\"

Fare thee well Roots until the next time we \"eat\"!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan since their food truck. I used to always say I couldn't wait until they were more accessible and now they are. Their store front in southend and now catering which I use for my office meetings. I absolutely love working with Chandler in the catering department. The food is delicious and great quality. Chandler personally worked an all day meeting I had coordinated and was very professional. Roots is always one if the first few places I think of to offer up when there is a catering need."}
{"text":"Roots is a food truck that has taken a deep hold of the Queen City and me, so I'm just gonna put it out there: This is simply the best food truck I've had the pleasure of dining from to date.

The concept is simple and part of a growing trend: cooking with locally-sourced foods that are seasonal and allowed to ripen fully to deliver a product with superior quality and taste.  

The skill in the kitchen is exceptional.  Head chef Craig Barbour  and his team have a laser-like focus on bringing out the best of the season's offerings by combining flavors that boast of freshness and delight the palate with contrasts.  For example, summer's bounty brings heirloom tomatoes roasted and then drizzled with a balsamic reduction and finished with basil.  Or how about a watermelon gazpacho with lime infused creme fraiche?  The preparation here is always elevated just a bit and takes that menu item onto another level.  Another example: Local pork chorizo taco with blueberry chipotle and cucumber fennel salad.  The final product tastes as good as it sounds.  In short, this is a foodie's delight and these guys manage to do it routinely, with gusto.  

Too bad you can only find them for lunch during the mid-week and then a couple special events for evenings.  Do follow them on Twitter and/or Facebook to stay updated.  Craig maintains an e-mail list with a routine listing of the day's menu and there next stops.  Lunch at 3rd and Tryon is available Tuesday thru Thursday.

I'd also recommend their website for information about their whereabouts and their cooking classes, which have an increased following.  If these classes produce anything like a typical menu on their cart, then it's worth your while.  

While other food carts tend to have a few specialties and do them well, Roots changes things up and continues to impress.  Despite its small size, this cart has huge abilities.  If you like the local food movement, search these guys out.  If you happen to just stroll by them one day, do your taste buds a favor and try something, anything.  If you like good food, let Roots take hold over you too."}
{"text":"Met these guys at Yelpo de Mayo. AWESOME guys, AWESOME concept! So excited for them to get the word out about their company! The food they were serving at the Yelp event (Duck Confit Tamale) was amazing and I can't wait to visit them at their food cart to see what else they have going on ! Love seeing more slow food making it's way in!!"}
{"text":"I actually have seen this truck before but last night finally tried something from them. It was the Pork Belly Sliders with Apple slaw and it was Awesome, try them if you see them around!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! I was wandering around Charlotte's Uptown and saw a line on a corner in front of the truck. There's a good reason all those people are lined up! 

On the day that I happened upon this truck, it was sliders day. 2 for $7 or 3 for $10. It was tempting to order all four, but I knew my stomach wouldn't be able to keep up. It's hard to travel alone when you want to eat ALL the food! I went with the Grilled Steak Slider with Bing Cherries and Blue Cheese Chutney and the Jerk Chicken Slider with Crisp Cucumber and Roasted Bell Pepper Salad.

I found a newspaper box to set my take-out container on and chowed down. They were both delicious, though I'd have to say that I leaned more towards the chicken in this showdown. It was tender, flavorful, and all the flavors went so well together!

If I'm ever in Charlotte again, I'll have to track down Roots because I'll want to sample everything with my partner in crime. It's just how we do things... EAT ALL the things.

The folks at the truck are incredibly friendly. Loved that!"}
{"text":"Hooray - another delicious food cart! 

I was so excited to hear about Roots Farm Food - a food cart committed to providing super fresh food w/ingredients sourced within 100 miles of Charlotte. My first experience eating at Roots was at Charlotte's Clean & Green fest when I indulged in a duck confit taco and the most perfect grilled cheese. 

First of all, I really appreciate that Roots grows many of its own veggies and sources plenty of ingredients very close by. But it's really about the taste, isn't it? Both items did not disappoint in the least! I never eat duck. Seriously - I never eat duck...but when hubs ordered the duck confit taco with fresh slaw and a toasted soft taco shell, I just had to try it. Suffice it to say, he didn't get to eat very much of that duck taco...I did! Delicious. And how about the grilled cheese?! Ooey gooey with super fresh cheese, delicious toasty, buttery bread...perfection. 

I'm pretty delighted that the fresh and local food carts are finally being brought into Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and hit up their website, find the cart and get back to your Roots."}
{"text":"I used Roots to cater my wedding last month. At our tasting the food was way too salty, and this was asked to be adjusted. On the day of the wedding, half of our guests liked the food and half did not. The half that did, really liked the shrimp and grits, however they did not like the fact that it was portioned. The half that didn't enjoy the food complained that the roast beef was dried and the green beans were too hard and undercooked. My husband and I could only confirm some of the remarks as our plates were served to us COLD! It wasn't hot, or slightly warm. IT WAS JUST COLD; so we didn't eat much but a few bites. I sent my plate back to be reheated and it still wasn't hot enough. We both agreed that the beef was dried and the green beans were too hard. The carrots on the beef was good. The au gratin potatoes would have been good had our food been served HOT. In regards to the hors d'oeuvres, all the guests really liked them. We were promised that the wedding party (whom were out taking pictures) would be served these appetizers during cocktail hours. My wedding party had to go hunt down the servers to get food and my husband and I only received 2 crab cakes and 1 chicken and waffle. I'm not very satisfied with the dinner food quality nor the cocktail hour wait service. The only other interaction that we had with Roots employee was during our tasting and they were nice, so I was shocked to receive below par food and servers."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Roots Farm Food last night at the Passport to NoDa food truck rally. It was worth the wait! I tried their sliders. I got the 14 hour smoked beef brisket. Yum! I also tried the pork belly slider. Again yum! They were super friendly too! I look forward to catching up with them again in the near future for some more delicious food! A nice added touch, they through in an extra slider for my wife's birthday!!! You just can't beat great customer service."}
{"text":"This food truck used to come to our office park at IBM Drive. The one time I ate fthere, I got an upset stomach immediatley. Actually had to leave work early. Same thing happened to a co-worker. Was told they recently a health inspector came and shut the truck down right in the middle of lunch. Security came and ushered truck out of office park and they have not been back since.

I guess their food is not \"farm fresh\" after all..."}
{"text":"My fiance, planner and I had our tasting with Roots last night and we were totally blown away. The effort and care that was put into our tasting was evident. Kellyn and the Roots team are so obviously passionate about their business and their roles in the organization. The food was delicious and beautifully presented and we are thrilled to have Roots cater our big day!"}
{"text":"A farm to table food truck is like getting an extra scoop of hot fudge on your sundae - perfect!  Roots sets up in uptown on Wednesday's and delivers a \"taco\" day experience.  They frequently rotate their menu on the actual tacos they sell, but rest assured, they will be relatively fresh and edgy.

Had a brisket taco and a thai-style chicken taco and both were pretty tasty.  The price ($7 for 2 tacos, $10 for 3) is a bit on the steep side, so the whole value side of the equation falls a bit short.  Honestly, there's no need to have a \"waiter\" standing out front of the truck, take the orders at the window, cut her costs, and knock down the prices $1 for both 2 and 3 taco orders and you'll make more.

Truth be told, but I was not blown away.  While the tacos were tasty, they weren't knocking my socks off with flavor, were average or even small on portion size, and no one will convince me otherwise, those were not fresh tortillas.

I'm very much down with the food truck experience, but any corner cutting whatsoever sticks out like a sore thumb because you don't have the restaurant experience to mask the deficiencies.  

At the end of the day, I will check out the menu when I walk by there during the lunch hours of my future Wendesdays, but they're going to have to really nail a recipe to tickle my appetite enough to convince me to eat here again."}
{"text":"Roots, such a powerful word. When I hear roots, I think of the essence. Essence in this context refers to their mission, their beliefs. The belief of supporting your neighbors, supporting your local economy, eating and living healthy. 

Roots being all of the veggies, proteins are organic, from local farms. Combining passionate growers with a passionate chef equals a creation of beauty. Food for the soul."}
{"text":"Such a welcome change of pace for lunch in Uptown.  Parked at the corner of Third and Tryon on many days, Roots offers a nice farm to table offering of unique eats.  Many days, those eats are a variety of interesting tacos.  This Wednesday brought four choices, duck confit, chorizo and strawberries, coconut curry chicken with Thai cucumbers and veggie.  I had one each of the first three for $10 and each was a delicious combo of flavors and textures.  Thanks for the hard work and good food Roots!"}
