{"text":"This is probably the best Thai food in town, I went there a couple times for diner and lunch! Absolutely delicious food and very warm service! I have to say that the lunch special is excellent, 20 choices for entree and it comes out with free Thai salad and a spring roll! You need to check out this restaurant if you are close by:)"}
{"text":"Have gone 3 times, so far,  and has been phenomenal every time.  The pad see ew has a rich and savory flavor without coming off as overly heavy.  The thai basil signature dish was also amazingly flavorful and packed full of veggies. The last dish I had was the chili garlic vegetables,  I have to admit it was also a good dish,  the vegetables were fresh with a pleasant crunch and mixed well with the sauce.. in every dish I had the tofu (crispy) and firmly think they make the best tofu in town.  Definitely worth checking out this new place!"}
{"text":"Love it here! Many combinations and plates for even difficult eaters like me! you just pick your protein for the dish- me tofu and my boyfriend shrimp and pork. Definitely will be returning to try out other menu items and next time won't make the mistake of setting my mouth on fired by getting my fried rice \"Thai spicy\" very good, but too hot for me... I'll be sticking to mild"}
{"text":"Great and authentic Thai food! Love the curry noodles, pad see ew, and fries rice. Sticky rice was on point too! If you don't like it from uber eat you should try it in store."}
{"text":"Really Good Thai the service was amazing and me and my family of 3 split phad Thai and a curry was perfect amount and it was a great price I wish they have this stuff where I live. I recommend this to most family's and the waiter we talked with a lot next time I come to Tempe I will defentliy come to ThaiTini. It was an amazing place You should go"}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is very trendy and comfy, amazing food, my friends and I ordered the crab fried rice, BBQ chicken, Larb Salad, pad -Thai and dessert Mango purple sticky rice, all  very delicious and authentic Thai food. Beverage is good too, I really like the cocktails and Thai tea here. Also, amazing service!!!! I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Pictures can not describe how amazing this place is. If you haven't try this restaurant. Please do so. Food is awesome. I'm Thai and this place is an authentic Thai food. Please check this place out and enjoy. Highly recommend to try the drunken noodle (thai hot is the way to go :)"}
{"text":"We got take-out from here and really liked it. The Pad See Ew was delicious. We've also tried the other Thai place about a block up on Rural -- that spot had bigger portions but the overall quality was better at ThaiTini. So far this is our favorite take-out spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Try the Barbecue Sausages!"}
{"text":"I went Friday afternoon for lunch and got the Pad Thai and the shrimp fresh rolls, everything was so delicious and fresh! And the owner knew which beer to pair with my spicy food, added plus! I loved it and had a wonderful experience! I would send anyone I know their way!"}
{"text":"This place is insanely good!  The parking is in the back (the previous business name at this location is posted which makes for some confusion and fear of being towed).  Our group ordered a large variety of items and the were all absolutely delicious.  Even the little kids in the group enjoyed their noodles which is a rarity. The service was prompt and helpful. We're definitely coming back here next time we're in Tempe!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to me, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered a crab fried rice and it was PRETTY GOOD. But man, it only had a few pieces of crab meet on top of a whole bowl of fried rice, and it was $17. The price is unreasonable to me."}
{"text":"I always thought spicy noodles/drunken noodles were the same thing. Apparently not because they have one of each. The food was mostly peppery. But the best part. The menu says lunch comes with a soup OR salad. Nope only salad. And it was three pieces of iceberg lettuce and a drizzle some sweet sauce. I've tried many Thai places and this is one I will not return to.... you have got to see the picture of my salad. #embarrassing to serve, if I was the waitress I could not walk that over to someone's table. No I did not touch this salad before the picture was taken!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, comfortable setting with generous, tasty and delicious Thai treats. Very reasonable prices for such a pleasant dining experience!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  Larb tasted like flavors did not have time to set in.  Thai basil stir fry a little better.  Very hard to find great Thai in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We ordered food to pick up and it was ready on time and very hot! The drunken noodles were delicious the chicken is high quality and there were plenty of veggies and flavor. we ordered medium spicy but it was a little mild for my taste but every place is different. We also ordered pad thai which had no spice at all when we ordered medium so that was a little disappointing. It was decent not the best i've ever had but satisfying if you're in the mood for pad thai. We didn't go inside but the place looked new and nice from the outside. The two dishes were $25 combined. If you're really hungry the portion sizes are not super huge but the price isn't terrible for good thai food. Would order from them again and either ask for spicier food or make sure to order a side of chili paste to add to the food!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai place. Surprised by food -- would def recommend. Really like the drunken noodles; garlic vegetables with chicken was also really good. Service needs improvement /- only had one server on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We had the red curry and the yellow curry lunch special.  The spice level was great and so was the flavor.  I would definitely come back for lunch and will plan to come for dinner too!"}
{"text":"Very americanized Thai Food. There was an abundance of black pepper on every dish we ordered. We ordered the Pad Se Ew, Crab fried rice and Cashew Chicken was decent but not authentic thai."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Thai Restaurant!!! Traditional Thai food with new style drinks. Strongly recommend their crab fried rice, grills, Thai noodles and mango sticky rice. A 5-stars must try one!^^"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Nice decor with a full bar. I'm glad I found this place and will go back again."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this little Thai restaurant. Service is outstanding and the food is excellent. The atmosphere is very fun and welcoming.  Not your typical hole in the wall Thai restaurant. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We just stopped in. The food was pretty good. We had yellow curry, pad Thai and Thai iced tea. The service was decent. But our Thai tea that we ordered was definitely not tea, it was coffee. LOLLL."}
{"text":"It hasn't even been one week and I'm already ordering food from here for the second time. The food is just as great as the service! Not only do they have lunch specials from 11-3, but they also give out a 15% discount for all students! Out of all the Thai restaurants in Tempe that I had, this is BY FAR my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing, but I thought it was pretty pricey. I got the pineapple fried rice which was unexpectedly wonderful, but came with a price tag of about $14. I understand entrees being $11-12ish, but options for rice should be lower or have different sizes :) Food really was amazing though, friend I went with also really loved his Pad Thai"}
{"text":"11.10am already. But they said \"we are not open yet\" and \"nobody come to work yet\"  Hello!!!!   Please change Time to open!! If you guy lazy to wake up. Lol I used to be server in restaurant 3 years. Worker have to come 30 minuets earlier before restaurant open. Disappoint of you guy!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Fantastic value for tasty food. Service is great as well. Not super popular yet so it is easy to get in and out quickly during lunch time."}
{"text":"Amazing. The staff is super friendly, grab food and a great place to grab a brew. Tina is great over there."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Good flavors and very clean environment. The decor was simple and crisp. Had curry and three noodle dishes across the party and all were thoroughly enjoyed. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had around this area! My husband and I order postmates and Amazon prime Thai food a LOT and have tried at least 5 other places. The pad Thai is super tasty and we got shrimp. The shrimp is grilled to perfection and they really give you a ton of shrimp unlike other places. The price is sort of high but the quality makes up for it. We got a couple appetizers, too which were great. Can't wait to get this place again."}
{"text":"The food was good. Service was horrible. No utensils. No refills on drinks. There are way too many other great Thai places that are so much better. Won't be back"}
{"text":"This was pretty good.  I found it a bit on the salty side, but that's the unfortunate case with a lot of American-Asian food.  Service was quick and friendly, price is reasonable, and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Ordered the Khao Soi noodles and it's absolutely perfect! Perfect sweetness to the curry with just trying right amount of noodles. Reminds me alot of one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Hollywood and I'm very happy this place is in Tempe. Great place, great service and amazing food. You must try this place out!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to ThaiTini. I just got done with a 3 hr hike and was exhausted and very hungry. I ordered the Thai basil with duck. It came out fairly quickly, was cooked to perfection with the veggies a bit al dente. They prepared my meal 4/5 hot, which is their Thai hot. It was perfect; not too hot but had a nice temperature to it.  They have a good liquor and beer selection but no gluten free beers, which would be nice or another gluten free option.   Overall very satisfied with my meal!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant with hip wall mural painting! Been here a lot since they open and this place has the most authentic Thai dishes compare to all Thai food I've had in state. Visited Thailand 2 years ago and this place reminds me of what I've had back then. Staffs are also friendly and accommodating. Will be back and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice place around ASU campus. It is easy to stop by with available parking lot in the back. Food are great and good portion."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Tina's cusine. I'm from Vegas and know my way in and out of Thai restaurants. I've found my new spot while I spend my time in Tempe."}
{"text":"I work nearby so when I heard there was a new Thai place near campus I was a bit worried about parking. Fear not! They have parking in the rear. We went for dinner after work and since it's the summer it was pretty quiet. They have quite a selection of options and an expansive list of protein options - beyond Chicken/Steak/Shrimp. Loved the decor and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best in town. I have been eaten a lot of Thai food. Nothing is better than this place. The spicy is perfect the way the chief made it. if you are looking for a night out with a friend or a date. I recommend anybody to come. the restaurant very clean and beautiful decoration. I order pad see ew with beef. the dish was perfect. not too sweet nor too sweet. Perfect in the middle.I will definitely come back and try it again.    ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly!   They have a special lunch menu which includes a salad, spring roll and a lunch portion of your favorite Thai dish.   I had the green curry with chicken and it hit the spot- lots of veggies and plenty of that OH so good curry flavor.   Their spice means business so don't go thinking you can take on the Thai hot - it's for the strong only!   It's close to ASU and I think the building use to be a bar so bathrooms were not the cleanest, but I would go back for their lunch specials again!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Nearby hotel and asked for a recommendation. This place came highly recommended so we gave it a shot. We were immediately greeted by a glass of water, placed out to go orders and told that our wait time would be 30 minuets. We're off to a great start. Then that's when everything went down hill. Our food was ready, we sat 10-15 minutes trying to pay for the food after numerous of times of flagging the server down. We weren't the only ones getting impatient... by the time he got to us he was so flustered he forgot everything... utensils, sauces etc. fast forward to the food... our entrees were delicious very well seasoned I had the spicy noodles and my mom had the Thai rice... our appetizers on the other hand were BURNT! Not just one appetizer but both appetizers... not just a little burnt but over the top burnt to where we couldn't even eat them. I was pissed but tired so i didn't call and complain... just wasted $12."}
{"text":"New place with easy parking. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was great. The food that we ordered was delish and was served quickly!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and i absolutely love this spot. We love their chicken pot stickers and egg rolls for appetizers. Also, they are extremely friendly and very attentive. They have a variety of alcohol choices with is also a good perk. Highly recommend giving it a try and exploring the menu."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but the experience was disappointing.  Ordered off Uber Eats and the Mango Smoothie ($3.50) was basically a mango snow cone in a cup. Maybe 20% watery mango juice and the rest was ice.  Pad Pak Chili Garlic Vegetables with Chicken was severely underseasoned and had a weird aftertaste in a watery broth.  Pad See Ew with Pork ($15) was better with tasty pork and flavorful noodles but the spice level wasn't there.  It was really weird that there weren't any Thai chilies in the food especially when we ordered them spicy. Thai Elephant on University is way better for the price and quality.  SAD"}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai and fried rice for my music studio recital. Everyone loves it. Good price for a big food tray. I also dined in the restaurant too. The place is cute. Love the green curry chicken! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the pad thai here. Employees are super friendly and the wait for food is never long."}
{"text":"The pad Thai is SO good here! They're always nice and the food is great, prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"A really good place for Thai if near ASU! An amazing Thai tea and pad see ew! We came late at night so the place was empty but the service was good and the food was very good! My friend got the pineapple fried rice which she really enjoyed. We wanted to try the potstickers but forgot too! Will have to try next time."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. First time eating here but I've gotten take out a few times. I've gotten a different entree every time and they've all been great!"}
{"text":"Loved our chicken pad thai and yellow curry! great service and great selection of beer on draft! Such a cute little place! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have to say we have been looking for a little something different not just the same old same old. We found it the food is fresh and flavorful. Thai owned and operated small family style but still with a hip kind of vibe. They need a drink menu for sure but once they get that in place there ain't no stopping them from having a fantastic future as a destination Thai food night! Not to be missed the staff are quite friendly and efficient we really enjoyed our food and time spent eating it. Don't miss out get over here and eat!"}
{"text":"Food is was excellent! Decent price and very nice customer service. This will be our new go-to Thai place! Green thai tea was delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered the mild version of their Thai green curry with Tofu, zucchini , carrots and broccoli. Everything was perfectly cooked and it tasted amazing ! They even packed extra rice to go with the left over curry.   Service was quick ! I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  Ordered Pad Woon Sen, one of my staples.  It was overcooked and the bean thread noodles were clumped together.   GF has Pineapple curry.  She said it was Ok, but never touched the left overs so i know she was not impressed.  It was at the dinner hour on a Wednesday and I was the only one in there.  Hmmm...."}
