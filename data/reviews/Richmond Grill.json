{"text":"Utterly disappointed--can't even give 1 star but no choice. WORST restaurant experience ever. Usually very careful trying a new place--most reviews positive; perhaps new management? Came for brunch with fam of 16. Egg shells in food, cold coffee, no bananas, no hair net on cooks, no music/ambience. Service took forever, meals came with incorrect items as they ran out (could've told us before we ordered!). Wrap was in sandwich bread, ran out of home fries and white toast!?! We were the only customers there and they tell us our reservation was for 12:30 when I even called that morning to reconfirm it is 12 since I made res 2 weeks early and never heard from them. Our whole experience felt like a bad dream!! Do NOT eat here!"}
{"text":"Comfort Food !....my craving included Liver and Onions.....served with garlic mashed and veggies....washed down with a \"Golden Pheasant\" ale.....atmosphere was pleasant...no noisy music..or distractions from my meal ...being full, my guest and I shared a desert of chocolate decadence ... I would return !"}
{"text":"We decided to get take-out for a family gathering and they exceeded my expectations. The food was beyond amazing, everything was fresh and steaming, the ingredients were of very high-quality. The Veal Osso Bucco is a must, the meat was falling of the bone, tender and beyond delicious. Most braised meat dish has a monotone flavour profile, being overly rich and after the third bite it is just taste bland, however they braised the Veal Shanks beautifully. It had a dynamic flavour profile and was beyond delicious till the very last bite.   

Also the price is very reasonable when the food is this good. However the value skyrockets with the customer service you receive from these guys.

Overall, I am going to use them again if possible. However in the meantime, I am going to satisfy my cravings by visiting their restaurant."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to being back at Richmond Grill since we had good previous experiences here.   Had the beet salad and it was sour with a boatload of balsamic vinegar.   Same for my wife's organic field green salad.  Followed up with a veal chop and it tasted like it was past its due date.  Service was mediocre at best.   No one came by to ask how the dinner was.  My wife had requested a different side but that request was not fulfilled.  The only thing good was the martini."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Delicious food and professional service.
Highly recommend!
Best restaurant north of Toronto.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Back in its' heyday it used to be THE place to eat in Richmond Hill. People supposedly came from all over to have a great meal in a quaint little town. It's now 2009.... I can't say I would drive far and wide to eat here but it is good. 

Steaks here are amazing, cooked perfectly and aged well. I can't say the same about the appetizers and other menu items, unfortunately. Food here is good and you can tell the chefs know their way around the kitchen but nothing was amazing besides the steak. Food styling and prep are, well, a little dated with baby veg and small portions on huge plates. Service is attentive and relatively quick. 

The decor, like the plates, is very dated. Lots of green, tables and chairs look weathered. Maybe this place usde to be amazing but it has lost its touch and merely makes a decent restaurant.

Overall, the hype is long gone and the steaks are great. Not much value for money as portions are very small. Decor definitely needs some help."}
{"text":"First visit to this quaint restaurant. Fine dining atmosphere with menu to match. However, service levels were disappointing. We had reservations a month in advance for a group of 13 guests, for a late dinner (7:30pm).  Apparently, they did not anticipate the volume of patrons due to the theatre performance across the road.  This was the explanation given for the delay in getting water, drinks and menus out (more than 20 minutes after being seated). No bread was brought to the table.  We were the only group left in the restaurant (Tuesday night) and service throughout dinner was still slow.  Coffee was brought to the table cold.  Waiter had difficulty figuring out who's bills were who's.
The meal was tasty and a good portion. I didn't have the creme brûlée but I heard it was divine.  The food was the saving grace that my rating was not a single star.  For a fine dining experience, the service level did not meet expectations."}
{"text":"We visited Richmond Grill today for brunch. To start off we got our drinks. The orange juice was bitter and tasted old so we thought perhaps it was only the glass. Our waiter brought another glass and to our dismay it was the same. After waiting for a reasonable amount of time, our food arrived. Obviously \"steak\" is a word this restaurant uses very liberally. The steaks that were brought were approximately 1/3 of an inch thick and had many lumps of cartilage and inedible bits. The only reason this review is 2 stars is because the home fries were pretty good. I do not recommend this restaurant and would definitely not return."}
{"text":"We moved to the little village 2 weeks ago.  We dined there on a whim one night and loved it.  The service, the food...all very good.  The whole atmosphere is great and you can tell everyone loves working there. All the patrons we saw that came and went were happy as well."}
