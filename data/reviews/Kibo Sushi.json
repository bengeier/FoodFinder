{"text":"Tiny place full of flavours! Clean & delicious! Staff is very friendly and you will get your order super fast"}
{"text":"Got introduced to this place as a take out sushi place for lunch, WAY WAYYYYYYY better than anything else in the area. The sushi was fresh, really big, the selection was outstanding AND, what I love most about this place is they have all this auxiliary food like kimchi, extra ginger, gyoza, seaweed salads, soup, which area all delicious. The location sucks for them because no one would notice but they make up for that with their delicious food."}
{"text":"I need my sushi from Kibo right now! I visited Kibo Sushi during my trip to Toronto last summer. Honestly, I didn't have high expectations on sushi in Toronto... (Yes I am from Vancouver lol) but the food I got from Kibo  was AMAZING. Best place to have high-quality sushi in Toronto for sure!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever had. Easily.  Ordered through Foodora - 1 x sashimi and sushi platter + 1 x roll platter.   All of the fish was wet which means everything was frozen and defrosted.   The platter of rolls was all different sizes of california rolls. Zero variety despite having spoken to these guys on the phone.  For $70 plus, completely not worth it and disappointed.  Never again + cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered take away through Ritual. Salmon and avocado is $5.45 for 6 pieces if you order via Ritual but $5 if you order in person and pay in cash. More avocado than salmon (see picture). Fresh and delicious but the uneven avocado and salmon ratio bothered me. Miso soup is not included. I think I'll stick to CJ's which is a block away, more balanced and throws in soup for free."}
{"text":"This is a convenient sushi spot for nearby condo dwellers. They have a few seats for those looking to dine in, but they have a lot of \"cash and carry\" sushi packs for those who need a quick take out meal. For $5, you can get 8 rolls of spicy salmon or spicy tuna, California, or yam. The spicy salmon is a bit too minced up, but it's good value overall."}
{"text":"Excellent service, speed, portions, price and taste. Sushi rolls have the perfect filling/rice ratios, which seems to be a rare find in Toronto. A nice and quiet place to eat-in, and also a conveniently-located place to get takeout. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've gone here for dinner a few times and countless times for takeout. You really can't beat their prices for take out - $5 flat for 8 piece spicy salmon or salmon avocado roll. They also have fancier rolls like Dynamite (plus salmon sushi) for $10 which is a bigger portion as well. The quality is a lot better than the typical sushi places and for the prices, the value is amazing. I love the staff there as well, always friendly and smiling."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. They took my order for pick up. I waited close to 20 minutes outside and came back in when I noticed that other people who came in after got their order. When I went back in to ask about my order I found out they forgot it. How silly is that? So I waited another 10 minutes and they refused to admit they made a mistake. I WILL NEVER give them my business again. NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!"}
{"text":"They frequently screw up your order so pls make sure to check it before you leave the store. This is the second time it's happened to me and when you bring it to their attention they don't do anything about it."}
{"text":"This is my new fave sushi spot in town.  Been to Kibo over a handful of times last month alone.  It is a small resturant but the quality of their fish is super fresh and the price is very resonable.  I def will be ordering more from Kibo soon. My go to is the party platter A which is only $26 for 32 pieces."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or to catch up with a friend. Delicious, well priced sushi is made fresh to order or you can grab a pre-made container to go. The waiters are super friendly and pop is only $1. I really liked the inari sushi, spicy tuna roll and gyoza soup. The ambiance is pretty quaint and the tables are few and close together.   This is more of a take away place but offers the option to sit down if you'd like (which I did and because the tables are so close I got to eavesdrop on the guys next to me talking about tinder dates - don't worry they were pretty decent guys)."}
{"text":"i am blown away. this sushi was amazing, especially since its hard to find good sushi in the area!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a go-to for me. The fish is fresh, not too much rice and they're very cheerful. $5 cash specials on a couple staple rolls, and the menu is also available on the Ritual app. I eat here almost once a week. The dine-in space is very small and cozy so be prepared to leave smelling like tempura or deep fry. It's really a take- out spot for me when I'm too lazy to cook or need a quick fix on a busy day."}
{"text":"The spicy salmon maki here is so good and my co-worker whom I shared with agreed! The avocado crunch and yam/avocado rolls here are less exciting fare - I'd definitely recommend picking the specialty rolls. When I placed my first dinner order here it also came with free miso soup :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever, waited a really long time, the waitress served the wrong dish and we were asked to leave after we finished the meal shortly.  Very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery: salmon teriyaki bento box combo. The salmon was raw (for pregnant wife) so that was already a bad start, the miso soup that was included was not included, as well as the additional California roll that was ordered. To top it all off there was a hair in the bento box noodles.  This is the second time ordering from kibo. The first was average so gave it another shot, safe to say won't be eating/ordering from here again."}
{"text":"A small sushi shop, I often got there to get some take away and enjoy the specials (2x boxes of sushi for 10$). Drinks are 1$.   Staff is friendly, sometimes it is busy especially on Friday/Saturday night as they have a lot of online order. If your special is not available they will prepare t on the stop.   There are like 2 outdoor tables where you can it, and 3 or 4 tables inside. Decor is cute, Japan inspired.   Accept cards but specials are cash only."}
{"text":"Ordered10 dollars Combo A from ritual for lunch.this is definitely nor worth 10$ !!! WTF so little portion."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in town :) I love the presentation, ambiance and friendly services here. The sushi is yummy and i much enjoy spending my time. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Truly a fan - I constantly order here for lunch and dinner, and the service and quality is always consistent.   For a better deal, sushi boxes on the fridge are $5/each!"}
{"text":"I went here the first day they opened with my boyfriend. We sat in and ordered 3 dishes: black dragon; salmon lover and tuna tataki! I really really like this place and I think it fills a real sushi void in the King area! The location is a little covert - so keep an eye out.  The food was delicious and i enjoyed the care they took in the miso soup and the green salad. The service was very genuine. As I live nearby, I will frequent regularly :) !"}
{"text":"Just tried the new Kibo location at 36 Charlotte St by King and Spadina! Very familiar feel to one of the other Kibo locations at St. Clair which I frequent often and the same great food and friendly service! Will be coming here often great stop for those working closeby downtown."}
{"text":"love this place.never had a bad experience.food is always fresh and delicious. the people working there are always friendly. I usually order takeout but i've eaten in as well. would give 5 stars,but service is a tad slower in the restaurant than if getting takeout"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall type of sushi joint.  No frills and Korean owned.  Seats limited but service is fast and friendly. Sushi is relatively fresh and tasty.  Take-out runs supreme here.  Will be returning for take-out daily specials."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite quick-stop eats downtown because it's close to my office and it's consistently great quality sushi. It's a cosy little cafe space so take out is normally the way to go. But you can't go wrong with $5 rolls (cash and take out). Also on Ritual!"}
{"text":"Overall I was pretty disappointed with the experience. We ordered two bento boxes on Ritual - one with teriyaki chicken and the other with beef. The beef one came with California rolls, but we paid $1 extra to exchange it for spicy salmon rolls...however when we got home we realized they had still given us the California rolls.   The chicken was not very good. It was dry and tasted like it had been frozen. There was not very much teriyaki sauce either...The beef tasted alright but it was cold, as was the rice.   The tempura was the only thing that saved this review from 2 stars as it was actually pretty tasty.   It did come with salad and soup, so overall it was pretty filling."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch quite often because it's convenient and fast. Great prices for the sushi you get and although it can get quite busy, I haven't had much any issues with the service. Definitely not a luxury restaurant but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and affordable. Rarely can I gorge myself on good sushi for less than $30 but Kibo makes that happen. I've been to this location twice and can safely say that it's my favourite restaurant. The simple cheaper rolls are delicious and make for a cheap meal. If you want to splurge a little I highly recommend the scallop dragon roll: SO FRESH!"}
{"text":"The food is good, for Toronto standards (Japanese food in this city is not the best). My favourite is the tampura, they actually season it and the batter is kept light. Prices are alright. Service is not that great though. I give this place a 4/5 because the food is better than other options in the area."}
{"text":"I've only ever had their take-out sushi/delivery, and for those times they were very good and always prompt with the service. They always packed the sushi really well and give a good amount of utensils and sauce trays. I've tried their green dragon/salmon rolls and also their party trays are plentiful to feed 4 people. Definitely will be continuing to go here for sushi delivery."}
{"text":"Prices are cheap. Tried the love boat and was disappointed with the quality of the fish, which looked and tasted dry and not fresh at all . Tempura was the better half of the meal. Will probably not come again"}
{"text":"Not the greatest place for dining in as its very small and has a lineup that sometimes can lead outside the door - but thaaat is for a reason. This is probably one of my favourite sushi joints in Toronto. Always fresh and consistent. Yam + Avocado roll isn't usually my top fav roll, but at Kibo it is!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this cute looking little place for lunch. I ordered the sushi / sashimi combo. I wanted to have some japanese beer with my meal but I was told they don't serve any alcohol. The seating was extremely cramped and people kept opening the door picking up sushi and it was basically cold there all the time.  The meal itself was very underwhelming and below average in quality. Salmon was good but everything else was just dull and tasteless. Salad dressing was very sour. Sushi rolls had way too much rice. Too many strikes against this place to come back."}
{"text":"Greatnfood and great place. It was a great find through Yelp! Visiting Toronto and looking for good sushi"}
{"text":"Decent sushi for an on-the-go snack or meal!   If you download some app and order their sushi online you get $5 off."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good quality sushi for a tiny shop! Plates are garnished well and miso is authentic. Chef substituted salmon in our dynamite roll because of a shellfish allergy - unexpected considerate twist!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Kibo - went through JustEat and ordered a party platter for delivery later in the day. Arrived on time, presentation of rolls was well done and quality of food was great. I would ask for more ginger/wasabi if ordering a platter as it was minimal. Otherwise, pleased with this place and will order again."}
{"text":"Everything about this store is ok, nothing is bad. The 5$ box + a soda is enough to get you full. Alright freshness and taste. You will not be disappointed but at the same time will not be awed :)"}
{"text":"Food was good - the waitress not super friendly   We ordered Beef Aburi Shiu Mai  Spicy dragon rolls Kibo California rolls Two salmon hand rolls Green dragon rolls Chapchae  So looks like mix of Korean and Japanese food.   The rolls are on the large side so hard to take a full bite. They are trying to pack a lot of stuff in - if they don't it would be better actually.   Also great location.      Lots of people floating in for take out so I think that's what I would do next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! I recommend the Bento box D. it comes with tempura or teriyaki,  sushis sashimi, rice and  edamame! Best value in town!"}
{"text":"I come here when I need a quick sushi fix. They have a similar walk in deal to CJ lunch box where you get a 6 piece roll for $5. I prefer the quality here over CJ's, the rolls are made slightly better. I tend to stick to my usual spicy salmon rolls. Another one of my favourite items is the veggie gyoza tempura. It's nice and crispy and it comes with a spicy sauce. I recommend ordering on ritual though, the line can get quite long if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and looking for something for dinner. I mentioned this place was really close and had great reviews. We were not sorry! The food was delicious, the restaurant was cozy, the sushi was generous. My husband accidentally left his phone and the waitress literally ran half a block to bring it to him! This restaurant made our first evening in Toronto special. We're already talking about going back before we leave!"}
{"text":"Definitely looks more like a chaotic hole in the wall takeout place - we wound up here despeate for a fix after another place kicked us out because it was \"too close\" to closing time.  It wasn't fancy, but the prices were fair and it was good enough. I get the impression that it was a high volume joint for the lunch rush, and honestly, it was not too bad.  Don't go for it as a sit down joint - this really is a take out."}
{"text":"In Toronto for the weekend with some friends to watch a soccer game, needed something to eat before hand in a short amount of time. Was really good, great price, and super friendly"}
{"text":"It was at a walking distance from my workplace and once a week lunch place for me.  This is the place why I started eating sushi in the first place. I wasn't a sushi fan. I had tried it from several restaurant but never liked it very much.  My workplace fam was a fan of this place and used to get lunch from them all the time so I decided to get it myself as well. When I had their spicy salmon roll the first time, it blew my mind. It was amazing, so nice and fresh. Since that day it became one of my favorite lunch spots. I have tried their miso soup as well and it's good, I've had better. Take my advice and try this place out and I promise you that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the 20 piece Sashimi, it was ok.  Came with Miso and Salad.  However, it didn't come with the supplemental white rice! I'm still starving after eating this.  Usually when you order Sashimi, you always get a side of rice to fill you up and to enjoy the sashimi.  When you order sushi, you don't get rice. That's how it works.  Looks like a miss from the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place had great food but when we got our order half of the food we ordered wasn't delivered. We called and asked them about it they said in 40 minutes they'd bring it. An hour n half later nothing has came. We got no refund for the food we didn't get. Definitely, will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"The rating is low because of their customer service or lack thereof. Every time I come to this location, I get greeted with attitude. Seems like a bother I am asking to order food to sit in or take away. The only reason I keep coming back is because the food is really good & it's in a good location."}
{"text":"This was a delicious sushi place! We ordered takeout and the food was ready in less than 10 minutes. had the chirashi don and my partner got a maki combo. The fish was fresh, and the makis were not skimpy. I wish there was a bit more fish in the chirashi. I think there are special $5 deals everyday if you pay cash. Great value sushi. It's one of the cheaper and reasonably priced sushi places downtown. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and received hard, stale sushi set and roll. I called the restaurant and all they could say was sorry, what I received met their minimum quality standards (which is absurd to think a place would give their patrons such terrible quality of food) - so I can get 10% off the next time I want to order. Why the **** would I want 10% off an order I'm never going to place because the customer service and quality I had just experienced was atrocious?? I could honestly get better quality sushi from the \"day old\" pile at the mall kiosk.  Most frustrating experience. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Just tried this place on foodora and all I have to say is WOW!  For an affordable sushi place, we were blown away by the quality and care of the food.  We ordered the \"love boat\" which comes with miso soup, salad, tempura, edamame, and 32 pieces of sushi.  I must warn you though, it was A LOT of food and would say it's better for a party of 3 (and that's even after moving all day and not eating anything)  To top it off, they gave a free salmon avocado roll with a cute note which really made our day.  We just moved and already found out new local sushi joint, yay!"}
{"text":"Great for delivery!  I ordered Kibo through UberEATS and I must say I'm very impressed with this delivery sushi.  Black Dragon Roll ($14.90) - filling to rice ratio is very fair - the portion was a lot bigger than I had anticipated  Chirashi Don ($18.25) - about 12 slices of sashimi - they give you A LOT of rice; there is an option for brown rice for an extra $1 - fish was overall quite fresh, but I think their rolls are better in quality and value so will probably stick to rolls next time  Definitely put this one on your sushi delivery list!"}
{"text":"Very average sushi, I can't say it's the best I've ever had. May or may not buy from them again, I think I'd rather give other restaurants a try. I got the daily special, the salmon was good, but the sushi rice itself tasted cheap. To me it's the sushi rice that makes or break good sushi. Unfortunately I don't think it made it for this restaurant.   I had no problem with the service though. The service was good."}
{"text":"We order from here a lot through Foodora but have never dined in.  I always get the Bento D with tofu teriyaki with the sashimi option. The sashimi is so fresh and tasty. My husband orders the Bento E and there is PLENTY of food in his meal. The bentos come with a small portion of really yummy glass noodle sesame salad. It feels more special and creative than the sides that come with other sushi place's bentos.  Never a bad delivery meal from here, which is a rare find in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"the rolls here are amazing. from the tri state area, so i'm used to good sushi, and this place has good sushi"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've had but it's not bad. I usually get the tuna, salmon, or tamago sushi. I've gotten the dynamite roll once and did not enjoy it. I would stick to the nigiri sushi if you go here. Place is small and gets really warm when it's hot outside so normally I just get take out! They are pretty fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to neighbourhood sushi joint. Place is small - but good for a quick lunch or dinner if you want to eat in. Best value is their carry-out special, they have $5 (cash) sushi and each time I've gotten them, they taste fresh and delicious. You get 6-8 rolls with varieties like dynamite, salmon avocado, yam tempura, spicy salmon, etc. You can pay debit/credit, but they add $0.25 to the charge. I've also gotten to love using Ritual, as you'll earn rewards. Service is always pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto over the week on business and decided to get some sushi. I currently live in the states and have eaten sushi from good and not so good places all around the states.   Kibo had great reviews so we walked there.  It was a little hole in the wall place, but those also tend to be some of the best hidden restaurants in cities. We ordered the Spider roll and Dragon roll which were both huge rolls. I have never seen such sloppy sushi ever before. The rolls didn't stick, just fell apart. They didn't taste fresh at all. Almost as if they were sitting in a fridge and just set out for us.   Generally I don't write bad reviews unless it was really justified. I don't think this place deserves 4.5 stars. The restaurant inspections were expired by 7 months (clearly shown on the front door). Probably one of the worst sushi places I've been to. Next time I'm in town I'll pass on Kibo."}
{"text":"AMAZING SUSHI & EXPERIENCE!!! It's hidden, right off Charlotte st, and it's very small, but the sushi is so delicious! You even get hot tea served with your meal when you eat at the restaurant. The staff was very kind and service was great. The prices are extremely decent, as well! We were the only ones in the restaurant so we received great service! HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR SUSHI LOVERS!"}
{"text":"I discovered Kibo since it was downstairs from my friend's apartment and I absolutely love it!   It's a small restaurant, but the service is super friendly and prompt, the food quality is good, the portions are generous and the price is awesome! It's more of a take-away restaurant, but I had a filling sushi dinner in the core of downtown Toronto for $10 - you can't beat that.  The restaurant is also very tech-savy appealing to app users from Ritual and Foodora.  I definitely would say Kibo is a hidden gem downtown and if you're looking to fill up in the area, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Summary: a good fast-food sushi place in Downtown Toronto  I discovered this place through Ritual app. This place has a hidden location, a bit hard to find. It is a small place, so it would be better just to order to-go. The sushi quality is pretty good, better than most fast-food sushi I have tried. I ordered daily special, which come with 16 pieces of sushi, and I could not finish it. Tip: ask for more wasabi and ginger"}
{"text":"Love Kibo!!! I first discovered them when I ordered from them on Just Eat. They had an awesome combo with like 3 spicy rolls for 13 bucks, which is pretty good for after lunch time. They delivered it promptly and it was good quality!! Including the rice to fish ratio :) The following week I returned with my dad to the actual restaurant. We discovered it was a tiny hole in the wall, but nonetheless still good! Even with their dishware, instead of plates they just serve it to you in the little take out trays! kind of funny. I'll continue giving them business I like them! And you gotta watch out for sushi places down here, there's some bad ones!"}
{"text":"Pretty good quality and value. There are many great sushi places around the city - Yasu, Miku, JaBistro, etc. but when you want quick take out that's good and won't break the bank there aren't many options. Kibo fills that void for us! Prices are reasonable and sushi is pretty good."}
