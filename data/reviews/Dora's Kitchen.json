{"text":"You wouldnt be able to tell there is a restaurant from the outside but it is there and it is awesome! So glad I took a chance on this place. Every time I have been there the food is great. Love the mexican food and my buddy always gets the Greek Gyro and says it is also amazing. Would love if it was open on the weekend but it will just have to be a place for lunch on weekdays."}
{"text":"Dora's is a great little spot... inside a liquor store. Want to enjoy a \"40\" with your lunch? Have at it! This place is better than BYOB because you can buy anything your heart desires and it will be cold and priced reasonably.

I had the chicken chimi when I went a couple months back. It was delicious and I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I'm always go to Dora's but what I like the most is how nice they are, I been eating here for 4 years and this year I become a vegetarian they always do my food with out meat of course but they add beans or avocado to it and I feel like they support me even with all my crazy diets and cravings ,I'm going to miss them"}
{"text":"Greek Mexican food. Enough said.......

{"text":"I was surprised to find this place was in a corner convenient store.  The kitchen was very clean and the food that came out of it was delicious.  I got ground beef and shredded beef hard tacos and a chicken enchiladas platter on my second day in town which was a Tuesday.  On my way to the airport on Friday I stopped and got the chicken enchiladas platter again."}
{"text":"Great food,  friendly staff.  Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some decent food. 

Don't be disuaded by the look of the outside, the inside holds great treasures."}
{"text":"Phoenix sort of has this thing going on where everyone says they know the best taco shop. I honestly think Dora's Kitchen is probably One of the most overlooked taco stands in the entire city. I've stopped here a few times I didn't even realize they had a kitchen inside. I have tried everyone's \"best taco shop\" in the city and I have to tell you that this place is the very best tacos I've ever eaten in my life. What's even better is they will customize your order for you without any problems, unlike some places. 

It's worth the drive for lunch!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Tiny little restaurant inside a liquor store in an industrial section of Phoenix. Has about 6 booth tables. The feel and vibe of the place is definitely rough around the edges...it's restaurant inside a liquor store after all! I'm guessing most people would be intimidated to enter or eat here. Patrons are blue collars. 

Food: Your typical selection of Mexican food (burritos/tacos/tortas) as well as some Greek dishes (gyros/pita chicken wraps). I had the focacia (chicken pita wrap with chipotle mayo) and it was delicious. As far as beverages you have the liquor/store at your disposal.

Price: Not bad, $6.50 for the chicken wrap. Generous portions. Thought it might be cheaper but oh well.

Service: Very attentive. You order your food up front, pay at a separate counter, beverages come off the shelf.

Summary: I really dig places like these because it's by no means your typical restaurant. Takes a little a courage to walk in if you're not use to a restaurant like this but it's well worth it to the adventurous foodie."}
{"text":"My new office happens to be within a stone's throw of some of the best little Mexican joints in town. Due to this, I have gained about 4 pounds in the last two months and have eaten an obscene number of breakfast burritos. I like my chorizo burros, but my office mates prefer more Americanized ingredients like bacon and ham - which is why we generally wind up ordering from Dora's - something for everyone!

Due to its proximity, speed and reasonable prices, we have recently started ordering lunch from Dora's. The tacos and lunch burritos are some of the best in the area, and my co-worker swears they have the best green chile around - which the owner told me they make fresh in house, and you can buy in a large side to go. Since I have been overindulging in Mexican food of late I decided to try the chicken gyro for lunch on my last visit. They were out of chicken so I went ahead and ordered the lamb, against my better judgment. The gyro was well made, on a super fresh pita, but the lamb just wasn't my thing. They also offer a Greek Salad for $5.95... so as I prepare for a couple upcoming weddings that may be my next order. 

The 'restaurant' is in the back of a market called \"Minute Liquor\" so you can pick up pretty much any sort of beverage you'd like to go with your meal. Cervesa anyone? It may seem a little strange to find a dining establishment located in the back of a liquor store, but the neighborhood is rife with these little combo shops and the kitchen is clean and the food is good and economical, so I can navigate the aisles of beer and chips in the mini-market to the back of the tiny shop for my lunch."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 2 years at least 2 to 3 times a week and for the most part I get the same thing, A Redbull and a sandwich. Well today they were extremely busy for lunch and it was a little bit of a wait which was no problem but my unopened Redbull got warm so I swapped it out for a cold one in the cooler, then got my food and Proceeded to leave and the owners wife told me I had to pay for my Redbull (which I already had) and told me I was trying to steal it. I asked her to look at her transactions on her register and she wouldn't do it, and continued to accuse me of stealing l. I would be able to give her a receipt but she never gives anybody receipts for their transactions. I don't appreciate being Accused of stealing especially because I'm a regular, I will never spend another penny here."}
{"text":"Gave it try and super excited!!!! Hole in the wall gem! I got the Carne Asada and Egg Burrito. Huge burrito for only $5.75!!! It taste's so good!!! I will be returning and letting all my co-workers know. I hope they will cater a corporate lunch for us!!"}
{"text":"I purchased a coupon from restaurant.com the other week. You pay a certain amount depending on the increment and then you have to order a bill twice as much as whatever increment you got, mine was $15 so I was ready to order $30 of food. It took me that long to use it because they aren't open on weekends and they close at 5. I finally got to go today and no one was attending the register. When she saw me she came up, I showed her my coupon and she rolls her eyes and says to wait and leaves, another woman comes up and says that its old and they aren't doing that anymore, the woman tried to hang onto my coupon and I grabbed it from her. If she calls the number on there it will make my coupon invalid and I will lose the $15. my mom who was with me asked when they expire and I showed her where it said it never expires. Yea right! I can't comment on the food because after that visit I wasn't going to buy anything from there."}
{"text":"Best bean tostado I  ever ate.  Not your regular bean and cheese.  Love the avacado, lettuce, tomato, and feta cheese.  The beans were delicious also.   Yummy.   They  also delivered to my apartment."}
{"text":"Its really too bad about this place, its right near my work, quick and easy but then when the cook calls out my order rather than saying 'Sir your order is ready' he looks at me and says 'Cabron order'. Not a nice thing to call someone at all. The food does look good but unfortunately I ended up throwing it out, I dont trust people like this."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in my entire life. Everything I've had on the menu is absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend that you get down here as soon as possible and order something"}
{"text":"You would miss it if you were just passing by; but, this place is great. Good food!"}
