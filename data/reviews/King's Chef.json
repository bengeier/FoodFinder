{"text":"Finally! A Chinese restaurant in North Mesa!  Such nice service, clean, and my kung pao chicken was delicious, perfectly cooked with loads of veggies and mushrooms. My husband enjoyed his peppered steak and we left very happy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So enjoy dining at this small Mesa venue! We have delighted in the always tasty fare! Our experience has been enriched by the courtesies extended by the manager and wait staff! Today was decidedly different since the man working the counter was rude, insolent and argumentative! When we asked for the manager this man rudely advised us the manager and the owner were not on site. We then politely asked for his name. At this point he replied it was \"no name\"!  Mr. No name does this business no favors! Mr. No name should not be in customer service as he was rude to other diners and took telephone orders just as rudely! Food service industry is a risky business venture; however, employing someone like Mr. No name is detrimental!"}
{"text":"Love this place always fresh and delicious! Gave this a try from posted reviews glad I did."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Incredible prices. Free bottled water. Friendly staff. Very impressive."}
{"text":"Love the food, fresh and crispy. The service was excellent, glasses were kept full. Portions are impressive for how much the plate costs. Will definitely be back. Small place but really quality food and service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out. Restaurant was small and very clean. Both cashiers were friendly and helpful with making my selection. I got Sweet and Sour Pork dinner and Teriyaki Chicken dinner both came with egg rolls and crab puffs. I also add a side of Lo Mein plain noodles. Price was very good for the amount of food I got. Food was cooked fast, everything was very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered their lunch special. It's quality food and great for a quick lunch (trumps panda for sure). Their lunch special includes an eggroll and a crab puff. However, they package these together and appear to be using real crab meat. I have a seafood allergy and because of this automatic inclusion I was unable to enjoy or sample the eggroll. Something for them to consider. 

Otherwise, it was a pleasant, efficient, and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Great place. Service was fast and Friendly. Restaurant was Clean, inside was updated, food was hot and fresh and you can't beat the $6.25 lunch special! I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I love their large selection of entrees. You also get a lot for the price and it's delicious. Some dishes were a little too salty for me though and the wait times are a little long. First time I waited 45min and second time about 30min. Overall it's good though and I'll definitely go back. Next time I'll just call my order in so I don't have to wait."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal! I've had wonton soup three days in a row now! I've also had their crab puffs, spring roll, fried rice, and General Tso's chicken. It's all been excellent. I've tried several Chinese restaurants since just recently moving to AZ and was very unsatisfied but, this place is amazing! It will definitely be my go to from now on. The staff is super friendly, it's clean, every thing is made fresh, and best of all it's super close to me!! So excited to have this new Chinese joint for all my Chinese food needs and cravings! Five stars for sure! You guys deserve it!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service! I have been eating there frequently because of the reason I already gave you."}
{"text":"Do not be Detered.by complaints about plastic wear and bottled drinks served here. I am thrilled about the expensive HEAVY utensils, bowls and take out containers they provide. I like that they forego dealing with rewashing and sanitizing dishes. If I want silver will bring my own. The FOOD is worth trying then decide and the meat does NOT taste frozen. I like that bottled water and drinks are offered...less chance of bad AZ water and unclean fountain risks...kudos that they concentrate on a fair price for Quality Food!!!
Only 5 days and couldn't resist returning to sample a few more items off this restaurants menu. 
This time I ordered a chicken egg roll. It is larger than the vegetable ones served with the combo lunch or dinners. Chicken is a noticable change. Again the crab puffs are delicious! They are better than anyone else in my opinion.
Next we ordered off the lunch menu: Shrimp Egg Foo Young with sauce on the side...a generous helping of plump/thick Chinese style omelets well worth reordering, very good! Green Pepper Beef w/onion with a delicate sauce that reminded me of a recipe of a renowned chef long ago. All that was missing from that long ago time was a hint of pineapple and a touch of fresh tomato...probably more USA touch but a Beverly Hills Specialty no less 
Next we added the Mushroom Beef with a white sauce and sweet pea pods...delicious! Then General Taos Chicken. Not a battered meat fan I loved the sauce and presentation but prefer the chicken on the Teriyaki offering best. However, unlike other restaurants...the meat if ALL 4 disnes was succulent, very tender and so far none overcooked!
We tried the egg flower, hot sour, and won ton soups...all three surpassed expectations. All arrived scalding hot. I personally love hot sour soup, but would be happy with any of the three. The Chef knows how to prepare all to a tee!
I will return soon...there are so many dishes I am excited to order before coming back for favorites. I almost took a qt of hot sour soup, but would prefer eating here more than at home.
Hard to decide absolute favorites just yet...but this is my go to place for Chinese...well worth the 5 & 8 mile trip."}
{"text":"So far everything we have gotten has been really great. They also give you a lot of food!! We tried the fried rice, egg drop soup, sesame chicken and orange chicken. I highly recommend it. We have been looking for our go to Chinese spot and we just found it."}
{"text":"I would come here for the hot and sour soup and prices, but that's about it. The sauce on teriyaki has a weird cinnamon flavor and didn't taste anything like normal teriyaki. The chicken dishes are fatty dark frozen meat deep fried. Did not enjoy the teriyaki or General tso's and would never come back to eat either."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to get some won ton soup for my wife and had great conversation with the staff. The food smelt so good that I ended up ordering more food then what I went in for. Got home the food was fantastic this will definitely be my new go to Chinese restaurant. Can not wait to get back in there and try something new!!!!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open and was excited to finally get to try it. The inside is clean because everything is new, but there's not much decor so everything is very basic. No sofa fountain so you have to buy bottled or can drinks which mean no refills. There's only 5 tables inside which seems to be filled with people waiting for takeout orders which was annoying since we went for dinner with the plan to eat in, so we decided to take it home instead. I often get large family meals for football Sundays from other Chinese places and was again excited to see what this place had to offer but their smallest family deal is $90 so they lost me there, which I found odd when they seem to have great lunch specials. Now for the food itself, it's good! This is our new go-to place for Chinese food, and I definitely recommend you check them out. I hope they can fix a few of their short comings and go from a good restaurant to a great one, but for now we'll stick with ordering take out."}
{"text":"Had to try this place out since it's so close to our house. The place itself was very clean and the people working were extremely nice and very attentive. I had General Tso's chicken and my wife had the Shrimp Fried Rice. My chicken was very tasty and the sauce was delicious, I was hoping for a little more rice but overall was very satisfied. The shrimp fried rice was not as good but mainly due to the shrimp they use, they were tiny and lacked flavor. They tasted like water to be honest. If I had ordered the shrimp for myself my review would be closer to 2.5. Changing the shrimp would make it much better. I'm looking forward to trying other things on the menu, will definitely come back but not for the shrimp."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to eat out and so we were so excited when a new Chinese restaurant came into our neighborhood. When trying out a new restaurant we normally order a large spread and variety of platters at the same time to get a feel for the restrauant. In this particular King's Chef order we took it to go. We started off with  a disappointing start as they gave us a pre-made ling ling frozen spring rolls instead of egg rolls that we had ordered.  Things got a little bit better with their delicious crab puffs and wonton soup... although my husband said the broth was pretty weak (he ended up adding some beef bouillon to the broth to finish it) but the wontons were delicious! Next up was their sweet and sour pork which was their best dish that they served that night! The pork was tender, flavorful and I really like that they put the sauce on the side so we could add as little or as much sweet and sour sauce we wanted! The platter of beef and broccoli was equally amazing! The only disappointment with this dish was that on their menu it said it came with broccoli,  carrots and garlic brown sauce and unfortunately ours came with mushrooms instead of carrots. So just know they do take liberty to change their menu so you'll just have to ask about it on a daily basis. Next we tried their sesame chicken and it was a hit...all except that our chicken was drowning in sauce. There are those out there who only like white meat and if that's the case I probably would be very careful in ordering any of their chicken dishes as that all the chicken platters that we ordered had dark meat there was very little to no white meat given. Next step was their General Tao chicken which was marked spicy but had no spice or kick at all :( and much like the sesame chicken it was also drowning in sauce. Once you scraped off some of the sauce it was quite delicious though. Last but not least was their fried rice which was pretty stingy on the vegetables and ended up being average. With that all said and done, my husband I will probably most likely come back again if only for the bbq pork, sesame chicken and the beef and broccoli platters... we'll stick to getting our ohgeneral Tao chicken from the Walmart deli."}
{"text":"This is a true winner, the prices are very fair and the service is fantastic, the employees come around to make sure that everything is ok and to see if you are enjoying the meal.  

I can see a great future for this establishment the food is really good, the only down side is that the eating area is small, so be willing  to share your table with strangers...I did and we had a great time."}
{"text":"Okay, 2nd visit. Still only 3 stars. I like Mei Fun.  Theirs is decent.  I had to request an upgrade in beef. It was still so thin and dry. The broccoli beef was good. The spring rolls and egg rolls taste like pre made frozen.   Not to my liking. We will try 1 more time and go from there."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place. Since moving here a decade ago from the Boston area, I haven't found a truly good Chinese restaurant. Well, that search is finally over. 

This establishment shares the plaza with my local Fry's with which I was doing some shopping (for dinner funny enough). My wife, daughter and I come out and are immediately enticed by the intoxicating aroma. Well, I gave into my hunger and I stopped in to get a take out order. The place was pretty full but the lovely ladies behind the counter were super friendly and welcomed me while handing me a printed menu. 

I ordered hot and sour soup (I judge a place on this alone. It is so good and so easy to screw up), spring rolls and pork fried rice (a staple) while my wife got their chicken teriyaki combo to split with my daughter. It was a short wait and the order was ready.

Holy moly was the bag huge. For $23ish, I was blown away by the value in quantity alone. The wonderful smell wasn't just from the outside alone, my bag was full of wafting odorous delights. 

Getting home we were met with more food that we even guessed and man o' man was it scrumptious. My wife's teriyaki was a full on grilled chicken breast (skin on) covered in a flavorful teriyaki glaze. None of that goo you get from some places. Our rice and spring rolls (combos get a choice of white, brown or fried rice, spring rolls and a crab puff) were delish. The spring rolls themselves were crisp and piping hot. The rice was full of veggies and BBQ pork.  My wife also really enjoyed the crab puff. I hate them in general so I'll take her word on it. 

As for my main thing, the soup... Wow... Just wow.  A little sour tang, a hint of heat. Full of mushrooms, bamboo shoots, tofu, egg. A meal in an of itself. Top it off with wonderful and complex flavor and you have a hit. 

Can't wait come back. It might be a bit because I have so much leftovers to get through (kidding, I'll be back in like a week)."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a great Chinese restaurant close by for years now!!!! And we found it! Restaurant is clean and fresh and food is delish!!! Vegetables are crisp and fresh and I love the kung pao shrimp!"}
{"text":"We came to this location with high expectations due to the favorable reviews and because we were craving Asian food, which the area seems to lack. I must say this wasn't what we expected. 

First of all, because of the reviews, we were expecting something more authentic, but this place is quite americanized. Although I like the combo option, the dishes are generic and contains a lot of salt. It seems like not much thought was put into constructing the dishes because the flavors could definitely be better. 

Some other reviews mentioned that service is fantastic but no one greeted us when we walked in even though the restaurant was not busy. However, they were very nice when they brought us our food. 

Lastly, the atmosphere is far from ideal. The restaurant had a TV that was playing a baking food competition. There is nothing wrong with that, but due to the silly nature of the show and the exaggerated personality of the hostess, it made the restaurant noisy. Also, I'm not sure how a funny baking competition is relevant to the restaurant's targeted audience who came to enjoy Chinese cuisine. The show's high volume made it a bit hard to communicate. 

Overall, the other reviews are relevant because everyone has different expectations. But this is by no means a place for authentic Chinese cuisine. In fact, I would say it's more of a takeout place than sit-down restaurant. So keep that in mind before visiting."}
{"text":"First time here and staff is supppper nice and food is so good!!! Really good lunch deals"}
{"text":"All I can say is yummy and close to home!!! I got the Mongolian beef with white rice my wife got shrimp and vegetables with noodles ( cost extra but she claims it's worth it. ) I've been here a few times now and the best time is for lunch and dinning in. The soup is the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"WORST FOOD POISONING I'VE HAD since living in a third world country. I know it came from here because other family members got very sick also and King's Chef is the only food we had in common. I'm writing this from the bathroom floor where I've been for the last 12 hours. Never visiting this restaurant again, which is a bummer because the food was tasty and well priced. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"We got take out from here and there were some complications with our order. (Won't get into the logistics, but basically, there was major miscommunication between me and the staff). I actually felt pretty bad as it seemed like it was partially my fault... but they were SOOOOO kind about the mistake. Not only did they give us the correct order for free but also gave us a couple free sodas for the mistake. I rarely write about service alone but this service was so beyond what I expected I have to give them props! 

As for the food, it honestly was delicious. I ordered chicken lo mein and their \"home style tofu\" which was perfect :) 

I will definitely return here and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"I am lot sure what I was expecting, but I had hoped for a good Chinese restaurant near me. I went there shortly after they opened. The food was average, like so many fast food places, it was drenched in sauce and the egg roll was a little doughy. 
The service was good, the gentleman who took my order was polite and answered all my questions. 
I would probably go back there and make adjustments with my order (ask for light sauce), because I am hoping that I find something I actually like there."}
{"text":"We came to the opening day today and I think there was way more business than they anticipated which is great news! Today we waited for about 15 minutes but the food was very fresh and very tasty! My wife is 9 months pregnant and was waiting for this place to open since it's near our house and we are happy to say we will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Ordered three meals here. They were fine and had big portions also. Nothing really that stands out. Service was good. 

Should I say I'm from blank city so I know what I'm talking about here? Lol.  

Give it a try if you are in the area.  because the rest of the Chinese food is not good in north Mesa."}
{"text":"Anything with breaded chicken is TERRIBLE--it tastes like they buy it frozen in bulk from Costco. Other dishes are OK but nothing special.

This is another restaurant that serves even meals eaten in the restaurant on plastic plates and provides only plastic utensils. They don't care enough about their business or the planet to invest in plates, silverware or a dishwasher, so I'm not going to invest in it either."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on opening day yesterday and service was quick and staff were very friendly. We ate there during their soft opening and the food has been delicious each time. Nice portions for lunch menu too.  They are just getting started and I hope they succeed.  We loved it!"}
{"text":"Finally, a great Chinese restaurant in Northeast Mesa.  The food is fresh and a great value for the portion size. The service is fast and friendly.  The menu for lunch and dinner has a great variety of options.  The pricing is very fair in comparison to other Chinese restaurants that offer subpar quality.  
I've loved the teriyaki chicken and lo mein noodles. The fried rice is excellent and does not taste like it has been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. 

Do yourself a favor and try this great new restaurant because it will not disappoint!"}
