{"text":"Great food. I really liked their bibimbap in hot stone bowl"}
{"text":"The food was good. But the service was horrible. We were ignored, and given so much attitude. For the kind of price point they charge, it was a very poor experience."}
{"text":"Pros (?):
- The quality of the food here is about average for Korean the area. However, since the restaurant is located in Koreatown North, you can find much better Korean food just minutes away.

Cons:
- The prices here are some of the highest I've seen for Korean food in Toronto. You can get similar quality and quantity at other Korean restaurants for half the price.
- They are quite stingy with the sides. I went with a large group and they gave portions that were barely enough for two people. They also ignore your requests if you ask for more sides.
- The service here is atrocious. I normally don't expect good service at Korean restaurants, but the service here isn't simply unhelpful: it's downright rude and offensive. If you ask for anything, not only do they ignore your request, they actively give you attitude for daring to ask for anything."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but there are better Korean restaurants further up on Yonge street. The service however, was arguably the worst I've ever experienced. We asked for refills for side dishes and water many times and both servers kept ignoring us. The female server was at least apologetic about it in the end, but the male server was extremely rude and unprofessional. We were so upset about the service we decided to let our tips reflect our dissatisfactions (which was still close to 10%). The guy had the nerve to demand more tips and even said that he will remember our faces. Are you kidding me?! 

Two servers might not be representative of the service of the entire restaurant, but it's bad enough for me to decide to never come back again. I will advise my friends to do the same to avoid colossal disappointment."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service I have ever experienced, and that's saying a lot for a Korean restaurant. Bad service is somewhat understandable if you are paying cheap prices, but the food here is ridiculously expensive for Korean. The food is okay...but I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how a Korean restaurant doesn't serve the Pork Bone soup - they have the beef version instead. 

Ended up ordered the Spicy Beef with Leek soup. The beef was okay, the soup was somehow lack of salt, all I can taste was the spiciness from the soup. 

No complain about their side dishes. Those are pretty good. 

And their staffs are friendly. The menu is expensive compared to other Korean restaurants. It somehow did not meet my expectation for a typical Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Me no rikey! 
Never mind about \"where's the beef\", more like \"where's the flavor!\"  Soup was bland. 
Pretty expensive as well.  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here by accident and had their beef ribs and octopus beef soup. It's so good and environment feels very clean and dishes are clean."}
{"text":"I went there with a non-Korean friend of mine who likes Korean food. We used to go to a place in Korea Town near Christie and Bloor, but it was a little far for us, so we decided to try this place as it was closer to where we live.

It was practically located right across from the Sheppard Centre - it's easy to commute there. We were there around 6 PM on a Monday and it was about 3/4 full. We were seated immediately. The waitress seems to speak a little bit of English but didn't talk a whole lot. I ordered a bowl of cold noodle while my friend ordered japchae (glass noodles).

While my cold noodle tasted better than the one I had at Cho Sun Ok (that place used to have the best cold noodle in Toronto, but now it's meh), my friend's japchae was rather bland. She had to wait for it to cool down a bit too, as it was steaming. The side dish was also good and they refilled them for us while we were about halfway through the meal. My friend couldn't finish the whole thing so she asked if they could provide a container for her and they did!

Overall the service was decent, and the food that I had was good. I want to come back to try the famous beef bone soup."}
{"text":"Sure it's not cheap and there's no free parking, but the food is oh so good and consistent. The sul-lung-tang is what they're known for but their side dishes are fresh and flavorful and galbi jjeem (braised beef) is so delicious. Definitely one of my favourite Korean places."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is horrible. I wouldn't recommend going here for Korean BBQ. It is far more expensive and you get only a few side dishes. My boyfriend and I went here for lunch and and were not given any rice or soup with our Korean BBQ. For the price you pay, you would expect a lot more side dishes and they don't provide any extra meat.  I had requested for a couple of slices of meat and the waitress was extremely upset about the request and stated that I had to pay extra. I would highly recommend checking out another restaurant. I too had read the negative reviews and thought I would still give this restaurant a shot, I wished I had took those posting more seriously and checked out a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Lunchtime.  Not too busy, not too quiet. Service was good to me but some people seemed to want to be seated faster. The food came quickly and the usual starters were provided. The kimchi is very good in my mind. I might go and get some as takeout another day to bring home. 

The dolsot bibimbap was standard. It was good. It didn't make me think it was the best thing ever but really, you have to be pretty bad to screw up bibimbap. 

I'll go back, but not everyday. It's still a lot of food for lunch when you are eating alone. It was about $17 with tip. They only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"Very good food so far. The khalbi, and shredded beef soup (yuk gae jang) are great. They also have the chicken soup (Sam geh tang) that is ready within 10mins from time of order. (You'd get a whole small chicken that has sticky rice stuffing with garlics and dates). It's perfect for winter and for colds. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"excellent food?mackerel is fresh and tasty. but side dishes can be refilled once only..."}
{"text":"Their specialty is the beef bone soup. It comes plain..without any seasoning. They have seasalt ans green oniona on the side for you to add. Side dishes was average, except kimchi."}
{"text":"Yuk Gae Jang is awesome.   Did I mention they give at least 6 side dishes of appetizers?   I am into Korean food and have tried many  restaurants and I find that their soup/stews is among the best.  I can only find 1 issue though, their meat dishes serving size is good for 2-3.  I wish they serve half size. All in all, I'll be coming here more often."}
{"text":"There are items on the menu you won't at the many other Korean restaurants in the area. Ask the servers for recommendations and they'll make sure your selections go together.

Really tasty food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean restaurant. Fish soup is my favorite. I have been going there for many years."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews I was a bit skeptical of this place but it wasn't even bad.

Food were just the way it should be, traditional Korean food. I ordered spicy pork ribs, assorted meat and the whole chicken soup and all came to $97 a bit pricey I must admit the quality is great. The Kimchi are hand picked ingredients from farms, the meats were tasty and saucy, none of them were dry at all. Unlimited side dishes that includes, kimchi, jap chae, mashed potato, etc which all tastes pretty good.

The only down side is that there is only 2 waitresses for a large number of people but they are quick on their feet. One of my family member dropped a spoon and they came in with a new one without us having to ask them for a new one. They were very polite and very responsive and we had no problem or issues at all.

I wish the tables were a little less crammed but there isn't much they could do about that."}
{"text":"Food was the same as any other korean place but priced wayyy higher! Customer service was beyond terrible, ignoring us completely and then they were surprised with the tip and will confront you about it. Looked like he wanted to fight....never going back there again!!"}
{"text":"If my friends can't find me during dinner time, they would find me here. I LOVE their beef so so so much!"}
{"text":"Beef bone soup is their main dish here. Unlike a lot of Korean soups, this one does not have any fiery red chilis in it. The broth is simple and subtle. Their other dishes are about average for Korean joint. Decent variety with the banchan."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, and this place is good for eating it. I love having Dumpling soup here. I come here often with my Korean girlfriend and she says it is one of the best Korean restaurants, or the best one in Toronto. I agree. And it is not expensive. You should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dinner here. Ordered table cooking bulgogi and sea food pan cake. The price point is slightly higher than other Korean restaurants (30 and 15) but the portions are large. Too much for 3 people. Bulgogi comes with 2 bowls of rice and your choice of tofu soup or another one I couldn't remember. Overall a great experience here!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were craving some Korean BBQ so we found this through a top 10 kbbq in Toronto list. I concur, it's definitely a great spot for authentic Korean BBQ! The meat quality is great and it's one of the few places with Jumulluk (sliced beef tenderloin with sesame dressing). If you're going for the korean bbq, you will have to have a minimum order of 2 korean bbq dishes (you can order 2 of the same kind of meat). Each order feeds about one person. We ordered the Jumulluk ($28.95) and the Samgyupsal ($19.95) for 2 people and we were stuffed. 

Side note, the kimchi was also delicious here! Probably one of my favourite kimchis!"}
{"text":"Try their \"Mae woon dwae ji kal bee jjim\" (hot pork rib)!  I love spicy food.  I can take the heat more so than the average person but with that being said, it is pretty spicy.  And I love it.  Especially when you take the sauce and mix it with rice - it's soooo good! 

The best best best thing here is summer.  You go to the second floor and they cook kalbi or samgyupsal on charcoal fire!!!  Tears of joy....

Their bibim kook soo is good too but again, only in the summer... 

I do think they can invest some money on their deco. 

Finally, I love the owner's wife.  She is the sweetest person you will ever meet.  :)"}
{"text":"- great, family run joint (and by family, i mean dad, mom, son, and daughters....)
- food is pretty fantastic and will definately come back.
- pajeon (seafood pancake) is awesome. as is the bbq stuff (make sure you ask for garlic if youre doing the grill!!)
- really want to try their beef bone soup next time"}
{"text":"The beef none soup had no taste. Had a few strings of noodle and a few slices of beef and the soup did not taste like beef. Not sure what I was eating"}
{"text":"I know I gave this a 5 star! My first experience was just a few weeks ago and I still crave for their spicy ribs! Oh what a treat it was. I love HOT(spicy food) and this certainly gave back. The waitress warned us because we were a bunch of Chinese guys tackling one of their mightiest would be a hot one. Little did she know we eat that for breakfast. Heh

Three of us...the total of the bill came to just over $60 but we think it's well deserved. Endless side dishes like most Korean restaurants, loved the kimchi and also the pickled radish. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If it is home cooked korean meat soup you are after, this is probably not a bad place. It is not full of msg. Soup itself is not bad.
However, there is not whole lot of variety as this place specializes in the meat soup."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Korean restaurant for beef short ribs. I usually order the large size beef short rib hotpot. It comes with two rice and a big serving of short ribs that is enough for 2-3 people. The short ribs themselves and juicy and tender. In fact, they fall right off the bone. The soup base is sweet/flavourful and goes well with rice. The reason I am taking a star off is due to its side dishes. Although side dishes are not the mains of a meal, I think good side dishes definitely affects the overall quality of the entire meal. The side dishes were cabbage kimchi, turnip kimchi, salted/spicy bok choi, potato salad, and broccoli. The quality of side dishes here has definitely gone down in the last two yeara I have visited. The kimchi dishes were very bland and the other side dishes were mediocre at best. Despite that, I would still recommend this place for their beef short ribs....as long as you are not too picky about your side dishes."}
{"text":"Good food, very sincere and attentive service.

My fav dish is the \"steamed\" beef short ribs, short ribs are actually braised in a flavourful dark sauce till fall-off-the-bone tender, absolutely delicious. 

Beef bone soup is the house specialty dish and certainly worth a try, salt and chopped green onion containers on the table for DIY seasoning. 

I am getting hungry as I write this ..."}
{"text":"My best Korean meal in Toronto.
Service was very good, even with some language barrier. I do believer there is universal appreciation for good food. :-)
I tried the beef bone soup as all yelpers recommended. It was nice, but I still miss the famous beef rib house near Suwon. 
Braised beef short rib is fork tender and very flavorful. Seafood Pajeon (pancake) is a true standout. I would give 10 out of 10 for those two dishes. 
I almost gave this a 5 star, for food and service. However, it is little tricky to find parking if you drive there. Sheppard subway stop is very close though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rating - good food and friendly service! I think they have better selection than your typical Korean restaurant. Prices are definitely higher than the other Korean places in the area, but the food is also better and fairly decent portions too. I guess just depends if you find it's worth it? If you're looking for value, this might not be be it, but food is definitely flavourful with good ingredients!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to go there after work since we both do not want to cook today. We ordered the octopus and bulgogi hotpot. The portion is enough for two people, however the octopus is hard to chew. Side dish is so-so. A little bit pricy compared to a few other Korean restaurant at y&f.  Probably will go back, but will not order the same hotpot again."}
{"text":"I came here earlier tonight with my bf for dinner. We both had the yuekgaetang, which we thought was very flavourful and full of beef! I like that they serve six banchans and are all refillable. One thing I don't like is that this restaurant is a bit pricier than most Korean restaurants. So if you want something cheap, go elsewhere. 

Also after reading reviews here, we did not experience bad service such as being ignored or servers chasing us down for more tips.. Not sure if it's because my bf is Korean and he did all the talking.

Overall, I don't think I will return to this place..like ever. Plenty of Korean restaurants in the area for less!"}
{"text":"Late night Korean craving brought me Lee Nam Jang and boy am I glad that it did. Everything at this restaurant seems to be made with care and lots of attention to detail. Two friends and I came here late on a Saturday evening for a snack. The restaurant was fairly quiet with only a few patrons. We were greeted by a cheerful older lady and seated right away. I believe this older lady was owner of the restaurant; she was doubling as our server as well. We decided to order 2 dishes, the Kkori Jim ($24.99) and dolsot bibimbap ($10.99).  The breakdown of the dishes is as follows: 

Kkori Jim (Our server recommended we order this as it is one of their house specialties): 
- this is a steamed oxtail stew served spicy
- the pieces of oxtail were huge and very tender
- the stew also had ginseng root, dates, and gingko beans, the broth had a major spicy kick but was well balanced by the sweetness of the dates
- It was served with a bowl of purple rice to help sop up the extra sauce
- An excellent, complex and well balanced dish that I would have no problem ordering again

Dolsot bibimbap:
- served with a raw egg yolk in a sizzling stone pot allowing you to cook your egg yolk to your liking and your rice to crunchy perfection, spicy sauce served on the side
- This was a solid bibimbap, served with a good portion of veggies although a little more meat would have been appreciated, the spicy sauce on the size was delicious
- Good portion of rice in the bowl allowing for a good mixture of soft and crunchy rice

In addition to our mains we got a handful of traditional side dishes (banchan) all of which seemed to be hand made and well prepared. I absolutely loved the kimchi, the pieces of cabbage were large and it had a good bite to it, I enjoyed all the banchan in general. 
The restaurant itself is quite nice, very modern décor with some flat screens on the wall. It is definitely nicer than some of the 24 hour Korean restaurants closer to Finch ave. The menu seemed to have a wide array of very traditional dishes; the price point is a little higher than some in the area but the food is definitely worth it. They also have BBQ combos that come with choice of beer/soju so this wouldn't be a bad place to snack and have some drinks. The service was so lovely, owner was very cheerful and clearly takes pride in her food. I will definitely be back!

* they don't serve gamjatang (Pork Bone soup):-(."}
{"text":"I've never been yelled at by a waitress before. At first she gave me attitude while taking my order. All I didn't was ask questions about it. Then, She yelled at me for trying to help her put the food she was holding down on the table. I ordered the pork bone soup and It was so bland I felt like I was drinking hot water. Never coming again."}
{"text":"Peoples, listen up. If you pass by and notice their banner advertising Seolleongtang or whatever-beef-boner soup, I am going to guess if you decide to enter the doors you'll have a 50/50 chance of getting it.  

Another 50/50 where you may not be salting(seasoning) it to your preference.  I am still mystified, why this variation of soup needs self-service but if you season it enough the soup does a body good.

That's not my purpose at Lee Nam Jang,  Beef Soup is more of a side dish for me even if they said they won this or that.  Famous or not, it's the Kkori Jim that's the main attraction.  Steamed oxtail stew, right amount of spice, perfectly saucy, savoury and tender.

The single ginseng root, few rice cakes, a couple dates and gingko gives it better presentation and I try to feed those to my friends/family so I can get more Tail, yummy.  Sauce was good enough for others to finish their bowls of rice.  Personally, I could of just drank it on its own.

PS.  Look for the boss lady to order, she's more accommodating and less pushy."}
{"text":"I am almost positive this place ripped me off. I paid 15.95 for kimchi chigae. I did not realize at first and paid for the bill. I then looked up the reviews on yelp and saw a copy of the menu on here and it clearly reads 12.95. I then proceeded to ask the lady and she said they raised the prices for this year. That's insane considering the soup is made of kimchi, tofu and a few bits of pork. Never returning as there are many other Korean joints that serve this same dish at a more reasonable price. There is also nothing special about this soup either."}
{"text":"The korean food here are more expensive than other places near finch. It tasted about the same as every other korean restaurants i've been to. But their side dishes are some what good."}
{"text":"Typical Korean food joint that's nice to have within walking distance. Service was quick and to the point, but in a nice way. I can count on it when the craving for Bi Bim Bap in a hot stone bowl hits or for the delicious side dishes and kimchi."}
{"text":"They have good quality of soups. The steamed beef short ribs was really good, but its $24+ for four small pieces. A lot experiencer than other korean restaurants, but their dishes are natural, they don't add a lot seasoning or salt."}
{"text":"Ratings:
Food: 8.5/10
Drink: n/a
Service: 8/10
Value: 7/10
Hygiene: 8/10
Aesthetics: 7.5/10

I come here on occasion because it's a good place to get some Korean food in the area. 

Of the soups I've tried, most of them are well flavoured. I do enjoy the yuk gae jang and the oxtail soup. I was a little disappointed in the kalbi tang though. It didn't have as much flavour as I'm used to so perhaps my expectations were a bit high. The food is still much better quality than the majority of Korean restaurants I've been to.

The service here can sometimes be a little slow but there is nothing to really complain about.

The decor and atmosphere is pretty plain and simple. Nothing that really stands out or makes you go WOW. 

The prices are a bit high, and I'm sure you could probably find somewhere else to get a better deal, but considering the location and the nearby stores, it's alright.

This place is good if you're looking for something to warm you up or just craving Korean soups."}
{"text":"Had their signature dish Seolleongtang. In Korea, you are supposed to self-season this type of soup which is not a norm here. It is supposed to be \"tasteless\" and underseasoned  before seasoning it. The staff should explain to the customers how to eat this dish if it is their first time having it. 

Although I enjoyed my dish, I am giving this place three stars because some items are quite overpriced and the service could be better. This place has been here for a long time and loved by Koreans which can be a good sign. However, there are many new ones that serve better food with better service (if you check my reviews on other Korean restaurants). 

Bottom line: if you are in the area, sure, you can get your Korean food craving fix here. If you are looking for the best Korean restaurant and willing to travel anywhere in GTA, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food that we had wasn't very fresh (both of the dishes with meat in it tasted stale and strange??). Ordered their beef tail soup that people recommended on yelp ans it was not that good. Service wasn't amazing either. It was overpriced for the stuff we had (paid parking before 9 too !) and probably won't be coming back :("}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 star place but I'm being generous cause of customer service. I was craving some Korean food, wanted hot bibimbap dish, but really short on time. 

I called them on a weeknight in the evening and let them know what time I would be there and if I could order my food over the phone so it would be prepared by the time I arrive there. When I arrived, they put a little reserved sign for me and the food was just placed on the table. Everything was hot and yummy. Lots of side dishes, I really liked the glass noodles and cold mashed potatoes. 

It's not as popular as Joons which is a few doors down but it's also a decent option too. Just a bit on the pricey side. It's a few bucks more then what you would typically pay for dishes like a simple bibimbap. If not for that, I would come back more often."}
{"text":"i had cold noodle, LA galbi, Seolleongtang

better than some of restaurant which is located Cristie
but bit expencsive.

love their side dishs too!"}
{"text":"Korean family style cooking which means no MSG. This place is a great,
 Had the yuekgaejang and was very pleased with the broth.  Perfect flavor, couldn't ask for more.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Decent korean place, wide variety menu. Basic stuff. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"No MSG in the soup. It's hard to find restaurants that don't add chemicals into the food."}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant in North York area.

Yukgaejang-spicy beef soup, LA ribs, steamed beef short ribs are must have.

And the best side dish award should go to this place as well. Usually only vegetarian side dishes are given in the other restaurant, but this one actually have fish in the side dishes occacasionally.

Very authentic. 

* Beware that they don't have pork bone soup, but all the beef soups are awesome!

Soups come in 2 size, regular 8.95-10.95, large 12.95. LA ribs are quite large in portion, 21.99, would feed 2 people.

I went there with my boyfriend almost once a week when we first met."}
{"text":"They do not use MSG in their food. Their food is 'Upscale authentic Korean food' also known as \"Royal Korean Food\". Their food is high quality, and their prices reflect that. I think this is one of the very very few places that serve this kind of cuisine in Toronto. Some may find the taste is bland because the food doesn't contain MSG. I love this place because I appreciate it for what it is. Some days I want to spend a little more to taste the quality Korean food that doesn't make me sleepy or taste 'off' to suit western/chinese diners (i.e. places that add sugar to their kimchi etc).

For the beef soup/broth types, the soup itself comes unseasoned. You have to season it with the fresh chopped green onions, salt and pepper. Some choose to douse kimchi in their broth, there's also a paste you can add to the soup if you want it to taste complicated."}
{"text":"A Korean friend suggested coming to this place for their BBQ so I eagerly said \"yes\". The three of us went there for dinner on slightly cool Wednesday evening. Lee Nam Jang is conveniently located just about half a block North from the intersection of Sheppard and Yonge. And looking up from below it wouldn't be apparent that there does exist a patio on the roof top of this restaurant. 
Having read some of the more concerning reviews for this place, I believe that some of the bad experiences results from miscommunication between the staff who are Korean (yes which means the dining experience is going to be truly Korean) and the patrons. I will admit that if my friend had not acted as a communication bridge between us and the servers, our dining experience might have been just as awkward as what some of the other reviewers had mentioned. For example: her and I both arrived first at the restaurant and we were told that a patio table she had reserved had not been recorded in their reservation data so she was able to persuade them to give us one of the tables that was meant for a large party that was coming at around 7pm that evening. The patio does allow you to get a good view of the streets so it was great that we could get that we could sit out there.
Once we were seated our server came over with the menus and we went over it while waiting for the last of our trio to arrive. Once we decided to order we picked the Jumulluk (sliced beef tenderloin with sesame dressing) and Pork Ribs. The menu is interesting that each dish is mentioned in Hangul, Chinese and English which I never noted in some of the other Korean places I've eaten at. I believe that from what I saw in person, each of the meat dishes is enough to feed about two people with moderate appetites.
Again thanks to our friend the server actually prepared the Pork Ribs separately at a nearby converted charcoal grill. The ribs were then cut into moderate sized pieces before being served at our table. What was a thrill for me was to able to finally follow the Korean custom of placing our grilled meats in the fashion that I've seen in Korean food documentaries which is to wrap up the meat with some other accompaniments in lettuce leaf and consuming it. I did the same thing for the Jumulluk which was grilled at our table since it was already sliced in the same way as the cooked Pork Ribs. Both types of meat tasted very good even when not eaten dipped in the sesame oil and salt dipping sauce and the ssamjang (a dipping concoction of bean paste and chili paste)
The other four items worth mentioning was the Kimchi, the Purple Rice, the accompanying tofu soup and the Korean Seafood pancake which was I regard. I've only had the prepackaged type of kimchi that is found in the grocery stores, but the one served at Lee Nam Jang was very fresh ( I couldn't tell how long it had been fermented), I could still taste the Nappa cabbage and the thicker parts of the leaves still had their crunchiness. The purple rice was a thrilling treat since that was the first time I've actually seen it for myself after seeing it as well in the food shows. It tasted no different from the white counterpart but it was just unique to consume it at this meal. The tofu based soup was also tasty and not as spicy as some of the soup based dishes that I've had. I would have preferred to be slightly thick since I become so used to seeing and trying out most of the jjigae dishes.
The Seafood Pancake was originally not part of our dinner itinerary, but my friend noticed me finishing off what was left of the kimchi and the lettuce leave, (I was enjoying my meal that much that so I just picked off what was left of the banchans) so she suggested that if I still felt hungry that we should order something else to close off the dinner. We had been talking about the pancakes and I decide since I was there, why not just go for it. We got one order of the Seafood Pancake which when brought to the table looked like big thin omelet on an equally thin pancake base. Our server cut it into six wedges and we started going for the final kill. The pancake was startchy in taste and I mentioned that I could taste something like potato starch in it, but it was still tasty enough and the flavor of the shrimp and green onions complimented the startchy taste. That pancake pretty much made me full for the rest of the evening.
The restaurant is certainly on the pricey side since the two meat plates that we order were in around $27 and $29 respectively. However, the positive experience that we had was worth what we paid. And judging from the number of Korean customers that flocked here before we made our exist, this is certainly the place to come on the odd occasion for a quality Korean meal."}
{"text":"I came to the Korean restaurant, Lee Nam Jang on a recommendation from my Korean friend who is now my go-to guy for recommendations for Korean food!

My Korean friend came with us and helped us order in Korean. He ordered us 2 orders of the Korean beef ribs and 2 orders of the Korean pork belly which were grilled with vegetables right infront of us by a Korean lady and came with 4 bowls of rice and a bowl of Korean spicy tofu soup (I forgot the name in Korean).

Everything was grilled perfectly. The Korean beef rubs were so tasty and well marinated and you can't go wrong with Korean pork belly. The meal comes with lettuce for wrapping and sauce. I love the fresh and crunchy lettuce texture with the flavourful juicy Korean meats. 

How many times did I say \"Korean?\"

My Korean friend suggested that the bad reviews left on Yelp were to sway people away so this place won't get too packed lol. Maybe you need to speak Korean to get the good stuff?

For 4 people with 4 orders of grilled meat, plenty of sides and spicy tofu soup it came to around $30 per person. And the place is quite clean. Check it out especially if you speak Korean.

{"text":"- order mac-gul-li. It's a little more expensive then store bought. but it's worth it. Its less sweet, but natural taste. LOVE IT! You know what this rice wine is if you are Korean food lover.

- They recently introduced new menu: Cheese Port Cutler. I cried out of joy. MUST try."}
{"text":"Although the storefront seems small and dim, this restaurant is actually quite spacious & clean and is great for big groups! The prices are slightly higher than other Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood, but they are able to maintain their competitive edge with quality authentic Korean dishes. Their side dishes tasted fresh and quickly refilled it after we finished. Overall great food and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving for a soup that is warm and comforting, I like having Korean beef bone soup or oxtail soup. Lee Nam Jang is the only restaurant that I have come across that makes those soups the best. They're known for their wide variety of soups and stews, but they also offer a great selection of meat and noodle dishes. Their oxtail soup (gomtang) is very hearty and the oxtail meat is tender and soft. The restaurant provides you with salt, pepper and green onions for you to season the soup to your liking. 

I would definitely recommend Lee Nam Jang for their beef bone or oxtail soups because they make them the best in Toronto and it's the perfect comfort food on a gloomy, windy or cold day."}
{"text":"Once again some great recommendations from the reviewers here. Normally I would not throw down $25 on lunch for one person but since it was recommended by so many of you I had to try it. I was skimming through the menu and at the same time I had a picture on my phone of the steam oxtail. The waitress noticed the picture on my phone and asked if that's what I wanted. \"Yes, please\".

Steam oxtail for $24.99. Went with the non-spicy version since it was a really hot day and didn't want to be sweating bullets. The sauce was very sweet and the oxtail was tender. In terms of portions of oxtail - lets just say I could barely finish it all when you factor in the side dishes and my sisters left over cold bibimbap.

While eating the oxtail the waitress asked my sister if she got a chance to try the oxtail. She did get to try some but out of the 8 or so pieces of oxtail she probably got like half a piece. It was that good that I didn't want to share. I also love the chewy rice cakes which were soaking in the sweet sauce (5 stars).

Cold bibimbap for $10.99 I think. No complaints here but nothing worth noting either (3 stars).

Side dishes were in small portions (kimchii, sweet/sour radish, mash potato, brocoli, glass noodle and I think the last one was shreds of fish cake or either some kind of tofu) - Not really impressed with the selection of side dishes and portions when comparing to other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews and since I live around the area. If you want cheap Korean food, this isn't the place to come to. I feel their prices are above average. However, the food is good. We tried the ox tail dish and I felt it was a little sweet for my taste (not really what I was expecting). Their soups are quite tasty. Looks a bit run down from the outside but they're worth a try."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday night. When we went inside the waiter let us have seat quickly.  We ordered their famous Sul Lung Tang and it was fantastic! The soup was very fresh and the side dishes were suitable for their soup as well. Their soup costs 9 to 10 dollars for regular size, but with the side dishes, it made me full (and I can eat a lot). Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place due to the high reviews. Maybe it was a bad day. Maybe it was my high expectations. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish. But all I can say is, I've experienced better stone pot bimbimbaps elsewhere. 

Don't get me wrong. It was average. Rice, shredded carrots, shredded cucumbers, sliced onions, very little portion of beef, and lots of black sliced mushrooms, egg, come served in a sizzling hot stone pot. The pot was super hot that the place made crackling noises and loud \"pop\" sounds three or four times. And I smelled some burnt plastic... don't really know where that came from since this is a STONE pot. The bimbimbap tasted rather bland even with the spicy red sauce. Considering the price - $11, I've had better. 

The ban chan side dishes were pretty good. I liked their kimchee, their mesculin mix salad (a lil different), the sweet soy beans..  their bean sprout was rather bland as well. Maybe they are going for the healthy taste. 

Everything on the menu is few dollars higher than other Korean restaurants in the neighborhood. Perhaps I should have tried their signature dish - the beef broth but I didn't. I'm going to have to try this next time.  So many good reviews can't go wrong right? Right?!?!"}
{"text":"i came here yesterday with my bf, it was really good :) it does look a bit shady from outside in my opinion, which is why i haven't tried this place until yesterday, but surprisingly it is really nice inside. i got sam-gae-tang, it was super authentic. side dishes were really good too. waitresses were nice and prompt. i will return when i crave good authentic korean food."}
{"text":"Came here for the raved oxtails dish. YUM.  Probably one of the best Asian (not just Korean) resto's for oxtail.

The oxtail comes in a hotpot and the meat is incredibly tender and flavourful.  Not sure what kind of Korean seasoning magic went into this dish but the sauce was amazing - salty with a bit of sweetness.  There were also a few pieces of rice cakes which were a little harder to chew but the sauce was enough to make the whole dish.

The large size is definitely enough for two people, as the oxtail comes with rice too.  The side dishes are similar to those of Joon's, with the sweet potato mash.  Would come back again in the future to try some of the other large dishes to be shared :)"}
{"text":"One of the more expensive Korean restaurants I've ever been to. Food was ok. Side dishes were good and plentiful though. We were just really hungry and needed somewhere to eat. Would not go out of our way to eat there."}
{"text":"Best Korean Restaurant in Toronto! I am from Cali and we have probably the worlds best Korean food but LMJ had delicious yook-hwa (raw beef) and seollungtang. Both these items are not easy to make as raw beef requires the highest of beef qualities for raw consumption. Seolungtang requires 24 hours or more of making the beef broth. After speaking with the owners I confirmed that the soup base they use for their soups have NO additives or msg. They really take a ton of time making their soup and take pride in the homemade quality and service. It is a little bit on the pricier side but it is WELL WORTH IT! Spend the extra dollars and get the best Korean Food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Lee Nam Jang hasn't basically everything that you would find in other Korean restaurants, plus SO MUCH MORE! While there were a couple dishes that tested my taste buds (their fish stew was just way way way too fishy and it was a pain to pick out all the bones), they definitely have some real winners. The seafood and kimchi pancake are tasty and generous in size. The fried dumplings I had here were a bit bland, but that's nothing a little bit of kimchi can't fix. And speaking of kimchi, they give every table cabbage and daikon kimchi. I don't know if it is homemade, but it sure tastes like it is. There's just enough funk and tang to the vegetables. There's also the  beef bone soup that is a specialty of the house. It comes out looking very milky, but tastes extremely light and flavourful. I like to add lots of green onion and pepper to the party just for added measure. I love this gem because it's delicious, authentic and close to work. Win-Win-Win in my books."}
{"text":"the owner is the cheap type if the owner is there, prepare to not get what you paid for
i've been here 10+ times and every single time the owner is there i feel ripped off
i will never come back here

1/5 stars"}
{"text":"Ox tail soup was amazing!!! Definitely not a daily luxury, but I have to say I will repeat purchase many times in the future.  Their dolsot bibimbap was a let-down after the amazing soup,  but I guess this was to be expected after coming off that amazing first dish! Make sure you use the salt, pepper,  and green onion provided for the soup and mustard dipping sauce for the oxtail.  Stupendous."}
{"text":"I thought this place was like the 3 stars indicates, A-OK.

It's one of those weird Korean restos that DOESN'T have Pork Bone Soup - or even the beef version (Yukaejang) - on the menu.  I looked through the menu quite a few times and neither of these dishes were on there!  So I had to order the ol' standby, Bibimbap.

BBB was alright.  Like how could you possibly screw that up??  And even though I added the kojuchang to the rice, I couldn't really taste the spicy/sweetness of the sauce.

Sides were decent.  Kimchi was flavourful, not uber salty like some places!  When we asked for a refill, waitress just brought half of them to the table.  Otherwise, service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Simple and stead Korean food. They are mostly known for their stews which are done decently. They are a bit more pricier for what you get but beats having to drive for Korean food."}
{"text":"The service at this place is horrendous. I'm typically not one to care much for good service (especially when I go to Asian restaurants, which excel at value versus service), but even I was appalled by how we were treated. 

We were repeated ignored, and even given attitude when asked to be served. Furthermore, when we only tipped 10%, they chased us down and demanded more. We refused, saying that we received terrible service, and they threatened us by saying that they'll remember our faces next time. 

Just disgusting."}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean place.  Their food is very good by Korean standards.
Side dishes are one of the best in Toronto.

The place specializes in this beef bone soup called 'Sul Lung Tang', which is white soup base with beef and a little bit of noodles in it. You season it yourself with some seasalt and chopped green onions. You can ask for spicy paste for the soup and make it spicy!!

Kimchi here is one of the best I've tried in Toronto. I don't bother buying kimchi from a restaurant but every since I found this place, this is where i buy my kimchi.

Pretty much everything i've tried here exceeds expectation or better than average. Try their Gal-bi JJim, Bo-SSam, beef sashimi, and Mak Gul Li (house-made rice wine).

Can't think of another Korean place this good in Toronto."}
{"text":"Bland and expensive. 
Came here to have classic Korean dinner, appalled at how expensive the meat dishes were, ended up ordering soup. I ordered the beef rib soup and it tasted like water. My mom ordered the dwenjang chigae, and it tasted like slightly seasoned water. 
The only star I'm giving for this is for the variety of side dishes and the refills of those side dishes.
Go to Owl instead."}
{"text":"Good traditional Korean restaurant came here with a few of my Korean friends one day and they suggested I try the cheese donkatsu (pork cutlet) comes with cheese.  Awesome dish came back to have it again and the size is decent for 14.95.  The restaurant is a bit on the pricier side compared to some of the other restaurants in the area ex LA kalbi is 29.95 for a plate usually my favorite but not for that price.  Table cooking they have some good dishes including the premium version of kalbi at 34.95 but you need to order 2 items so expect at least 60 to 80 dollars. 

Good place for moderately priced Korea food"}
{"text":"It's a two storey building, if you want to have the bbq yourself it's on the second floor. They also provide bbq on charcoal, but it's cooked in the kitchen. 

Do not order pork bone soup there, they don't have it. But they have a lot difference choices of beef soup and the side dishes are tasty(tho you may have to cut the kimchi yourself :/). Those are very good. I personally don't like their bibimbap."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but it took long to get service. I ordered the cheese tonkatsu which was a first for me. I didn't really enjoy the gravy all over the dish, it made it feel extremely heavy and there was a lot leftover. Prices seemed to be higher than average as well. The other 5 adults didn't find anything memorable about their meals either. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"I only had a Bi Bim Bap at Lee Nam Jang once and it was, well, a pretty good Bi Bim Bap. No complaints whatsoever. They give you plenty of side dishes and the food is as close as you can get to authentic Korean food. They have an extensive menu with all kinds of soups, rice dishes, etc. If I were craving a Bi Bim Bap and if I were in the area, I'd definitely pay them a visit. If, on the other hand, I was craving a pork bone soup, my favourite place in Toronto for that is The Owl of Minerva."}
{"text":"Pretty good sul lung tang! Don't know many restaurants in Toronto that make it well. The reason why I'm writing this review though is that people seem to be complaining about how bland it is when they just don't know how to eat it.  You put the salt and the green onions in to flavour the broth more. It's beef bone soup so you layer the flavours and also you're supposed to eat it with kimchee!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this place. The restaurant is spacious. My friends and I ordered 3 dishes to share. 

The food are pretty good, similar to other korean restaurant. There are lots soup and fry food. We had stone bowl, seafood pot and a soup. 

The only down side is that the service is average. As one of my friend is Korean, the server never talk to us in English. Even if we initiate the conversation in english, the server replied in Korean.

In conclusion, this is place would definitely be an option if you are looking for casual meal."}
{"text":"I know I deserve the best. And Lee Nam Jang serves one of the best version of Kkori Gomtang (Oxtail Soup) that is one of the item on the Korean Royal Court menu.

This is no ordinary soup (tang). It takes hours in preparation time and I just love the spicy version which is really rich and has such complex taste (spicy, salty and sweet at the same time).

Lee Nam Jang's Kkori Jim ($24.99) is definitely not cheap. But that's one of the thing I enjoy most every time I dine here. I just wish that there is more of everything.

Service here is friendly and the restaurant is clean. 

So when am I going again?!"}
{"text":"It cost me more than 40 dollars to have a seafood stew, ended up with more than half left. You can feel the crab was frozen before and not fresh any more. The appetizer potato salad was very yummy!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend just moved to this neighbour so we decided to look for a Korean place to eat. I've been craving for pork bone soup for sometime now and thought any Korean restaurant must serve pork bone soup so we just went in. So I looked at the menu. OH NO! No pork bone soup for me. Alright Korean mama recommended the beef bone soup so I went with it. Boyfriend ordered the sweet beef soup. 

Boyfriend didn't like any of the side dish and I just swallowed them all besides the kimchi lol 

The soups came fast. Bit disappointed about the rice cause it's not purple rice. 
Had a sip of my soup. Flavourless. Added tons of salt to just add a bit of taste. Boyfriend had a sip of my soup said it's more like Jewish kind of taste. His soup was average. Nothing to rave with. Well I was hungry so I still finished my whole soup. You would def think it was ridiculous if you saw the amount of salt I've added to my soup. 

Service was fast. Korean mama was nice. I just didn't like she urged us to pay while we deciding to go Dutch or not. 

Food: 2/5 
Service: 3/5

Won't come back since I had better Korean food with cheaper price in downtown near my hood."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean Restaurant in North York. Beef Bone Soup is their specialty."}
