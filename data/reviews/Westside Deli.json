{"text":"Service is slow but friendly. Surprisingly decent prices even though it's in a Vegas casino. The \"meaty\" sunwich is delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was not bad. The only problem was that we waited 25 minutes for 2 small things. There was only one person cooking and A LOT of people ordering"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick hungover lunch to get your day moving. Decent prices. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! My sons pancakes were cold and burnt. The Blt I got had no bacon and the bread was thick dry and cold. My girlfriends turkey bacon melt looked like they cooked it on the dirty ground and the turkey meat looked like baloney. 

This whole casino is gross and dirty, and all the people staying here are all diverse cultures off trash! 

Stay away from Circus circus!"}
{"text":"I went here two weeks ago to get lunch for myself and my wife. 

I got a BLT for myself and it was absolutely the best one I've ever had. It was the perfect ratio of bread, meat and vegetables.

My wife wanted pancakes and they were massive. I think the grill was a little too hot for them because of them being dark brown and chewy. Even with this they had a great flavor.

Next time we're at Circus Circus (2 weeks) we'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"I wish you could bring back the strawberry shortcake. I really miss that..other than that this place is great!"}
{"text":"Went to this deli for lunch. I had the pastrami sandwich toasted. It was so good. The pastrami was soft and the rest of the ingredients like lettuce and tomato made the sandwich just tasty. It came with the potato salad which had enough flavor and cubes of potato. My sandwich also came with a dill pickle. Such a great combination of flavors. 
I had a pink lemonade to drink. It was a delicious meal. Very filling. 
The deli is located inside Circus Circus. There are plenty of tables. Service was quick and friendly. Awesome place. 
My daughter loved her hot dog! Great place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Service was okay but it's very expensive.  I ordered the hot dog and I couldn't finish it.  It was just disgusting .  I would go back only if I'm starving ."}
{"text":"Road Trip
Summer 2016

I wanted to take my parents to a different restaurant, but they just  wanted to hang out at Circus Circus. Sigh. 

The chicken noodle soup was surprisingly delicious! The tasty broth was comforting, the egg noodles made me feel real good, and the fresh vegetables added the homey, classic flavors in the soup. 

The soup of the day was very good, too . It was beef..uhhh..I don't remember the name. It was a little salty, but I liked it and so did my parents.

For our dessert, we shared a Cinnamon Roll. It scratched the itch I didn't know I had. It was sweet and cinnamon-y good! I like how they heated it up, what a nice touch! 

Customer service was quick and courteous! I can't think of any reasons to give it less than 5, so 5 stars it is!

Total: ~$23"}
{"text":"Really not bad. I ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup because I was freezing cold from being inside the ice cold Adventuredome. The noodles were huge the bowl was a good size and it had nice bits of chicken and some veggies in - good flavor! I also ordered a cheeseburger which comes with lettuce, tomato, red onion and a pickle spear I got jacked for from Hunnie Bunnie. UGH. This wasn't bad at all - not dried out or anything and a decent size as well. 
Hunnie Bunnie had a hot dog, the regular size, but there are footlong hotdogs which you can order like Matt P. did - also with a cheese, chili, or both option to add to the wiener!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch. Got a pastrami on rye...very good & huge serving (couldn't finish it all). All toppings were fresh & the wait time was pretty short. Prices are expensive but comparable to hotel food prices."}
{"text":"Good. Cheap. Fast. After 100 ounce drink, the pastrami REALLY hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Plenty of food is provided here! It is a busy deli but we got our food rather quickly as it was made to order. They provide large portions with their meals so if small children are ordering 1 meal would be enough for two children to share! 
I didn't notice any smoking in the area which is a plus for me and my family! The staff were very nice, even with the amount of people they were tending to. One staff member stood by my order while we took one tray to our table and returned for the 2nd one. I'd come back to eat here after our experience!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant inside Circus Circus. We walked over due to an ad about their $2.99 specials. We ordered 2 items from that menu: a foot long hot dog & a strawberry shortcake. Bf also ordered a burger which was very mediocre. The shortcake filled an entire large styrofoam box! It was also surprisingly moist & covered in strawberries (not fresh tho). The hot dog had a crisp skin & thick like a sausage."}
{"text":"Don't buy coffee here, like a hot water and nothing Flavours and spend some time at Starbucks or McDonnell better option don't buy here thanks"}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Fast. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. Totally recommend! 

I live next door so it's difficult to find decent food around me since I don't want to live like a tourist all the time. I'm really glad I found this nice little deli. It's easy to access and the food was fresh and well prepared. Love it! Everyone working was all smiles as well. Exactly what you expect from Vegas! Nicely done Circus Circus."}
{"text":"Tired from our drive from LA we didn't want to leave the hotel with the kids anymore so decided to eat here. We got a chicken noodle soup and a club sandwich. The soup was delicious nice and hot full of carrots and celery. The sandwich was also very good it came with chips but I got fries instead. We might eat here again before we check out :)"}
{"text":"So let's talk TACOS, yes they are Gringo Style, yes they are far from authentic, but they are big, tasty, and CHEAP!! I love the chicken tacos at this place, they are tasty and moist and hit the spot after a few beers at Slots A Fun!!! 
Miss the HO Dog from the old Westward Ho? Fear not that dog is back here at the WSD!! Not quite as large but still a huge dog with a great garlicky flavor! This place is inexpensive and has just good old comfort type food to include a ridiculous Strawberry Shortcake!
If you're in the CC, and why wouldn't you be, this is a must do!"}
{"text":"Soooo, this is your basic deli style cafe. Nothing out of the box unique but what they do is simple and tasty!! In a hotel of course the pricing is bit high but the portions really are adequate and in my opinion enough to share!!  They are open 24 hours a day."}
{"text":"If you want quality, quantity, and reasonable prices--don't go here.  The food could hardly be deemed within an authentic deli realm.  The service is poor, the offerings minute, and taste lacking (chicken soup too salty, sandwiches bland, and desserts hardly unique or fresh).

Even though they are open 24 hours, you have 24 hours to find another venue.  This is a side-show at Circus Circus that is not worth attending."}
{"text":"Food was okay but prepare to wait  for your food since it is made to order. 

They serve a variety of  sandwhiches such as the clubhouse, BLT, turkey and bacon melt, grilled cheese as well as burgers and such. For non carnivores they have a veggie burger and salads. The deli also offer a small breakfast selection - just the basics; pancakes, oatmeal, breakfast sandwhich and fresh fruit."}
{"text":"IF I could give this place a lower rating, I would. I was served undercooked breakfast sausage at Westside Deli two mornings ago and I will never forget the experience. A friend and I went to the Westside Deli for breakfast before a daytime concert that morning. The line moved along quickly and all seemed well. When she and I arrived to the cashier, the woman that was taking our order was mumbling rude comments about another co-worker that hadn't completed an order. No big deal, but she kept interrupting my friend and I as we were trying to order. Finally, we waited for our turn to speak and ordered our breakfasts. The food came out fairly quickly (that should have been the first signal), but I was too hungry to care. The portion was big, but I was hungry so I ate just about everything on my plate. The breakfast sausage was the only thing that felt \"off\". Later in the day, I could feel signs of indigestion and then felt the nausea hit me like a bus. My friend and I had to cut our concert day short because I couldn't walk 10 feet without wanting to vomit. Eventually, I made it home and the end was not pleasant. And when you think of \"not pleasant\", please imagine something along the lines of a burst-open fire hydrant. Please do not eat meat at this deli. Despite the name DELI--it is not where you want to acquire meat products. If you do, observe carefully and do not eat if you think there is something remotely wrong with the food."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning,  the experience was terrible. The service was bad,  the order was wrong. When tried to resolve, was spoken to as if I was a dumb customer and could not possibly comprehend the employee. 
The tables were dirty, we had to clean them before using them of ketchup and syrup. ...
The food tasted like plastic. 
If I could I would give it a minus star. 
Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This little gem is located inside Circus Circus. The food was actually really good. We came here a couple of times. Had the Philly Cheese and the next time had the Italian sandwich. Both were delicious. I really recommend this place. The only thing I did not like was the tables were always dirty, ladies don't listen well, and the prices were horrible. Other than that great delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"The ladies here are nice, but the service really sucks. I placed my order at 12:27pm and after waiting 25 minutes, I went up to the front and apparently no one processed the order. Not lying about the time either. I know people can be over dramatic about waiting 5 minutes and say they waited over 10. I looked at my watch at the counter and it was 12:52pm. The ladies were Sally, Ana, and Esther. They comped the bagel I ordered, but still, how could my order get forgotten. The only reason I confronted this issue is because people that came in after us got their food before we did. I got my refund and just went to McDonald's."}
{"text":"This deli saved me from dying of starvation!

After a long night of walking tirelessly walking up and down the strip, I was EXHAUSTED. By the time I returned to my hotel (circus circus), it was around 5am. I was SO extremely hungry and so I frantically searched for 24hr delivery services. It was harder than I thought. I couldn't find a single pizza delivery service open during that time. 

Frustrated, I went downstairs and found a small deli inside the hotel. Their prices were a bit up there.. I think for my turkey sandwich, it was about $9. But it was decently sized with a big portion of meat in it. Also, the sandwich did not come with condiments. You have to put the mustard or mayonnaise in yourself. 

The sandwich tasted heavenly.. but it might have been so because I was ravenous!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stayed at circus circus during our visit to vegas. This place is our to go place after a night out of clubbing. Everything is so big in portion and reasonably priced. I recommend the chicken salad and the beef sandwich. My guy friend ended up buying four beef sandwiches here during our three day stay. Also, the staff were really friendly. Highly recommend if you stay at circus circus and don't wanna drive anywhere for some midnight snack."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad----workers are slow and just don't care. I spotted one female worker dipping her finger in a customer's fountain drink after drying her runny nose with the same hand. Unfortunately, she did this AFTER I had finished eating the footlong hotdog she served me earlier. I feel a sniffle now and wonder if this is a coincidence. I don't think I 'll be coming  back to this particular deli."}
{"text":"Everytime i visit no matter where i stayed on the strip of vegas i would come here to get the strawberry short cake and to hear that they no longer have it, is very disappointing im sure the shortcake was the best on the menu .... BRING IT BACK !!!!!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars!

Out of all the casual food offered in the Circus Circus, I think Westside Deli is one of the more decent places to go.  If you can find this place through the poof of smoke that engulfs this entire casino, give it a try.  It's not authentic AUTHENTIC deli, but it will do in a hunger pinch.  Plus, you ever been to Circus Circus on a weekend?  So damn busy!  For me Westside Deli had the shortest line.  Sometimes that can be seen as a bad thing, but thankfully for me it worked out OK.

Westside Deli offers deli sandwiches on its main roster, but does have other mostly American fare.  Seems like a decent enough place for a quick breakfast or a speedy lunch to-go.  They do nachos & chili, foot-long hot dogs, soups & salads, and even tacos.

I focused on my go-to when I visit a new sandwich place - for here it is the Clubhouse ($8.99).  It is a triple-decker sandwich on toasted bread of your choice (got sourdough), with roast turkey, crispy bacon, lettuce & tomato.  The sandwich comes dry if you request to-go because there are mustard/mayo packets available on the side for you to take along with you.  Nice touch, because no one likes a soggy sandwich.  If you choose to eat there they will ask if you want mustard/mayo on your sandwich.  Sandwiches also come with your choice of chips, coleslaw, or potato salad, and a pickle spear.  I went with the potato salad.

Verdict!  Not that shabby!  Sandwich is actually HUGE, barely fit in the take out container!  Lots of sliced turkey, and the bacon was actually crispy.  Lettuce & tomato were fresh and bright.  I liked that you could add the mustard or mayo separately because you can add as much or as little as you like.  Pile on that creamy mayo, baby!  They also had packets of salt & pepper available, so adding that to my fresh tomato gave it some flavor.  Plus, what is potato salad without pepper!  Love my potato salad with a ton of pepper for some reason, always have.  Overall this was a good sandwich with some pretty good (store bought) potato salad.  The portion was large for the money, I ended up taking half of it home for a snack later.  Good lunch fare.

I would be back here again for this sandwich, and maybe try something else on the menu.  Only problem is that I'm hardly ever in the Circus Circus, and I'd be hard pressed to drive here just for the Westside Deli.  If you're staying at the hotel it's a good option, for a more authentic deli experience you should go somewhere else.  But I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Pancakes felt dry. When doused in syrup they were tolerable. However due to the mystic properties of the batter soaking the syrup into the pancake and expelling it into a pocket dimension, it didn't stay moist for long and when you cut into the pancake you find the interior bone dry. 1 star for taste. 5 stars for breakthrough in the realm of material science."}
{"text":"I got the clubhouse which is a club sandwich with turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomato. Mayo on the side. It was more expensive than I thought it would be but the portion was HUGE. Came with chips which were surprisingly good. I bought a 20 ounce soda and it was FOUR dollars!!! Crazy!!! Sandwich was worth it though."}
{"text":"Coffee was weak, but hot. Selection of pastries and breakfast items was like a smaller Starbucks. But, it did have a wider choice of cooked items. And it's open 24/7 (unlike most Starbucks, except the one in N.J.)

I got a delicious almond croissant and coffee with a bonus apple thrown in with a coupon I got for booking a room at Circus Circus. I feel sad that Janet N. says this is the best place to eat in this hotel!"}
{"text":"Dang it. They took the best thing away from circus circus,  the greatest strawberry shortcake on the planet.  Sorry, but that was a mistake. Only reason I had to come to this old worn down casino. Bring it back and I'll change to 5 stars , until then, your heading to RIVERA status ! Smh"}
{"text":"Not bad for a 24-hour deli in Circus Circus. Sandwiches are large, but a little pricey. Nothing too speical. Just a nice, big deli sandwich, great for late night munchies."}
{"text":"Food is aweful! Had Caesar salad, lettuce was old and dressing horrible. Chilli dog had worst chilli I've ever had. Daughter had veggie burger and when I asked how it was she said \"edible.\" She thinks everything is great. Unfortunately, there are no good options at Circus Circus, the entire place is a dump."}
{"text":"Honestly the best place to eat at Circus Circus.

I'm giving 5 stars because it's 24 hours, it serves everything from breakfast, sandwiches, soups and desserts at decent prices. This place literally saved me and my friends and didn't just fill our tummies as the food was pretty good itself.

- The Chicken Noodle soup is explanatory in itself, it comes out hot with loads of large noodles and chicken and is given with a handful of saltines. 
- The California Sandwich has bacon, ham, swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato on wheat bread. The portion of this sandwich is enough for two! 
- The \"Sunwich\" is cheese, ham and egg on an English muffin with a side of their seasoned chunky potatoes and bell peppers.

Their drink selection is pretty good too from milk, juice, gatorade, energy drinks and beer! 

The workers here are really friendly, though service can be a bit slow ... it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here twice to eat. Between 2 people over $30+ each time. Just for 2 sandwiches, 2 orders of fries and 2 drinks that is not a reasonable price. I understand it is a place in a casino which casino places do tend to charge higher but we were actually paid guests staying so it would have been nice to have some sort of discount. The philly was enjoyable. The Italian was okay. The chilli cheese fries and cheese fries were okay. Wish they had more/better options. It also didnt help that they were short staffed and it took a while just to get our food but again I understand things happen."}
{"text":"I haven't had real good burger very long time ago. I ordered chicken breast and it was great."}
{"text":"First time here since moving out here despite numerous recommendations from friends and fellow yelpers. Great asset to the LV area when at 330am and craving everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese with lox. Very good bagels , some of the best I have had out here so far., good deli, clean and comfy atmosphere. Reminiscent of the classic delis back on LI."}
{"text":"Slop posing as food. Way overprice. Jaunita is extremely rude and shouldn't be employed anywhere. How did she get hired? 

Grouchy while taking our order. When we received our food it was literally thrown on the the plate (burger not even put together and all over the plate) when we complained about how the food was thrown on the plate she dismissed it and refused to fix it. When I came back around she was talking to customers about how we were rude to her.

And literally said \"this is a Deli why are they expecting 'cafe' quality?\" To her next customers. Which doesn't make sense but okay. 

I shouldn't have tipped her, she doesn't deserve it.

Jaunita, you have:
-poor customer service
-a bad attitude
-no people skills
-over all a very unpleasant person."}
{"text":"Pretty good...ordered the chili dog and even though I read what it said that is a foot long I didn't registered it properly in my mind. Is way too big, but that chili was just so good I was only able to eat half of my plate! Service was okay a bit slow!"}
{"text":"Had a sandwich here and it was bad. They forgot my cheese and it was cold when I got it. I did not taste fresh. I think subway is a lot better. 

Not your best choice by far."}
{"text":"10/10 for this little deli! It's a hidden gem. The BLT was amazing. So much bacon it was unreal! My friend got the turkey & bacon melt & she said it was delicious. 100% would come back into this hotel just for the sandwiches here."}
{"text":"I come here quite often to eat while working. The food is always fantastic, French dip is my favorite, and the girls behind the counter are always nice and smiling. The boys in the kitchen always know what I want, as I come here so often, and usually have it ready before I even finish paying for my sandwich.

Prices have gone up, WAY UP, so I don't come as often as I used to."}
{"text":"Pricey and just okay. Subway is just down the hall and would be less costly. Okay for a quick grab for convenience."}
{"text":"It's not terrible food, but it's not great either.  The upside to this place is that it is the only restaurant open 24 hours at Circus Circus."}
{"text":"Love this place. You get a good amount of food at a reasonable price. The staff was very friendly. Love the fact that it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the hotel, this is your go to place for a quick affordable snack/meal. Had coffee here every morning of my stay. Reasonable prices, good portion sizes. Had a Roast Beef Sandwich with side of coleslaw all for $8. Grabbed their Meaty \"Sun\"wich on checkout day, and it was awesome. Staff was quite friendly and welcoming."}
