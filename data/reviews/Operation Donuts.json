{"text":"These donuts are AMAZING!! I meant to take a before shot but here is the after photo! You won't be disappointed eating here! Operation Donuts is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Love their mini donuts!!! I make sure to stop by every Saturday at Tivoli Village's Farmers Market and get some for myself and my mom. I love how many toppings there are to choose from (even though my favorite is cinnamon/sugar). They even have a little crunch to them. I've tried other mini donuts in California markets and Operation Donuts definitely are the BEST. I look forward to the customer service as well! It's important to me that the person making the food has his/her soul in it and I know that Josh does! I've been able to get to know him over time with seeing him each Saturday and he definitely has a vision and a goal in mind with his business. Looking forward to this Saturday for more cinnamon/sugar mini donuts!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of first encountering Josh and his amazing donuts at the Summerlin Farmer's market.  His friendly demeanor and customer service was the best. He is by far one of the best donut masters in Las Vegas. I will travel near and far to enjoy his donuts!"}
{"text":"When I tell you these are amazing!!!!! I mean it, if I could I would have these everyday! The different flavors are so yummy I can't decide which one I love most. I'm a huge fan can't wait until you get a shop I'm there every weekend!"}
{"text":"5/5 Stars, I don't know what's in these donuts but they are the bomb dot com. Normally not a donut guy but picked some up at First Friday to satisfy a sweet tooth and I was not disappointed! Excited to try this Vegan donut everyone keeps talking about that they have!"}
{"text":"I love their donuts! I stop and get some every time I'm by the farmers market. They even made me a special order once. Good to do business with"}
{"text":"The best, made to order, hot, fresh, and DELICIOUS donuts EVER! My family make sure to grab some everytime we're at the farmers market!"}
