{"text":"I wouldn't give this place any stars if I could.
Terrible service and tiny portions compared to other All Star restaurants (STC & Vaughan).

Why the service?
Here'a the setting: There were only 2 orders of wings with 2 separate flavours for 3 people.

We were given the incorrect flavour (Cleopatra is a pretty distinct flavour). When we notified the manager, all he said was \"sorry\" with a smile that so insincere not to mention smug.  No offer to partially compensate, no offer to switch the wings. Not even a compensated coke!

Portions are tiny, we ordered fries and the basket it came in wasn't even full. 

Never again will I give my money to this restaurant. Mediocre food and horrible service.
***EDIT: pretty sure the guy below who rated it 5stars is the manager/owner who didn't give any care to assist with our incorrect order***"}

{"text":"One of the WORST bar's in Toronto, they played gangster rap music that had anti-black \"N\" WORDS, and misogynistic sexist rants...so I complained to the bartender. She chose to get sassy with her mouth, by  echoing my compliant back to me with a murmuring tone, like it was some kind of joke that I was offended by the music?! Then she made an excuse not to change the music \"it's all the way down stairs, so I can't change it...\" well, I will never return to this inconsiderate, incompetent dive again, when visiting T.O."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Got the ribs on tuesday for their special. The half rack ribs was dry and tasteless. On top of that the waitress informed me after the bill arrived that the discount rib special could not be applied for the half rack.. ended up waiting 30 mins for them to sort out the issue. After several arguments I decided this wasn't worth my time."}
{"text":"I ordered theWutt?? Sandwich delicious and my boyfriend ordered wings he lived them !! Good food highly recommend!! Burgers are good too!!"}
{"text":"This was place was alright. Good thing is that they have a lot on their menu. They have a whole page for grilled cheese and a whole page for wings for example. I wasn't a huge fan of their chicken wings. It was a pound of really small wings so it felt like most of the weight was from the bone. There was also a rule that you can't share 1 pound wings...i don't think there should be rules on how to eat your food. It's not like it was all you can eat. The nachos was okay but I felt like it was a bit overpriced for what we got. Their pulled pork grilled cheese was good though. Not sure if I will revisit to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Monday night is wing special night.  
They give you and 1.5 pounds for the price of 1.   I'm almost certain they change the variety of wing on Mondays.   Went previously on another night and they were big and juicy.  However this winter special night the wings were Itty bitty Skimpy  lil things and dry  to the bone."}
{"text":"It was my first time.
We came to watch a game. We absolutely loved it!
Very nice, clean sport bar with a lot of TV. I was surprised, when I saw high tables with small TV.
Menu has American food ( putin, onions rings, burgers, wings, ribs) mostly. It's good with )
They was busy, but our waitress always checked our table in the right time.
And very important for me, they have a dessert menu!!!
We definitely will back!!"}
{"text":"i don't need 20 large screen teevees blaring.

i don't need 200 sauces.

i don't need a twelve page or so menu with 200 sauces for everything and the kitchen sink.

i want good wings with a reasonable number of flavours.

i also want them to be chicken wings.

i think i got pigeon wings.

teensy weensy wings. sure a pound is a pound but meat over skin any day.

the funny thing is that you need only walk 3 minutes and find large size wings, perfectly done with - on no! - only 3 sauces.

for a third less money."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for wings and instead of going to the usual haunt of Louis cifer (whose wings are excellent) we decided to try something new. The first sign of concern was the size of the wing menu. There were around 100 sauces, and with the minimal turnover at this restaurant, it made the freshness of the sauces highly questionable. I ordered one of the very hot flavours that had a traditional Buffalo wing sauce according to the server. When the order arrived I was disappointed at the size of the chicken wings but the taste was decent enough and accompanied by a pint it was a serviceable experience. Around 3 am I woke up with sharp pangs of nausea and a cold sweat. Food poisoning sucks, and for several hours I was in severe discomfort and condemning myself for going to a restaurant where I had alarm bells going off. The lesson here is to distrust near empty restaurants with needlessly extensive menus."}
{"text":"Very Good food and service, they have more than 200 flavours of wings and  our server explained us all the wings flavours and helped us choose the one we wanted to satisfy our taste buds.
The kids menu is very reasonable in price.
Good for vegetarians many options."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend tonight. We have ALWAYS loved AllStars and are regulars at the STC location, so we were really happy to hear that this location opened up since it's a lot more convenient. 

This location is pretty clean, but If it wasn't I would be surprised cause it's new- I like how they have outdoor seating and open up the doors/ windows. The manager/owner here is really nice- she welcomed us when we came in, and she even checked back with our table to see which kind of water we preferred. Our waitress was really nice but she kept bending down at our table and fixing her bra right in front of us (not cool at all). I know it's a sports bar, but come on. Another table seated near us requested to turn the lights off since there was a game, and the workers obliged right away- but the other tables around were confused as to why they're eating in the dark. You can't cater to one table and not the 4 others around it. 

The food was great! We ordered the slick greek and cleopatra wings, and also an order of their garlic bread and jalape√±o poppers. We did however go on a Monday though, where they're supposed to give you more than a pound as their special, and it was definitely not the portion we were used to. Whenever my boyfriend and I go eat at AllStars on Mondays we end up having so much wings left but we finished everything this time (strange). I would come back here and give this place another chance...but kinda disappointing considering we paid so much tonight for this kind bittersweet experience."}
{"text":"I've gone to all the original all star locations, and always loved it. So, when I found out they opened one downtown (well, relatively downtown), I had to check it out. It's not the same as I remember though. From what I remember, they used to charge in multiples of 10, and I think if you ordered 50 you got 4 sauce choices?  they also seems smaller from what I remember? I got 5 lbs of wings here to share amoungst 3 people, and and extra choice of sauce. I remember that it used to be a struggle to eat 50 wings amoungst 3 people, but here, we finished the 5lbs (roughly 50 wings) relatively easily and I could have personally eaten 15-20 more. It wasn't bad....but it wasn't as satisfying or addictive as I remember. Even if I had nothing to compare to, it'd still only be an ok wing place on par with any of the others in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love all stars, however I will never come back to this location. I ordered the sweet heat and when the waitress went in the back the cook questioned her if the customer knew chocolate was an ingredient she screamed yes \"people like that disgusting stuff.\" There was no music turned on yet so I heard it crystal clear. The wings we ordered barely had any sauce on them, they were very dry. We ordered a blue cheese, ranch, and dill; we received two ranch and a dill in a smaller size cup than the other two dips. They're super cheap with their sauces, their wings are tiny with barely any meat on them, no bar, and poor customer service. This is my second visit with issues. I'll make the drive to Scarborough from here on out."}
{"text":"was delicious. saturday night nooo wait! had a big party with me. Service was great. Price was same as usual. flavours were good. always get the pandora, love u long time..all star. delicious. no complaints. washrooms were clean."}
{"text":"This place was such a bust! Nothing close to the Vaughan location or other All Stars I've been to. Service was slow, the server got our orders wrong and water was never refilled unless we asked. The only good part of our evening was that the server was kind, and she had our wings remade since they weren't correct. 

Don't eat wings when you go to the Danforth! Lesson learned."}
{"text":"It was 11pm on a Friday night. After a long day we just wanted our wings. We always go to the Rutherford location and its always great. However because we were in the area we decided to go here. WRONG. 

The server was delightful. That was pretty much the only thing that slightly made our experience better. We ordered 1 lb hot and honey + extra vegetables and 2 lbs plain hot sauce on the side. Because there was alot of Uber orders, Rebecca (our server) informed us that she was sorry that we still haven't received our food and that it will come out shortly. I appreciated the fact that she had informed us because we have been waiting so long.

The food finally came out and it was wrong. Instead of hot sauce on the side it was all over the wings. Rebecca had told us they made a mistake and if we would like for them to redo it. However because we already waited so long we said forget it just bring it. She said the manager would like to offer fries for the inconvenience. If we wanted fries we would have ordered them.. so that was pretty useless to us. My order of hot and honey was straight honey garlic and the extra vegetables never came. 

Overall, most likely will never be coming back to this establishment ever again. Just stick to the north locations because this place is a complete fail."}
