{"text":"Well, the food looked great but the place was dead. I wonder what they do to bring in people to the underground location. Upstairs seems to be doing alright.

The manager kept walking back and forth without addressing our table which was front and centre. 

The bartender and him I could hear swearing from the kitchen when they went into the back of house. Completely unacceptable. 

Not a fan. Will not return."}
{"text":"While I like the place, right now they seem to be overwhelmed with people redeeming vouchers from a deal of the day site.  Probably best to stay away until things settle down"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! the atmosphere was ambiant and romantic. The food was amazing! and very reasonable for the amount and the quality.
The chef made dietary allowances especially for me...which NEVER happens in restaurants.
The customer service was fantastic from the moment we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome the service was attentive but not overbearing.
We are HIGHLY recommending this place, and are definately returning with friends...A lot!

LOVE the decor! and the fixed menu choices"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday in a group of approx 14. #1. I find it strange that a group fix price menu is different from individual fix price menu. While not in a group, your dinner will include dessert. Whereas in a group dessert suddenly becomes a la carte. 

#2. At 10:20pm there was a belly dancing show... However only ONE belly dancer for the whole restaurant. It's sister restaurant at least had multiple dancers the last time I went. Starters were both cold choices, I went with a Cous Cous salad instead of gazpacho. My appetizer was another salad, this time on a fried rice paper basket. 3rd course was a amuse bouche sorbet. Lastly my main was a seafood broth 'twas alright it had muscles in a tomato broth with other bits of calamari and fish. Seemed like an appetizer plate I would order at other restaurants.

Also moroccan tea is offered to those not on group menu.... We may as well have booked tables of 4 beside each other to have a higher class of service.

Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I went to BerBer for a dinner with my husband. The place is gorgeous and the decor is amazing. We found it cold inside and it kind of smelled like a basement in there. The food was nothing spectacular but it was tasty. It was presented nicely.

For the price we paid for the two of us I wouldn't go back. If you're looking for authentic Moroccan cuisine try a place that's not so flashy and focused on looks."}
{"text":"We went to Berber on a Thursday night for drinks around 8 pm. We were surprised that we were the ONLY people in the entire lounge at that time. We were in 2 minds whether we should just leave but decided to at least have a drink. Their drink menu seemed kinda limited, apparently they don't serve any food coz they close by 9 PM on Thursday since not many people come by. Really??? 

On another note, it's a really pretty lounge, done up very well. I just can't get why there's no one there on a Thursday night! The place is dead and I won't be back!"}
{"text":"The food was alright. I ordered the seafood appetizer (good), grilled entree (ok - my medium steak was overly well done and dry) and baklava (good). The prix fix was $39. Not worth it at all.

The service was horrendous. They seated our party of 4, then re-seated us to a less comfortable booth 10 minutes later. The service was super slow... about 1 hr wait for food. I had to eat my really dry steak with a butter knife until I was able to flag down the server (she walked past me 5 times before I was noticed). 

The seating was extremely uncomfortable. It was like sitting on stools eating at an end table. 

The music entertainment was AMAZING!!! 

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I went to BerBer Lounge for my birthday. I had such a good time!!

The servers were really friendly but service was very slow. By the time my entree came, I didn't bother eating it. The appetizers, I'd say most of my guests enjoyed, but  the general consensus was that the entree was not all that great. Dessert, no one felt like eating and it was too over priced for basically dried fruit and cookies. 

The music and the atmosphere were great. Its a great place to come with a group of friends to party without feeling claustrophobic....unless thats your kind of thing.

I'd go back but next time order the shared platter instead of the individual plates."}
{"text":"I am no fool, the Berbers lived in the desert and lived in quite shabbily built mud/clay buildings, and they didn't decorate their walls with wooden panels and fancy paint colours because they didn't have trees in the desert, nor did they have paint!
I'm a cultured man, but what do you want...it's Toronto.

BerBer Lounge is right next door to the Sultan's Tint & Caf√© Moroc, you descend down a small flight of stairs and enter a heavy door in to the dimly lit premisses. The well stocked bar canals the two areas of the lounge.  The South end with booths, and the North end a semi-segregated vip-ish area which can sit up to two dozen patrons.  Despite this, the lounge retains a welcoming and non-hostile ambiance.  Beautifully decorated but uncomfortable wooden furniture, carpeting on the walls (never got that), vintage-like lamps, free-standing lanterns, and lots of drapery.  The place is simply beautiful!  
Full bar, full kitchen, bottle service, and all of it for a very reasonable price.  A bottle of sparkling wine can be as low as $35.
A four course meal for under $39, or the a-la-carte menu which is best befitting for the venue.  This is my ideal place for a finger food and wine gatherings with my slightly more matured associates.  A great clubbing alternative!

The drinks doesn't come as fast as I want it to, and the service can be improved with more attentive waiters...but these are points to improve on, not shortcomings.  

It was awkward for me to find a comfortable position in their uncushioned seats at the North end, but in the same chair I've received a random free massage courtesy of a very fine lady, so it's all good memories.  Didn't envy the pillow pillaged south side for a moment.  The barkeep is quite skilled at his craft and the food ain't bad either.  
Again, I am no fool.  Few BerBers have ever had it so good, and this is leaps beyond from authentic....but I'm not complaining, because the authentic BerBer experience is probably more of a pilgrimage than....this.

A real Lounge where one can--lounge. 
Missing something though...perhaps, a real BerBerian..."}
{"text":"Nice decor but service wasn't great!

I went there last Saturday for a friends birthday, and wasn't impress with customer service.  I usually don't feel that way with places because I  work in this area.  Why I say this?  We all knew it would be a pricey but having our drinks and food taken before it was finished was upsetting.  I had drank half of my gin and tonic as it was sitting on the table, came back from the bathroom and it was gone.  My friends meal had more than half on her plate, didn't ask and took it away in front of her.  The lights are dim but there's no excuse.  What happen to asking if we're done?

Food was okay but it would've been nice if they had condiments.  We asked for hot sauce but they didn't have any.  The menu is confusing, we had our waitress explaining multiple times.  I would stick to their 3 course meal cause they'll end up ordering it, which I asked for something specifically.  

Decor is amazing cause it does feel like we're in Middle East.  If you have back problems, stay away from this place.  All their furniture and tables are low."}
{"text":"Giving this place even one star is too much. Terrible over priced food, small portions and slow service. Do not order the $27 stuff chicken as it's four small pieces of dry chicken. Our waiter said it was enough for four people, not. We went here as we couldn't get into the Sultan's Tent, which is where we wanted to eat. They referred us downstairs to this place saying it was good. Take my advice and go some where else if you can't get into the Sultan's Tent."}
{"text":"I went to BerBer for the Brew Benefit event that Dishcrawl was hosting. Let me start off by saying that this place isn't usually open on a Sunday, but they graciously opened their doors to us for the event and I am forever thankful. Thank you BerBer!

This place was amazing, but it was quite hidden. I would have never gone to this place on my own, but this event opened up my eyes to the greatness that is BerBer. Once you see the Sultan's Tent, there's a large door on the side of the building and you are led into BerBer. BerBer's atmosphere is definitely reflected from the outside, and it's carried all the way into the lounge. The decor in the place is all imported and it's absolutely beautiful. I've never spent so long staring at the decor in a building... and I wasn't even drunk yet. 

Next, the service: Service was GREAT! There were a total of about 130 tickets sold for the event and we were expecting places to get pretty crowded. I don't think BerBer anticipated the crowds that came in that day because there were only two bartenders, one manager, and some kitchen staff. The bartenders were great. They handled the crowds very well and still managed to smile. Although I could tell that one guy was getting a bit frustrated and flustered, he never took it out on the guests that day. Both bartenders and manager were amazing that day and I couldn't have asked for better service. With the increased amount of drink orders that day, my friend's food order got lost in the mix, so one of the bartender's gave her a drink on the house. Great damage control! 

And the food... Omg the food. So there were 2 $5 specials on the menu that day and they were fish tacos and mac and cheese. The fish tacos were great. They were... inverted?... hahaha not quite sure how to explain them, but they were basically battered pieces of fish sitting on some type of white sauce. It was all pretty amazing. And as for the mac and cheese? I wish I had the recipe for this because it was great. White cheeses... elbow pasta... baked... sprinkled with more white cheese and some corn flakes (yes, corn flakes lol) good god it was just great. 

I died and went to BerBer heaven that day. Try this place out!

P.S. to the 2 bartenders that were working the Brew Benefit, kudos to you two! You were both amazing!"}
{"text":"My friend had her birthday here. 

You walk down a flight of stairs and arrive at a beautifully decorated lounge.
The decor is very authentic. 

She reserved the front lounge area, we all ordered delicious cocktails. The drinks were on point. We also ordered a seafood platter - I highly recommend this.  Again, absolutely great. 

A lot of her friends trickled in, all had a few drinks, it came to the point, we didn't know who was coming and going and it was a full fledged party.  How to bill all this?

Berber was amazing. The bartender/ server, just put everyone on one huge bill, with the items on it, and as each person was  leaving, they just saw the bill, highlighted what they had, and paid for it. 

All was accounted for, I don't think that system would work for randoms, but everyone is a group of trustworthy friends, so it worked perfectly. Very accommodating, in terms of the staff.

There was some sort of performance going on, a woman singing, but it changed to just some light electronic music thereafter.

It was a great space to sit , chat, drink, hang out. It is not a dance club.

The food and drink are great here. I am sure a bit pricey but it is SO worth it."}
{"text":"Feb 6th day after the latest snowstorm.  Shovel snow or try Winterlicious?  Need I say?  Went with a group of 10 people after work. Reviews raved about drinks but food had mixed opinions.  

The service was attentive.  The food was okay and well priced for Winterlicious.  Decor was exotic and felt like stepping into a Moroccan treasure.  Food was not memorable but executed well.  It might do better if they served really good Moroccan instead of standard fare like olive tapenade or steak."}
{"text":"Interesting place to go , food and environment needs improvement. Belly dancing was interesting during dinner but a decent social place for casual dinner . Would say not a place for dating. Company event would not recommend"}
{"text":"I recently went here for a Christmas party and was very underwhelmed. We were in the basement and the decor was absolutely gorgeous but that was the best part of the evening.

When I heard this is where we were going I got excited for Moroccan food but was met with the \"Let's keep white people happy\" banquet menu that included chicken and waffles, eggplant parmesan, and creme br√ªl√©e. It was $55 a head and absolutely not worth with it. 

The food was not terrible by any means, it was actually quite tasty in fact, but the portions were a complete joke. The best way to describe it would be fine dining presentation with Jack Astor's quality. Small amounts of food piled high on large plates (the chicken supreme for example included about 2oz of chicken breast or half of a half chicken breast) and the food although good was NOT anywhere close to fine dining.

The party I was in was about 35-40 people and the staff did try their absolute hardest but honestly had no clue how to handle a party this size. They were uncoordinated, looked and acted really stressed (I honestly don't blame them) and were stuck in a world somewhere between trying to pull off something that resembled proper service and not crying. They gave us 1 server to take the order of that many people and the poor girl tried but my god did she look overwhelmed. I'm a reasonable person and strongly believe that this was not the staffs fault at all. It was management's fault. If your staff can't handle a party of 40, either train them properly or don't take the party. 

The kitchen was also a disaster that couldn't handle a party as large as ours. We had 3 tables and people at the first table had finished eating their entrees before mine had even been brought out of the kitchen. The menu was prefixed 5 course and came out in waves according to who ordered what option but it was clear that whoever was in the kitchen just couldn't keep up. Again, management's problem. 

I really do feel for the staff that has to deal with such a poorly run operation and honestly hope that things get better for them. Beyond that, I would not recommend a banquet or large party at this place at all, but I can't speak to what their regular menu or service is like. I'm sure it's better so I would give them a chance there."}
{"text":"There were 40 people in my party. We were there to celebrate three birthdays. The ambience is nice but that's all I can say about this place. For 40 people, we only had 1 server. So the service was slow and we were looking for the server most of the time. It took 2 hours before we got our food. My dish was cold and burnt. It also gave me a stomach ache and I ended up spending 20 mins sick in the washroom. When it was time to pay, we had to line up in a single file at the cash register. For the amount we paid for our food, it was NOT worth it! I will not go back to this restaurant and I don't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"I went her recently for a friend's birthday. There were around 20 people in the party and Berber accommodated our group well. Great Moroccan-themed decor with lots of comfy pillows and lush colours. Even the bathroom is pretty! Food looked tasty (but I had already eaten), with various sharing platters of middle eastern dishes. Drinks were reasonably priced, I think ~$10-12 for a martini. They do charge cover on saturdays, $10, but free if you come early enough for dinner or are part of a group on the guestlist. Music was your standard top 40 with some random tunes thrown in (disco?). It's an older crowd, mostly 30's+. Refreshingly un-scene-y and there is actually space to dance without bumping into a bunch of strangers every few seconds, which is nice! A fun place for drinks and dancing!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice but hard to find...they forgot my order but gave it to me for free after waiting a long time to receive it. The have excellent service"}
{"text":"Nice decor and the drinks are quite strong. Good place to come with a group to lift the somewhat sleepy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here tonight, the martinis ($10-12) were delicious. We sat In the bar area and had a fabulous server (His name was Isreal) he gave us fabulous recommendations and was very attentive to everyone in the area. The food ($11-13) was really good: stuffed seashells (stuffed w cheesy scallops), the red chicken curry, and brochetta. 
The decor is Moroccan, it's nice, but a little over the top in some places.
Good soundtrack as well."}
