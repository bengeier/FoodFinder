{"text":"Once your pallet becomes blasé with the options at Chatime and Green Grotto, you must come check out Gong Cha! Their mustache series uses real tea and milk! Their base teas are Green, Black, Alisan, Oolong and Earl Gray; you gotta try them all!! (Try basil seeds too, and natural and delicious alternative to tapioca!)"}
{"text":"Came here after I saw the opening weekend special- Buy 1 Get 1 Free. Lined up for over 30min in the afternoon. After ordering my drinks, it came up to over $10..then I asked about the promo special? She told me it's only applicable to #8 and #9....ok so then I had to change my order. I just feel that I've been misled by the BOGO Advertisement....nowhere does it mention only for certain drinks. There was no sign mentioning that inside the store! After ordering, we had to wait on the side for the drinks. That took like another 10min!! This is ridiculous! While waiting, I noticed a lot of people are not happy after realizing the promo only applies to #8 and #9 and had to change the order. I think they should have at least informed people about it, this wastes a  lot of time since some people had to change their order and feeling disappointed in the end. I would not have lined up for this if I had knew from the beginning that the BOGO only applies to 2 drinks!"}
{"text":"This bbt place is my new guilty pleasure. I love the milk foam it's just soo satisfying! The location is not ideal for me because it's quite a drive (30 mins away) but my girlfriend and I would make the trip whenever our cravings kick in. A must try is their wintermelon milk foam."}
{"text":"This place is essentially a Chatime, but I have to admit I like the milk tea better here. The tea just tastes.....more like tea! I had the milk tea with tapioca and loved it. 

They're well known for their milk foam topping,which can be added to any drink. I don't really see why it's so popular though. It kind of reminds me of salty whipped cream, floating on top of your beverage. Not my \"cup of tea\" (har har I'm so punny), but it's definitely an interesting experience when you first try to figure out how to drink the thing properly."}
{"text":"Came in for the B1G1 promo today. The place is still in preparation for their grand opening this week. 
Server was friendly and knowledgeable.
I had the milk foam wintermelon tea. It was excellent!
I would say this place is on par with Chatime just down the street in terms of quality and price. 
So I recommend while they have the B1G1 promotion."}
{"text":"Ordered milk foam wintermelon tea. Very nice!! A bit too sweet for me, will probably go with less sugar next time. 
Milk foam was really really nice!! 
And like someone says here, the guys worked there is really nice and offer suggestions and being accommodating. 
One star off simply because it's abit pricey than other bbt places. But wintermelon milk foam tea is 5/5."}
{"text":"The baristas were slow and have little knowledge on how to make the drinks. The royal milk tea tasted disgusting because they watered down. Also they messed up on the request of substituting pearls with red beans in the taro milk tea."}
{"text":"If I can I will rate 0 star. I just purchased two milk foam tea at this location. I was a fan of Gongcha but not any more after this purchase. When I opened the lid to sip on the milk foam, I saw a small flying insect in the milk foam. It's so disgusting."}
{"text":"Ok so I heard of this place through my friend and decided to try it. It is quite far so I was always lazy to venture out there.

First off, I being shit with directions circled the plaza 3 times and finally found it (after entering the sketchy food court multiple times). But when I found it, it looked nice and clean. Definitely the cleanest looking shop in this plaza which I am thankful for.

Now I hadn't heard of any comparisons to other bubble tea places until cha time was brought into the equation. 

I agree with most people that the royal milk tea, although I don't know what's royal about it, tastes pretty good. I asked for the \"lite ice\" option and 50% sugar as well. 

I don't know if I got lucky but the milk tea had a nice blend of the milk and the actual tea! Now the tapioca on the other hand was on the chewy side and some may like it, but I just associate chewy tapioca with it not being fresh.

I've only tried this place once because it's completely out of the way, and will try it again just to confirm my review."}
{"text":"I have been to countless bubbletea places and I definitely prefer Gong Cha. I always order the roasted oolong milk tea with pudding. You can actually taste the roasted oolong. Sometimes I go wild and add grass jelly and tapioca as well. I also notice a lot of other bubbletea places don't have pudding as a topping, therefore I must come here and get my fix. I would say this place is more for take-out because seating is limited and it can get pretty noisy with all the blenders."}
{"text":"I came here on Monday night  with my girlfriend and we ordered a winter melon tea and a green tea. They were both part of the Buy One Get One promotion and I gotta say they were delicious. I really liked the winter melon tea. It was adequately sweet but the staff said it contained no added sugar.

All of the tables were filled with people, but I didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for my drink, although I did come around 10:30pm on a Monday night, so that could have something to do with it.

Overall delicious tea, incredible value, and the service was fine.

Update: Went back again last night and without the promotional B1G1, I could not forgive the time it took to get my tea. The line itself was not long, but I still had to wait 15 minutes to get my two winter melon teas AFTER I ordered. I'm not sure why it took so long especially when there were 4 girls preparing the orders and only 3 other people ahead of me waiting for their 2 drink orders. The tea was still delicious, but I had to take it down a star cause of the wait."}
{"text":"This Gong Cha's products are the closest tasting to the real thing I've had outside of Taiwan. I've been to all 3 locations in Northern California and they were crap, so I was very cautious about trying out this location. 

The drinks really taste authentic, albeit slightly sweeter than I'm used to. The Black Forest drink is super sweet but addictive because its all desert toppings. You really should try it at least once. 

I wish this place wasn't so expensive, because I've been going there everyday while I'm in town, but it keeps the wife happy so I guess its worth it. The service is random, sometimes its really slow, but as long as the drinks are consistently on point, I'm fine with it. Parking as so far been easy which is a rarity in a Chinese mall."}
{"text":"Got two drinks for their grand opening special- buy one get one free. I got (L) royal milk tea with pearl for myself and (L) winter melon milk tea with herabl jelly for free for my friend. 

Pro: the staff who served was really nice and patient. But somehow she got my sugar option wrong which I asked for regular sugar for both and ended up gave me 70% of sugar.

Cons: I'm really big fan of pearl milk tea, but honestly, GongCha royal milk tea I can't taste any milk or tea. It just tasted like water. I was really dispointed. Definitely not going back again."}
{"text":"I received fact service unlike some review say. I tried the wintermelon milk tea foam thing and just a regular bubble tea with red beans and pearls. They were both very tasty. 30% sugar is ideal."}
{"text":"The service is good but the drink I got was only alright. I got a oolong milk tea with grass jelly and all I could taste is the milk. Maybe they were low on tea but even my drink looked white like milk. It even had a powdery after taste to it. I would not get that drink again but I wouldn't mind going back to try something else."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Great customer service. Amazing drinks. 

First time coming here. Every time I go to a BBTea place I always get a Taro Milk Tea with bubbles. Why you may ask. It is because it seems simple but its is also the easiest drink to mess up. If a place cannot make me a good Taro Milk Tea with bubbles, they are out in my books.

Lucky for me, they made it beautifully. Not too sweet. Not much ice. (Just like i asked) It was creamy and smooth. Will definitely come back and try their different drinks."}
{"text":"I was really shocked at the ratings that Gong cha got and decided that I should share my input about them (my first yelp review!). I never had Gong Cha before until this one opened nearby where i live. The staff here are so friendly unlike the Chatime across the street. I been to both places multiple times and i would have to say the customer service is much better at Gong Cha. They are really helpful when it comes to choosing drinks and explains them well. The drinks are really good and is a great spot to just hang out with friends. 

The price is pretty much the same price you would get at any other bubble tea shop so no big surprise there. I tried out the #3 Wintermelon Milk tea with grass jelly and it was so good! I usually stray away from grass jelly since it taste so pungent, but surprisingly I really liked the grass jelly here. It doesn't have the pungent or medicinal taste at all and is really soft. I first had a sample of this during there grand opening and really liked it. 

Just a positive experience every time i come here though I just wished they had paper takeout menus since that would be really convenient. I totally recommend this place to everyone especially for those bubble tea lovers."}
{"text":"As reviewers have also stated, I was very disappointed at the quality of the drinks here.  I had the Royal Milk Tea with tapioca.  The drink just tasted like water and cream powder and there was next to no actual tea flavour.  The tapioca was also quite bland and way too soft and overcooked.  My friend had their signature Wintermelon foam drink and she says that it as okay but nothing special.  With all the new competition here in this area Gongcha would not be near the top of our go to tea shops to visit.
On another note, why is it so dark in here?  It's eerie and does not make for a comfortable environment as it is already quite a small space."}
{"text":"Yo famdem this place heard you had a ting with chatime and was nice with it. Mans think their sick though running out of tapioca all the time like cool it fam like one of those tings that sends you a \"you up\" text at 3 am and doesnt respond but its still lit out here fam 5/5"}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of positive reviews about Gong Cha, I visited for the first time yesterday. I got their 3rd most popular drink - winter melon milk tea with grass jelly. I asked for 30% sugar, and less ice. I'm sure there was a mix up because it tasted extremely sweet, probably 100%, so I didn't enjoy my drink very much. I definitely did not taste any winter melon flavour, but it could be because of the sweetness. There wasn't a lot of grass jelly, so if you're looking for something to chew on, get the tapioca instead. 

We also got an oolong tea with milk foam, 30% sweet, less ice. It was pretty good. I would definitely get it again. 

Overall, it was a-ok. I would definitely go back, and try other things. Just be careful with your sweetness level!"}
{"text":"Tried the milk foam oolong tea this time. Not as good as the wintermelon one. Will stick to that next time. Also, the milk foam novelty is kind of gone now..."}
{"text":"Their moustache series is fabulous. I tried my friend's Wintermelon tea, and it was delicious.

However, if you're coming here for the regular milk tea (as I did,) I'd recommend CoCo's instead. Fresher tea and better flavour. Come here for the moustache series, if anything."}
{"text":"Loves it. Personally, I prefer Gongcha over Chatime. The consistency on the percentage of sweet/ice is great at Gongcha but not so much for chatime. Chatime would depend on location, how busy and who's making it. It's never the same I find - which annoys me."}
{"text":"GongCha, lauded for its milk foam and unique flavours such as wintermelon, has opened up a new location in North York.  To celebrate, they will be having a BOGO sale on select drinks from May 15 to 18!

Much like ChaTime, you can choose your sweetness and ice levels, customization akin to Starbucks. You can even use your Vicinity card here just like ChaTime. It's a bit pricier than ChaTime but you get some signature drinks such as the Earl Grey Milk with 3 Jellies!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for bbt so I decided to try this new place out. The winter melon milk foam green tea is good! I had it with basil seeds! Also the roasted oolong is really good with pudding. 
5 star for good service, nice decor, & delicious bbt. Will be back to try the other teas"}
{"text":"I'm used to like Gong Cha's Wintermelon Milkfoam, it's a drink that I usually order. I was in the area for dinner today, so I figured I would drop by and order a drink. I had redeemed enough points for a free beverage. However upon ordering, I was told that the reward would only be a small drink, so i can't pay extra for upsize... (60 points for large drink) which was fine by me. So I proceeded to order my usual Wintermelon Milkfoam. The server then notified me that the reward only covers the base drink, and that I would have to pay extra for the foam. I found this to be utterly ridiculous, seeing as how the Wintermelon Milkfoam is actually an item on their menu. And on top of all that, the girl manager working there was not pleasant. I am very disappointed with my experience here, Yonge location is much better. And I found their rewards system to be very unrewarding!!!"}
{"text":"Opening hours are not as flexible as I would like - closes earlier than preferred (11 pm or midnight ish) BUT the service is great and so are the drinks! I actually prefer Gong Cha more than Chatime especially the drinks with tea because you can actually taste real tea. Also a big bonus is that there's usually no line."}
{"text":"Gong Cha recently opened a location in North York and it's more spacious than their Markham location, but just as packed! 

They have a grand opening special - Buy one get one free for four of their signature drinks. I got the winter melon milk tea with herbal jelly and got a royal bubble tea free! 

Prices are pretty average compared to the competition in the area. The winter melon milk tea was rich in flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. The Royal bubble tea did not impress - tasted pretty bland but the tapioca was nicely cooked. 

The staff was tremendously busy because of their grand opening so service was brisk and cold. I'm not a fan of Chatime, but Gong Cha takes the same Vicinity Card if you have one! 

My go-to bubble tea in the area is still ShareTea, but if you're looking for somewhere with seating, Gong Cha is a good option!"}
{"text":"Since this location opened my wife and I come in for drinks about 2-3 times a month, and have been sticking to only a few drinks. The drinks are delicious, however inconsistent with the sweetness level.

Though I do dread the service! Only one staff member is genuinely courteous (likely the owner), the rest of the staff seems rude and as if they don't even want to work there.

Often times the staff is complaining, swearing or acting unprofessionally with each other or their friends who hang out there.

Today, I was very disappointed in the service. When I arrived the 2 staff members were at the cash having a conversation. When I walked up I gave them a smile, they glanced at me and continued talking to each other. I assumed it was quite important so I let them finish their last thoughts.

They were bashing other staff members for keeping the cash drawer open and were missing cash. This carried into other topics for about a minute.

Finally having knowledged me, rudely they asked if I was ready yet.

I tired I change the tone by using please and thank you in my interaction, but was returned with a dirty look.

And when paying by interact the person on cash was trying to look at my pin 

My final thoughts, the management need to take a look on how to train their employees or hire those who know basic etiquette and manners."}
{"text":"The staff was attentive, friendly and the entire decor/ambiance of the place is great.   

If you don't know what to drink just choose among the top ten suggestions :D

I picked taro milk tea with red bean which was so tasty.
Also the red bean was good quality.

The concept and taste is similar with the chai time... little bit pricey but worth the cost.:)"}
{"text":"Move over, you-know-what-time - there's a new bubble tea queen in my books, and Gong Cha reigns.

Beyond customizing sugar and ice levels (though you can also certainly do so here), there are a lot of topping options: regular tapioca pearls, white pearls, coconut jelly, grass jelly, aiyu jelly, aloe jelly, basil seeds, milk foam...

Providing free samples of a couple options, Gong Cha is the first and only place I've actually enjoyed the milk foam/mousse in a bubble tea.  Thickly frothed milk that sits on the top of any drink, it's faintly savoury when sipped on its own yet barely discernible once mixed in - think salted caramel. Mmm.

Today's Brown Sugar Oolong Tea was the gateway to my new Gong Cha addiction.  While I've learned that at 70% sugar level is way too high for my taste, it actually had a strong tea flavour that still cut through the sweetness and the milk.  Plus, duh to me, it has Sugar right in the name!

Loved the instructions provided by the staff to remove the lid and sip off the brown sugar bits floating above the creamy milk cloud to enjoy their cookie-like texture.  Plus just in case I missed it, it also came with a sticker with 3 other different ways to enjoy the texture and flavour.  

Hmm, I only got to try 2 out of 3 - guess I'll have to go back again tomorrow and give the rest a shot.  Oh yes, I am *that* addicted right now..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and I really liked the place! It's not just a typical random bubble tea place since they had quite a bit to offer. The selling point for me was that I was able to control the sweetness and the amount of ice in my drink. I usually find drinks too sweet at times and being able to control that is 2 thumbs up in my books! I really enjoyed my coconut milk taro drink. Some places I've been too won't even mix the 2 flavours for me. I'll definitely be back to see what else they have to offer and if it's anything as good as my first drink...well I'm going to be Hella broke this summer."}
{"text":"Love love love their mustard creme wintermelon tea. I can even dream about it at night sometimes. I wish they have Gong Cha in my city. However, it is really a small place, I wouldnt feel comfortable sitting there. So I take 1 star of because of the tiny place."}
{"text":"Maybe my new fave bubble tea place?! But it's so far away  I wish there was one closer to home!!

I've been venturing out to Markham lately and came across gong cha! Sooooo good! I really enjoyed it!! I love the toppings especially the milk foam! It's so different from the typical places I go to in Mississauga. It was a nice change and a delicious one at that!! I ordered a taro milk tea with milk foam, grass jelly and tapioca (i know, i like to put multiple toppings in mine) with less sugar and less ice. It was delish I wasn't sure what to expect with the milk foam but it was a nice surprise! Super creamy, light and tasty! 

I wish I had easy access to it so I could try everything they have!"}
{"text":"Location: Very accessible by subway. About 5-10 minute walk from Finch station.

Price: Drinks are all around $5-7 each.

Food: my most personal favourite at this place is the milk foam! It's a unique combination of sweet and salty (strange, but delicious!) I didn't realize the magic taste of salted crema until I find this place! The foam is slightly heavy so it goes well with a light, slightly sweet drink. The wintermelon tea with milk foam was amazing! I was slightly sceptical about veggies in my drink but I'm sold!

Seating: they have about 3 huge tables so it's good for huge groups. They also have free WiFi so people sometimes sit and study.

Overall: Nice place for foamy tea and large/small groups!"}
{"text":"Your typical bubbletea joint.  Similar to other competitor, you have ability to change sweet level, ice level etc. Array of selection to choose from. For those whom are overwhelmed with selection, there's a top 10 list to choose from.

More parking available at back. Good for very casual conversation. Not many tables available. Best in small groups"}
{"text":"Gong Cha has always been one of my favourite bbt spots, but my love for it exponentially increased after going to Korea. I guess Gong Cha is the go to place for bbt in Korea because it is EVERYWHERE. I kid you not. 

After returning from my trip I was really excited to go back to Gong Cha, but I'd forgotten the menu would differ. I don't know if they just do it better in Korea or what, but I didn't really enjoy the passion fruit qq drink I got here.. Perhaps I should've stuck to what I usually get (taro milk tea with red bean) instead of venturing out.

The location is of a decent size with comfortable seating, especially if you're staying to do some work. The service is inconsistent, being quite subpar the last time I went.

That won't deter me from coming back though. I just love Gong Cha too much."}
{"text":"I prefer this to Chatime. Their drinks are more flavourful (stronger tea taste) and refreshing. My favourite drink is the brown sugar oolong tea!"}
{"text":"There are so many places you can get bubble tea in Markham. I tried out Gong Cha because everyone raves about their foamed tea. It was like any other typical bubble tea place, but the foam was up to my expectations. Slightly overrated though. Prices run around $5-8  depending on what drink you order and the modification you want on it. 
They accept vicinity rewards cards."}
{"text":"If you ever wondered what poison tastes like, I think I may have found it at Gongcha. Throat burning, stomach pains, and hurling my guts out. The whole damn nine yards. 

I've heard many good things about Gongcha since they first opened, but hadn't had a chance to try out their drinks until now. After eating at Legend Pot nearby, what better time was there? 

We had the Earl Grey w/ 3J (pudding, tapioca, grass jelly) and the Taro red bean milk tea. 
The taro was to my bf's liking; no complaints there. Except, it's definitely way too sweet unless you get it adjusted. 

The Earl Grey, however... Midway through my indulgence, I noticed an ACIDIC substance in my drink. As if I was taking 3 shots of vodka straight - but it was definitely no vodka. 
I thought I was imagining it at first, and took another sip; INSTANT PANIC. 
My throat was BURNING, chest burning, stomach queasy for an hour. Followed by throwing up my entire dinner. Oh so classy. 

HOLY CRAP. WHAT WAS IN MY DRINK?!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I've received a text message saying that \"buy one get one free\". HOWEVER, they refused to redeem it. The guy said there was a problem with the system, so I should pay extra. Is it my fault??!  Attract customers and then treat us like idiots. Interesting."}
{"text":"Delish milky foam, delish honey tea. SLOW ass service. Go for 30% sugar if you scared of diabetes."}
{"text":"Been there twice. 

Tea is average. I've ordered a milk foam oolong milk tea, not as strong as the ten-ren's, may be it the milk foam who makes it too milky..

the thing that i like is they do offer lots of special kind of tea, which is quite interesting. 

bubbles are being cooked nicely, not too soft or chewy."}
{"text":"I was hesitant when I got here because they didn't have my usual Chatime favourites but that milk foam wintermelon one is delicious. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"They have the best Milk Foam Wintermelon Tea. It's very addicting! 

I've had the same in other places like Cha Time, Cha Me. Cha, ZenQ, etc... but nothing compares. There really is something unique about their Milk Foam that differentiates them from the rest."}
{"text":"The service was fast & efficient! I came close to almost midnight, around 11:30 ish. I was just so excited to try any tea flavour that had basil seeds in it. ..that was my main goal!! So the owner then approached me for my order & handed me what was the greatest bubble tea experience of my life. He then instructed me to drink the foam as much as I can to the point where I will have a milk stain on my lip then when all is gone to mix the drink to have the full bbtea experience! It was phenomenonal!  I never in my life have I had to drink a drink the way I did & boy was it an amazing one ! I don't know why all these yelpers are complaining but all in all everything was perfect in my experience. Give it a shot & you won't be disappointed. ...you won't find anything like this in Toronto !! Guarenteed!!."}
{"text":"Really great place to hangout with friends lots of space.

Really enjoy their 1. Milk foam wintermelon with basil and their new popcorn foam milk tea."}
{"text":"Refreshing drinks and great service. Never had a complaint about anything I've ever ordered here. I love when they come out with new exciting drinks!"}
{"text":"Mostly come here for their slushie drinks. My favourite is the peach yogurt smoothie with 30% sugar. It has a light peach sour taste where the yogurt part is more like the yakult small yogurt drinks that you find at the supermarket. Super refreshing on a hot day. They also have a chocolate strawberry smoothie drink, it literally taste like ice cream! A fave of mine when I need a sugar rush."}
{"text":"First Gong Cha drink shop franchise in Canada and it's located in GTA (Scarborough)!!!

For those who don't know about Gong Cha, it's a tea shop similar to Chatime. Gong Cha was currently branched at 8 locations internationally and most all over Asia that established 2006.

They opened in July 2014 and currently doing a soft opening with many promotions where they had buy one get the second drink free yesterday. Today, they did promotions on a few of their top 10 drinks when you buy 3, you get the 4th one free. Not sure what's going to happening tomorrow or coming Friday but Grand Opening is apparently happening Thursday but I could be wrong.

I'm so lucky to live in a neighbourhood with trendy and booming food shops; I get to try them before my friends.

I ordered the Milk Foam Winter melon Tea, containing a lower layer of brewed tea covered by an upper layer of special creamer which is their signature topping (creamer tasted like there was butter) they have 7 categories (Gong Cha Signature, Brewed Tea, Health Tea, Milk Tea, Creative Mix, Yoghurt Series and Smoothie Series) plus toppings section to choose and make your concoctions. 

The ordering style and choices are similar to Chatime. Price is similar also but the question is who's better?!?! At this point, I would say Chatime but I've only tried one flavour, so I will have to try a few more drinks in different flavours to judge equally. 

Décor was clean and modern looking. Two bathrooms at the back of the side bar.

TIP: You can do the same as Chatime and customise your order. i.e.) less ice, more ice, more sweet, half sweet and etc. Not currently displayed but from what I heard, this will be shown on two additional TV monitors not being used."}
{"text":"This review compromises my first visit during grand opening (which was like a year ago), and my second recent visit.

Gong Cha is my favorite bubble tea place in Hong Kong.  I was so excited when I first heard they were launching in Canada.  I was very disappointed after my initial visit during grand opening.
- I waited over 1 hour and there was only few people waiting
- no tapioca - which was ridiculous for a place known for \"bubble tea\"
- the environment was stuffy - everyone waiting in line for their drink preferred standing outdoor because there was no air-con indoor

I ordered the Milk Foam Green Tea - it tasted nothing like the one in hong kong
- i wanted it with tapioca but they didnt have it
- i ordered 50% sweet - it was not sweet at all, it was unsweetened
- i ordered no ice - there were still few ice cubs
- the milk foam was very thin


Recently, i visited Gong Cha for a second try.  The environment was back to normal - it wasnt stuffy.  However, the place was empty.  They got my drink right this time, and I got to try their Milk Foam Green Tea WITH tapioca finally.  Tapioca was a little too soft and relatively smaller than other bubble tea places.  Though theres not much to say about my second visit.  Just a decent bubble tea place compared to other places.

I hope they get more training done and reach the standard of an official Gong Cha."}
{"text":"Fantastic.The waits a bit long, but so is any bubble tea place in the area. We got our bubble tea incredibly fast after ordering considering how many people were there. We were waiting for a friend so we ordered after she arrived and once before and both times they made our bubble tea quickly. They were also nice enough to deliver it to our table once when we were sitting even though it was pretty crowded. (incredibly nice, since we weren't waiting beside the counter.) People need to understand that the Gong Cha franchise has distinct tastes/recipes and it's not like regular BBT found in Canada. You also have to adjust the sweetness. The staff is still new since it just opened but the bubble tea still taste great. Don't think people should judge it so quickly as it will probably surely improve and it's the first to open in Ontario! I had Gong Cha in HK and I'm so grateful it's finally here. Will be heading back soon."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's a bit of a drive from where I am but that's okay, it's worth it, and a lot closer for me than the Markham location. I've been keeping my visits a minimal since the fall though. I usually order Black Milk Tea, Royal Milk Tea, or Wintermelon Tea with foam + tapioca + coconut jelly at 50% sugar(foam is a game changer for this drink). At first the Wintermelon tea was way too sweet for my taste but my cousin kept bringing it over for us and eventually I grew to like it and ordered it every time I went. I don't really ever drink the foam the way it suggest. I just make sure I get foam along with everything each sip, everything complements eachother really well.

Anyways, the line up is usually long on weekends in the evenings til closing, but it really depends on your timing, usually I'll go in, there's 1-3 people(they're usually in the same party) infront of me, not bad, then when I'm done there's a line out the door, maybe it's me they came for right? Right guys? Ha.. ha.. I love the late closing, I'm pretty lazy in the day. The staff there are extremely friendly. Don't really see many new faces when I go there. It's clean, nicely light, night decor, seatings usually full around this time as well. A lot of people hanging out with friends there. Wait times I feel have been getting shorter although as I've said, visits have been minimal since the fall. 

The best entertainment(aside from the kpop if you enjoy that) there would be seeing all the cars up front getting ticketed.

Anyways, the dairy from the drinks is good to accompany or sooth any spicy food you might've eaten up there."}
{"text":"This place has fierce competition in the area. However, it doesn't really distinguish itself from the competition. Similar to other Bubble Tea places, you can adjust the sugar content in your drinks. They have a list of their top 10 most popular drinks on their sign, helping customers make their choices easier and quicker. 

Service was prompt and our drinks were made fairly quickly. The place was clean with plenty of available seating. They also have a free WiFi too. 

Nothing to recommend or not to recommend. Drinks were fine.

{"text":"This is going to be my attempt at trying to review a BBT place which I think is hard to do and unfair to do so unless you've been to it multiple times and at different hours (at least in my opinion). Also each location offers its own unique feels based on the community and the workers.  I mean I don't think the other reviews are without value but it's hard to capture the quality of the variety and range of teas on a one time experience. The quality of service is also hard to gauge as you would expect the noise levels, claustrophobia-factor, and service engagement level to differ based on the business of the establishment. So after writing all of this, what I'm going to do is review the drinks we got and shed light into the quali-tea of service (pun intended). 

I got the strawberry green tea with Kanten Jelly (whatever that is). My partner was put on to this Milk Foam Brown Sugar Oolong tea. The reason for this is that the girl who recommended this tea said it's like melted cheese that leaves a milk mustache and it all works together. Now who in their right mind hears this and goes OMG!! I have to try this. 

Anyways let's start with MY drink. I prefer my drink less sweet and no ice to water down the flavour. Already I enjoy and find it should be a standard for any good BBT place to have the option to customize sugar/sweetness level and ice levels. The drink was really good, you can taste the tea flavour, but didn't have a strong strawberry flavour. Now the most interesting thing for me is the Kanten Jelly. It isn't very sweet (which is a plus for me), it offers a pleasant chew to just under a pop due to the solidness of the jelly, and finishes almost with a herbal sweetness if you let the jelly play on your tongue. 

The oolong tea, as my girlfriend described it tasted almost like cream cheese, but I felt like it was closer to like a salted whipped marscopone, with a whipped marshmallow fluff like texture. She enjoyed the milk mustache and the joy of drinking it 3 ways (there WERE instructions to drink and experience this thing). I tried it and I enjoy the saltiness of the foam with the bitter earthiness, and sweetness of the tea. When you mix it all up it give you that great blended taste that a good milk tea has, creamy, sweet, and with almost that hint that reminds you of grass jelly (or maybe that's just me). My partner said the most enjoyable might be sticking your straw through and getting the tea and the foam separately but without the milk mustache. 

The cashier was very nice and helped us with our vicinity cards (which is a reward program card for those that don't know). This was during non-peak hours as the establishment was mostly empty and the service was quick. 

A solid 4 stars for Gong Cha. Good quality tea although the flavour of the fruit didn't permeate the tea and was hard to detect if any. It offers a large selection of teas to try to accommodate as many palates of BBT drinkers. Decent amount of seating but I can imagine especially for the area it gets busier at night and on the weekends, which may present a noise problem.  Solid service but you be the judge when it get busy, but from my experience of this day and this location, top quality service."}
{"text":"Access
Gong Cha faces the Steeles side of the plaza but let's be honest here, just park anywhere. You are going to kill yourself if you want a good parking spot in that crammed up place.

Service
It's just slow. There were only a few customers but the servers were working like turtles. But as we all know, this place opened up recently. Perhaps they will improve with time or never lols.

Drink 
I can tell you right away if a bubble tea sucks based on how much powder I can taste. Gong Cha does not make that mistake but damn it, how much foam did they make? LOL. The drink is very refreshing and the taste is mild. I can tell they are taking a different approach from Cha Time and aims for something more subtle. I think it tastes okay but I'm not sure about sucking in foam half of the time. I understand lots of people like Gong Cha but it may not be my cup of \"tea\". You can use that rewards card on here and collect points but meh, who cares. I'm not drinking 10 bubble tea in a month. I might have to come back and try another drink before I can make my final verdict. It is definitely a contender for today's bubble tea business and will develop a fan base but for me, I'll continue to explore around."}
{"text":"I got the mango smoothie with tapioca, redbean smoothie with tapioca and greentea smoothie with red bean. 
Drinks are smooth and tapioca are soft and chewy! Similarly to chatime, you can adjust the sugar level but their regular bbt is equivalent to 70% sugar so if you say 100%, you are technically adding more then a regular bbt amount.  Other than that, interior is small, cozy and clean."}
{"text":"I think one of the best drinks here that differ from other bubble tea places include drinks from their foam series. I am also a big fan of their early grey with 3 js. With their vicinity points (reward system), you collect points to earn free drinks but occasionally there are promos like bogo!"}
{"text":"There are so many bubble tea places in the GTA now so when this place came up on groupon I figured why not give it a try. I ordered the oolong milk tea 30% sugar w grass jelly and it was awful. I could hardly taste the tea and the grass jelly was from a can!!! The grass jelly tasted of chemicals and the consistency was off. I didn't even bother to finish my drink. Are they cheaping out on their ingredients bc of groupon? There are too many good tea places (Chatime, Coco) to waste time and money coming here."}
{"text":"By far the best bubble tea I've had. I ordered the wintermelon milk tea with grass jelly and it was amazing. The gentleman who took our order was very helpful and gave us samples to try, which I thought was pretty cool. We were even given the option on how sweet we wanted our drinks. 
This place is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Most other places have been way too sweet (looking at you Chatime), but with the bubble tea here I can actually taste the tea even with 70% sugar. 
I got a lychee green tea the first time and a mango green tea with coconut jelly today and both have perfectly satisfied my craving for bubble tea. 
And what's even better, they offer a student discount when you present a valid student ID and they are part of the vicinity rewards program. This is my new place for bubble tea."}
{"text":"I saw a guy giving this place a 5 star on yelp and then a few minutes later giving it 5 stars again lol. Then I realized he was a friend of the owner of this place. The owner is a young Asian couple and I highly doubt they have their friends write rave reviews for their shop. The drinks are really mediocre and the tapioca powder they use aren't good quality ones. I know because I used to work at a smoothie/tea shop and the manager told how to distinguish between good bbtea and bad ones"}
{"text":"Best tea shop is best.
#1 (wintermelon with milk foam) is amazing. Definitely have to try it.
Open late too and the staff are very friendly. Not too busy when I went (which is a good thing)

Definitely my go to tea shop, even though it's out of the way for me."}
{"text":"This would be a great studying location during not busy hours of the day. They have cozy couches available for casual chilling and chatting with friend. Wifi is also available, and parking is free on the side of the road at 10pm. 

The baristas were super friendly and patient while my friend and I had a difficult time choosing what to pick since it was our first time here. They offered us samples of the brown sugar milk tea, it was so yummy we opted in for it right away. 

Since I do not like sugary things, I got mine at 50% sugar. My friend loves sugar but she also got it at 50%. She thought it was the perfect amount of sugar because it wasn't too sugary, while I still thought it was a bit too sweet so request the sugar percentage at own risk!

They also offer the vicinity points system that a lot of places take, it's great for racking up points. They also do vicinity card sign ups as well if you do not already have one. Even though they said they are the same company as chatime, they do not use the same points system. 

Overall awesome place! Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"My first experience with Gong Cha was their downtown location that opened up a few months ago and I really liked it.

This one is much more spacious, and I like the decor along the walls. Really gives it that antiquated chinese tea house feels. It doesn't have a trap door like the one downtown though, which I honestly think would've been a great addition given the interior design.

Well, that half of the room anyways. The other side has a TV mounted onto the wall playing popular korean music videos instead of Gong Cha ads. But the quality of the videos are quite something. Seriously, the videos were so smooth, so detailed. So much better than that youtube-quality stuff. There's also korean pop music playing in the background.

You can ask for samples of drinks. This means you might be waiting a bit longer in line, but it's a nice service. Like most (better) bubble tea places, you can customize your sugar level, ice level, and add s number of additional toppings to your drink.

I ordered the Royal Milk Tea, large at 50% sugar no ice. It comes with tapioca, but unfortunately it tasted a little too watery to me. Tapioca also didn't feel as nice chewing through. Not sure if more sugar could have improved it. I think perhaps it was lack of milk, or this is just how it is? Now I'm tempted to try another location to see if it's the same."}
{"text":"First time at this location. The lineup was pretty long on a monday evening, but just soaking in the decor and ambiance I think I waited for a good 15 minutes. Staff was nice, I ordered the winter melon foam top. It was just as good as the other location and a bit better then the gong cha in hk. Pretty comfy place to sit and chat amongst friends."}
{"text":"Tried Gong Cha for the first time in Toronto yesterday! I liked my drink which was the earl grey milk tea with red bean, grass jelly and pudding. 30% sugar, less ice. I would probably go back and have the same thing again- might get more ice this time just to taste the difference. The ambience is quite cute!"}
{"text":"OK, not as busy as chatime, felt like it took just as long. Lots of growing pains for this new business, service and cashier was below average. Cashier had trouble getting orders right and keeping up with people. They seemed adequately staffed.. just slow.

Teas were ok, nothing special. They have basil seeds if that's your thing. Just average, would repeat if I was in the area and didn't want to brave the chatime lineup"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. First time I got the wintermelon foam one at slight sweet. Considering slight sweet is the next option up from no sugar, the drink was still very very sweet. I can't imagine what 100% sweet would have tasted like. I figured maybe it was the sweet foam that made the drink so much sweeter. Came here again and got the coconut taro milk tea (hot) at slight sweet. It'a still way too sweet. I guess I'll just have to get no sugar from now on if I want to enjoy the drinks here. 

This place would not be my number one choice for bubble tea. I'd much rather Chatime or Sharetea where I know that the slight sweet actually tastes like slight sweet."}
{"text":"First saw this on Groupon ($9 for 3 drinks). Took me a couple of months to swing by. Jyst FYI: Groupon deal is for preset styles and for regular size only. Any add-ons or increase in size will cost ya.
Love their earl grey milk tea with grass jelly, pudding and foam. 

I'll be back again....
I still have 2 Groupon left."}
{"text":"Love gong cha.  I love in Mississauga and I would pass bubble republic to get gong cha now

I like their brown sugar oolong, their coffee jelly is really good"}
{"text":"Love gong cha but this location is really tainted their name. 
Tapioca here is always worst than the other location
Even their basil seeds aren't good... 

Also when they're out of Tapioca at night time.  If you 
order the 2J drinks that comes Tapioca. You're allowed to switch it out for another topping (cause I was offered at the steeles/Markham location) .  But the worker denied that and didn't let me and was going to charge me if I wanted a different topping. So they were basically scamming me out of a topping that I get charge in the number 9 brown sugar with 2Js...

But now this location is open later than the steeles and Markham so going here is a last resort for your gong cha cravings"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for bubble tea and she said that it's 10x better than Cha time so I had to go see it for myself.

The place is pretty small, but very cozy. Nice decorations, very playful and modern. It wasn't so busy when we went so service was really fast. 5 seconds after we paid, we received our drink. This is really great compare to waiting long lines at Chatime. 

She said to get #1 on the menu - foam watermelon. I really like the fact that you can add/lessen sugar on the drinks. And you get a choice of what toppings you want and how much ice you want in the drink. For someone who doesn't take sweets very well and can't take really sweet drinks, being able to customize the sweetness of my drink is really great.

I also like the fact that it has vicinity rewards just like Chatime. You get 5 rewards each drink you buy and when you reach 50, you get a free regular drink. 

The drink is really heavy because of the cream/foam...but it's so delicious. It definitely beats Cha time. And I'll be coming here from now on."}
{"text":"During non busy hours of the day, this place is extremely quiet and cosy - would be an excellent space and ambience for studying. It's a lot less notoriously known than Chatime and I personally prefer their drinks more - it has more of an authentic tea taste to me (more bitter which I like), though the prices are a bit steeper. However, their service is good and their playlist is amazing. My friend and I were there for a couple of hours today and I loved every song they played. Yes and amen. We both had the large size lychee green tea, with pearls & it was great. Very refreshing and tapiocas cooked to perfection - not rock hard, not too mushy, just chewy goodness. I prefer this location to the Markham location, it is much more spacious, and consequentially more comfortable for me."}
{"text":"I love their milk teas!! The pearl milk tea is one of the best ones. Tarp milk tea is amazing. But nothing can beat the new popcorn series."}
{"text":"I heard great things about Gong Cha and decided to drive up to get some! The line up was short on a Saturday afternoon however the tables were busy. I like how you can specify your sugars and ice. The great thing about this place is you can sample the teas! I really enjoyed the royal milk tea with pearls! Great tasting and very smooth. I would come back again to try the milk foam teas!"}
{"text":"People might feel that it's similar to chatime well it somewhat is. However the taste and quality of the bubble tea is completely different you really have to experience it in person. I urge you if you have the time ,stop by there."}
{"text":"This is my favourite milk tea!!! I love the flavour !!! It remind me of the old days at home ..."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time but it won't be my last! I liked how you can pick your level of sugar & ice in the drink. I got the matcha milk tea with tapioca and it was delicious! 
Parking isn't the best, but what can you expect with this area. Looking forward to trying more flavours!"}
{"text":"I really liked my experience at Gong Cha in Markham, so I was thrilled that Gong Cha opened at Yonge Finch area.

On my first visit with my SO, we ordered the Wintermelon milk tea with grass jelly and the regular milk tea with tapioca. We left the store after and it wasn't until we were back home to drink our bubble tea..and we realized our sugar level was switched. I originally ordered half sugar but instead got 70% and my SO had the 50%. So ok, whatever we just let it slide because we thought it could just be a honest mistake.

A few days ago, we dropped by Gong Cha again and we ordered the same drinks with the same sugar level. And as soon as we stepped outside the door, we had a sip. I thought my drink was too sweet, so I had a sip of my SO's bubble tea and realized once again, our sugar level was mixed up. We went back in and told the person who I think is the owner (not too sure) about the mix up. He  apologized for the mishap and remade our milki teas again, not only that but he was nice enough to fix our previous drinks.

I'm not sure if I'll be back here again, I feel like another mistake could happen lol. Plus, I'd much prefer Cha Time and they're everywhere these days."}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered the #1 from the top best seller. This is like the perfect dessert in a cup. I've had milk foam before from other places and I wasn't a fan because of how savoury it tastes. Gong Cha makes it on point! Adding the Ai-Yu jelly to the milk foam wintermelon was heaven"}
{"text":"Their bubble tea wasn't anything impressive. Just your basic bubble tea. We thought we would try it but there are a lot of different other bubble tea shops in the area so probably won't go back. The guy who was at the cash was rude as well- not a lot going for this place."}
{"text":"Sayonara, teashop 168, hello gong cha! Wow! That's all I can say. I've always known I was missing out (speaking as a teashop 168 kind of guy) on the full bubble tea experience but this was exactly what I've been saying a bubble tea place should be! The interior is super nice and chic and cozy with an amazing playlist. Customer service is fantastic. The first thing they did was offer us free samples, and naturally I went right for the sample. I got the oolong milk tea that tastes like a cookie with brown sugar on top. I love that you can choose sugar and ice levels and have so many options for toppings (pearls, grass jelly, coconut jelly, red bean etc!) And you don't get charged extra for half sweet (teashop 168!!!! )
Overall the drinks were incredibly yummy, service was fast and very friendly and communicative, and interior was very nice and chic. Our new go-to!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is consistently good (there have been a few hiccups for my family members but I've had great experiences all of the time). 

I always order the Lychee Oolong and what I like about Gong Cha is that when I say \"no sugar\" you can legitimately tell there is no added sugar. Comparatively at Chatime and other bubble tea spots, there's an overwhelming amount of sugar.

The servers are always pleasant. Only downside is that there's not a lot of parking but the subway is nearby."}
{"text":"Only one girl was making drinks while another was washing dishes. Naturally, it took forever for our drinks. We watched the girl make our drinks, and she actually forgot to put one of our made drinks out, so we had to ask her for it. It was busy and she was trying her best, so I don't blame her for forgetting. 

I got the Longan Honey Drink (reg ice, half sweet, large): tasted like honey water. Nothing special. Too pricey."}
{"text":"Winter melon with milk foam is best BBT I ever had. Unique taste, fresh ingredients. Get it with the kanten jelly."}
{"text":"Usually one of my favourite bbt places (particularly their wintermelon milk foam), but the service at this location is pretty bad... I forgot to add tapioca to my order today and when approaching the counter to ask to have tapioca, the server said I had to pay extra - which I was willing - but they refused to take credit card for under $2 and I didn't have cash, which left me with no options. For such a high margin item, to refuse a customer such a small request makes for a negative (and awkward) experience. Additionally, the wintermelon milk foam tasted pretty much like sugarwater even though it was 30% sugar... So, you know, make sure you don't forget to include tapioca in your order, or else you'll be stuck with a super sweet drink with no texture if you have no cash :("}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, came here on opening day over a year ago.  The service was super slow, but understandable since everybody's new.  Over a year later.... Same speed? 
It's already very quiet compared to other tea shops like chatime, presotea... Etc. 
There was one person in front of me, and a lady behind me that ordered 3 drinks. 

I ordered qq grapefruit tea. 

One drink.... 

Took 20 minutes to get out of the shop.  The lady behind me with 3 drinks got out before me.  And to make it worse, I got my drink... Looked in and saw 1/8 of it with tapioca.  No coconut jelly.  Had to bring the drink back so they could open it back up, dump some of my drink out and put some coconut jelly.  And even with the newly added coconut jelly, the toppings barely make up to 1/4 of the cup.  

I understand why it's always empty in there now."}
{"text":"Gongcha is now my favorite bbt place. Their winter melon milk foam is my all time fav. Friendly staff, great service. Toppings are about the same as the other bubble tea places (quality and variety), but their winter melon tea is by far the best I've tried! Also make sure to get their vicinity points card for extra perks!

Their seating is however somewhat limited, especially on weekends. I therefore always get take out."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bubble tea places. My brother showed to me once and been hooked since. Has a great selection, The cashier's are fast and friendly. My favourite is the their earl gray with tapioca grassy jelly and pudding absolutely sublime."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. Had high expectations after I saw a lot of my friends post this place on Facebook. That being said, this is specifically for their matcha latte, and not anything having to do with foam.

I ordered their matcha latte ($4.99 for regular, if I'm not mistaken), sans toppings. When I received it, the cup wasn't full. It was about an inch from the rim of the cup. It wasn't a large cup to begin with. My matcha latte was quite lacking in the matcha department. Upon first whiff, I didn't get any matcha scent. I got seaweed. Um...that doesn't sound promising. Upon first sip, there really wasn't much matcha taste either. It was quite floral, in fact. I had it 50% sweet, so I don't think the sugar was masking the taste of the matcha. I've never had matcha like this, and I can definitely say I didn't enjoy it. Matcha, to me, is something I get to sip on and slowly savor the taste. If I chugged matcha, it wouldn't be as pleasant because it's strong tasting. I chugged this. Yeah. Not good. I understand that matcha is expensive, but if you're charging me $4.99 and you're not filling my cup up to the brim, there had at least better be really good matcha taste. There wasn't. I doubt I'll want to come back.

Ah. Ailee and Got7 on TV, if anyone's a Kpop fan. They were playing the radio though, so visuals only. o.O"}
{"text":"The original milktea tasted pretty bland, it was lacking tea taste imo. Their grass jelly was horribly made, tasted as if i was chugging down powdery jello."}
{"text":"Visited here on May 17th for their BOGO opening day promotion. The BOGO only allowed 4 types of drinks, which happened to be their 4 best sellers.

I honestly do not remember about the price - I believe it was around $5.70, which is comparable to its competitor across the street (Cha Time).

My significant other (SO) did not like the experience first time we had Gong Cha back at the Markham location. However, since it was a BOGO, we decided to give it a try again. We ordered Milk Foam Wintermelon (#1 seller) and Winter Melon Milk Tea with grass jelly (I believe this was #3 or #4 best seller). 

Winter Melon Milk Tea w/ grass jelly:

The milk tea is nothing special. In fact, I would said Cha Time has much better flavour/grass jelly for this type of tea. What I found with the tea was that  it didn't feel particularly flavourful. I found their grass jelly to be really strong, almost medicinal flavour to it. Skip this and stick with the milk foam. 


Milk Foam Wintermelon:

Honestly, you should give this a tea try before judging Gong Cha. I believe there i a reason why this is #1 seller here and it really is different from any drinks I had at any bubble tea place. The milk foam is quiet dense. The milk foam's flavour reminds me of cream from butter beer at Universal Studio down at Orlando. Its got dense, creamy, slightly salty/sweet flavour, You are able to either 1) mix with the drink 2) drink out of the cup or 3) drink out of the straw to get different experience. I enjoyed this drink a lot - only thing is, I am not sure what wintermelon is supposed to taste like, so I am not sure if it was the cream I enjoyed or the actual flavour of the drink. 

The service, as expected due to BOGO and opening day, was not great. Even when the drink was ready, no one knew if all the drinks were ready for us. We had to look over the counter and indicate to them that the drink that was sitting on their counter for 5 min was ours. I also think they made a mistake on the sweet level for our drink. We ordered 4 drinks (two of each) and some of them tasted a lot sweeter than the other. 

I would go back here when I feel like I want the Milk Foam drinks again."}
{"text":"I have to say that Gong Cha was not an instant hit for me but my fondness  for their bubble teas has grown. I quite like their large selection of toppings, including coconut jelly, aiyu jelly, coffee jelly, tapioca, basil seeds, and of course, milk foam. Although personally not a fan of the latter myself, I know many who drive well out of their way just for Gong Cha's signature milk foam.

I like the selection of drink flavours, with my faves being earl grey milk tea, oolong milk tea, and brown sugar oolong milk tea. They have some of the best selections of wintermelon drink options among the popular bubble tea chains. Their drinks are consistent, and like Chatime, you can customize sugar level and ice quantities. However one definite advantage I find Gong Cha has over Chatime is shorter wait times at most locations and friendly wait staff. I also like that they are affiliated with the Vicinity loyalty card program, which means I only have to carry one loyalty card for at least 3 of my fave bubble tea chains. 3.75 stars."}
{"text":"UGHHHH THIS PLACE IS TOO GOOD!

I've given up bubble tea since may-june 2014, but when I heard of this place, I definitely had to try it. Now, if you didn't know about the hype, you'd be like \"....why would this be so loved?\" The sign and the interior does not look that great - nothing special, just a regular tea place. 
But I decided to try the mustache series and although it's the only thing I've tried there, it keeps me coming back! I still don't drink bbt that much, and I do not like sweet drinks but the mustache foam earl grey tea with 30% sugar is simply delightful. It's just the right amount of sweetness I need, and the foam is super .. interesting. It's a bit salty but sweet at the same time.
The cups are cute, they even give you instructions on different ways to enjoy your gong cha, and tell you the time when the tea is at it's best. 

There's nothing I've tried that's come close to it, and even though the parking lot is full of dumb shits that can't drive and super tight parking spots, I'll overlook it just because the tea is so fucking delicious."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to gong cha and I ordered the milk foam green tea (one of their top 10 favourite drinks).  The drink was so so.  This my first time trying the milk foam as well and it seems more of a gimmick to me.  

Now, I might be bias because I am a fan of chatime.  Overall, it is okay."}
{"text":"Tried Gong Cha for the first time. I ordered the Royal Milk Tea with Tapioca with 100% ice and sugar. I thought it was good and I love their brewed tea. I've always been curious how their bubble tea tastes like cause I have always been an avid Chatime fan. This location has some seating and it a nice medium size place to sit down and enjoy your bubble tea. It does get busy being in the heart of uptown Koreantown. The staff were friendly and allowed me to try some of their other toppings that they are hoping to implement which was cool. I also use my vicinity card to collect the points here. This is the case with most bubble tea places these days."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I am not crazy for bubble tea but after that one sip, I knew this place is something special. I haven't been that impressed by bubble tea before. 

I am just going to write about their standard green tea milk foam bubble tea which was what I ordered. I personally never had anything like that before (milk foam) and was genuinely surprised how much more interesting and complex the milk foam made my drink. 

I like how they have a little sticker describing the three different ways to enjoy it but somehow I didn't follow any of three (I still enjoyed it!). I also liked how they show you a screen where you can select how sweet you want it (by percentage) and how much ice you want as well. The tea was strong in flavour which I loved. The foam is incredibly rich and creamy with a salty like taste to it which adds another level of depth.

I'll definitely be back for bubble tea here!"}
{"text":"They have a vast variety of flavours and combos. I love their wintermelon milk tea! Prices are about the same as Cha Time. Will go again if I'm in the Markham area."}
{"text":"I quite like this bubble tea place. I got the coconut taro smoothie with light 30% sweet and regular ice. I can definitely taste both the taro and coconut distinctively and it wasnt overly sweet at all. It only comes in either medium or large. I got the medium for 5.30$ including tax. Staff was friendly and helpful. They have a student special for monday to friday from 12-6. When you present your student ID you will get 10% off the specific drinks. Atmosphere is quite clean and quiet. Its a great place to study. They also have a loyalty program you can register for free. If you get 50 points you get a free small drink and 60 pts you get a large drink. The workers explain the process really thoroughly."}
{"text":"The configuration of the bar and counter is not very good for flow of traffic however, the staff is very well organized and equipped to handle a large volume of customers. There is an extensive menu however it is awesome they have atop 10 popular drinks menu to help you narrow down your choice.
I like the winter melon foam green tea however, I find regular sweetness is too much. Other drinks do vary in default sweetnes though so be careful, 50% sweetness doesn't always do the trick."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good bbteas but the price is way too much compared to other places.  Averaging $0.50-$1.00 more than usual, it's a good place to stop by but nothing worth going out of your way to try.

Their regular pearl milk tea has a very nice unique taste.  Taro was also good and the red bean is some of the best I've had compared to other bbtea places.  The Milk Foam is so decilious but you really need to lower the sugar level for it!  

Service at this location is average, the staff are friendly but they are so slow! I usually go when there's no line but my drinks take around 5 minutes to make...way longer than other bbtea places.

Overall the bbtea itself is a strong 4/5 but the price and service bring this place down to a 3/5."}
{"text":"This bbt place would be perfect for me if they have Royal Milk Tea SMOOTHIE.
IMO they have the perfect consistency for their smoothies, which is not too watery."}
{"text":"I usually visit this Gong Cha when there's a Groupon available ($9 for 3 regular sized drinks). I made a quick trip here when I got an email from Groupon offering me $5 if I used up the Gong Cha Groupon this week (this might be YMMV?). 
When you open the door, your olfactory sensors are immediately flooded by the scent of strongly brewed tea (in a good way). The place was fairly clean with the exception of a table with garbage which wasn't removed. I got there around 6:30 and there was only one customer sitting at the table with a drink. 
Gong Cha is a bubble tea chain originating from Taiwan that is best known for their moustache series drinks. I ordered the oreo milk foam with earl grey tea (with 30% sugar) and it was surprisingly tasty. The oreos were small chunks instead of finely ground powder which added a nice crunch. The hint of sweetness of the foam paired well with the strong earl grey tea. Milk foams are best consumed by removing the lid and taking slow sips so you get some tea and some of the foam. 
If you're not a fan of milk foam, I highly recommend the royal milk tea with pearl."}
{"text":"Here on a Friday early afternoon with very little people in line (relatively). Yet I've waited over 20 min to order as the waiters waste time explaining to everyone what the specials are and chit chatting with random individuals. I'm still in line.

edit: after ordering, I waited for 10 min for the four baristas (not including the cashier) to make my drink. they seemed inexperienced and under coordinated, always pausing to fiddle around. with the slow ordering line, they were at most making order for one other person. It still took them so long. 

Shape up, Gong Cha. Your decor and menu oozes Chatime, from which you obviously have taken inspirations from But your slow service makes you seem like rusty amateurs. I'm used to the fast and well coordinated service next door, which has an even narrower kitchen than you. 

I'm only giving you a second star for the opening week free drink."}
{"text":"Okay my first visit at Gong Cha was a terrible experience and the manager did let me know they were pre-opening at that time so training wasn't fully complete yet.  Taking her words, I decided to go to this place again a few more times recently and I have to say, they got things right!  Their milk foam signature drink tastes so much better now and the sweetest level is accurate!  It brings back the good memories I had with Gong Cha in Hong Kong.  I also want to mention their Coffee are surprisingly good, that is now my go-to drink and if they sell out of the coffee that is when I'll drink the Milk Foam Wintermelon drink!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my boyfriend. Being an avid bubble tea drinker, I was a bit skeptical going in, but he said it was a good place. 

There was a lot of selection, and I asked the server what he recommended, and he said the Wintermelon milk tea. We were served quickly!

The drink is amazing and now I try to go here every time I can for bubble tea.

Great place, people, and bubble tea.  10/10"}
{"text":"their promotion of \"buy one get one free\" is only good for #1, 2, 9 (milk foam winter melon tea, milk foam green/ black tea, milk tea w/ pearls)
price-wise, it's the same as Chatime

I had #2 & 9; both w/ 50% sugar & less ice 

milk foam green tea
the foam was interesting; tasted like cream w/ a hint of salt 
underneath that is basically a sweeter version of Tao Ti's (??) green tea 

milk tea w/ pearls
still too sweet despite being half sugar...so it was better after the ice melted 
tea flavor is stronger than most bbt places
but at this price, I would rather get Chatime's roasted milk tea
pearls were good"}
{"text":"Deciding to meet up for a quick drink, non-alcoholic Gong Cha to my surprise is a chilled out bubble tea cafe located in Metro Square Plaza.  
Much like Coco Fresh Tea, Chatime, etc. the place is clean, presentable and busy during peak times.
For a first timer, the lovely lady recommended their Milk Foam Wintermelon.  I must say, thankfully for requesting reduced sugar it was quite sweet, yet decadent, much like a dessert :) 
Though it did not take very long for us to get our order they apologized for the delay, and even took the liberty to come around to greet patrons at their tables to ask if everything was okay, etc.  
Overall great local place to grab some tea without any headache for parking....after 8 PM preferably."}
{"text":"As if Markham needed another bubble tea house, in comes Gong Cha, which I'm told originated from Taiwan.

It is no doubt in direct competition with the hugely popular Cha Time located just up the street from Gong Cha.

In essence, it's bubble tea. I'd say 75% of the GTA has had it in one form or another by now. 

Service was a bit slow, we had to wait about 10 minutes after placing orders for our drinks to receive it.   We were told ahead of time that they were in their soft opening so thus the staff were still getting used to the process of making the drinks to Gong Cha's specifications.  

I briefly talked to one of the owners of this franchise, Ethan about this establishment. Nice, friendly fellow, he was surprised to meet a Vietnamese patron in Markham.  We both agreed that it was due time for the Vietnamese diaspora to move out from our usual enclaves of North York/Mississauga/Brampton and into Markham/Richmond Hill..  (\"Started from the bottom now we here...\" lol!)

I ordered a passion fruit slush, while my gf ordered a passion fruit green tea QQ style.  I enjoyed my slush, not too overly sweet or sour, the pearls textures were chewy and soft.  While she thought the pearls in her drink were overly chewy, but to be honest, she was never a fan of pearls in the first place and only orders them once in a blue moon.   The tea tasted great at least, that we agreed on.  The subtle green tea flavor could be tasted strongly in the aftertaste despite the passion fruit flavoring.  

Would we be back? I definitely would as I'm a strong supporter of fellow Vietnamese entrepreneurs.  And because I really dislike the lines at Cha Time and all the INCONSIDERATE, IDIOTIC DRIVERS at Cha Time up the street who don't park but clog up the already CONGESTED PARKING LOT while sending in their passengers to wait in line for their drinks!  There is NO DROP OFF POINT in that plaza so move it elsewhere damnit!!! 

*ahem* Gong Cha has made a fan of me and I will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Wintermelon milk is the best!!! I took it with 30% sugar and it was perfect! We also tried taro with red beans but the wintermelon was too good for comparison! Definitely try it when you got the chance."}
{"text":"I went to gong cha and order an earl grey tea, the little man behind the counter told me they don't have earl grey and everyone started to laugh at me. He must of felt bad because he came around and gave me a big hug and made me their house special, no charge. I was so happy and then he told me I can do anything and said I was special I feel even happier and I hug him again. He then gave me another drink to go, his pea I mean tea taste so good. I happy now"}
{"text":"Been raving about this tea place to my friends for about a week now, since the time I've first come in. 

I think the first thing I have to say was how long this line up was!!! Must've been great promotional offers and advertising to get this many people in this tiny store! 

Next thing I found was me ordering the top three drinks on their menu and obviously loving them! I get the green tea or black tea with foam - less ice and less sugar so that I can actually taste the tea.

Their recommendation on my first time was that I drink the foam first (they are most famous for their foam mustache in Taiwan) and then drink the tea right after. There's a little bit of saltiness to the foam which brings out the best flavors in the tea!

Recommending this to any one who loves bubble tea and wouldn't mind trying something different!"}
{"text":"Meh.  This was not great milk boba tea, sadly.  My expectations were higher.  Can't remember why, but did make a mental note that I need not go here again.  Much rather go across the street to Chatime for real excellent boba tea."}
{"text":"Been here three times since posting this review -- the tea seems to be pretty good, less sweet compared to Chatime.  It's just too bad the location is a bit out of the way for me - hoping they'll have a location downtown sometime soon!"}
{"text":"There are no questions that Gong Cha has delicious teas. While there are lots of bubble tea options in Scarborough, I love Gong Cha for their great service and willingness to customize my drink. I do not like the cream/milk powder stuff bubble tea places use to make their milk tea, so I always request for my milk teas to be made with fresh milk. Although not on their menu, this Gong Cha is always willing to make my green tea with fresh milk! My other love Coco on the other hand was unwilling.."}
{"text":"I like the place a lot. Actually, I can say this place has the best bubble tea in town. Most of the place, their milk tea has too much milk and sugar in it. For Gong Cha tea, you can smell the tea and and it's doesn't sweet ( for regular order compare to other place).  Their grass jelly is thicker and smoother than others. In regular, I order regular milktea with grass jelly. It's worth with $6
Their signature is foam milk tea which is unique. Foam is little bit salty but totally fit with the tea. Gong Cha second location at North York (Yonge and Finch) is coming soon."}
{"text":"Give this location another visit. Now it becomes my only place to get bubble tea. I have problem with the grass jelly before, but seem the manager fix it. The process actually faster and you dont have to wait long to get your drinks. Tidy place. Now people tend to take out more than sit in the place."}
{"text":"In Short: 
* Good teas
* Hard tapioca 

#2 Green tea with Milk Foam 
- 30% sweet, half ice
- 3 ways of drinking: 
1) sip the milk foam without straw - cream is perfect semi-solid consistency, with slightly salt taste
2) sip with straw through the cream layer and green tea - at first, thought it was not sweet enough (even for someone who doesn't like sweet), very strong tea, plain. but after mixing in the cream, it tastes better
3) mix in the cream - best option for milky green tea that's not overly sweet. So in the end, 30% is just right for someone who doesn't like overly sweet drinks. 

#9. Royal Milk Tea with Tapioca 
- 50% sweet (still a bit on the sweet side for my personal preference)
- black tea is very good flavor
- tapioca hard

#8. Oolong Milk Tea with Pudding and Grass Jelly
- 50% sweet - quite sweet and not much distinct Oolong flavor? 

#4. (?) Passionfruit QQ
- 50% sweet - just right
- great refreshing taste that's not watered down 
- I like the clear jelly but again, hard tapioca

Waited 20 mins for drinks to be made.. hopefully this will improve after the grand opening! I will be back to try other flavors! Overall satisfied with the natural tasting teas."}
{"text":"Don't expect customer service.  People who work here are rude.  There are many BBT places around here, I'll take my business elsewhere.   Will not come back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bubble tea place in Toronto. Like in a coffee shop, you walk in and are greeted by this amazing aromatic smell. They have a great selection of flavours - my personal favourite being the taro milk tea with tapioca. It is *THE* best taro milk tea I have ever had - there's a toasty flavour that reminds me of roasted marshmallows.

Staff are friendly, place is clean and I've never had trouble finding a seat, although it gets crowded on weekend nights.

PS. You can collect Vincinity points here!"}
{"text":"With good drinks and friendly service, Gong Cha won't be the Cha Time killer, but it sure provides an unique alternative. 

It's difficult for a Bubble Tea store to really make a name for itself these days. The market is saturated, the offerings are mostly the same, and it seems like a new store springs up every week. Large players like Cha Time dominate the market, and for good reasons. It doesn't mean, however, that it's impossible to compete. Gong Cha is a fine example. They offer several drinks you won't be able to find elsewhere, at least not easily. Similar to Cha Time, they have a top 10 list. Most of their unique offerings are on here. I haven't tried all 10, but from the ones I've tried, winter melon with foam is the best. 

Speaking of foam, that's what makes Gong Cha stand out a little. Most of their drinks have the option of foam. Although I can't really tell the added benefits, it does provide a talking point. 

Next up is the seating arrangements. As you know, BBT places are split between walk ins and sit ins. Gong Cha tries to be a little of both. They have a more space than Chatime, but less than Tea Shop 168. On top of that they don't serve a variety of food offerings. 

Gong Cha is priced on par with its direct competitors. 

Overall, I find myself choosing Gong Cha over other alternatives in two scenarios: 1. I'm in the mood for some unique BBT. 2. I want BBT but I also want to hang around for a brief time. If you find yourself wanting the above, you won't be disappointed at Gong Cha."}
{"text":"As far as bubble tea goes in Toronto, Gong Cha has some of the best. Keep in mind, they now have 2 locations and the original one up at Steeles Ave is way better than the location in North York. 

I've been to this location about 3 times and I've already gotten a good tea. The taste is strong and not watered down, and they don't cheap out on the toppings. 

Even when I've finished the liquid, I often have to open up the top and use a spoon to scoop up the tapioca, puffing or gras jelly."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in Willowdale for bubble tea! I will literally bus it from YorkU to here just for it, despite there being a bubble tea place on campus. Unfortunately, the line ups can get crazy long here. I remember being here for a good hour and half at one of my earlier visits. So worth it though! Especially the buy one, get one free deal! (Dat OSAP struggle, shh.)"}
{"text":"Always made to perfection, absolutely love  this place. I have been going here for the past 2 years or so since they open and they never disappoint. Come before the dinner rush as sometimes there are ridiculous line ups 10-20 mins or so. 

Nice clean and friendly atmosphere, cleanly and hygienic always, order the winter melon foam bubble tea: it's one of the most popular bubble t as here"}
{"text":"Like a lot of other bbt places, I tend to order my drink with only 50% of the sugar because they tend to be too sweet, and Gong Cha is no exception. 
I was there on Nov 20th, which was the last day of their grand opening buy one get one free special promo. I got the wintermelon milk foam and the royal milk tea with tapioca (numbers 1 and 4 on the featured menu) in regular size and the price was $4.7, which is on par with other bbt places. They also offers the Vicinity points reward where if you buy 10 drinks you can get 1 for free. Both drinks came up pretty good, the wintermelon one was regular sugar and it was definitely too sweet for me liking, though I am unsure if the wintermelon taste would be too light if the sugar content is lessened, and the royal milk tea was decent but not too special either. 
I give points to the nice interior of the tea room, it's well renovated and offers plenty of seating where you can bring a laptop (they have all outlets) or a book and enjoy your visit here."}
{"text":"Dropped by again and was pleasantly surprised to find that they've expanded their menu extensively. They're also now a part of the Vicinity program. So those are some positive updates.

I took a bit more time this time to try to appreciate my drink (lychee oolong tea) and was rather pleased by it. The tea they use is pretty legit and had a great flavour and aroma to it. The lychee flavour was nicely woven in.

I'd consider them to be a legitimate competitor now. There are still some better options out there (e.g. Coco) but I wouldn't hesitate to come to Gong Cha if I was ever close to one and needed a quick BBT fix. They are better than a lot of the chains that have existed for the longest while in the GTA, and I'd say they're pretty comparable to Chatime as well."}
{"text":"My order: milk foam green tea

Pros
- I like the savory type of bbt with salted foam and sweetened tea so it was nice that they brought a bit of Taiwan over to Canada
- B1G1 free promo going on now due to grand opening (limited to 3 flavors)
- plaza parking

Con's 
- due to the lines and the newness of the staff, you have to be very articulate. My girl messed up my order by not modifying the sweetness OR giving me the requested pearls...
- they have loooong lines (just like Chatime)"}
{"text":"I've always been secretly curious about how many calories these bubble teas pack in as my oh-so-sweet after meal treat.

No matter.  You only live once right??  This place is conveniently located next to many other lunch spots I frequent and by default, I always end up here for a little bit of bubble tea.  

In my old age, I have decided to do away with the tapioca balls in attempt to reduce calories but even with their 30% sugar, the teas are plenty sweet.  

My go to menu is their royal milk tea or a taro milk tea but today, on my sister's recommendation, I tried their wintermelon milk tea which was so good.  I find Gong Cha's bubble teas more creamy than others I've tried but that's allllllllright with me.  '

I'll probably be back to try other delectable teas for many more moons to come."}
{"text":"my favourite is their hot wintermelon with milk foam! perfect for a cold day! 

their customer service is amazing! always with a smile, very patient, and always ready to make recommendations.

i do prefer this over chatime. :)"}
{"text":"After the first time I had came here I hadn't come back after 7 months. Again, 7 months ago was when they had first opened up and they were pretty new. 7 months later I decided to give them another shot to see if anything had improved since my last visit. 

After my second visit, that's enough. No more Gong Cha. This place isn't that awesome imo. I ordered the Royal Milk tea, and personally it didn't taste any good. There was a weird after taste after drinking that kind of milk tea. It's between artificial powder or some old tea they keep on re boiling....  Whatever it is ... or however they make their tea it doesn't taste good.... 

Service is average. But I'm just not a fan of their drink nor am I  a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Honestly, they do the regular (royal) milk tea ($4.70) very well. For $0.50 I like adding the milk foam because it has a little saltiness to it and it's super thick and creamy. 

The north York location is great. It's clean and there are 2 communal big tables and many 2-person tables near the back and a nice sofa table in the front by the window. 

They're just like Chatime with an abundant items on their menu, but I think it's the milk foam that gets me coming back every time.

This location is particularly good because it's nice if you wanted to go on a coffee date and/or a small group outing. 

All in all, I like this place a lot. The milk tea is"}
{"text":"Gong Cha is another chain from Asia that has decided to migrate over to Toronto to feed the premium bubble tea masses that are demanding good quality drinks.

On the surface they are the same as their competition, with long lines and waits during peak times. Gong Cha isn't bad, but their location is better and with a bit more parking offered.

They are also vincinity enabled, so don't forget to flash your tag/card when you are there, since you get 1 point for every $1 you spend there, when basically when you get to 5 or 6 drinks you can get a free reg. size drink.

Drinkwise - I have a preference for the lychee oolong with no sugar light ice with the ai-yu jelly. Their Royal milk tea is ok, but the flavor isn't as pronounced as other places. 

Overall not too bad, but anything with the ai-yu jelly makes things taste better without any added sugar. 

One thing - they don't really allow phone in orders..."}
{"text":"Solid tea place. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I love their royal milk tea with pearls and their caramel milk tea with pudding. Both are super rich and creamy so be prepared for that. No watered down stuff here. And get 50% sweet cause their regular is SUPER sweet and overkill. Space is quiet on weekdays but weekend evenings are busy and they have limited seating so better for takeout."}
{"text":"Used to be 4 star now 2.5 because they never have ingredients for drinks I want. I haven't been in a few months and they lured me back with a buy 1 get 1 free drink. Well guess what?

No tapioca when I went at peak hour 3 pm on Sat. I love tapioca so disappointing. No lemon so no lemon iced tea. My second choice. And the freebie drink they gave with buy 1 get 1 is only a medium and no topping. Service was slow as well. 

If you want me to come back then please have ingredients I can add to my drink so I don't feel ripped off paying $5 for a large green tea I can make at h"}
{"text":"$5.20 for a Oreo earl grey milk tea. They usually have new drinks and they are usually pretty good. I've tried this location many times before and the taste is pretty consistent. Good place to grab a bbt and go. Parking in the plaza can be quite hard to find."}
{"text":"I decided to try Gong Cha Tea, because I wanted to try another bubble tea place that wasn't Chatime and see if Chatime really is the gold standard for bubble tea. Unfortunately, I still prefer Chatime after my experience here.

When I arrived at around 4pm, the place was empty aside from one table. There was also a shift change occurring, so our orders took a while to come. I tried the chocolate milk tea, as I wanted to compare the chocolate taste here with Chatime.

The first thing I noticed was that there is significantly less sugar in my drink compared to Chatime (I ordered regular sugar and ice). It is healthier in a way, but I prefer a bit more sugar in my drink. Also, the tapioca pearls are a lot smaller here compared to Chatime. I prefer my tapioca pearls to be a larger size, so Chatime wins again in that department. However, I will say the drink is quite good and definitely worth 3 stars.

With the battle of bubble teas in the GTA, I still think Chatime is superior to the others, including Gong Cha."}
{"text":"I use to be a frequent Chatime customer. I discovered Gong Cha and ... now I'm hooked! My favourite drink would be the Wintermelon milk foam or on days when I don't feel like milk foam, I just get the Wintermelon drink. It's simple yet  amazing! 

If you're looking for a drink that's really sweet and dessert like.. I would also recommend the taro slushie with tapioca and milk foam topping. I tried this a few times and it's something I would order again. If you're a milk tea lover, give the royal pearl milk tea a try. One of the best milk teas in the area! Also the brown oolong milk tea with 2J was awesome too. A flavour of milk tea with a hint of coffee jelly - The perfect combination. 

Another bonus is that Gong Cha offers Wi-Fi and is also a good place to study or catch up with a friend. Gong Cha is one of my new favourites and go to places for bubble tea!"}
{"text":"The milk foam is what differentiates gong-cha from other bubble tea spots. And the north york gong-cha location does it the best."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday as it was recommended by a cousin and I'll be back for sure! I tried the #3 Wintermelon milk tea with grass jelly (30% sugar and less ice) and it was delicious! Might be my new favourite bubble tea place when I'm in the area! BONUS: They played great rnb and rap music for the 1 hour that my friends and I were there instead of the usual asian pop songs you hear at other bubble tea places. Win!"}
{"text":"I've been to their Markham location a few times but I tried this location about 2 weeks ago with some friends. We were easily able to find a table for 7 on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too busy at the counter that day. About 25 people or so could fit at their tables or lounge areas and it's not too loud even with the pop music and conversations.

I got my usual wintermelon milk tea with tapioca and hubs got the peach green tea with jelly. We like our drinks with 30% sugar and less ice. Both drinks were consistent in taste with the other location. My other friends got the same drinks and 2 others got the taro milk tea which is also good at Gong Cha.

It's a good place to catch up with friends after a meal elsewhere in the area if you don't mind paying for parking."}
{"text":"The milk foam drinks are unique but the taste becomes a bit nulling and too sweet after drinking about half the cup. I much prefer the winter melon milk tea with grass jelly here. Fast service, great staff and average prices. Dunno why people complained about Bogo limitations when they are just trying to serve the large grand opening crowds as quickly as possible. On a normal day their service is very fast and the quality is consistent."}
{"text":"I recently tried Gong Cha and I must say... I'm pretty addicted.

Right when I walked in, I noticed their #1 best seller was the Wintermelon Tea w/ Milk Foam... to my own curiosity I asked the girl what Wintermelon tasted and she was nice enough to give me a sample. The Wintermelon was overly sweet but still good. 

I ordered the Wintermelon Fresh Milk and it was something I've never tasted! As a \"topping\" I got the milk foam and oh my goodness!!! Their milk foam is TO DIE FOR. It's very creamy, thick, rich and little bit salty. 

On a separate occasion,I ordered a Earl Tea Fresh Milk and it was nothing special. I could've made it at home and save my $5! 

Almost forgot to mention, their tapioca is overcooked!!! Extremely chewy. Not cool.

Overall, not a bad place but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The setup of this tea place is not as good as Chatime. The lines are confusing because there is one to place your order and another for pickup but it gets mixed up when there are a lot of people. The time it takes them to make the tea also takes much longer than Chatime. The tea itself tasted good but the disorganized and long wait would stop me from coming back here."}
{"text":"Excellent tea and service! 

This place is a little bit tucked away in the shopping center, but its drink selection more than makes it worth the trip. Beverages were much more interesting than those at Coco, 168, or most other tea shops I've been to in the GTA. Prices are maybe a tiny bit more expensive here, but the novelty and quality make up for it. 

We got the milk foam winter melon tea with Kenton, and the brown sugar oolong with 2J. Both were excellent, and the winter melon (#1 on their menu) was so unique. 

The guy working there was one of the best employees I've encountered in the GTA, period. He was knowledgeable and passionate about what Gong Cha has to offer, and gave us great recommendations about what to get, how much sugar/ice to add, other Gong Cha locations, and where we could find some of our favorite foods nearby. 

Overall it was a great experience, and I can't wait to make a return trip to Gong Cha!"}
{"text":"I found this place on a touch too sweet. 
I love my drinks full sweet at a lot of bbt places, but got 70% for my milk green when I visited this location. It was still on the sweet end.
Nothing too special on the menu that makes it stand out for a bbt joint.
Wifi is nice and stable and the store has plenty of seating."}
{"text":"My friends discussed about how Taiwan BBT is reshaping the BBT market in Toronto. The once mighty 168, Go for tea and Ten Ren is now losing grounds to the new entrants. The days of artificial tasting teas are finally over - at least thats what I thought after an extensive discussion with my friends. 
Well this was my first Taiwanese BBT experience; my friends had always urged me to try Chatime but the line up is always so ridiculous. So the I wanted to give Gong Cha a try first since there wasn't much of a line up and they had a banner promoting BOGO. So with high hopes, I approached the cashier and ordered an Earl grey milk tea with 3 brothers and an Oolong milk Tea with pudding. Expecting the 2nd drink to be free, the cashier told me that the BOGO promotion had expired. As a consumer felt deceived after seeing their false ad on the BOGO promo and only informing me after i had put the order in. Anyhow after getting my order which took about 10 mins (i guess this is sort of the norm for a quality drink) I took my first sip of an authentic \"Taiwanese\" bbt; the Earl Grey tasted very very artificial with the after taste of a sweetener, the grass jelly tasted like the canned ones from 168 and the bubble was so under cooked it tasted like little rubber balls. I asked for no ice but there was still ice. As for the cold Oolong milk tea it was warm and it tasted watery. Its like they used Splendid to sweeten all their drinks. Although the pudding was something different no complaints about that but it didn't make up for the overall experience.

In conclusion,
This \"taiwanese\" bbt experience had  ruined my curiosity to try Chatime. I should of sticked to my gut feeling and try out Chatime first because there is always a reason why people line up for something. I would recommend Ten Ren over Gong Cha.
I'm giving Gong Cha an extra star for the poor girl who had to explain the whole phony promotion, I don't blame her. 

After my recovery from this utterly disappointing experience, I will give Chatime a shot and hopefully it lives up to its authentic Taiwanese bbt reputation. 
As for Gong Cha I will not return."}
{"text":"We ubereats 10 drinks, and only 9 came. There were no labels whatsoever, we had no idea what each drink was since 7 of them were milk tea based with tapioca. In the end, our last drink still didn't come. Don't know why y'all be cheaping out on us with that 1 missing drink though. This is my 2nd review for gong cha and it's still getting a 1 star from me, despite the change in location."}
{"text":"If this is your first time at Gong Cha Tea, you must try #1 Wintermelon Milk Foam Tea or #2, Green Tea or Black Tea Milk Foam. Like most of the new bubble tea shops that have opened up, you can customize your order with the level of sweetness and amount of ice you'd like. This place also opens late till midnight and sometimes longer during weekends. I have never been to a bubble tea shop that offers this \"milk foam\" which is basically just that. It's a thick white foam with sweetness. You can drink it 3 ways. You can sip the foam and drink the tea without the straw, which I don't prefer because I always end up with a milk mustache, or you can drink the tea with the straw and sip the foam after, or lastly you can just mix them both and drink them together. It's up to your preference, but I personally like to mix them together. With so many bubble tea shops in the GTA, it's great that Gong Cha Tea is doing something different, it's what will keep this business going."}
{"text":"Gongcha's drinks are delicious. This is a super popular chain in South Korea. And I'm very happy to find it here near finch station.

I got the Milk Foam Green Tea (house special). The tea is nice and strong, and the creamy milk is really tasty. You can modify sweetness and ice. Service was quick and courteous, and staff all spoke great english!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for a while and have always gone to Coco as my go-to bbt spot. On a whim today I dropped in for some bbt as I always see lots of people inside. I got the peach green tea with coconut jelly and the Earl Grey tea with three jellies. I was pleasantly surprised! They offer the option to reduce sugar and ice, and also allow you tap your Vicinity card if you got one. Service was fast and friendly and the tea was great! Can't fault anything really. It has great interior decor and seating so now I understand why I always see people hanging out there!"}
{"text":"Got the milk wintermelon, #1.  I was pleasantly surprised, no bitter wintermelon aftertaste.  I like the foam layer, great addition."}
{"text":"Not too sure but the one thing about bubble tea that I always look forward too are the bubbles and the tea.

After weeks of pressure by my friends to go and try Gong Cha because they said it was better than Chatime I had to try it. Due to the distance it was always difficult for me to push myself to come so far away from home. However since my boyfriend and I were in the area I requested that we try this Gong Cha bubble tea. 

Looking at it from outside it looks really nice and clean. I love the red and black colours that grabs your attention. Surprisingly we came around 7:30PM and it was empty minus the workers. I thought this place was really busy like the Chatime Downtown. 

I walked towards the counter to see what i should order. I loved the name \"Mustache\" teas. In the end I decided to go with a regular milk tea with tapioca to compare. 

It didn't take too long before I got the bubble tea and not too long before I quickly decided that the tapioca of Chatime's is superior. I have to admit though the milk tea was really good. Unfortunately though I think the tapioca was too chewy and would have preferred it more soft. The tapioca at Chatime I think they soak in some sort of sugar or honey which makes their tapioca tastier and obviously more sweeter. Personally I like the idea of soaking the tapioca in sugar or honey to bring out the taste. (I know that TenRens also soaks it in some sort of corn syrup.) 

But! Don't let this one review deter you from going and trying the bubble tea. I've only tried the one and it could have been an off day? I will definitely come back though to try their Wintermelon tea which seems to be their #1 drink. Maybe after that I'll be able to see if they really are better than Chatime. As of right now Chatime is the current champ and holder of the best bubble tea in the GTA.

Here you are only allowed to order between #1-4 in order to get a choice of #1-4 only! Wtf? Why offer a promo when it just leaves a bad taste in new customers mouth! 

Oh not only that their vincity card apparently doesn't work, so saw some lady steal a card over the counter and the cashier didn't even know! 

Crazy lines for a shitty promo! Let see how this place will compete with all the other tea shops, esp when MABU offers BOGO Takeout all day!"}
{"text":"Some of my friend love it some of my friend don't. I'm not a real fan of milk tea so I can't really tell if Gong Cha is the best among all, but the store's interior design and the services they provide would definitely count for higher ratings."}
{"text":"The tea is just okay; I find it is really lack of tea flavours. In additional, the price is higher than other bbt place. Most likely I will not go back."}
{"text":"Gong Cha is amazing!! Having tried multiple bubble tea places in my lifetime, Gong Cha is as good as it gets. 

Came here on a Friday evening and it was not really that busy. I think the weather deterred people from coming that day. I was immediately greeted by the friendly staff working behind the counter. Since it was my first time here, I asked for the most popular drink and was suggested to get the winter melon milk foam tea. I even got a free sample to try it before I made my purchase which was a really nice gesture. 

The tea was brewed fresh and tasted amazing. So sweet and refreshing. And the milk foam was creamy and so delicious. It was like drinking a dessert. 

The tapioca here was sweet and still slightly warm - a perfect harmony in a nice cool drink. It was slightly malleable, yet still firm. They know how to make their tapioca right!

I hope more Gong Cha's open up around the city - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My new favourite bbt store in Toronto. milk foam wintermelon is a must! earl grey milk tea tastes exactly like the one I had from my last visit in Hong Kong which is a plus!!!!, great location! Love the fact that the first one opened in canada happens to be in toronto. Now i dont have to keep craving it for years until i visit HK again. If you havent tried Gong Cha, try it. :) Brought so many drinks home for my family and they loved it. Tastes better than all the other basic hyped up bbt stores in toronto. Will come here more often every chance i get! If youre boring and like basic bubble tea.. then i suggest you try gong cha for a change :) haha! im telling you especially the wintermelon foam mmmm.. the foam has such a unique delicious taste to it im probably gonna dream of it in my sleep. Highly highly recommended if you haven't tried! Evenings are super busy! Been so busy with work and everything but couldnt help but leave a bit of review for my experiences here.. Gong cha..to die for"}
{"text":"It's nice that Chatime has a bit of competition now. However my taste buds still prefer Chatime over Gong Cha. 
I haven't been able to find a nice combination of sweetness to fully enjoy it. It has either been way too sweet, or way too bitter for my liking. whereas, i know that i can go to Chatime and order a grass jelly roasted milk to with no sugar and it tastes perfect.
otherwise its a pretty good establishment. maybe with the right drink i can be converted over."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this place this week that must mean I'm addicted lol. First time I had roasted oolong with pudding and it was amazing my girlfriend had one of the milk foam ones and it was also amazing. Right now I'm sipping on a milk foam roasted oolong and once again amazing :) we've found our new fav bbt place thanks Gong Cha"}
{"text":"Love love love this bubble tea place ! They have many drink and topping options to choose from.

 If you are feeling adventurous and silly try the moustache series and if you are like me who likes things original try their royal milk tea or the brown sugar oolong milk tea ! Oh and definitely get the coffee jelly as a topping , it's so good !!"}
{"text":"We actually just stumbled upon GongCha while driving by, and saw that Chatime line-up was crazy. It was packed inside, as can be expected on a Saturday night. But I see that they have some cozy sofas and communal tables for people planning to sit in. As soon as we ordered, a huge crowd walked in; it's safe to say they're gaining popularity as well. 
I'd tried GongCha in Asia and remembered liking their grass jelly topping, but with new places I always like asking for their recommendations. Now this is where I would give their service a 5-star as the girl behind the counter was friendly and informative. She took her time recommending us drinks, and even offered samples. I was so used to the brusque, or let's call it efficient services of bubbletea places that I was quite taken aback by this. Nevertheless, very much appreciated. 
Taste-wise, it kind of fell short of expectations since my drink came out too sweet even though I opted for 30% sugar. It was the brown sugar oolong milk tea that came with tapioca and coffee jelly. I have quite a sensitivity to sugar so it may be just right for some people. Coffee jelly was also meh but I think I'll have to go back again to find the right customization and flavour."}
{"text":"If only they had more locations, I only go here when I'm in the area. I really enjoy their original milk tea, that's my go-to when I go there. I also tried their mango slush with pudding but I wasn't too big of a fan."}
{"text":"Decent drink and service. One thing I like is the amount of toppings they serve. They actually scoop a generous amount of pudding and boba in my drink."}
{"text":"Been here twice, it's a good place and I like the taro coconut bubble tea- it has a unique flavour. However I feel the toppings aren't as good as chatime."}
{"text":"5 STAR! 5 STAR!  5 STAR!!!!!! 

heck I am BLOWN AWAY by their service and drink quality here!  I called them at 11:45pm last night (15 Mins prior to closing) to ask them if I could do a quick last minute pick up.  The lady On the other end of the line,  was not only kind enough to take our order at the end of her shift,  but patient enough to recommend drinks as it was my first time trying no gong cha.  She even let us know she will be there until 12:15am so we don't have to rush there.  

I asked Michelle what she recommends a few time and she kept insisting we try the winter Melon foam tea. Damn.  I think I'm hooked. ."}
{"text":"It is hard not to compare Gong Cha Tea to Chatime just up the street.

Came by on a weekday afternoon when it was not busy. There were just a couple of people in front of me. So I placed my order and wait for my number to be called. It did take a long time for everyone to get their drinks. I waited and waited and waited and no one was even calling any numbers and just let our orders piled up behind the counter.... 

How's the drink? I ordered something similar as Chatime: Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly. There were hardly any grass jelly, the tea was not as smooth and hardly any tea taste.... FAIL

Slow and Unorganized with So So products, I doubt I would be back!"}
{"text":"Milk foam green tea is always my favourite. The milky foam tastes a little salty but good! They have a great selection of milk tea/ bubble tea"}
{"text":"Better than chatime by a mile very pleasant refreshing bobba and lots of yummy booba options. I recommend taro milk tea with jelly"}
{"text":"I came here again and tried their #1 popular item the wintermelon foam milk tea, and it is really something unique and interesting. It is apparently very sweet naturally, so I would suggest asking for no sugar unless you are really into that sweet stuff. I can't really say it tasted like wintermelon... but it was unique in that it was really sweet and then had a slightly salty aftertaste to it, but was still quite good! Honestly I think I would make a trip to Gong Cha just for this drink, so it's definitely won me over - I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Seems all watered down.. I gave it 2 tries and I am really disappointed. Nothing like the ones I had in HK."}
{"text":"Came here while my sister had her massage.  I had the apple green tea.  Nothing special but I do enjoy that I get to choose how sweet I want the drink to be.  also they sell tarp chips that are pretty pricey and the portions are small."}
{"text":"Their bogo opening special is only good for #1,2 and 9.

This place is similar to chatime.  sadly also similar because they take forever to make a drink.  

line ups are crazy.. but not to pay ... you will find the whole store is filled with people waiting for drinks..  this is just like the chatime at warden north of steeles.

prepare to wait 10-15 minutes for a drink. (if your lucky)  THey also have a point system just like chatime.  

drink is similar to chatime.. grass jelly is super soft and house made just like chatime as well.. but i think chatime taste better because its slightly sweet.  the wintermelon drink is overly sweet and they are not able to put less sugar as they claim it is naturally sweet.  

its not bad with the bogo.. but without the bogo i would go for chatime... 
btw same prices as chatime"}
{"text":"I like this place.  It has a classy, elegant feel to the decor that is warm and inviting.  The space isn't cramped like many other establishments in the neighbourhood.   The night i went to Gong Cha, there was no air conditioning, so they kept the door open.  Thankfully the evening was cool, allowing for a pleasant time relaxing with my friends.  
The menu has pretty decent selections of drinks, ranging from milk foam flavor teas and coffee to smoothie.  I ordered a regular sized passion fruit green tea, with QQ jelly for $4.7.  At 30% sugar the tea was still fairly sweet.  
The associates were pretty fast with completing orders.  They were polite, but i couldn't help but feel that they were a bit stressed out by the constant flow of in coming customers.  But good job for working hard at fulfilling orders."}
{"text":"2 stars. Tried out this new tea house looking for variety. Major disappointment. The drinks we ordered were just mediocre nothing special. Don't really see what the hype is all about. The tapioca balls were too cooked it was mushy and stuck to my teeth. The grass jelly was not that great either. The only thing that was good was the foam. The actual drink wasn't that good. Asked for regular sugar the cashier punched in 70% sugar so my drink wasn't as sweet as I would have like it. Service was ok. Not as friendly as other places. Won't be coming back as there are literally hundreds more tea place to the left and right of gong Cha."}
