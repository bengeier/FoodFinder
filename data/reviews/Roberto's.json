{"text":"Definitely the best chip shop in Airdrie! There's pretty much always a queue out the door here at dinner time but don't let put you off as the queue is there for a reason and that reason is it's worth queuing for! They take your order as soon as your in the door so if you're just after a bag of chips you won't have to wait for ages while everyone in front of you gets a special fish supper. Of course it's not especially healthy food they do here but for dinner once in a while it's great. The food here is consistently good unlike other local chippies that can be lovely one day then sell you overcooked brown chips the next. The staff are always lovely and friendly and the prices are decent. They're closed on Sundays and Mondays so unfortunately if you've got a craving for chips on those days you'll have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best gelato in Montreal. I reserve a cake whenever I get a chance ie birthdays/events. Yummy!! My fav flavours: cantaloupe, coconut, toblerone, and many more!!! Go!"}
{"text":"Apparently best ice cream in town. I was told worth the detour."}
{"text":"I come from the U.S.A & have eaten at many Fish & Chip shops over my many visits to Scotland. This one is by far the best I have ever had. I just keep coming back. The fish is always fresh and the batter is perfect. The chips are great as well. I whole heartedly recommend this establishment. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for a conference and i was amazed by the food so we decided to come back to try their usual menu. I took the gigi and it was AMAZING. The pasta were chewy and not overcooked and the sauce was delicious. The service is great also and the best part is their gelato shop downstairs so make sure u save room for desserts (or just use your second stomach)"}
{"text":"Roberto must've taken all he learned since his days working with his dad at Tony's in Shawhead and put it to good use here. This is the best chippie in Airdrie and Coatbridge, by far. I've since moved to the US and this is always one of my first stops when I visit home. Fish is always cooked fresh and the flavour is just how it's supposed to be. 

I've never been disappointed, nor has anyone I've brought here for a good old fashioned fish supper.

Well done Roberto, keep it up!"}
{"text":"We came from Canada to check out my wife's heritage. Had read the great reviews of Roberto's. They were absolutely correct. This place has the best fish & chips my wife & I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Small wonder they were as busy as they were. We were in Airdrie for 5 days in 2015 and ate fish & chips from here twice. Have had good Fish & Chips on Vancouver Island Canada, but the food and the lovely staff here were so much better. Other customers were wonderful & friendly also. Wish it wasn't such a long trip as I get a craving :-)) 
This is a take away only, but we sat on the steps and ate."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch with a future colleague. This is a family run Italian restaurant in the heart of what appears to be mostly residential?!

In house prepared el-dente with a delicious house made white cream sauce. Finished the meal with a awesome Cappuccino. I'd go here again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Roberto's since I was a child.  It used to have the best ice cream in Montreal and it was one of the few ice cream stores that served Italian-style gelato.  That being said it kind of feels like Roberto's has been frozen in time since the 90s and it has long been surpassed by the competition.  The shop still looks like it did back in the day and the same goes for the menus.  The ice cream is okay but I feel like there are better ones out there.  It is reasonably priced though so if you're nearby it can be worth the visit, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"*À propos du bar laitier du rez-de-chaussée*

Toujours une bonne idée pour clore une soirée, puisqu'ils sont ouverts jusqu'à 23h ou minuit. C'est un endroit bondé, familial et bruyant, mais le service est attentif. Je ne me suis jamais sentie pressée de quitter par les serveurs et d'ailleurs, les sièges sont confortables alors on a envie de s'y attarder (raisonnablement)!

Les desserts alcoolisés le sont beaucoup: vous en aurez pour votre argent et vous sentirez très, très détendus après avoir terminé votre coupe à l'amaretto :)

Autrement, les gâteaux au fromage sont très bien, selon moi. 

J'aime moins les écrans de télévision qui diffusent des matchs sportifs, parce que c'est moins le genre d'ambiance que je recherche, mais je comprends que c'est très populaire."}
{"text":"Tried the cannoli from this place during Christmas time and they were to die for. Still dreaming of them from time to time."}
{"text":"Restaurant assez moyen dans l'ensemble qui ne reflète pas vraiment l'idée du restaurant Italien que j'ai en tête. Plats trop peu variés et pizza trop fade à mon goût. Les aliments ne sont pas tous frais et ne sont pas assez travaillés pour la gastronomie Italienne que l'ont connaît. J'ai tout de même apprécié le service ainsi que leur glaces qui, pour moi, sauve un peu les meubles dans ma note car très très bonnes et faites maison. Pour le prix, tout reste raisonnable même si j'ai trouvé le rapport/qualité/prix pas du tout en adéquation. A re-tester quand même pour en avoir le cur net."}
