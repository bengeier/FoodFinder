{"text":"I usually get the hibachi chicken and steak. It's really good and affordable. The lady at the register is always nice. I've eaten in like twice and called in for carry out 5+. No complaints with either experience."}
{"text":"The best Japanese food in Charlotte. I love it. Try the Shrimp and Snapper. It's great. Also the atmosphere is great and its family owned."}
{"text":"Had the Salmon And Steak Combination, salmon tasted like it was straight out of the freezer and the steak was dry and over cooked."}
{"text":"I was looking for a different place to eat and I found Hanaya Gardens. It is right off of university city Blvd so it's not far away from campus. I got the teriyaki chicken, it came with fried rice along with broccoli, diced carrots and zucchini all for only $7:50. If you are looking for a place that is cheap and tasty be sure to check out Hanaya Gardens."}
{"text":"Great Hibachi express place, fresh food cooked to order in front of you. Found this place this weekend, great find. Great food at a great price. Also have good sweet carrots. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Today I picked up Gyoza and Teriyaki salmon. The Gyoza was generously fried, making for a tasty crunch and the sauce was the fish was amazing. The carrots were a little too sweet and the rice was a little bland. All and all I had a good meal"}
{"text":"I gave a three not just for the food but great place to eat. Calm and quite. Not many ppl. Strangely the wooden seating are comfortable enough. Not a lot of choices as regards to type of food but it's good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hibachi in the university area. Cooked fresh right when you order. Sweet carrots are also on point. Home made shrimp sauce is also amazing. Good people and good food."}
{"text":"This is the best hibachi express type place I have found in Charlotte. The lady that owns it is super friendly and makes you feel very welcome.  The food is very good too, especially the hibachi.  Oh yeah and after you eat be sure to stop by the jewelry counter on your way out."}
{"text":"We went to Hanaya Garden today for lunch.  You walk in (past the jewelry, sword, and lucky bamboo sale displays?), order at the counter, and then pick up your entrees once their done.    We tried the teriyaki chicken and hibachi shrimp.  Both were made to order, flavorful, came with rice and veggies, and included a side of shrimp sauce for dipping.  Although the entrees were $5.95 and $7.95 respectively, their drinks were cheap ($1.25 with refills) and you don't have to leave a tip because it's self-serve once you order and pick-up your meal.    We sat by the makeshift waterfall (I guess that's where the \"garden\" comes in), watched a little of the news on their big screen TV, and wondered whether anyone ever bought any jewelry, swords, or lucky bamboo.  You wouldn't know that it's a retail shop, too, until you walk in; there's nothing outside advertising it.    Sure, it's not high-class Japanese food, but it was fresh made and was enjoyable for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Best hibachi near by everything is fresh and the shrimp sauce is amazinnggg! Tried hibachi chicken /shrimp and teriyaki chicken everything is really good looks like a store when you first walk in but give it a try it's amazinng! And prices a very reasonable"}
{"text":"I came here with my Grandma who lives in the University area because sadly there is no \"express\" Japanese places in South Charlotte. Having went to college with excellent Japanese I was very sad that I was unable to locate any near my house.   When my Grandma suggested we go here I was more than willing to give this place a try and I am so glad that I did! Although for a restaurant the setup is a little odd with the \"store\" on the side, we were able to walk up to the counter an order right away. With 3 of us, 3 lunches and 1 drink came out to around $20. That cannot be beat anywhere.   The food came out piping hot around 5 minutes later and was delish! The only thing I wish I had was more shrimp sauce, but the food was wonderful and when I go to visit Grandma I will suggest we go here."}
{"text":"Wow! I did not expect to be this satisfied. The decoration at first and outside appearance had me questioning whether to eat here.  Well I was wrong. Excellent Hibachi steak and chicken dish. The steak was seasoned quite well. The veggies and rice were great and I enjoyed eating inside.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and they have wifi as well.   Winwinwinwin. I really enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"Honestly, food is fresh, fast and it tastes great!  You can wait and watch the food be prepared. All ingredients are handled with care. Just be careful, they call Talapia, Snapper here :/ and they use spread or margerine to prepare the food. This was a little alarming because when I asked what type of oil do they use, the cashier said butter.  Big Difference! Just so happened as I was watching the chef ran out and I saw him go for a pound of spread. Overall, the meal was expected. So glad to know more about their ingredients... this way I can gauge my intake."}
{"text":"Cheap hibachi place that won't disappoint. They have a small menu with hibachi chicken, shrimp, steak and and 4ish more options. You order at the front and then they call you when your food is ready, so no waiter."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. It took a hour to get food and people with to go orders that had gotten here after me got their food 15 minutes before I did. I wouldn't recommend coming here at all."}
{"text":"When it comes to my hibachi, I am pretty picky. Ive gone to places that serve meat that tastes fake (if that makes sense) and other places that have made me feel sick. BUT NOT HANAYAS. I went during regular dinner hours and my food was made fresh. I ordered the hibachi steak and the steak was really good! Customer service was pretty good, not overly amazing, but not bad whatsoever! Overall I think ive found my hibachi place for this area!"}
{"text":"First time and not the last eating here. So good and very fresh, made to order. No MSG! I ordered for takeout and I swear, right after I finished...not only was I full but I wanted more. It's good until the last bite! Worth checking out if you like Hibachi."}
{"text":"We walked in for take out. The person who took our order got it wrong, left out a meal. We waited 20 min for our first order, then, without eye contact, apology, or accountability for the mistake, she rang up the rest of the order, and placed the order at the back of the line (didn't even expedite it). By the time the order came up, our food was cold. Nevertheless, the worst part was the nonchalant attitude, no eye contact, no apology. I'm not remarking on the food, as this, alone put a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is a quick eat in hibachi or grab and go type of place.  The food was good, but it definitely has a different ambiance in there.  Yes, there is a jewelry counter inside!  I didn't look at the jewelry, but it honestly weirded me out a bit that it even existed.  Not something you see everyday in a restaurant, that is for sure!  We both had the basic hibachi chicken with vegetables.  It was good, and the portion size was also acceptable.  The crowd is mixed because of adjacency to the college and people looking for a cheap bite to eat.  It was ok but I won't go out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 5 stars because it's my go to when I'm craving hibachi, but want it fast and for cheap. However, the girl that just took my order was incredibly rude! The people there are usually super nice, so hopefully that was just a one time occurrence. Anyway, like I said, the food is delicious and cheap - under $10 cheap. They give you large portions also, I always get the teriyaki chicken and usually get 2 meals out of it unless I'm starving. The miso soup is so good. Make sure to ask for extra shrimp sauce!!"}
{"text":"Want simple, tasty hibachi? This place is a great place to go. They've got hibachi steak, chicken, scallop, shrimp...etc. They also have fried rice, kabobs, etc. I don't remember everything because they have a pretty good-sized menu.  Might I add, I do know the owner and the family, and they are a GREAT bunch. :) Some of the jewelry on the side is handmade by the owner-wife. This place also has free wi-fi, but there's no sign advertising it, so nobody knows about it. But it's great for college students to go and grab a bite while studying!"}
{"text":"Good spot for japanese in the area. I eat here 1-2 times a week and have never been disappointed. Very affordable and good service"}
{"text":"As far as Japanese takeout, this place is about as good as it gets. I tried it last week when I was in the area and pleasantly surprised. The food tastes very authentic in my opinion. Service was probably slightly slower than it normally would be because I went right after they opened.  It's rare is find a decent Japanese takeout place with good prices. This place is spot on."}
{"text":"Good for Cheap food. Would I return maybe as a last resort. Found Tendons in my chicken. and Miso soup was incredibly watered down. Could find better Japanese in the area. Service was nice, but they seemed very out of it."}
{"text":"Simple but clean Hibachi restaurant. Good for fast and take away meal. Served in a large plate at eally good prices. Well cooked rice and meat, the carrots taste really good but bit too sweet. Like the environment and the chairs but dunno why there's a jewelry stand inside. And all the containers and foxes are disposable no matter you eat at the restaurant or take away."}
{"text":"Hands down the most flavorful Japanese food I've found in charlotte. The same guy always makes my steak. Fresh delicious food friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a hibachi takeout for a while and I came across this one. I honestly was disappointed my food had no flavor if it wasn't for the shrimp sauce I wouldn't have been able to eat it all.   The customer service was decent but I would not return or recommend this restaurant.  I do like the fact that they do not use MSGs in their food."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times for a quick and semi healthy dinner when I'm near campus. I always get the hibachi chicken. Which is just okay.   Pros: They always give a good portion  It's always hot and made to order The price isn't bad, though it's not great either The chicken is tender  Cons: The sauces are lackluster and watery but necessary because... The food is grossly underseasoned The wait times are longer than most because of the amount of take out orders  They have only one cook to fulfill hibachi orders The decor is hideous, dated and dusty.  The rice isn't really fried on the cooktop with your order and maybe not at all because the texture is off though less noticeable when you add the sauce  I think that Hanaya has potential. They just need to make some tweaks to improve the food and interior. Good in a pinch but not a destination."}
{"text":"Wow when we first walked in my family of four we kind of weren't sure even though It had stars because it was a jewelry counter to the left when you walk in then we got our food and it was delicious spiced great hot with the steak and shrimp and scallops and everything was very good. it definitely deserve 5 stars"}
{"text":"love this place, i get the shrimp hibachi with vegetables and the sweet carrots are the best"}
