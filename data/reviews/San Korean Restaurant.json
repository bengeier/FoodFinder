{"text":"I am crushed San has closed it's doors.  This was THE place for me to get  a GREAT meal at a great price with great service, fast, friendly, and sooooo good.  Wah."}
{"text":"Great food.. We seem to go there for all the Bday parties before going out.. The food is great and is made in small batches that is why it taste so good.. 

If you like Korean food.. This is a great place.."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful in every respect. Indeed, Erin H's view notwithstanding, they even seem to have improved the music selection. 

The food was superb, the service was helpful, wonderful, and nice, and the atmosphere was just about what you'd hope for. 

I guess the special bonus is that SAN Korean Restaurant provided a nice alternative to Czehoski Restaurant (next-door), which fell so short of expectations. Indeed, perhaps the real beauty of Czehoski's is that seeking it out brought me right past SAN Korean -- a true diamond-in-the-rough that I would have never discovered otherwise."}
{"text":"I have always avoided Korean food for the simple reason that the idea of a fried egg on top of any random plate of stir-fry repulses me.  But I was informed that no one forces you to take the egg and it is not part of every dish.

I finally decided to take the dive into Korean food by easing myself into it and choosing San over any of the hardcore joints around Bloor and Christie.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal of brown rice, tofu, vegetables, and Kimchi (fermented vegetables like pickles that are used as condiments).  The food was fresh, healthy, and the environment was quiet and comfortable much like a small sushi joint.  The only problem with the place was in its strange choice of music; truly, even those who enjoy the fake angst of Nickelback feel it has its time and place.

By the way, I tried the egg after all...It made the dish!"}
