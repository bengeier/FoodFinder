{"text":"I had the affogato.   It supremely blended the delicious creamy flavour of the custard with the rank taste of espresso to make overall a perfectly adequate experience."}
{"text":"I'm only here in Toronto for a week. But I can say this: what a fine, fine place this cafe is. My wife and I had pear and walnut quiches that struck gold. Plus, I had a cappuccino that trumped the others I've had in the city so far.  But I stayed on to get some work done. They were incredibly accommodating. Not only did they refill my coffee (my next beverage of the morning); it was the owner Jedd's birthday, and he came by to give me a waffle piled with tons of fresh fruit, just out of kindness.  Anyhow, this will be definitely be my home away from home now."}
{"text":"Wow chocolate custard is amazing. Ok coffee is very good too, and the place is very cousy as well. But, if you are walking past this place now, STOP!, walk in, and order chocolate custard. Warning! you might order another one, yes it is that good. I am definitely going to go there again."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen I am proud to announce that Jedd is making a coming back. I repeat Jedd is making a come back. I had the privilege of talking to him today at the front street food festival and he assured me he's be back in 2016. Seems like a long time to wait but if you're a frozen custard lover like myself it's a drop in the sweet treat bucket. He'll be operating out of union station hopefully by Spring 2016. Hopefully between now and then you're able to catch him at other street fairs around the city. His custard is as sweet as it is smooth. I await his return with eager anticipation."}
{"text":"Wasn't that great. Coffee was sub-par. Overpriced too. We had a desert cake...and it was over-priced too. Better off going to a trendier place."}
{"text":"This place is ok, really a 2.5, but to call it a patisserie is just misleading, especially when there are two actual patisseries within a stones throw. If you like good old fashioned North American desserts - pies and crumbles and whatnot, then this is the place for you. But don't expect no pattiesserie. Oh, and FYI, frozen custard is just ice cream, plain old (and in my biased gelato opinion - BLAND) North American ice cream."}
{"text":"A shot of espresso over a scoop of frozen custard = heavenly!!! It was so good I had double up!  Note of caution: super addictive!!!"}
{"text":"They only have vanilla and chocolate frozen custard available when we stopped by. The vanilla was pretty good but the chocolate tastes like ice cream from the supermarket. Both felt more creamy than regular ice cream.   Nice decor, friendly service, but at almost 4 bucks a scoop the price is a little steep.  We may come back and try it again when they have more flavours."}
{"text":"Must try.....banana cream pie, Quiche, raspberry cheese cake and rooibos provence tea....i love the staff and the owner \"JEDD\" is absolutely delightful!!! love going there after dinner!!  I went to Jedd's for lunch today and found out they do serve sandwiches and soups, had no idea!! I thought they only serve desserts, really need menu somewhere in the cafe! I noticed two couples leaving looking for light lunch!!"}
{"text":"Jedd's Frozen Custard is a great place to grab some coffee, enjoy a light meal or indulge in sweet treats, and of course, savouring their frozen custard.   Despite their really ugly name, this place is pretty classy looking, narrow, clean and comfortable. The staff is super friendly and helpful too.  The frozen custard comes in three flavours: chocolate, vanilla and one other flavour that changes each day. When I was there, the other flavour was strawberry, which I tried. The frozen custard was really rich; the texture was creamy and smooth. I like the frozen custard a lot, but if you're watching your diet, you may want to pass up on this because it contains lots of milk fat and egg yolk. For one small scoop, I paid over $3.  They're other dessert options too such as cookies, cakes, pies, tarts, biscotti's, brownies, macaroons etc. Most of these desserts are really pricey though. For example, a small piece of cake is $5-$6. Personally, I love their gigantic cookies ($1.95), their crunchy from the outside and chewy on the inside.   What I enjoy most of all here is the coffee beverages. I especially love their latte- strong coffee with creamy steamed organic milk, just perfect! The staff told me that the milk used at Jedd's is organic. Now I can enjoy my coffee beverages even more knowing I'm not sipping in hormone-pumped milk into my system.   Besides coffee and desserts, you can also get some fresh yummy salads and sandwiches.  Overall, Jedd's Frozen Custard is a great place to indulge in some great beverages and treats while sitting under pretty crystal chandeliers. Do expect the desserts to be on the pricey side though."}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews for Jedd's, I was excited to finally try it after having it on my \"must visit\" places for a while.  However, I was really disappointed. Service was slow and for some weird reason the person at the cash made a sarcastic remark about how \"that's all we're ordering\" (there were two of us, each person ordered a frozen custard). I thought that was uncalled for.  Portions for the frozen custard is tiny and not worth the price at all. I found Jedd's to be overpriced for what you get. The custard itself was nothing amazing. I've had frozen custard before (not in Toronto) so was wholly disappointed. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"LOVE.  Affogato is phenomenal and quite addictive.  Anything else with their frozen custard is great.  It's like the creamiest, purest ice cream you've ever had.  It's not shipped in--I saw them make it fresh right in front of me.  There are always 3 flavours: vanilla, chocolate, and daily feature.  They offer samples if you can't decide.  Their staple chicken vegetable soup is available most days and is truly fantastic (and healthy).  It is a meal in itself.  It's a nice homemade slightly-spiced broth overflowing with lean tender chicken and garden veggies.  No noodles, for all you carb-a-phobes!  I was hesitant to pay $6 for a bowl of soup, but I'm so glad I did.  The hot espresso drinks are a bit bitter and overpriced (vs. Aroma up the street) --that's my only complaint.  But espresso with the affogato is just fine!  Service is consistently good.  Every staff member has been lovely and they don't mind if you crack out your laptop and hang out.  It's a really chill environment and they obviously put a lot into their marble & wood interior.  I've met THE Jedd and he's really nice, too!!  Really hope this place does well.  P.S. Open one downtown, please :D"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my girlfriend on a Friday night after dinner to try some of their famous frozen custard. We tried both the chocolate and vanilla and we really liked them. Its like really creamy ice cream.  The place was cozy and the guy behind the counter was really friendly too. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Jedd serves up an smooth delectable  tasty frozen custard.   It's not ice cream -- I know as I've been to several Andersen's Custards in the US.  The single vanilla scoop I ordered at Jedd's was served in a ceramic cup which is a lot different from Andersen's where they dispense using a soft serve machine.   I decided to spoil myself and add a slice of cinnamon apple pie to the order to create a pie a la mode. Jedd's frozen custard + cinnamon apple pie = match made in heaven. :D  Jedd's frozen custard has a super smooth texture and unique taste. Personally I liked Jedd's custard better than Andersen's custard in the US. Tasted a stronger custard (egg) and real vanilla flavour in the scoop I had."}
{"text":"I have so far tried both the vanilla and chocolate affogato and I love it every time.  The food looks amazing so I really should try it but every time I go in there I find myself drawn to the affogato! They make the custard fresh all the time so it is always fantastic.  I really can't recommended it enough, I take everyone there."}
{"text":"Really liked the Custards and Cranberry Tea , but its Chessecake was a little sweet for my taste. But I recommend."}
{"text":"The quiches are always delicious and are one of the things I always come back for. The service is great, they're always friendly and helpful.   I suggest the quiches, the lemonade, the affogato and, of course, the frozen custard! Delish!"}
{"text":"first time trying this place. dunno if a peach tart is worth $5.75!!?? went on a sunday night - perhaps not the best time to visit a bakery. we got the eclair ($4.75) ,peach tart ($5.75) and coffee - eclair was dry and stale, they could've at least warmed it as a courtesy, but they didn't. peach tart was also cold, but better than the eclair, the coffee was luke warm but not for long since adding cream made it just room temp. (they give u a little jug of real cream though). i've made peach tarts at home and it was the same, no reason why this regular sized peach tart should cost $5.75! wouldn't go back, though their interior is pretty and quaint and they have free wifi, just not a reasonable price for desserts that are nothing special. for that price i want a WOW factor which i felt was lacking, got more like a meh factor...which is fine if desserts were priced accordingly... we sampled the frozen custard which was good - so i'd recommend staying away from $$$ baked goods that u can get anywhere else for half-price and just going for the frozen custard.  i frequent andy's frozen custard in chicago all the time - now that's a real frozen custard joint!"}
{"text":"The only pther place I've had custard is Wisconsin, the dairy land state, and the owner of Jed's mentioned that he used to live there and felt strongly about bringing the creamy taste of custard to Toronto, which he did to great success. Jed's custard is as creamy and delicious as anything you'd find in the dairy state. In addition to the custard, the cheesecake is rich and filling and to die for.  The atmosphere is simultaneously light and cosy, and the staff is very friendly and very customer-service oriented.  The owner is present often and he always has a smile and a word to spare for his clients.  Highly recommend it. It's a neighbourhood must."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a rest stop or cool off from the heat whilst taking walks around Eglinton!   I had the milkshake which was so yummy! Great flavour, texture and thickness! not to thick that you cant get it up the straw but thick enough that it feels like a, well milkshake!  I also had a lemon mirangue which was delicious but the base was a bit hard!   All in all a lovely little place to stop and have a milkshake although I was surprised to find it a little pricey!"}
{"text":"The SO and I stopped in at Jedd's for some sweet treats after dinner while in the Yonge and Eglinton area.  The place is super cute and has a really cozy cafe feel.  When we walked in, we were drawn to the pie section at the counter.  We ended up ordered a savour pie because it looked so good!  The Salmon and Broccoli pie/quiche was great, very light with chunks of salmon.  We still had room for something sweet, we ordered an apple pie with frozen custard.  It was DELICIOUS!!  The frozen custard was like an awesome scoop of ice cream, creamy, smooth and not too sweet.  It was well balanced with the pie.  With the individual savoury pie, sweet pie slice a la mode and a regular hot chocolate, it was just under $20.  A little bit on the high side, but the service was fabulous and worth the price.  We did not realize that the cafe does community events.  Last night it was Christmas caroles evening with high school volunteers leading the caroles.  They even played my carole request!  I definitely recommend Jedd's, I will be back to try out the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"It's not ice cream.   It's not gelato.   It's not fro-yo. It's freaking awesome frozen custard! ...Fro-cu....?  Maybe not. Anyways.  I ordered a scoop of vanilla frozen custard. My custard barista winked at me and told me I wouldn't be disappointed. He's was right.  Cold, creamy, light, and not too sweet. It's one simple but perfect dessert. I'm an addict. I want more. Now. Right now.  I hear the affogato is pretty spectacular, so I'll be back maybe earlier in the day so I'm not wired on espresso all night.  I'm totally going here tomorrow.  And I'm getting two scoops!"}
{"text":"On a cold winter day, I suddenly had a craving for ice cream, but I wanted something different. Then I remembered, someone had once told me about frozen custard.  So I Yelped and lucky for me, I found Jedd's.  The custard is like a very rich, yet smooth ice cream.  It was the perfect accompaniment to a piece of apple crumble that had the most wonderful crust, perfect in texture and taste.  The biggest surprise was the latte.  I didn't have very high expectations, even though a previous reviewer had raved about it.  After all, the selling point of this place is the custard.  Then I had a sip of their latte and let out a \"wow\"!  Smooth with a hint of sweetness.  It was the perfect pairing with my crumble and custard.  I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Another Toronto place that has a lot of potential but fails to live up to its full potential.  The sweets and pastries are nice, the service is inconsistent.  During our last visit the owner was very rude to the person working there and they got into this fight with me standing there watching them.  It was definitely a huge turnoff and I will not be back there again."}
{"text":"I found Jedd's Frozen Custard by accident two years ago. I haven't been in there very often since because I don't live in the area but the place has left me with very good impressions. Back then I took a girl there on our first date and to this day we're still together.  I like to try different places and this one has a very unique atmosphere. Maybe not the most amazing, but I find it really nice and relaxing.  Service is excellent and they even bring your coffee to your table. I felt like it's the kind of place you can visit and enjoy on either a sunny, or a rainy day.   I am also not an expert, but so far I like everything I ordered in there."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to this little gem in the Yonge & Eg neighbourhood.  I had never even heard of frozen custard prior to arriving at Jedd's.  When I'm surrounded by desserts I can't think clearly.  The kind gentleman behind the counter must have noticed and explained what they offered.  Once I re-learned how to form sentences I ordered the espresso poured over frozen custard - a perfect combination of two of my favourite things.  The obvious problem with what I ordered is that the hot espresso melts the frozen custard at a faster rate than I can consume my smectic A'* dessert.  The espresso was perfect, complete with the right caramel colour and texture.  The custard was rich and creamy, but not too sweet.  Heavenly.  I found the stark white décor a little cold, but maybe that's the idea.    *Smectic A' is a state between solid and liquid: http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/98/0622/solid.html"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe in Midtown with custard instead of ice cream. It's pretty much a more eggy ice cream. I had the sundae and the affogato which came to less than $10. It's great in the summer time because they have outdoor seating and the ambiance is very homey with many people working on laptops or reading. I would want to try the waffle next."}
{"text":"Love this place. Frozen custard is something else. Frozen custard + a tart + chocolate chips + pineapple = amazing."}
{"text":"Well, I'm addicted to this place now. Are you happy?  What is this frozen custard thing? Jesus. Not only it is ridiculously good, they manage to make affogatos with it. I'm in heaven.  The sandwiches are divine. The one with roast beef and brie is gorgeous.  By the way, the person that I referred to as \"the manager\" in my previous review is actually the owner, Jedd - yeah, from Jedd's Frozen Custard. He seems to be always there, always interacting with people and making sure everything is OK. If you ask me, that's a great thing that the owner is so interested in making the business grow and flourish, instead of just putting the place together and letting it run itself like so many other small eateries out there."}
{"text":"Friendly service! And oh my! The custard, it IS better than icecream! Love love love!"}
{"text":"Right next door to Centro  PROs: - wonderful staff, friendly and helpful - great hours for night owl dessert-ers.  Open till midnight on Friday/Saturday! - really really good frozen custard - awesome desserts from Rahier's - free wi-fi  CONs: - You pay a little more for Rahier's desserts here.  The little tart/cake is about $1 more per piece; macarons is sold by piece vs. by weight as in Rahier's  OVERALL: A cool place to hang out and get yummy eats when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Had plain jane frozen custard. Was too sweet and lacked any custard flavour. May as well been above average vanilla ice cream. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Okay, so sometimes doing homework at home seems like THE most boring thing IN THE WORLD. Jedd's is one of my FAVORITE places to crunch numbers at - their relaxed, friendly environment, coupled with their tasty treats and comforting beverages, create the perfect ambiance for learning. Bring your books & laptop (they have free wi-fi!) ~ a fun way to integrate homework into your coffee-shop experience!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say that this a little cozy nice place. Their \"foret noir\" cake is delish and despite what is said up here on the profile, it is not closed on Sundays. I'm sitting here sipping my tea, right now on a Sinday afternoon."}
{"text":"Coupon in hand I walked in to Jedd's and it has pretty good decor for Frozen Custard place.  The Drinks & Dessert counter is near the front displays where you can ADMIRE the beauty of the Desserts.  We got the 2 flavours available this afternoon, Chocolate, and Maple Walnut.  I had the Maple Walnut and quite enjoyed it as it had a CREAMY rich flavour that Custards have over simply Ice Cream.    The couple young ladies working behind the counter were friendly and even asked our advice on new flavour ideas as it seems they can COMPOSE flavour combinations.  They suggested a flavour profile and I said it might work because I just came from a Juice & Smoothie place that had that same combo.  It is also a nice place that offers Coffee and Espresso Drinks where you can relax, chill and chat with a friend.  They also had a note on the Menu Blackboard as well as notes on the table announcing a LIVE band will be here Friday, July 16th.  This is definitely another OPTION from regular Ice Cream, Gelato, or Dairy Cream.  BTW, the washroom was almost high-class condo setting I wish I could take it with me."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the Yonge and Eglinton area! Jedd's seems to heavily market its Frozen Custard, probably to differentiate itself from other local cafe's but it has all the usuals as well. Inside, the decor is quite nice and slightly upscale. The have a cute little patio in front with a couple of tables and chairs, so it's also a fun place to people watch.  If you're going in to try frozen custard to look for an adventure, don't get your hopes too high as it's quite similar to gelato. I'd recommend having the vanilla with a shot of espresso (affogato)...I think you'll be delighted. Let's all try and support these new little cafes in the area and hopefully we'll get even more local businesses!"}
{"text":"I was walking around the area with my parents, acting like a bunch of tourists (because, we kind of are! I just moved here!) and popped my head into this store...it looked really cool from the outside!  Inside, I thought it was a cafe but upon closer inspection the back area served...frozen custard!  \"What the heck is frozen custard and who'd eat it?\" I thought outloud to myself.  The girl from behind the counter explained...kind of like ice cream and gelato...but insisted that I had to try it for myself to come up with my own explanation. I agreed. She asked if I wanted a free sample.   \"Hell yeah!\" I responded.  \"What flavour? We have tropical fruit, chocolate and one scoop of maple cream left...\"  Feeling guilty about potentially stealing a spoonful of someone else's maple cream, I opted for chocolate. The sample came to me on a silver spoon and into my mouth it went.....and it was amazing. It was sinfully delicious, heaven in your mouth, and I was told that it had about the same amount of fat content as gelato.   I'll see it to believe it. But for now, I'm sold on frozen custard. Maybe it's just a different name for ice cream but hey, I'm all about marketing and spin, so frozen custard it is!  Will be back for the full experience!"}
{"text":"On a pleasant Spring day stroll, I made my way inside this cute, charming coffee shop. Wanting to mind my waist line, I chose not the sandwiches or quiches, but the butter croissant and mint tea. Yes, some habits die hard!  The croissant was soft & it flaked off in my mouth! It was a piece of heaven.  The Moroccan mint green tea had a very strong green tea flavour. I much prefer pure mint tea."}
{"text":"I work in the area and was delighted to find another place to eat for lunch...a cute little cafe with sandwiches, soups, pastries, hot bevvies and, of course, frozen custard! I start with a delicious homemade bowl of soup (chicken and veg, which they seem to have available daily) and top it off with a heavenly scoop of frozen custard. Yum-tastic!  The \"affogato\" (two shots of espresso poured atop a small scoop of vanilla custard) is as amazing as they say it is, BUT at $5.95 plus tax ($6.37) it's too pricey to get on a regular basis. Jed: make it under $5, taxes in, and I'll drink one every hour on the hour :)"}
{"text":"I loved it. On Yonge and Eglinton, definitely a great location. I'd gotten a waffle with chocolate frozen custard, and my friend got an Affogato with plain frozen custard. It was delicious.  The custard seemed creamier than ice cream and man with the combination of the waffle, it was scrumptious. The waffle was pretty good. It was a bit on the harder side, but as the custard seeped into the waffle, with the addition of strawberries, each bite was better than the last. The affogato. Well, what can I say? I haven't tried an affogato before, and this was indeed a revelation. The espresso with frozen custard? Awesome. The bitterness and caffeine of the espresso combined with the sweetness of the custard was definitely a great combination. The store itself had a pretty solid front. I chose to sit in the patio. It wasn't too shabby. The staff behind the counter was really friendly and he had solid suggestions. They even do lunch stuff! And me being a vegetarian, they seemed to have great veggie options for lunch.  I'd definitely be back here, and this is definitely a great date spot. Fairly priced, has it's reasonable choice of caffeine fixes, and a solid desert selection. Definitely one of the better cafés, here at Yonge and Eglinton."}
{"text":"Place was empty when we came in, only underscored by the fact that there was no music playing-- but hey, we were there for the food.  Ordered the chocolate milkshake and a waffle to split-- both were good. Chocolate shake was quite tasty, and the waffle was warm and we enjoyed what we'd ate. I'd say the only disappointment was that the frozen custard really didn't seem like much other than traditional ice cream, but maybe I just don't have enough of a refined taste to tell the difference? Either way, it was good, but it won't be on the top of our list for a return visit."}
{"text":"Espresso poured on top of frozen custard makes me a whole lot giddy =)  I came here with my wife and friends not knowing what to expect.  I had never heard of affogatos so when my wife mentioned that they have frozen custard with espresso I thought it came on the side.  I have to admit, when I got my affogato I was a little surprised and wasn't really looking forward to eating my now melting custard with creamy-sugary espresso (I like my espresso with no sugar, no cream).  I began to contemplate which I should start on.  Should I sip the espresso while it's still relatively hot?  Or should I start eating the custard while it's still in its frozen state?  I opted for the frozen custard first and was quite pleased.  I then sipped the espresso, which IMO was very well pulled.  It was around this time I realized to really enjoy this dessert, I have to eat it together.  I mean, why else would they combine the two?  Wow, what a delight that combined bite/sip was.  The creamy rich flavour of the combination of custard and espresso was inspiring!  I've only been here once and am afraid of going back with my now high expecations.  But this place has to be tried by all.  Perhaps its not really Jedd's I loved, but more the affogato.  So I'll give it 4/5 stars.  But if I do dare to go back and enjoy their other offerings, I will be glad to upgrade that 4 to a 5."}
{"text":"I come here mainly for their single desserts which are delish! They have these apricot and raspberry cookies which are quite expensive but worth every bit! I also enjoy their pistachio danish when I can get my hands on them.   Their frozen custard is nice and taste very fresh. The sweetness and color are just right, not excessive. Why do I care about color? Well because a very fresh place needs not use colouring as a crutch. They are confident enough in the flavour to leave the food dye alone and Jedd excels here. I do have to say that I am yet to really taste the difference between these and fresh ice cream. Perhaps I need to try them more often and it will come to me. In the mean time, when I occasionally indulge in the frozen custard, the strawberry is my absolute fave! I don't know why but natural, fresh, milky frozen desserts tend to shine in their strawberry offerings."}
{"text":"As it's been almost a year since my first review of Jedd's, it's time for an update.  Just yesterday they expanded their product offering by adding pies from The Canadian Pie Company:  http://www.thecanadianpiecompany.com/website/?cat=4 The fruit and cream pies are about $6 a slice. Not sure how much for a whole pie.  The continue to have the delightful personal-sized Rahier desserts, and macarons.  They also have croissants, brownies, sandwiches, etc.  And of course, the frozen custard, which I still have not seen offered anywhere else in Toronto.  I do think that their prices are too high on some of the bakery items - a brownie comes to almost $4!  However, the products are good, the staff are very friendly, and the place is nice, clean, and a pleasure to visit."}
{"text":"I was doing some work visits yesterday and decided to drop in.  Unassuming place - I had to take a double-take to see if: 1) it was Jedd's and 2) it was open. This could be due to the fact that it's January ... because reading other reviews, it seems to be more open in the summer months.  I just had lunch so I couldn't eat much. Next time, I'd like to try the famous frozen custard though.  Lunch is available - the quiches looked tasty (quiches and pastries are from Phipps and Rahier, two amazing bakeries in the city).  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"VIBE  Ok. Love! What a great alternative to meet someone here than for \"coffee\" where you end up smelling like a bag of roasted beans. There's cute little chairs you can swing around in and large windows to view passerby.  The rest is a typical cafe look. There's also wi-fi but before you perk up, it was spotty on my visit.  The service on my first visit was great; second visit not so much. Though maybe if you're a cute guy the cashier will flirt with you.  I EAT Well, um custard! It's quite tasty and big portions too. Win!  Tea and coffee are on offer also.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Cut it out! They've got custard here? A sweet treat and a perfect first date alternative for those who are too afraid to splurge for an all out dinner. Go on with your bad self."}
{"text":"Tried the affogato (espresso shot poured over frozen vanilla custard) because of all the amazing reviews it got on here (it was also listed as a \"reviewer favourite\" in the store). I honestly couldn't understand what all the hype was about. It is was a tasty treat, but maybe I was expecting too much and was disappointed.   There were a bunch of other cakes, quiches and pastries that looked good. I would visit again if I was in the area to try some of the other things they serve there."}
{"text":"This has become our favourite cafe/patisserie in North Toronto.  First, their coffee's are simply, just perfect. Sweets and other patisserie goodies you'd expect to find are all there, along with baked goods like quiche's etc.    We had the lentil soup, with a salmon quiche for $9.  The lentil soup was as good as any homemade my wife can make.  It was perfect.  We also tried the custard \"ice cream\" and wow... i was shocked.  This is superb and I highly recommend it.  It's a product brought from Wisconsin and the milk/cheese lovers there who produce this custard process and is very well known there.  It's so good...you won't want to eat the Baskin Robin's or DQ crap ever again."}
{"text":"Was talked into a long walk for frozen custard. This place does not disappoint. Ordered the chocolate scoop and it was really good. If you like chocolate ice-cream, you will love their chocolate frozen custard."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting, extremely nice waitress. I recommend the chicken salad sandwich. The iced vanilla latte was delicious in the summer heat. Wifi is available !"}
{"text":"I write this in the middle of a severe frozen dessert jones.    Of course, I could satisfy my cravings in any number of places, high-end and low.   Within a short walk I can indulge in just about any scoop or soft-serve delight the city has to offer.   But somehow, I crave something different.   It's hot enough to crave something chilly, but not so hot that I don't want butterfat.   RIch.  Creamy.   Butter.   Fat.   Luckily, Jedds is just up the block.   Featuring a limited menu of \"frozen custards\" alongside decent coffee and exquisitely pretty pastries, Jedds also has laid-back seating and a barista-cool vibe. Bring a date. Or your wife. Or both, if that's how your roll. I don't judge.   That said, I'd eat their frozen custard sitting on a cardboard box in the street. It is supremely creamy; holding its structure long after the Dairy Queen cones of the world have given up the ghost.   Fat carries flavours, and Jedds' are subtle. Coffee one day, maple the next, swirled with more standard flavours like milk chocolate or floral vanilla.   If you're a fan of chunky ice cream, these treats are not for you. They're all about mouthfeel.    and RIch.   Creamy.   Butter.   Fat.  My only criticisms of Jedd's are that it's too close (a longer walk would better burn the delicious, delicious calories), and in tribute to a certain US based frozen custard chain, I wish to God I could order a cookie puss."}
{"text":"I'm flip flopping between 3 or 4 stars. 3 because i was actually quite a bit disappointed with the frozen custard (okay it's a bit creamier than regular ice cream, but my plebeian taste buds do not taste the huge difference). But I think this place deserves 4 stars because the vibe is ultra laid-back and cozy here, and the servers are extremely friendly and the prices arent bad. I'm definitely interested in coming back to try their other types of dessert."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check out this place.  First off, kudos for the super warm greetings and friendly service. They even brought out my snacks to my table and I didn't expect that from a cafe.   Had a mini quiche to start- Bacon, grilled onions and emmental cheese. It was pretty tasty but I'm a sucker for quiches so that's an easy sell for me :)  The Dumas tart was Delicious. Don't know which part I liked best, maybe the wafer walls or the noisette mousse/custard. The crust was not the right texture and stuck to the plate but otherwise this was chocolatey nutty perfection.   Disappointed that i got no latte art and it was a bitter brew.  Also a bit let down by the selection ESP for cheesecakes. There was not much, see my pics and you'll see. Nothing like others' pics.   So overall not a bad spot.  I RECOMMEND- the Dumas  TIP- seats are comfy but tables are kind of high for laptops/typing. Impractical.  TIP 2 STAFF- the manager was screaming. I planned to enjoy the music but she kept going on about everything and anything and chatting so soooo loudly. Mood kill."}
{"text":"Affogatto!   Espresso over Jedd's Frozen Vanilla Custard!   oh it is so so so so good........ Now I really taste the difference between ice cream (meh) VS frozen custard (yay!). It is definitely an adult treat.. after licking my bowl I am in sugar high and caffeine high and ready to face the cold chilly weather!   Life is so so good!"}
