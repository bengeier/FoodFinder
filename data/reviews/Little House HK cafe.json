{"text":"The staff was friendly and the service was super fast.  I tried the Tom Yum noodles and it's wasn't too spicy which was perfect for me. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A very small restaurant with very limited menu and parking.  Lunch and dinner has the same menu, and it is on the pricy side.  Almost $10 for satay beef noodle.  Would not come back again"}
{"text":"Decided to try out this new gem in my hood as recommended by one of my friends, they serve quality HK style food! I had the baked chicken thigh rice with soup, chicken was tender and tasty, love the veggie rice that came with the dish! This is not the normal white rice but some special chicken flavour veggie rice. Price is reasonable, will definitely go back and try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Can't say this place is bad as the reviews say it is but neither was it good enough for me to return. 

Came here this morning for a quick breakfast. I ordered the satay beef vermicelli and changed it to instant noodle and cold lemon tea. I liked how changing it to instant noodle didn't require an extra charge but probably the price was included anyways ($6.75). Seems pricier than new city but then again everything is on a rise. Food came out quick but it didn't taste like satay at all, lack of it. Overall just normal beef boiled in instant noodle soup. It didn't taste terrible just lacking satay flavour. 

The lemon tea itself was lacking tea flavour as well. The whole bill came to $9. 

Parking was terrible. This hk cafe needs to improve on its dishes in order to survive since there are so many options around this area."}
{"text":"I came here with my family since it's close to my parents workplace and it was great! The service was pretty nice, server seated us and served us right away. She actually improved from the last time we visited.
All of our food came at appropriate times (tea, soup, main course, drink). The food here has gotten better from when they first opened as well. Overall, I would come again with family and friends!"}
{"text":"Saw this place as we were driving down Hwy7, decided to give it a try. It's been open for 3 days so everything was very new and clean. I tried the stir fried spaghetti beef lots of flavour, very good portion. Would come back again. Convenient location!"}
{"text":"Affordable | Free WiFi | Limited parking | Limited Seating | Closes at 8pm

Little restaurant opened from a previous Italian restaurant on hwy 7. Location has very limited parking.

Decent affordable HK cafe style food. Serves breakfast at 8am and closes at 8pm.

Simple menu including rice, noodles and steam rice options. Nothing special. Service was okay. 

The daily soup was not very impressed for a typical Chinese soup. A steak and spaghetti dish for $15 is okay. The lamb chops were small and came in 3 pieces. The fried pork chop in soup noodle was bland.

Overall it's a nice little place but so far nothing outstanding for me to come back again for."}
{"text":"Agree with most posters, won't last long. Your average cha Chang tang, nothing special. Took one star away as HK hot milk tea (suppose to be a signature item for these places) was warm, not hot. French Toast bites for afternoon tea was good."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by and try this place out, as i always drive by this restaurant on Highway 7.
From the outside, this restaurant is quite small- with only a few parking spots in the front, but they actually have some more spots behind the restaurant.

I find the menu here is quite limited, with a sandwich menu, afternoon tea menu ( i came here at around 3 pm) and a regular menu.
I was first attracted by the laksa noodle, but it was around $10.95 which i find it a bit pricey as an Hk cafe.

Hence i went with the afternoon tea menu, we ordered :
- pork chop cutlet with soup noodle
- grilled pork chop with instant noodle

The above comes with drinks, we ordered cold lemon tea, so it costs extra $1 per drink.

The food is actually not bad here, and the portion is quite big. The bill came up to less than $20 for 2 people so it's pretty good.

This is a restaurant that I wouldn't mind coming back again."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch - it wasn't planned but we were driving along Highway 7 and noticed the new sign. It's a small cafe with a very limited menu in Chinese standards, organized into 3 sections - soup noodles, rice, and steamed rice. There were probably less than 20 things to choose from in total, of which 33% were unavailable that day (i.e. the whole steamed rice section). The menu is the same for lunch and dinner, so prices are actually on the higher side for lunch.

Although the restaurant was more than half empty, service was slow and the waitress kept forgetting what we ordered even though she seemed to have written things down. She came back on two occasions to confirm noodles/rice for 2 out of 3 of our dishes. Also, our drinks were first to come out (usually served last, but not picky here), followed by our dishes, and then our soups (usually served first). They had actually forgotten our soups. The waitress also told us they only accepted cash or debit, but when I went up to pay the cashier told me credit was okay too.

Despite the poor service, food was decent but nothing special. Clearly this restaurant is very new and appears to still be working out a bunch of kinks, but unless they expand their menu I will likely not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just a regular Hong Kong cafe. It's a cute little cafe. There's only 2 parking spots in the front, but more parking in the back. I ordered the Laksa chicken and shrimp noodle soup. It comes with 2 different types of noodles and the flavours were pretty good for a decent price (bun + drink included). They have breakfast, lunch, tea time, and dinner combos as well. I would come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Barely any parking, the waitress is clueless, the food in mediocre, the price is high. How do you charge nearly $11 (after tax) for a bowl of Satay Beef Vermicelli (which comes with an HK bun and drink) that is marginally just filling? Everything on the menu is priced at a premium without serving anything at a premium. You are better off avoiding this place and going back to your typical hk cafe around the area which can beat this place with quality and value."}
{"text":"The menu has limited options to choose from as others have mentioned already. The portions were small for the price. We ordered the steamed rice with pork. It's their opening special, $7.50 for the combo (regularly $9), it comes with a drink and a soup. The rice was too moist and sticky. It is in a small foil tray. My lemon tea only had two small pieces of lemon, but it's good enough since the cup is small. Anyway, the food quality is okay, but I would say the price is average to high. E.g. A satay beef instant noodle with a drink would cost $9.50 + tax.  I'm not sure if I would go there again since there are lots of other similar restaurants around with wider food choices and more parking spaces."}
{"text":"Saw this little hk style cafe opened recently. Today is the first time we came here for dinner. I really appreciate the waitress's service. She recommended \"salted\" chicken rice, which tastes good. And she noticed we really like the coconut soup that comes with the meal, she even offered a 2nd bowl for free. The soup taste very good and she said it's no MSG."}
{"text":"3.5 Not bad. Came on a weekday so there was only a few people in the restaurant. I liked the modern decor of this quaint HK cafe. 
  
- High tea menu portions are smaller but are a bit cheaper. The original menu is quite limited to begin with
- Pork chop with fries - Pork chop was a tad dry but I got over it because i loved how crispy the pork chop and fries was. 
- Club sandwich - Good but average. Decent portion for this 
- Cubed toast - also good but average tasting. It was little bit too oily for me 

Each dish came with a drink and we got one hot and one cold HK milk tea which was standard tasting. No wow factor.

Service was great as it was not busy. Poor location and little parking available."}
{"text":"A few weekends ago, we just wanted to go eat at a hk style cafe. Since we passed by it on the way to our regular cafe that we enjoy, we decided to try some where new. 

Huge huge huge disappointment. Firstly, the complimentary tea that is given to you once you are seated has no tea taste (way too watered down). Secondly, the menu is so limited already but 1/3 of the menu (which was the rice section) was not available. Thirdly, there's no hk cafe out there that will only include either a bowl of soup (which btw had only one choice but usually hk cafe offer minimum two choices) or a bun. It's such a joke. This place is wayyyyy overpriced for a hk cafe. For the price they charge, I definitely hoped for an above average meal which wasn't the case.

Hence, why would I come back when there are so many choices in the area that are lot tastier and cheaper and legit ??

Furthermore, the servers here are super inexperienced. There were a party of 4 waiting for a table. There were two tables that could be combined as a table of four in the middle. However, out of all choices, they decided to move an older couple, that were seated at a table that could sit 4, that had already sat, ordered, and started to drink their soup, to move for that party of four. 

Anyways, good luck to this cafe. Definitely lots of room for improvements....."}
{"text":"My husband and I keep passing by this place since it's on our way to work every morning and also 5 minutes from home. So finally we got to try it. Went in for afternoon tea time around 2:30pm which most HK Style Cafes start their Ham-cha menu. Got a parking right in the front (got lucky I guess since most reviews in here complained of limited parking... which is very true). 

We got seated immediately and I couldn't wait to see the menu. But to my surprise there was none. It was up on the chalkboard and super limited items. I usually order my staple items during Ham-Cha at the other HK Style Cafes surrounding  this neighborhood...which is Pork chop with fries/salad, Honey garlic chicken wings with fries/salad, Hoy-Lam-Gai-Fan with rice, Noodles in soup Guilin style or mini steak with fries. This menu had non of the staples. Weird. So I ended up ordering Pork Cutlet with urdon noodles which costed roughly about $10 for afternoon tea menu and veey plain looking. Kind of expensive if you ask me for afternoon tea menu. But I'll give it to them that the crust on the fried Pork chop was good. 

Another downside was.. Their menu was do limited you barely have any choices. And some stuff on their menu they said wasn't available yet. So why put it up to tease us? 

Service was friendly ... a bit slow, she forgot to bring us some utensils and a spoon to stir sugar into my husband's hot HK milk tea. How to stir your drink without a spoon? Just little things I think they still need practice on. Esp little things like this because it goes to show you trained your staff well and want to run an efficient restaurant. It also goes to show you care for your clients and want them to return with good impression.

I don't want to be hard on this new HK Style cafe, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they are new and haven't established running it well yet ... therefore I give this place 3 stars for the effort. Hopefully they will read these client reviews and take it as positive feedback to improve their restaurant and I wish them well on getting better with improvement."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now and so far they've been consistent on their food and portions. 
It's a bit more pricey in terms of the HK style fast food world, but I enjoy the setting and the service. 
The servers are always polite and full of smiles. This is definitely not a trait common to these places. 
The restaurant is still very new so it's clean and comfy. Never way too loud. There are TVs, but the noise level is definitely more tolerable. The space itself isn't too big, but the seating is set up so that you don't feel crowded in. If there is a wait tho, waiting at the door can be a little uncomfortable as that part of the restaurant is fairly narrow and can be a little tight. 
It's off of Hwy 7, in a small strip mall so parking can be difficult. 
The food isn't a wow or anything but if you're going to this kind of fast food restaurants, don't expect too much on the taste front. Their pan fried pork chops and pan fried chicken steaks are not super thick, but they manage to keep it juicy. 
The soup the noodles are in a home made chicken broth we were told. So less MSG."}
{"text":"Checked out this cleaned and nice hk cafe that opened up. We were very impressed by the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff! I always appreciate quality food and good customer service! Will be back for sure. Almost forgot to mention...the milk tea was A+++"}
{"text":"I really did enjoy Little House HK Cafe, and despite only having one dish here, it's a really cozy HK cafe. I found both the food and service here pretty decent despite what is said in a lot of these reviews. 

I went with their beef Satay vermicelli noodles and it was quite enjoyable. There was quite a lot of beef actually, and it's weird saying this, but there wasn't enough noodles to go with the beef. I suppose there could have been more Satay taste/paste but it was still good. The soup was sweet, although I'm not sure if that's a good thing. The bun was quite standard - it was soft and warm. The lemon tea was also as expected. 

A totally random tidbit here but there's these awesome and totally cute (but real) drawing on the wall with the chicken and the cows. You can't miss it.

The major downside was the pricing here. The noodle bowl was $10 with an extra $3 add-on for the lemon tea. The $10 is already on the steeper side and the $3 add on didn't make much sense when it was just a drink substitution. Service was friendly with no complaints and food came out in reasonable time."}
{"text":"Overall experience was quite average. Found the menu selection to be very limited, plus higher prices than competitors with smaller portions. Food was okay, but nothing stood out."}
{"text":"First Impressions
=============
Nice & cozy little cafe. There is extra parking at the back (just an fyi) if the front fills up.

Friendly service as we were greeted and seated.

Food
=====
Curry Pork Cutlet: Cutlet was a little under-fried?  The Cutlet just seemed like it could use a bit more time in the fryer--batter seemed undercooked.

The curry was good.  It was pretty typical HK cafe style curry. Like halfway between Malaysian and Japanese style curry--and very mild.

I personally like a strong, bold, spicy and flavourful curry so this didn't really do it for me.

Club Sandwhich: club Sandwhich was good.  Just the right amount of everything that typically goes in a club Sandwhich.

Would I come back?
===============
Yes, I want to try the Laksa noodle.  It looks good from the pictures posted by other Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Passed by on hwy 7 with a craving for HK style breakfast food. However, we had our dog with us and knew not many places could accommodate. However, we noticed the store from of this place and a small like patio.
Walking in, the waitress greeted us right away and helped us set up outside. 
The waitress also gave us some recommendations from the menu as they did not have much prepared. They had only opened for 4 days.
We had a fried porkchop instant noodle (yes very HK...for breakfast) and their speciality Salted/Baked chicken rice. We were very impressed with the rice as the chicken had the bone taken out and crispy skin. The best part was the \"Choi\" rice which is a traditional Chinese way of making rice with veggies baked in.
It was a also a nice touch that cold drinks did not have the usual +$1.
Will definitely come back and try their other dishes.
Minus one star as their service was a bit slow. The owners apologized as they had just opened and were working out the kinks."}
{"text":"Was craving HK cafe food and happened to pass by this cute little cafe. Lunch special: Pork shop with spaghetti + drink and soup for $9.50. Pork chop was the worst I have ever had, not enough sauce, bland and the pork was gamy. Never got to have the soup because they ran out. Milk tea was good."}
{"text":"Somehow wanted to try a new restaurant and it was a mistake. Came here on a Saturday afternoon.
Not many people so was seated right away.
No one bothered giving us the newly printed menu or giving us tea until after 5-10 mins.
I can read Chinese but not my bf so basically I had to read him the menu as written on the black board since there's no English on it.

The selection was extremely limited. Only 17 items on the lunch menu and it's a bit on the pricier side compared to other hong kong style restaurants in the area. Right away I can think of new city and M.Y. restaurant. 

When we were ready to order, I was told that five (the steamed rice) out of the 17 items weren't available. What? So this restaurant only has a dozen of lunch items? And why didn't they tell us right when we sit down? And why didn't they have it ready before lunch hour? What didn't they put an \"NA\" sign over the blackboard?

I was about to leave but my bf already ordered the pork cutlet so I ended up ordering the same thing. it didn't matter anymore cuz I wouldn't be eating what I first wanted anyway. 

Our food arrived much later when we ordered at similar timing as the table behind us.
First our drinks, the server dripped the milk tea all over and apologized and just when we expected her to comeback and clean it up - nope she didn't return. 
Onto the food: the pork cutlet instant noodles/vermicelli was underwhelming. No seasoning for the vermicelli nor the cutlet. Dry and rough for the most part. Paper thin for a few pieces. At close to $10 for this pork cutlet? I could have gotten a much better meal else where. 

After we finished, bf agreed that we shouldn't have walked into this restaurant but said there's one way they could make it up. I said \"give us a discount for this meal\" \"jinx\"
But nope it didn't happen. No apology for nothing.

Overall, super limited selection, pricy, mediocre food, amateur services. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Quick service, super friendly customer service (very rare when trying hk cafes), I ordered their curry chicken rice, portion was good and their sauce is amazing.
Their MUST TRY is their french toast bites, with peanut butter. It's so good!!"}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. I drive by this location many times but have wondered how these small places have survived. There's only a couple parking spots outside and today I decided to give it a try.

I haven't had instant noodles in a while so I decided to order them today. The dish looked OK, like something I could cook up at home. The egg was cooked just right but everything else about it was pretty standard. The soup lacked flavour and seemed watered down. The milk tea that came with my dish however was blehhhh. I don't know what exactly it needed but it did not taste good, even with the addition of sugar. 

The service was pretty standard. I don't have much to comment about it. I do want to mention that there are a couple TVs there playing some asian dramas if you are into that though :P

The price of the combo came out to be $7. It's a meh price but the milk tea definitely did not help justify the price. 

Being such a small place, I was surprised to see how many people actually came to eat at this place. In my opinion though, it wasn't that good and I most likely won't be coming back. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"I badly wanted to like this restaurant. It is near my house, is new and is clean. 

Sadly, the owners have forgotten that an important element of running a restaurant is to have food at aforementioned restaurant. 

We went on a Saturday afternoon. The menu is sparse for HK style restaurant - 17 items spread out across three categories: soup noodle, rice and spaghetti, and steamed rice.  Except that the kitchen had no rice. Setting aside the fact that this means half their menu is not available... WHAT KIND OF CHINESE RESTAURANT HAS NO RICE? 

Also, they had no rice noodle, which is my usual go to staple. 

That's okay though. The waitress compensated for this by forgetting part of our order, getting it wrong anyway, and generally being... inexperienced. 

Fortunately, there is almost no parking in front of or behind the restaurant, so you won't need to worry about the quality of food, since it's entirely unlikely that you'll even get in."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place can survive given its poor location and a combination of lack of parking and walk-in customers. Nonetheless, I'll try and offer a fair review for this place...

Little House HK Cafe is located on the south side of 7 near Main Street Unionville. As said earlier, parking and location is terri-bad here, which may explain the lack of people in this place the entire time my friend and I were here.

I had the pan fried pork chop spaghetti, which came with a Chinese style soup and an iced lemon tea. The soup was okay, nothing to write home about. The pork chop spaghetti was decent. Not the best I've had, but not the worst. The iced lemon tea, however, was not good at all unfortunately.

Service was unattentive. After we finished our meal and wanted our bill, the server never came out until we had to yell for her to come out. I know we were the only customers and she probably wanted us to stay longer, but we had places to go...

There's lots of other (better) HK style cafes in the area, so I don't really have much reason to return here."}
{"text":"This place is not cheap but a nice little area to eat. There aren't much seating but the service was very nice. The waitress explained the menu and she advertised the curry combo on the wall. Portion size for the steamed rice wasn't big but the presentation was good. Would recommend to try once to friends and family."}
{"text":"Little house, big taste! We were so happy to see the previous restaurant go, and find a new HK restaurant instead. This is karma at its best. So of course we had to try it. Right away everyone was very friendly and welcoming. We ordered the short ribs and pork chop on rice, and both were delicious. The soup and drinks were good too. We will definitely be coming back to try their other dishes. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the food took a bit long to come out, and it was very hot inside."}
{"text":"Nice decor, clean place,  and friendly service.  Ingredients to are fresh and portions are good, although the meat in granny's beef noodles were quite tough.  I think they have some serious organization issues.  Their orders are often mixed up and their service is really slow for a HK style  day for cafe.  They do have good attitude about it when feedback was provided.  They have been open for a week only.  They were also upfront about menu items that they don't yet have.  Hopefully they shape up soon.  We need more places life this but customers use fast food because they are on a time line."}
{"text":"1.5 stars. I came here a few weekends ago for dinner and had high hopes for a nice HK style cafe that I go to for quick bites. Unfortunately we won't be coming again.

I'll cover the good first - it's new (they opened maybe a month or two ago) and clean. This used to be a nice little Italian restaurant and they renovated after they took up the spot. The cafe also has wifi and tv.


Now the bad... I can't help but get the sense the folks that runs this place are new to the restaurant business. Typically places try to do a terrific job wowing and securing new clients before they do things like cut on portion sizes or find ways to cut costs. But here - we had ordered a chicken + spaghetti dish that had WAY too little meat to even say there was chicken in it. Similarly the \"AAA\" sirloin steak... I mean I know these kind of cafes really aren't typically serving AAA even though they say it, but it was pretty subpar even for cafe standards. 


Next is the service... I wouldn't say the service is rude or abysmal, but you get the sense the folks running this thing are completely new to this industry and are kind of just bumbling their way through. The waitress in particular seemed to have her head in the clouds - she was switching the sign to \"closed\" when we were approaching the restaurant (which is open), and when we told her about it (several times), she had this really puzzled look. 

She didn't bring us utensils or napkins when we sat down. When we asked, she just dropped a bunch on the side of the table (again yes it's a HK cafe, but it is also relatively new and not meant to be a dai pai dong style place). She also took the order wrong - we pointed to an item on the chalk board and she gave us the numbered item in the menu. (Apparently what they wrote on the chalk board is differently numbered on the menu... but she tried to pass it off as the \"right\" order even though the item we asked for wasn't supposed to have pepper in it). To the credit of the woman running the restaurant, she saw the waitress was bumbling and she came and offered to give us the right meal.

There was a guy eating in a booth near us that got the pork chop and he had a couple bites before telling the waitress it's undercooked. She kind of just stared at him a bit before asking if there's something she could do about it, before the guy kind of sighed and said \"yeah, nevermind\". Most places (esp a new place that is trying to establish a good rep and steady customer base) would have proactively re-made the meal for the guy."}
{"text":"My wife decided to come here for lunch. We were lucky to get a parking spot in front. There was not a lot of choices on the menu. We both chose the salt chicken. The menu says it comes with coffee or tea but when I asked for tea bag they said they only have milk tea or lemon tea. I took the milk tea but I had to add lots of sugar. They said the chicken had no bones but I got a few pieces of bones and tendons that were very hard. The only good thing was the French toast cubes with condensed milk. As others have mentioned, the price is a bit higher than average. I don't think I will be returning here."}
{"text":"Little House HK Cafe is on a strip of old-school commercial plazas where parking pretty much backs onto the street. There used to be an Italian restaurant (Cucina Locale) and a long time before that, a greek restaurant. The new restaurateurs have extensively renovated the space, adding in a full wall and booths in a modern design with wall decorations and flat screen playing TVB dramas.

It seems like there was only 3 staff working when we went, a very busy and overworked waitress, a cook and a cashier who also helped out cooking. The restaurant was pretty busy this Thanksgiving Monday and it seems like they were caught by surprise. They ran out of rice, and many of the dishes could've benefited from being cooked longer (eg. the curry dish and the soup).

Aside from the soup needing a bit longer to cook, I though that my black pepper sauce pork chop on spaghetti was good. The spaghetti was cooked well, chewy and cooked with a bit of butter. The pork chop was also good, juicy and cooked throughout though I could've had more black pepper sauce.

The menu is generally pricey. And they need a drink menu!

{"text":"I love their food! They don't cheap out on the dishes and great service. 
We tried a lot of food on their menu and most of them are good. I actually like their corn beef and egg sandwich. Really fluffy egg and crispy toast."}
{"text":"Stumbled here for lunch as we were driving down hwy7. Surprisingly it was their first day opening.
Seems like a family owned restaurant where the husband is the cook and the wife manages the front.
They didn't have their menus printed out yet so it was only the menu on their chalkboard on the wall which was in Chinese only.

Laksa noodles with chicken and shrimp ($10.95)
This was okay. The soup based lacked a bit in flavor, strong in Coconut but not really spicy. There was a lot of chicken meat bit they were just boiled and put it, not marinated with flavor.

Pork chop rice ($12.95)
The pork chop was really good! The meat was really tender and flavorful. I asked for black pepper sauce but it felt like it was just their normal \"siu\" sauce with black peppers. Regardless, the pork chop was tasty. Comes with two big pieces, veggies and rice, and a soup and bun as appetizer. I like how they serve Chinese buns, since most places nowadays only serve soup or garlic toast. The soup was interesting tho, it's like a chinese coconut chicken soup but I wasn't feeling strongly about the cocunt flavor in the soup. 

The food was a little slow given the fact that we were the only customers eating there. Overall the food was good, the staff seemed really confused but I'd give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened.

Debit or cash only."}
{"text":"Very expensive place for very common food. Especially given the area and the abundance of options."}
{"text":"My wife and me went here on Tuesday evening.
The interior decor is modern and clean.  Choices are not so much ok the menu compared to other HK style cafe.
Hopefully it will be expanded after they are settle down.
I ordered the AAA sirloin and my wife ordered the pork chop dinner.  My sirloin turned out to be well done even though I ordered with medium cook.  My wife's pork chop dinner looks and taste fine.  The price of the dinner portion is a bit high compared with the level of food they served.  I will give another try in the future and hopefully they will expand the menu."}
{"text":"I think that I agree with some of the reviews here: there is lots of competition if we're talking about HK-style cafes in the area and I think Little House has a slim chance of contending. 

When I first looked at the prices, I was a bit surprised because it looks pricier than most, but hey, maybe the portions will make up for it (they didn't). Initially, I wanted the \"rice noodle in soup with fish and beef balls\" from the afternoon tea menu - they didn't have it because they said they ran out of the balls. Mind you, afternoon tea starts at 2:30 and I was there at 3:00...

Anyways, here is what we actually had:

1. Vermicelli with Satay Beef in Soup ($6.95):
This is served with a coffee or tea an I for a lemon water. The portion was smaller than most HK cafes. There was also a small handful of a thick noodle that wasn't vermicelli - they probably mixed it by accident? There were maybe 3 slices of beef in the whole bowl of noodles; this was such a disappointment.

2. Tuna Fish Sandwich ($5.95):
This was toast I could've probably made at home because the portion was so small and the amount of tuna? It may have well have been butter - that's how thin of a layer it was. For the price I'm paying, I expected much more tuna than what I got!

3. Beef Brisket Curry Combo ($10.95):
We clearly were not full after those two meals so we ordered the curry, which came with a soup and a coffee/tea. I was surprised that this portion size was average and the curry actually tasted like curry. However, the amount of beef brisket we found? Not much. It was all curry sauce with lots of onions... even the carrots and peppers were scarce in comparison! This was not satisfying at all.

In the end, I do have to give them an extra star because their service was not bad (even though it was clear she didn't speak English). Nonetheless, I would not come back for the food because one, there's not many seats to begin with, and two, there's just not enough flavours and consistencies to draw me in."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try someplace new for lunch and were lured here by the positive reviews. The Laksa that I ordered was mediocre at best and could have definitely benefited from more aromatics like lemongrass or kaffir lime leaves. Save your money people."}
{"text":"3 stars for effort but otherwise I would give a 2. This is a new and clean HK style cafe with a rather limited menu. The staff were friendly but seemed lost and confused half the time. I had the Laksa noodle soup for lunch which was ok but at $10.95 I expected it to be better than average. I couldn't finish my meal as the portion was quite large and the server asked me if it was because I didn't like it. I think it may be a family owned business and they are still trying to figure things out, so I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"Little House HK Cafe is another HK style cafe in the area. To survive in this competitive market is not easy and I am not really sure if they would make it if they don't make some changes.

Afternoon Tea Special: Satay Beef Vermicelli ($6.95) was a fail. There was hardly any satay taste and the beef was dried and hard.

Menu is quite small vs other restaurants and if they are struggling with such a small menu, I really have doubts with the kitchen staff.

Hopefully, they would improve and work out all the kinks in the near future."}
{"text":"I personally would not return to this little cafe. I wanted to try it out because I drive past it all the time on Highway 7 and the sign looked nice. There isn't a lot of parking, luckily, I got a spot right in the front, but it was pretty hard to get out of.

On a Saturday afternoon, there were only two other tables so we were seated right away. The tea they serve you when you sit down tasted absolutely horrible. I had a question about the menu and while the server was very sweet and tried to explain it to me, her English just wasn't that strong.

We ordered two dishes: Pan Fried Porkchop served with gravy, rice and some vegetables and a Laksa noodle. Our dishes also came with a bun with butter, a soup, and two drinks. Our total was $30 (after tax and tip).

I was impressed with the porkchop - it was pan fried very well. Crispy on the outside but the meat itself was tender. The Laksa was average - it wasn't the best but I have no complaints. The milk tea wasn't good at all. 

I don't think that I would give this place another try. I feel that it's a little pricey in comparison to other HK style cafes and the quality of the food isn't on par with the pricing. Overall, I would not return and I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Unfortunately no matter how good the food is the lack of parking and frustration is not worth it. Servers are shady never provide afternoon tea menu and only provided regular menu until asked. When asked lady seemed pissed off at us changing our order. Ontop there is no heat in the resto LOL. In the Kennedy and HWY7 area competition is fierce. The final nail in the coffin is the fact that their HK Lemon Tea is just weak. For the price, food, and convenience there are much better options around the area."}
