{"text":"Really well organized and clean cafe that has lots of menu options. Great ambience!  Coffee is really good!  Staff may be a little uptight at times but they are working hard and that's to be expected. Always professional, however.  Great place for first meeting or for working alone."}
{"text":"Worse cafe ever, got Inside without a greeting. Even have to wait few minutes to be seated when there's no customers. The atmosphere was okay and the food. However I find the customer service really really poor."}
{"text":"Love this place. Its not a \"trendy\" spot, like nearby Overeasy or Diner Deluxe, but it has great breakfast selections that arent greasy, for a good  price. Ive never had to wait long after my order has been placed to receive my meal (and i always go on saturday or sunday)"}
{"text":"OMG! Blue cheese burger. So goooooooooood.   Nuff said."}
{"text":"A latte that can set a good standard. Thanks for the morning smile!"}
{"text":"Joshua Tree provides a nice, clean space with reliable wifi and a decent selection of coffees, teas and other drinks. They also offer up a more robust food menu than I am used to seeing at coffee shops, which is a nice bonus. However all I can really rate JT for is the tea and the wifi, both of which did me right. Oh, and the ambiance - it was decent. A little clean and sterile for my Portland-Bohemian inclinations but when in need it served us well.   Maybe I'll try the coffee next time in."}
{"text":"My business allows me the flexibility to meet current and prospective clients for coffee. Depending on my client's location in the city, I like to meet with them at Independently owned cafes. The Joshua Tree Cafe is one of those places.  It's on the top of the hill of Edmonton Trail N, just minutes from downtown Calgary.  I've been coming here off and on for a 6 months now. It's easy to give directions to, easy to find, lots of available free parking and you're always able to find a seat - comfortable Ikea'ish looking chairs or two face to face leather sofas.  There's an Asian flare to the place and the staff are extremely polite, humble and tidy - dirty tables are quickly cleaned up when a customer leaves (though it must be said that I'm a fan of any customer who picks up after themselves - it takes ZERO time and demonstrates your respect and appreciation for the facility and staff).  The food is quite good - most everything is made fresh right before your eyes - a breakfast menu, bagels, salads, sandwiches, paninies with a variety of cold drinks, coffee & teas.  Of course they have treats too. Today I had a turkey sandwich with a spinach salad - all very tasty - along with a large coffee... just under $8.00  There's 'secure' WIFI network though the password has been the same since my first visit - is that really secure then? Just ask anyone of the friendly staff behind the counter and they'll be happy to share it with you.  Secured (locked) public restrooms are on site - nicely decorated as if you were in someones home - not commercial like you're used too in usual fast food establishments.  They play the radio (currently Light 96) over the cafe speakers at a level that wouldn't interrupt good conversation.   As much as I like Tim's, Starbucks and Second cup, I will always support the independent business owner who offers a quality competitive product. The Joshua Tree has earned my business time and time again. If you haven't tried it, you should."}
{"text":"The Joshua Tree Cafe is pretty much one of Calgary's hidden little secrets - an adorable coffee shop with pretty damn good coffee, a delightlful ambiance and hidden away in a strip mall beside a blockbuster. It has cute little chairs and a menu that is mostly soups and sandwiches, all in all a very traditional coffee shop. But the colours and feeling of the place make it worth a visit - its true intimacy is a wonderful place for a coffee shop, or even just to relax and do some introspection."}
{"text":"I'd read about this little hidden gem in one of the local magazines (Avenue) and it intrigued me.  It referenced being in the same neighbourhood as Diner Deluxe & OEB.   I have driven South on Edmonton Trail too many times to count and never once noticed this little cafe tucked into a strip mall.  Late Father's Day morning we decide to try our luck and go out for brunch.  We ventured over to Edmonton Trail to inspect the line ups at Diner Deluxe and OEB.  And as we expected the Diner Deluxe line up was ridiculously long, OEB had about half a dozen waiting outside and then I remembered the Joshua Tree Cafe.  We found it, pulled into the parking lot, walked up to the door, walked right in and grabbed one of the last few tables available...while watching all the others in line across the street.  The cafe was clean, inviting and as some of the other reviewers say the coffee is damn good.  The food was simple & tasty and I really appreciated the plate was not overflowing with home fries like at other places.  These other places pour on the home fries, I can never eat it all and I always wonder (when there) how much food waste there really is as I see empty plates with leftover home fries being carted back to the kitchen.  Thoughts for the Universe I suppose.  Everyone was pleased with their meal and it was made much more enjoyable by being able to walk in, sit down and order right away and relax while the kids doodled in their books.  A great meal under $10 per person is a good reason to return!"}
{"text":"What's the best part of a Wednesday? Why, Breakfast Bagel Wednesday (BBW) of course! Note: This has nothing to do with Joshua Tree, rather, it's a Wendy invention.  Every now and again, I have a hankering for a breakfast bagel. I have a general rule that I only eat breakfast bagels on Wednesdays. So, when a Wednesday morning comes along and I get that funny feeling, some BBW magic usually comes together.  On this particular Wednesday, it came in the form of the bagel and Joshua Tree. I stopped in for a quick morning chat with AJ P, who suggested Joshua Tree as a nice little place on Edmonton Trail. I'm glad he did!   My bagel was served warm and slightly toasted (though it could've been a little more \"toasty\"). In between the two bagel halves was an egg, cheese, tomato and ham. It all fit within the edges of the bagel and it was a perfect morning treat.  Joshua Tree's a handy little spot for some breaky if you're on your way by. They advertise that there's free wi-fi, though I didn't have a chance to test that out this time round. There's plenty of room to walk right in, sit right down and baby, let your hair hang down."}
{"text":"I am a cafe mocha freak and the staff at JT make the best mocha.  I do enjoy Second Cup's as well, but I still think Joshua Tree has them beat.  I usually pass on the topping, but not here because they make it with chocolate whipped cream.  Hello!    They've reno'd the cafe in recent years, making it a pleasant place to sit.  It's all windows and I enjoy watching the traffic on Edmonton Trail."}
