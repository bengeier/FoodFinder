{"text":"Simply the best Jamaican food in town. You can't get better value for your dollars. I love the Jerk chicken plate, lots of food and so tasty!"}
{"text":"I love the food and Janet is so nice and always smiling. Her chicken is the best in the city well seasoned and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING food! Unbeatable price and taste. New fave!! Wish I would've met this experienced chef loooooong time ago.

I'm the happiest girl knowing I didn't judge this very small and local shop by the outside because I would have never discoverd this jamaican paradise :) 

Long live xx"}
