{"text":"Went to McGees chicken to check it out, now I know what a dive restaurant is. Very odd atmosphere had the Chicken and rib tips, chicken was good and the rib tips were bad ,hard to find anything edible on them. To be fair I will return and give them another shot and try the gyro's or gizzards."}
{"text":"First experience tonight. Kinda reminds me of corner soul food places in Minneapolis.  Little bit of a dive but it wasn't an issue for me. I had the catfish and fries. A nice simple meal that was real tasty. I came near closing time and they were out of many menu items. Next visits I'll call ahead and come earlier."}
{"text":"Indeed it's a dive. But everyone needs to eat at a dive now and then. Bare bones kinda place. They take credit cards, but charge you a buck if your order is under $10.  Friendly staff? Not Really. Hard nosed staff? Not really?  Large menu? Absolutely. Not the cleanest place? You got that right.  That being said I ordered the Breast and Wing meal with sides of Mac & Cheese, and Greens.  Best greens I've ever had, not that I consume them on a regular basis. Chicken was good, but not great. Cornbread was ok, as was the mac & cheese. Snapple and bottled soda at $1.00 is a great price.  Wouldn't be my first choice when I'm back in Madison, but you could do worse. I like to support local businesses."}
{"text":"This place is my husband and my favorite for fried chicken! We randomly found it last year, and we won't go anywhere else now. The breading is delicious! The fries are scrumptious, and the cornbread is fabulous. It's not too far from our house, so I love sending my husband out to get some McGee's Chicken last minute when I don't feel like cooking. Highly recommend, your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food. If you love greasy Chicago food, this is the place to go. Being from the Chicago area, I'm so glad Madison has a place like this! Reasonable prices, great variety on the menu, and portion sizes are filling. The gizzards and wings were phenomenal. The batter was flaky and delicious, and the fries and bread compliment it well. I've also tried the Italian beef, which is very flavorful. My only quibble with this place is the restaurant cleanliness. The floor and tables are gross, but I think it's a part of the McGee's experience. I would suggest to go in at a non-peak time; I went in on a Monday at 4 pm and I waited no longer than 10 minutes. If you're looking for great food and great prices, McGees is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Not worth your time or money. The chicken was overcooked. The cornbread was awful. The restaurant is absolutely filthy!!! I should have trusted my gut and walked out as soon as I saw how dirty the entire place was. The candied yams were good though."}
{"text":"I have tried some more things.  First of all, McGee's has an excellent double cheeseburger.  $5, includes fries, and I'd pick it over, say, a Culver's burger.  Probably over Five Guys too given the price difference.  My only complaint is that they were out of bacon.  They have a special with 1 sliders for $3.  I tried to get these on three separate occasions and they were always out.  The gyro is also great.  It's easily as good as a gyro anywhere else in Madison, and like the burger, is cheaper and includes fries.  In all my years of eating Chicago food I had yet to try a Pizza Puff.  I figured, why do I need a restaurant hot pocket?  For $3 with fries I decided to try it.  It is exactly what I assumed-- a restaurant version of a hot pocket.  Kind of like a small calzone.  They also have a \"gyro pizza puff\" and I'm kind of scared to try it but I'm going to.  I've heard multiple people including McGee himself rave about the Philly Cheesesteak.  I was underwhelmed.  The meat seemed too thinly sliced and it wasnt cheesy enough.  Granted, it was cold by the time I got to eat it (bought food and then drove somewhere) so perhaps I'll give it another shot.  Last thing I tried was the pork chop sandwich.  Flavor was very good, but if you're going to have a bone in pork chop in a sandwich (which is common in the south) the chop needs to be big enough that the bone is outside the bun or bread.  The downside that everything comes with fries is that the fries do NOT last long and if you dont eat them first, you'll end up throwing them away.  And make sure you get mild sauce on your fries."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in around 4ish and order food.  The Lamb Gyro and Chicken Sandwich were both very good.  I think next time I will call ahead and pick up the order.  It was a little to long to sit and wait.  (25 minutes)  But everything was tasty and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Always looking for hidden gems, so decided to try this place out. Ordered a 3 wing meal. The woman asked how we wanted the wings, but there were no options on the menu and she didn't list any, so we had to ask what the options even were. The place was not busy, and after waiting 30 minutes we walked up to the register to check on our order. A woman said \"wings will take 20 minutes, as you were told when you ordered.\" There were two problems with this: 1. Nobody told us this and 2. It had already been THIRTY minutes! Overall our experience took about 40 minutes. We were ignored the whole time we waited and not received well when we asked a question. The food was decent, but not at all worth the wait. Wanted a quick late night snack and we were very disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband was craving some chicken as we were driving through Madison at about 7:15 on a Friday night. He found McGee's on Yelp and thought we'd give it a try as it was just off the freeway. There were a couple people waiting for to-go orders (I would guess that is most of what they do as there's only a few tables inside).   They have a crazy-huge menu, including Italian Beef & sausage sandwiches, fish, Philly steak sandwiches, pizza puffs, gyros, hot dogs, BBQ, and, of course, chicken. You can even get a 100-piece chicken for about $100!  We were greeted immediately and they took our order. I got a 5-piece chicken strips and my husband wanted gizzards, so he got a small order. Both came with crinkle fries & 2 pieces of white sandwich bread.    I'd have like a biscuit or some of their famous cornbread, instead of the sandwich bread.   After about a 10-12 minute wait, our order was ready. Strips, gizzards and fries were all hot & freshly made. Strips & gizzards were both crispy and seasoned well. The small order of gizzards was huge! The fries were tasty, but weren't very crispy, and could have used a shake or 2 of salt.   They didn't offer up any sauces to go with the strips or gizzards, but they didn't really need any. Our carry-out order also included plenty of good-quality napkins.   Overall, a good tasty spot."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings in town!!!!!! I have ordered many times and it's great every time! Yes you have to wait for your food to cook but it's made fresh!!! If you can't wait for fresh food go to some BS fast food joint!"}
{"text":"Yum, catfish. I hadn't had catfish until here. Nice thin layer of breading. Counter staff was quite nice. Its the kind of place where people who know each other or the staff holla back and forth. One of the cooks came out to sit down in the dining area and chill. Yep, it feels divey and could use some attention to general cleanliness and outdoor upkeep. But that was a hella cheap, yummy sandwich. The fries are nice if they're fresh, otherwise they remind me of frozen Ore-Idas from the high school cafeteria. But the sandwich filled me up so no worries."}
{"text":"I've been to McGees a couple times. Both times, there were both positives and negatives, but the positives overwhelmingly outweigh the negatives.   Positives:  - Diverse menu with a variety of options: From ribs and fried chicken, to catfish and gizzards, to hamburgers and gyros. Seriously, it takes me a solid 5 minutes to peruse the menu and narrow down my choices.   - Very affordable. Seriously, you can very easily walk out of there with a ton of food and spend less than $10.  - The food is, generally, very good. Between what I had and what my friends had, the reviews were very positive for a vast majority of the things that were ordered. The rib tips, mushrooms, and fried chicken were the most raved about.   - The people who work there are very nice.   Negatives:  - The chicken tenders I ordered once were overcooked.  - The wait times for getting your meals, especially when it's busy, can be long. I think I waited about 15 minutes. That's pretty long for a fast food spot.   Those negatives aside, though, I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hard pass.   We ordered a variety of food: rib tips, chicken wings, fish fillet, French fries, and chicken gizzards. The gizzards were the best thing but even so, the breading was too thick and crunchy in some parts. Everything else was extremely salty.   The customer service is horrible. I actually heard an employee yell/loudly berate a customer for leaning on the counter. He simply had his hands sitting on the countertop. Poor guy!   And we sat in darkness for 20+ minutes while we waited for our food. As we walked out, I saw another customer turn on the lights. What kind of business lets its customers sit in the dark? They have multiple signs that say \"We appreciate your business,\" but I definitely didn't feel that way. Firmly will not be returning."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant for home cooking. The fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, greens, and yams are very good! Great prices on a burger and fry meal (about $3.50 for a huge burger and fries!!!)! The only drawbacks are the wait time for the food, there is sometimes a lack of seasoning (specifically salt) in the food, and the appearance of the restaurant. But overall, it is a great place to stop in to get a tasty bite to eat! Thumbs up! :)"}
{"text":"Went in last Friday. Yes there's a wait, but as the only non-chain fried chicken carry out in the area why would you expect anything less on a Friday night? 30 minute wait.  Yes it's loud. Mcgees functions as a carry out place masquerading as a dine in establishment with carry out options. It's a carry out joint. Everyone is friendly and the prices are ok (why no chicken buckets?).  The reason for the low rating is straight up the food. Batter is nothing special and everything was dried out-not quite as bad as chicken jerky but not far from it. This is not comparable to (Chicago-based) Harold's or even close to Evanston Chicken Shack and it's not worth coming back for. Maybe if you've gone years without decent fried chicken and nothing but KFC and Popeyes you might like it-but if you know or like good fried chicken you won't want this."}
