{"text":"The lunch special here is UNBELIEVABLE. A choice of three full sized savoury crepe (galette) and beverage and a choice of chocolate, sugar or salted dessert crepe for $15. Wow! I had the sausage galette with caramelized onions (comes with spring greens salad) a Perrier and a caramel crepe. Delish. Best lunch deal on the red mile!"}
{"text":"This Breton creperie just opened a couple of days ago (today is Friday, 23 March 2018). It's in a space that had been the Canadian Bagel and Sal's Flatbreads among other things. It is unrecognizable in its current form; it's clean and tables are well-placed. The kitchen is completely exposed and customers can see everything happening there and in the attached bar. It's very pretty.   I had the lunch special, which comprises a choice among three crepes (I chose the \"complete,\" which has egg, ham and gruyere, a soft drink (I got half OJ and half Perrier), and for dessert a cake called a far Breton which is a very dense egg milk and flour delicacy that has a prune puree inside.  It was all delicious. Really, really delicious. The crepe was perfection, beautifully presented and delectable; the crepe is a Breton buckwheat version with great body and the fillings are ample. Dessert was also stunning but I did urge them to get smaller plates, because the slice of cake was overwhelmed by the huge plate and they chose to squirt chocolate sauce all over the space around it. That's not traditional and it didn't taste good, but I ate around the chocolate and LOVED the cake."}
