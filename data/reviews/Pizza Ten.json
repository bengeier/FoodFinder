{"text":"This is actually such a good place to get pizza. It's really cheap & extremely underrated. The only downside is if you're waiting inside the place for your pizza, or dining in, there is no air conditioning & no wifi. I love everything about it except for that."}
{"text":"Whatever the delivery time that your quoted make sure you double it, and be cold when it arrives. It seems every time we ordered from here, things get a little worse. It's a shame because I was so happy with the first order. I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I came in here recently for a quick slice of pizza.  I didn't know what to expect, but I figured that even bad pizza is usually still not so bad.  At around 12:45pm, the remaining pizzas on offer for slices were looking pretty sad, as though they had already been sitting there for hours.  I'd gone far enough to walk in, so I picked one anyway.  It was... not what I'd hoped for.  It had a crust, and sauce, and cheese, and pepperoni... but I feel it may be overly generous to call it pizza."}
{"text":"Located in a nice busy food plaza of heartland, I have order the pizzas for pick up and its a quick in and out location.

The pizzas are decent with the right amount of toppings.

P.S. They do serve halal toppings."}
{"text":"I've always ordered online but ordering from Pizza 10 was the worst experience of my life! Firstly they quoted 1hr but the food arrived in 2 hrs and was very very cold! Then I asked for one burger with just cheese (for me) and the other with mustard and mayo (for my sister) only for me to receive both with mayo. I called up the guy that took my order and he started screaming at me that he gave me what I ordered. I asked to speak to the manager and he said he was the manager which I don't believe because a manager can never be that unprofessional!  I hung up feeling very dehumanised. Avoid this place like a plague!"}
{"text":"good halal pizza. but the owner (chef) likes to count the number of each topping. say if you order a chicken or beef pizza the quantity is very less.

would recommend to others as pizza itself is good and halal."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium pizza with halal beef pepperoni, red onions and jalapeños. The cheese was exquisite, the onions and jalapeños fresh. The pepperoni was delicious. With the pizza I ordered 18 wings with honey garlic sauce. The sauce was beautiful and the wings were perfectly cooked. The owner was very good with customer service as well. I will definitely make this my to go place for excellent pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here per signs on the Restaurant and Menu. Made the mistake of trying the burgers (new item) from here instead of the pizza.  The beef and chicken burgers were bland and stale.  Looks like they use frozen patties (Al Safa or something similar) instead of making it fresh.  Luckily I did order some Honey Garlic Chicken Wings on the side and those were pretty good.  I hope their pizza is better than their burgers!"}
{"text":"ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 large peperoni pizza, everything was yummy, prices were nominal. nice clean place majority of their business is either pickup or delivery."}
{"text":"Worst place for picking up pizza in Ramadan. I placed an order yesterday at 6pm telling them to make it ready by 8.30pm. When I reached there at 8.15, there were people there complaining and most cancelling their orders. The guy at the counter told me 5min and the pizza will be done. I waited 20mins and it was almost iftar time when I asked one of the guys again and surprisingly he had a blank face and said another 8 mins. I lost it by that time and told them to pay me back. There were three ppl working and the management was the worse I have ever seen. Why keep taking orders when u can't make one damn pizza on time. Never going back there again. I ended up getting popeys and breaking my fast on the way."}
{"text":"Pizza Ten is a HALAL restaurant, offering pizza, chicken wings, fries, and more. Five of us hungry people stopped in here on a Saturday around 4:30. The place isn't snobby, so be prepared for a relaxed eating atmosphere. We got a really good deal and all of us were happy and full with our total coming out to around $34. 

The lady taking our order was pleasant enough, and they had red pepper and other spices available to top our pizza with. 

The pepperoni was just OK, not as crispy as I would have preferred. And olives and mushrooms were just olives and mushrooms. The wings (which we got with BBQ sauce) were fantastic, and the fries were crisp and hot. 

Overall, this is a nice, cozy place to eat."}
{"text":"Terrible. Just terrible. Horrible service and mediocre food. You're better off ordering from Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"I guess if you are looking for a halal pizza with a Pakistani twist, it ain't bad. Then again, there aren't many halal pizza options near heartland anyway. 
We had a guest who only eats halal, so we gave this place a shot
Prices are very reasonable, I got two large pizzas with 3 toppings for $20. That's a good deal. Plus they don't charge extra for the dipping sauce."}
