{"text":"The ambience is great here. Make sure you sit outside overlooking the hills of North Scottsdale. The food is average, but not bad."}
{"text":"Great nachos! They are huge and the best I have ever had.  Fish tacos also awesome. Service was great."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend and LOVED it! The environment here is great for a date night. Our server, Melissa, was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu! She recommended their house tequila and it was bomb!"}
{"text":"We found glass on the lemons that were brought for our water. That's bad enough, but when I pointed it out to the manager he just told me that they threw the lemon slices away. No compensation...no offer for dessert. Nothing else! Glass??? The food was so-so and overpriced, no rice or beans with the fajitas, chips and salsa are extra... Who's ever heard of that with Mexican restaurant? I think they just take advantage of people that come to the Boulders or are in the area vacationing. I would look elsewhere for Mexican restaurant!  (I thought the waitress was nice, however.)"}
{"text":"We just moved here and had a family-from out of town- dinner here.  We are searching and trying to find some favorite restaurants.  Spotted Donkey is a great space, open and well decorated.  They sat us at an uncomfortable table for 5, but I think there are no good tables for 5.    The waiter started to ask about drinks and responded to an innocent question about types of tequila with a 7 minute monologue about the special tequilas they buy and how awesome the margaritas are.  It was 7 minutes more about tequila than I really wanted to know.  Especially since the margaritas ended up being inconsistent from one drink to the next.  Other than the tequila rant, the service was outstanding.   We started with an order of guacamole.  And they really did charge $11 for a small scoop of guacamole and  $7 for chips and salsa.  At that point I'm not sure I cared that they were good.  I ordered the squash quesadillas.  The veggies were crisp and it was tasty.  I enjoyed them.  But other folks didn't care for the mole, or the enchiladas."}
{"text":"I wouldn't by any means necessarily call this authentic Mexican food, it is very American style driven, but in saying that the food was delicious and prepared well. I will be returning, but not because I feel like having real Mexican food. (I have had a lot of authentic Mexican food)"}
{"text":"On September 6, 2014, a friend and I faced one of the worst meals of our lives.  The seafood enchiladas were soggy mushed fish in soggier tortillas, and they were repulsive.  Imagine putting canned tuna through a blender, and that's what our food looked like.  I counted only 2 whole shrimp, and I never saw a sign of crabmeat.  Don't waste your money and your time at SDC.  Far better food is available at a Rubio's that serves tasty fish tacos and other fish treats.  You'll pay far less at Rubio's, and you'll enjoy well-prepared food."}
{"text":"Spotted by two weekends ago to get lunch while in the area.   Was pleasantly surprised with the Nachos, not the typical Nachos, almost like a Chilaquile.  They were great!   The shimp appetizer looked fantastic.   The drinks were good!    Will reserve the 5 star for when we can make it to dinner there since we live in Ahwatukee.  Definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Food quality is not what it use to be, we had nachos and the stew. Been going here every Jan for 5 years, don't know if we will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! I love nachos and this was the first time I've had the pulled pork variety and it was plentiful and delicious. After salting the guac, it was great--fresh, rich, creamy and very flavorful. I had the carne asade, which was very well-seasoned and my fiance had the enchiladas. We left full and satisfied, having eaten way too many nachos and guacamole. If I'm ever in that forsaken part of AZ, I'd be down for making a pit stop at this spot."}
{"text":"Came here with a big work group. The Spotted Donkey offers solid Tex-Mex that seems more Tex than Mex in a great casual setting. Can't beat the location if you're staying at the Boulders.   Portions here are humungous and I could barely make a dent in my entree after some appetizer rounds.   I tried: - ceviche: well done, perfect mix of saltiness and not too much 'filler' veggies - jalapeño poppers - breaking was a little burnt. I liked the presentation in a shot glass and the fact that fresh jalapeño was used - tacos - I got the chicken tacos because it was one of the few items not fried and/or smothered in cheese. This was a solid choice, but I didn't like that it was dark meat vs chicken breast  Drinks and service were a highlight. Special props for making me a Paloma (like a margarita but better) without my having to explain the ingredients."}
{"text":"Friends recommended this restaurant and now we do to. The waitstaff was friendly and efficient and the food was excellent. The atmosphere was a little sterile, but we came for the food.   I had a honey glazed salmon fillet on a tostada that was excellent and my wife really enjoyed her pork tenderloin on a bed of Mac and cheese.   The only con were the drinks. My iced tea was no better than the Lipton sun tea I make at home in a mason jar. My wife had a margarita which she thought was delicious, but when I got the bill her 8 oz drink cost $16. My salmon was only $17.   Overall though, a very good meal."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and the nachos are really good.  Outside patio is great in the summer."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time.  Get the salsa trio and chips - positively delicious!  Definitely try the double barrel spotted donkey tequila - ultra smooth and flavorful - just wish we could have bought a bottle!"}
{"text":"The most amazing calamari I have ever had in my life! You've never had calamari like this! They use a different part of octopus then everywhere else. Its so moist! Omg! Also got the huevo rolls, very good too!  The naranja margarita was the most delicious drink I've ever had, be careful, I could easily have one too many of these! You can barely taste the tequila, but even with my high tolerance, felt it after one. Every one here was super friendly and the manager, or guy that sat us was pretty charming and cute! Don't sleep on this place!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, but on the expensive side for mexican food. No free chips and salsa??...not used to that coming from Texas. Tacos were great, perfect portion size, chicken was better than the beef, which was a little tough. Overall, good and I would go back."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed!  Went during restaurant week and assumed this is when you put your best foot forward to attract new guests...Not!  Service was lack luster- and the food- I don't know where to begin...perhaps at the end with the ice cream that tasted like the freezer.  My pork had so much sauce on it I couldn't taste the meat and 2 of the 3 salsas served with our chips was so watery - one of them (it was green and watery) was sweet???"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is great here!!  Jalapeno shooters are great! enchalitas also a fav!  Miss the Ben and Jerry's downstairs!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came up from Tucson for a quick getaway and were pleasantly surprised by the yummy food at this cozy restaurant. We shared a veggie quesadilla appetizer that was big enough for a meal, and the pintos tacos- 2 beef and 2 pork. The beef barbacoa was moist and flavorful. Next time I would get all beef. I even liked the rice, and usually only like Villa in Tucson's. The beans were very good too. The only reason for the 4 star, instead of 5 is that you pay for chips and salsa if you want them. I am just used to them coming with the meal in Tucson. Our server was super attentive and honest about the choices, which we appreciated!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. My husband's family was visiting from out of state and we decided on The Spotted Donkey for dinner. We approached the hostess stand and asked for a table for four. The hostess asked if we had reservations and my husband said no, and then asked if we needed them to be seated. She laughed in his face and replied, \"Well it would certainly help!\" We turned around and walked out, deciding to eat at Cartwright's instead."}
{"text":"I have finally found a mexican/southwestern restaurant that lives up to the fact that it\"s IN the southwest! Seriously, iI've had better mexican food in Chicago than most places in Scottsdale/Phoenix! I am happy to report that this place really satisfied an intense mexican craving.  The guacomole is an absolute must order. It seems a little pricey, but it is a very large order (4 hungry girls and 2 baskets of chips didn't finish it) and the chips are bottomless.  Skip the queso, it was too thin and not spicy enough for my taste. I would definitely recommend the chimichangas   Beautiful presentation, crispy, just the right amount of spice, and tender chicken.  While the mexican beer braised enchiladas were good, they didn't live up to their name. I couldn't taste any beer flavor, and the meat could have been a little more tender. My friends reported the shrimp and chicken tacos were both good, but their favorite part was the beans served on the side. Its like a mexican style baked bean...fantastic! It was a quiet night at the restaraunt, which was the lone drawback as I like a place full of people. Although it was nice to be seated immediately and be able to hear your friends without shouting! I will definitely make it a point to return when the weather is nicer to take advantage of their patio, it looked very inviting. All in all, I would definitely give a high recommendation to try this place out. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"very good service. the bar is fun to hang out at. one of the bartenders is a wildfire fighter. he has some very wild stories to tell a great place. P.S. great food too. yum."}
{"text":"I am a fan of mexican food and this place has some good chow downs.  I like when restaurants give you so much food that you can go home and enjoy the food later.  This place offers that.  The service was great and the cheese caso with tortilla chips was amazing.  The food was pretty good as well. I had chicken enchiladas and an awesome margarita that was purple.   Good for groups of 2-6  It's a great place for people you have out of town guests in and live in the area or a fun spot for a nice evening out on a date.  I came from tempe so the drive was a shlep but I was not disappointed by the food and the company.    Recommendation: To anyone who enjoys mexican food as much as I do,  make sure you pack an extra stomach when going, and don't plan on doing anything after-words except lying on the couch"}
{"text":"I was truly disappointed with the food between is having two  entrées, both had no real flavor other than weird with horrible after-taster. Needless to say we will not back. And to charge for chips and salsa which is normally fee at most Mexican restaurants"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Food was delicious and customer service was even better. They assisted me in planning a get together for 30 people on less than 2 days notice.  Everything was set up beautifully and the food was hot and ready for us when we arrived. Everyone complimented the venue as well as the food and drinks. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Best guacamole I've ever had. Ever.  Pumpkin seed salad was amazing and deserves a 5.  House salad was also very good, but compared to the pumpkin seed one, it should get only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Fun place to get nice Mexican and Southwestern style food.  The excellent margaritas are a nice complement to the food!"}
{"text":"So I had lunch here today. I guess I was not disappointed, but at the same time it was not overly memorable. I just cant get my head around going to a mexican restaurant and paying for chips and salsa.... I also dont like colored chips.... Call me traditional.... I had the pork tacos.... average.... I dont know, the place is not terrible in my opinion, but there are too many good restaurants around here to spend $25 a head to eat average tacos and chips and salsa....."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! I do not know how this place stays in business... Bland! No flavor at all and over priced! I'm from Houston so my Mexican food standards are high.  I will NEVER come back to this place :("}
{"text":"The restaurant was curiously empty when we went at 7:00 on a Sunday night.  When we got our food I knew why!  The special, pulled pork and green chilli stew was greasy and had more potatoes than either pork or green chillis.  The enchiladas were marginally edible.   The final insult was when we were charged 7.50 for chips and salsas .  The chips were good, the only good thing about this meal.  This used to be a great restaurant but obviously something has changed.  Take a pass on this one."}
{"text":"First time here. Pumpkin porter was good and holy shit. Donkey nachos. Amazing. When I cone back will be back here again"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants in the city; not even worthy of 1 star.  The rice is instant and made from a box.  The tortillas are store bought and the fish in the tacos are comparable to the fish from a box at Fry's.  It's a complete shame that a resort like the Boulders would associate their name with such a terrible restaurant. I've had better Mexican food on a food truck!"}
{"text":"(Review for the Scottsdale Road location)  The Spotted Donkey is a semi-upscale Mexican restaurant with absolutely delicious food and great-tasting drinks (especially the signature margaritas). I really like the atmostphere and decor -- you can go in jeans or make it a lovely date night.   The only thing that's holding me back from four stars is the price. I'll admit - I'm a bit of a cheapskate, so the prices might not bother you as much. But here's an example of something I find a bit over the top. They offer a delicious tableside chopped salad for lunch. However, it comes with bacon. Want to add chicken or shrimp (hey, even offer to substitute for the bacon if I'm feeling especially diet-conscious?) -- the salad now becomes nearly $15. For a salad. For lunch.  Again, I know this is Scottsdale and the Spotted Donkey is a bit more upscale than, say, Zipps around the corner. So, definitely go there. (I have paid for this expensive salad more than once, and I probably will again.) Just be prepared to spend a bit more than your average lunch/dinner/happy hour."}
{"text":"As a proud Mexican man I hope they build the wall quickly, to stop Americans calling this Mexican food. We waited over 1 hr for our food to arrive and what was served was greasy fajitas that featured an anorexic chicken, 1 pound of uncooked peppers and kid size tortillas. I don't mind waiting for things I love, like cock fights and running water, but I would not wait 1 minute for this slop."}
{"text":"On the drive up to the Spotted Donkey, I asked my friend who was driving \"So is this place in Flagstaff or what?\". As we joked about how distant this restaurant is from our far far away land (Tempe), my stomach started to grumble. You see, I didn't eat anything that day, and my friend assured me that I would be rewarded by the amazing food at the Spotted Donkey. I took his word for it, and off we went... Though, If we didn't make it to Spotted Donkey soon, I was going to stop at the In n Out at Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101. Luckily he assured me it wouldn't be much longer, and we made it before my stomach rebelled against me.  It was a beautiful evening out, and the weather was perfect, so naturally we wanted to eat outside. As I combed over the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted. I was going to start with the Guacamole ($10.50), and for my entree I would get the Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($12.50 - appropriate name, you'll see shortly enough).   The guacamole was some of the most tasty and fresh I have ever eaten. The mixed basket of yellow and blue corn tortilla chips complimented the guacamole immensely. The only thing missing from this great dish was the kick I am used to. I asked our server for a side of chopped jalapenos, which once mixed in to our guacamole, transformed this dish from great to sheer awesome.   I was hit with the unfortunate truth that it may be hard to top such an amazing appetizer. I only ordered a hamburger from a menu with many specialties on it. Though I was shocked again, the burger that I received was one of the tastiest I have had in Arizona in a long time. I was told by my friend that the chefs here vary on the burger cooking temperature, so I made sure to describe exactly how I wanted my burger cooked, so we went with medium +. To continue with that night's spice theme, I asked for a side of green chiles to put on my burger, which turned out to be another great choice. The burger comes with a mountain of fresh cut fries filled to the brink in a basket. These are also delicious.   While I hear they have fantastic desserts, I was beyond stuffed, and could not even consider looking at a dessert menu.  The Spotted Donkey receives an easy 5 stars in regards to our food. The only rating that they lose on is the service. The two times I have been here, the waiters have lacked personality, have been spotty at best, and seemed to have a bit of a smug attitude. I realize I am a college age student, but my money is just as green as anyone else there.   I am looking forward to my next trip up!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the beer braised beef enchiladas with red and green chili. I get it almost every time.  The pork stew is really good and my husband really enjoyed the chili relleno. Great mexican food and a wonderful patio, lots of umbrellas."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and loved it every time.  We ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer and were glad we did.  Great chips and the tomatillo/avocado salsa was perfect.  I also really enjoyed the bean dip.  I have ordered both the shrimp and tilapia tostadas and the Chicken Rojo and would highly recommend either.  Service was the right  combination of friendly and efficient and they played good music, old time-y style country (don't worry, for those of you not into country, it wasn't too loud.)  Nice lighting, nice atmosphere.  We think we're pretty lucky to have a place like the Spotted Donkey Cantina in our neighborhood.  Stop by and you will see why.      PS: They have nice outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"The Spotted Donkey is a great restaurant.   The food is consistently good and the staff are always great. The donkey paintings through out the restaurant are a lot of fun. The only down side I see with the restaurant is the pricing. It's a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great presentation,  decent price and reasonable portion sizes.  Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Very helpful and nice staff  We started with the nachos with pulled pork (you might think its a bit pricey for nachos, but damn.... you get a lot of food... and its good.)  A friend ordered the Calamari... and even though I am allergic, I had to try a few pieces... it was alright...........she said she had ordered it in the past and since then she says they changed the breading and they don't deep fry it anymore. Thus it is not as good as it used to be. The smoked jalapeno dipping sauce was really good though.   The Pulled Beef Barbeque Sandwich and The Beef Enchiladas were a treat.... I really like this place. Nice location and decor also. Plus they have cute donkey pictures :)"}
{"text":"Great guacamole! Good margaritas. Had the shrimp fajitas which were great and my mom had the nachos. She's a bit if a connoisseur and really liked them. Service left a bit to be desired, but were we in the bar."}
{"text":"If you have ever had hatch green chili you know that it is by far the best green chili in the world.  This restaurant has multiple recipes that include some hatch.  I recommend the Mac and cheese or the enchiladas both were outstanding."}
{"text":"Here for dinner in April and had taken friends from east coast to lunch in February.  Never a problem with seating even when crowded.  Nice outdoor area. Everyone loved their food, but made traditional mexican choices.  Their guacamole is luscious and prickly pear margaritas very tasty.  Reliable favorite."}
{"text":"We live right down the road and frequent the place often. It's always been one of our favorites. We went and sat in the bar last week and received terrible service from the bartender. We sat at a table next to the bar. He took our order for drinks, we received our chips and then he took our meal order, all was good. I got the burger, (yes it's very good at a Mexican joint) and it was over cooked. My wife's meal was fine. It did get a bit busy and I understand that as I am in the restaurant business. If you're in the industry you know to not let customers water go empty! He finally came over and asked how everything was, as I began to tell him how my burger was he noticed that we had no drinks and interrupted me by walking off vs asking then listening. The manager on duty, can't remember her name, maybe Susan came over and asked how everything was. As I began to tell her how my burger was and that we had been waiting on drinks for a bit the bartender decided it was a good idea to confront me and say \"we got busy\". He and I were not having a conversation and the manger did notice his condescending and rude outburst and said she would report him. He then looked at her and said as he walked away \"I will let you handle this!\" Wow, extremely unprofessional. The manager apologized and was very sincere about everything. She did an amazing job making sure she could do whatever she could to please us. I commend her for that. She may be the only reason we come back but I doubt it. We have another spot we get great service at."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Boulders Resort for a weekend getaway and the resort staff suggest this restaurant. We started with the ceviche and the queso.  The ceviche was good but a little heavy on the cilantro. The queso came out way too hot to eat and separated as it cooled.   For the entree, we wanted to split the carne asada. I find it odd that the server ask me how we wanted it prepared. Now I am an AZ native and this is the first time I have ever been asked how I wanted my carne asada prepared. When it came out it was raw with little carne favor. Sent it back and the next plate was over cooked, chewy and not good.   Service was good but food left us going back the the resort for more beer to mask the bad food."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for the Margaritas. It was nice that our server was so knowledgable in Tequila that he opened our minds to try something new.  We ordered food and we definitely could have shared. The portions are worth every penny. We had such a great time we went back the next night."}
{"text":"Shockingly disappointed!  We went to SDC last night for dinner.  Good meal as usual until it came to the bill.  It would appear as though the Spotted Donkey now has a mandatory 20% gratuity for a party of 5 or more.  This came as a bit of a surprise even though we typically tip 18%-20% for their good service.  What was really surprising was that our \"party of 5\" consisted of 3 adults, a 4 year old and a 20 month old.  What was a satisfying meal of a sudden became marginal."}
{"text":"Love this place. They honored happy hour for my wife and I with our baby in the dining room. Something that Upper Crust on Cave Creek refused to do, that pizza place has horrible service. Spotted Donkey has super nice and pleasant people. The food is outstanding. Happy hour prices are amazing. Margaritas are superb. One of my favorite happy hours and Mexican restaurants. Try the happy hour taquitos."}
{"text":"I love to read reviews from everybody complaining about the drive to Carefree.    I feel your pain when I go to a Dbacks game  I live a couple miles down Carefree Highway but in 3 years had never stopped here at the Donkey ..but we went    Maybe you have heard the weather in AZ is glorious 9 months of the year and many restaurants have wonderful outdoor seating     So we cruised up the road thinking about dinner and at the bar we just had drinks and chips with the fundido.  Then we were full.  Next time we had drinks and an appetizer and we were full and left.    Everything tasty.   The  drinks were weak, but I like them strong enough to make me scared driving home.   Mac and cheese is tasty.  I'm going Wednesday for lunch.  I will try to get an entree.   Someone mentioned they didn't like the crowd.  This isn't old town Scottsdale. It is almost Carefree next to an expensive resort.   So no rap music or skanks.   Older folks with money! Worth a visit if you're in town.  If you're staying at the Boulders ask for doubles and stagger back to your room."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. If you're staying at the Boulders, this is a no brainier. The appetizers, entrees and desserts were all good. The server was on his A game for our party of 9."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Chef Doug and the bartender Jill were so nice. Food was great too. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the food here, especially for what I paid for it. I ordered the stuffed pepper (for lack of better term) that was supposed to have meat, rice, cheese along with a few other things. And all I got was a pepper stuffed with rice and a few scraps of meat. I was hoping they would redeem themselves with dessert. They said all their deserts fed two easily, and for 9 bucks I would hope so. So we ordered the fried icecream. And got a small scoop of fried icecream drowning in whipped cream. So basically paid $9 for whipped cream. Very disappointed and never going back or recommending this place to anyone ever."}
{"text":"Always have great food!  We started going to the Spotted Donkey 3 years ago and have never had a bad meal.  We make it our go to place when we have guests in town knowing they won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We first visited the Spotted Donkey three years ago and ate there twice while we were in town. Just last week we were back in Scottsdale and this was the first restaurant we went to. The food has always been good and it was last week as well not to mention I really like the prickly pear margarita so if you there you've got to try one!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here tonight. The silver coin margaritas were delicious, and strong. We had the chips with salsa trio, and one of the salsas seemed to be a ground beef and bean salsa, but was cold. It was good but the red salsa was excellent and the tomatillo was very good. Our server Lisa was prompt to come and greet, and get the drinks, and very helpful in our selections. We opted to share the cheese enchiladas with two sauces, red and green. Served hot, full of melted cheese and just the right amount of sauce, over rice. The guac on the side was delicious, I will get an order next time. The beans were smoky, hot temperature and just hands-down delicious. Overall a big portion so we were glad we split. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago with some family friends. Mind you, these family friends are from the Mid West and chose this place because they heard it had \"really great Mexican food\". Next time I let my Windy city friends pick out a \"Mexican food\" place in the Arizona I have called my home for over a decade, I will think again. So, here we go. I am from Scottsdale, so I pretty much knew where it was. I agree, it isn't very well signed, but when we got there, it as pretty busy. The decor is AMAZING. What a beautiful restaurant. I was tempted to swipe things off the walls they were so gorgeous. Our server was really sweet and fun and because we were a large party, we were sat in the center of the restaurant, right by the bar. We started with drinks, where the ladies had margaritas, which were good, but very small. I like my margaritas in a MARGARITA glass, not a high ball glass. They had an interesting mix of tequila, but they weren't the best, and definitely not the best bang for your buck, for sure. The chips and salsa and guacamole were okay, but very pricey! Most Mexican restaurants GIVE you chips and salsa, for free! And, we were 8 people and they brought us a little basket of chips, which to me, made no sense. My mom and I shared the fajitas for two as our entree. They serve the beef fajitas with beef tenderloin and sausage. My mom and I both thought that was weird, so we asked for no sausage, just the beef. When it came out, our fix-ens' were great, but no rice or beans or even cheese, which is usually served with fajitas. The tortillas were amazing however, and tasted hand made. The peppers were undercooked and there was like NO MEAT in the fajitas... like, none. Maybe, my mom and I had like 5 small pieces each. The fajitas for 2 are $29!!! I didn't make a stink because I didn't recommend the restaurant, and I wasn't paying, I was being taken out. But, in the end, I would never recommend this place to anyone. There are millions of amazing Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale, it isn't worth a trip. In my line of work, I recommend a lot of restaurants to out of towners, and this place will definetly not make the cut. I guess if you want pretty decor and a decent margarita with sub par food, then its your place, but not for me."}
{"text":"We were turned away and told they were booked and we need a reservation. They had at least 10 open tables and outside seating. Wouldn't even put us on a wait list."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood favorite. Even though chef, staff, and menu have changed, it's still a special restaurant. Waiters are all consistently good. Lisa was a star last night!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately just not very good. Not a terrible experience as the service was ok and busy place but food is marginal and price is on upper end for mex food. $11.95 for chips and guacamole... $8 for the house marg. $30 for fajitas for 2. That's all fine if it is good but sad to say most could make better mex food at home."}
{"text":"I had the Street Enchilladas and thought they were delicious and well prepared.  The food presentation was nice as well and lets you know someone cares about the food they are sending out of the kitchen.   Service was timely and our server was friendly.  Chips and salsa are normally included in most Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix, but we had to order them as a separate appitizer here.  That wasn't a huge surprise though considering the area of town."}
{"text":"Love love love their chopped salad with jalapeño dressing!! I've had it with shrimp and steak and it's amazing either way!! Work walking distance, called for pick and they had it ready with in 5 mins; which is another plus since I'm limited on my lunch hour! They also had my salad dressing and protein separated so the salad doesn't get soggy; major plus points! If u haven't already, you must check it out. Also try the jalapeño shooter the are bomb.com.  Lastly, Happy hour is fun! Sit at the bar area, chat with the bar tender, the people you come with or just watch the many TVs that are set up."}
{"text":"The cocktails are very expensive and they dont offer table side happy hour. The food was average as was the cocktails. Wont go back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a buddy from out of town.  Margaritas were outstanding.  Service was great and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our most favorite places.  We go there a lot and I am also a Concierge and I can't even begin to tell you how many people I send to them - NOT after today.  If folks want to go, of course I will book them but will NO longer recommend them.  Ordered drinks - I drink one with infused cinnamon infused tequila.  Today, I couldn't even taste the cinnamon.  When I nicely mentioned that maybe it wasn't the cinnamon tequila, the bartender (not Scott) could have cared less and said, that's it. Ok - so I drank it.  We ordered appetizer - he never came to check on us, to either ask how it was, remove the empty dish, ask if we wanted something else.  Another Server saw our empty drink glasses and went behind the bar and fixed us another one - nobody ever asked us if we wanted food - totally ignored.  So, we settled the bill and decided to go to a high top and have a regular Server take care of us.  We sat down, she brought us water and disappeared.  After close to 10 minutes waiting, we walked out.  The place wasn't crowded - there may have been 8-10 people there.    Anyway, I don't think they care but they have lost our business as a couple and anybody looking for a Mexican Restaurant venue - found another place, by chance, hands down better."}
{"text":"The Cantina Shooters were very good. Stuffed Jalapeno's with a cream sauce in a Shot Glass. Presentation was great. There were six of us on a Tuesday night - the place was hopping busy and everyone enjoyed their food and service from the Chili Rellenos, Cheese Enchiladas, Shrimp Tacos, Carne Asada. Some of us shared dishes - the portions are large. Also the Sopapillas with cinnamon Ice cream and whipped cream for dessert were great. Our server & hostess were very nice as we mentioned it was our first time here. Very lucky to live down the street - we will be back soon. Only negative was the wine and mixed drinks were pricey but the local draft beers are fairly priced. I imagine they have a nice happy hour and will check that out."}
{"text":"Nothing could be better than downing a margarita, moon-side on a warm night outside at the Spotted Donkey.   Prompt. Knowledgeable. Delicious.   I'm always hesitant eating at Mexican restaurants where the plates are strikingly beautiful and they've some how made sour cream look like an art form -- I never saw this in my travels throughout Mexico.   Anyway, the food was wickedly delicious. Spicy, flavorful and bold -- perfection combination on a plate. I'd definitely order the guac, ceviche and fajitas.   Even when it is 130 degrees, I'd probably still eat their hotness."}
{"text":"Such a shame. Had 9 of us. Two are chefs. All the food good flavor but way, way, over salted all the meals to the point we could not eat it. If they remove some of the salt we would come back ;-("}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times over the past month for happy hour and it's always been good. The bartenders are very friendly and funny and the food is fantastic. Jill and Tony have always been great. From \"there wasn't room for us so we broke the rules and sat somewhere else\" to \"happy hour is dumb,\" sounds like there are a lot of cheap, entitled people that try and eat there for happy hour. Ignore these fake foodies who write the bad reviews and go to The Spotted Donkey. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"So... the waitress was ok, That's why I even gave 2 stars.    I AM BEYOND disappointed.  It's restaurant week for goodness sake, aren't you supposed to be at your best?  Lets start with the wine list, really? the most swill wine ever.  I'm no wine connoisseur, but really the cheapest wine at a not so cheap price and even though I was willing to pay for good wine, NONE was offered.   The ceviche wasn't ceviche it was shrimp in cocktail sauce.... it tasted ok,  but Ceviche it was not!!!  Have your chef google it....   I had the pork tenderloin...mediocre at best and the mole sauce was horrible.  My friend had the Carne Asada (flank steak and granted a trick to tenderize)  She had one bite, very tough.  Moving on to dessert we were trying to have a good attitude. It was presented beautifully.  The Sopapillas were good and the whipped cream was again presented beautifully,    about the time I said \"the ice cream is freezer burned\" my friend said my ice cream ( on her Apple Tort) is freezer burned.  TIME to go.  Sorry you guys have to step it up."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but this experience really made it difficult to go back.  The food here is pretty good, the jalapeno pepper poppers are terrific.  The Spotted Donkey Salad with Salmon, which you have to ask for, is really above par.  BUT, they charge for chips and salsa, not normal in a mexican place.  Worst though was the way they took advantage tonight.  I went over for one drink at the bar, \"what kind of good Bourbon do you have?\", \"Blantons\", Great give me a Blantons neat, rocks on the side.   Got the drink, that's all I wanted so I asked for my check.  Holy S*(&&, seriously.  READY!  $23.00 for ONE DRINK!.   I can buy the bottle for a little over twice that.   It's too late once you've ordered so I felt like I was had by the short hairs but it really makes it hard to go back for any of the other things.  I used to have lunch here with my wife fairly regularly, I'll suggest Venues or Legend Trail or any of a number of other options before I'll go back after getting taken advantage of with prices like that."}
{"text":"Ok, I am giving this place 4 stars based on the habanero margarita alone! It was amazing! Normally I have to instruct the bartender but they already had their own recipe. The habanero is infused in the tequila on-site. Great job! My husband and I ordered the queso dip on happy hour. Unfortunately we also had to order ground beef to add to the dip. I must say the staff was very accommodating! We sat at the bar. Overall we enjoyed the experience and are likely to visit again."}
{"text":"If your looking for something different. This is it. Great food. Great service. Ask for Kelly. She is a doll!! She was awesome. I am all about service and she was on point. This is a very chill place. Relaxing to bring the kids and enjoy the patio and views. Not bad. We live local and this was the first time we have been in!  We will be back.  Now the only downfall is the do not offer complimentary chips and salsa? Kinda crazy for being a Mexican food place. That was the only turn off. But it is what it is"}
{"text":"I love this place for Happy Hour, BUT, do not go at 5pm!  We went in on Fri at 4:50 & All 6 little pub tables around the bar were taken.  There were 3 of us & the hostess wanted us to sit at the bar.  How can 3 people sitting at a bar share an appetizer, let alone have a nice conversation? They would not allow us to sit at a table & still get the Happy Hour discount.  Very Disappointed, as this place is now owned by the Boulder Resort & we would expect better serivce. Not to mention, that we Aways order dinner too!  If they are going to be this crowded during their Happy Hour, why don't they add more pub tables?  Very unfair and turned us away :("}
{"text":"Close walk if you're staying at The Boulders Resort!   I got the salmon tostadas (slightly fishy) and my lunch date got the beef enchiladas. For the convenience, it was a decent place to dine al fresco. Our host/the owner(?) was super friendly.    Much like Dan G's review-- Spotted Donkey offers the usual Mex-American fare. Our food was predictable but dependable."}
{"text":"service was on point and the food was even better, try the special tequila straight from Mexico"}
{"text":"I am mixed about my review for here. We got there, and I made the reservation via Open Table. It was one of 2 reservation times left, so I felt like the restaurant was going to be packed. It wasn't. The inside was basically vacant, but I will say that the patio was packed. So we sat down, and it took about 10 minutes for the waiter to come over to us. Then it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks and guac/salsa brought to our table. The chips and guacamole were delicious, so there is no complaints about that. Then it took about another 10 minutes after that for our food to come out (our waiter kept vanishing and never stopping by). Once our food came out though, it was soooooo good. I got 2 shrimp tacos, which I can't find the name of now on the online menu, they were phenomenal. I highly recommend. And the side of rice that came with them was so light and fluffy. Absolutely delicious. So that is why I am so torn .. the food was amazing but the service was absolutely horrible. Oh, and the margarita was not good. It was premade in a machine and not mixed well at all.   Also, it was really hard to find. We were in Scottsdale for the week, and it was dark by the time we went to dinner. There was absolutely no signage for the restaurant on the main road, and we drove around for about 10 minutes and were about to give up when we finally found it tucked away in the corner of some business complex. No signs on the road, nothing. So that is another reason I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. It was packed, Cinco de Mayo. But the Hostess found us a table for 2. Great Mahi Baja Tacos. John our waiter was so real, gave us great recommendations on what to get. Also great timing for everything. We heard an owl on the way to our car, then spotted it on tall tower in the dark before it flew off."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!  I would ride a donkey all the way from my place in Phoenix to eat the Donkey Nachos."}
{"text":"Gorgeous views, impossible to not like. The cute pictures on the walls of the donkeys are fun.  Try the prickly pear margarita!"}
{"text":"I felt my dinner was yummy; I ordered the chicken and pork enchiladas with rice and beans.  Chips and salsa are extra, not complimentary like most places.   They do give you 3 types of salsa to try.  The margarita was good, just the portion was too small.  The view is amazing outside (on the second floor) and inside is clean and pleasing. Service was average.  The location is hard to find in a desolate shopping area next to the Boulders.  The restaurant is on the second floor.  Be prepared to pay $$$ it's pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Nachos are the best,  also, tacos are imaginative.  Highly recommend. Second story on the El Pedregal shopping center, outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"I will return.  Hard to see from the road but really good!  The bowl of guacamole for app. was way over priced.  That is the only complaint.  We had the quesadilla app. large enough to share for a meal which we did.  The 4 taco platter is well worth it and 2 meals in one.  The restaurant is large, patio a bit small but has heat lamps.  TVs for sports and a large bar.  Pico is amazing!  We will return.  Friendly service too.  I also forgot we had fried ice cream for dessert so save room!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a great find.  The stuffed peppers I had were awesome and NOT breaded.  They really take their tequila seriously. The Naranja Margarita was so good we asked for the recipe.  The bartender came out and told us everything from how they infuse their tequila to how they make their Margarita mix.  Our server was very knowledgable about all aspects of the menu.  Will be back very soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend there Friday Night.   The food was great and the ambiance on the patio was awesome. It's a really great place and I loved the atmosphere.  However, the service was pretty bad.  While the busboy was refilling water to the table next to us, his butt hit my girlfriends wine glass and knocked it over and literally drenched her pants, our seat, and our table was floating.   I don't think the guy even really acknowledge what happened, he grabbed is a couple napkins for us and walked away. We cleaned up the whole thing ourselves with the help of some of the other patrons.    Our waiter came back a few minutes later and seemed unaware of the situation at all or that it was the busboys fault, I think he thought we spilled it ourselves.. yes he brought us another glass of wine and that's fine.  But it would have been nice if they would have acknowledged it and tried a little harder to help fix it.   I wasn't going to make a scene so we just finished our meal, paid, and left. But it would have been nice for them to acknowledge what happened and try to help a little.. at least it was white wine.."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a long, lazy lunch or a cozy dinner.  The restaurant has such gorgeous, inviting decor and a nice patio too.  The staff members are exceptionally friendly and competent.  And most importantly, the food and drinks are excellent in terms of taste, presentation, and variety.  Everything is very reasonably priced considering the high quality.  I believe it's one of the best restaurants in the valley.  p.s.  Although there's no gluten-free menu (yet?), they do an above-average job of accommodating my gluten-free diet."}
{"text":"Have been a regular for many years, but this place has been going down hill the last year both in food and service. Overpriced and average at best. The portions are about 1/3 of what they used to be but prices are the same!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment pretty much I will be around  1st off the hostess at some attitude not sure what her problem was set me in a really uncomfortable booth ask if she can move me to a different table she told me  No even though the places pretty empty so I got a chair moved to the  End of the table now for the food chips   Salsa Very bland very watery the green tasted like burnt  Plastic  guacamole Had 0  Flavor  Tasted like something you get from Subway I  Ordered the chimi changa  I like the meat that was in it   was nice and tender the red and green sauce was not good the red tasted burnt the green was ok but to greasy our server was friendly but  Wasn't very  Attentive probly will never go back"}
{"text":"Our hosts for the weekend took us here for lunch and I'm so glad they did. GREAT food!  We were all starving so before our hostess could seat our party of 4, we had two orders of chips and guacamole and a round of top shelf margaritas ordered. The drinks were delivered right away and the chips and guacamole shortly followed. Chips and guacamole hit the spot and so did the margarita!  We all ended up ordering the same item; chicken enchiladas that came with spanish rice and black beans.  A pretty standard and typical item on a mexican restaurants menu but I have to say, it was very tasty and was prepared well.  The chicken was not dry at all. We all over indulged in chips and guac so finishing our entrees would be next to impossible. We had lots of leftovers, for sure.   We came on a Saturday afternoon right during the lunch rush hour but it wasn't busy at all. This allowed for our meals and drinks to come out rather quickly. We were in and out in an hour. Pretty quick lunch, I'll say..."}
{"text":"My friends and I went into Spotted Donkey one SLOW afternoon. We left due the lack of services and the utterly rude waitress. Not to mention the the bland food! Spotted Donkey should be ashamed of how they treated us!  I will never return, and I will also let EVERYONE  in the industry know how RUDE and how unprofessional they were."}
{"text":"Two of us ordered something wrapped in a flour tortilla. Had four small strips of grilled beef inside. Some tasty sauce, too. But the pillow sized flour tortilla was the meal. It must have started life the size of a $20 pizza. Only thicker. And still wet. And then it was wrapped around four small pieces of beef. Had to saw through it to find the grilled beef. Very disappointed. Spendy tortilla. Have no idea if other menu items are good or bad but the couple we were with were unhappy too."}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi fish tacos are excellent. Love the enchiladas because you get hatch green chile (the best) and red chile. Margaritas are also awesome. Ask for Josh as your waiter, native AZ and very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, good atmosphere. Bartenders are so personable, especially Tony, Jill and Scott. Very fun talking with all the patrons from across the US. One of a kind place. Located in the best part of the Phoenix Valley!"}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend read about this place in the Phoenix magazine and decided to give it a try...punched in the address in the gps and started driving, we had no idea how far it was and we got there an hour later...we got a seat pretty quick for a saturday night and its a really cute little restaurant. We ordered the nachos, which by the way were the best nachos ive ever had, my boyfriend got the burger and i got the chalupas. Everything was amazing very tasty and flavorful food...The service was slow but over all this place was awesome i just wish it  was a little bit closer, unless im in the area driving from chandler is a bit of a drive =("}
{"text":"Way above Mexican for a Mexican food fan that finds El Encanto very average (with Margaritas that taste like cheap frozen mix to add insult to malpractice).  As in all places we dine as a twosome we are bar eaters...and the bartenders are top notch and social.  The key baseline Mexican food metrics---salsa, chips, guac, margarita, all pass with flying colors...significantly above average.  They have some unique dishes like a Mexican stew that is superb...my go to dish. Have been disappointed with Chile relleno and some average dishes...but again relative to El Encanto it's better in all respects.  Will return...but do find Hacienda down the street superior quality and flavors. Close to home makes it a good choice"}
{"text":"Went here with family and the food was not bad! Decent mexican and not overly priced! Chips and salsa should always be free at a restaurant tho. Overall i gave it a 4 star for being decent with good service and food."}
{"text":"This place was really fun.  it's in a mall, and doesn't look like much from the outside.  Several other restaurants were dead, but this restaurant was packed, and for good reason.  The atmosphere was fun, the service was great, and the food was a step up from the usual mexican place.  It's not fancy food by any stretch - it's just high quality and prepared with care.  The cocktails weren't cheap, but they didn't leave us feeling let down.  The Mezcal Mule was the popular drink of the evening."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had a great rum/ grapefruit cocktail, so good. The shrimp on skewers appetizer we get every time. Really big meaty shrimp. I had the mahi mahi tacos, divine. One of our regular go to places."}
{"text":"You'll notice, if you stay at the Boulders at the very tip top of Scottsdale, that there are not very many food choices to be had. A food desert in the actual desert. Weird. Of the choices that are available, you are left wondering which are actually OK and which are just plain crap.  This place, which has a great name, is in the OK category. If you are not careful, you'll drive right past it and get stuck at another restaurant you didn't want to visit. It's located on the top floor of what seems like a deserted \"only in Arizona\" designed strip mall. After a little bit of exploring, we found it and entered into an atmosphere that is distinctly southwestern. All average so far.  The average continued. Margaritas were good, but overpriced. Food was good by overpriced. The queso, which my partner in crime reported was the best of her life, was just that. The service was absent with occasional sprinkles of attentiveness. We walked out with a $60 bill for 2 people and wondered what the hell we had just eaten.  You could go elsewhere, yes, but if you get lost and actually happen to find this place in the zombie apocalypse that is North Scottsdale, then you will probably have the best average experience of your life."}
{"text":"We just returned from having lunch at Spotted Donkey Cantina and it was pretty good, except for a couple things.  The lettuce in the little salad that came with my enchiladas had obviously come out of a bag because it tasted terrible.  I had one bite and regretted it because it ruined the taste of my bite of enchilada.  The lettuce even had brown on it.  It wasn't good and would cause me to think twice about returning.  My husband had the Cascabel-Chile Marinated Carne Asada and it had good flavor but the meat was over cooked somewhat.  This restaurant does have a nice atmosphere and would probably be fun when there are lot of people there.  It was very quiet when we were there for lunch."}
{"text":"Now that we live in Carefree permanently we  have looked forward to eating  at the Spotted Donkey. Have not been there for a few years. I am sad to say that they r not what they use to be. They use to have awesome Margaritas. Now they taste like over sweet store bought mix. Can't even taste the tequila so what's the point? The customer service is great! Not hovering yet checking in to make sure we r ok. The food is good but it is not consistently good. Last time I went I had the steak and shrimp burrito which me happy. The time before that wasn't so great and there was hardly anyone there. Please make a killer Margarita again!! Would like to find other Mexican restaurants so I have more options."}
{"text":"3 stars for the service, 2 stars for the food :( I think there are plenty of other locations outside of the resort to try before I would go back here"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place on Saturday and had a GREAT lunch here! It's a little pricier than what we would usually spend on lunch, but well worth it. They have a nice patio with umbrellas. We chose to sit outside, but inside was very welcoming as well. We had the queso to start, and WOW. I highly recommend this appetizer. The skinny margaritas were delicious ($10 a pop, but still delicious). Service was phenomenal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for dinner and after looking at pictures from fellow reviewers we had a general idea of what to expect and order. Our server was very friendly, offered suggestions on what to order. The best part was when we decided to have the nachos for apps, she mentioned it was enough to be dinner. We are glad she did, we still had leftovers. The nachos were delicious, the combination of different salsas on each quarters was the best as they complimented the flavors and texture. There was pork carnitas a plenty! We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of meat they had in the nachos.   We also ordered the shrimp ceviche, it was refreshing and perfection with the balance of flavors spicy and cooling.   The decor is very fun, makes for good photo opps."}
{"text":"We were torn on coming here because of the reviews but it worked out, I would recommend it, especially if you're staying at the Boulders Resort (they will drive you there on a golf car). I'm guessing they might have read the reviews and addressed the problems.  Our service was great (went there 3 days over a 6 day visit). The food was a little overpriced (it's part of the Waldorf Asotria, so I kind of expected that, but charged it back to my room to get the HHonors points).  While it wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, it was tasty and good.  The atmosphere is casual and friendly."}
{"text":"Let's see. Yes, it's in an eerily disused convention area. But the complaints don't make a lot of sense to me beyond that. It's technically part of the Boulders so they are all about customer service and making sure you're happy with what you have. Don't like a drink or your food? they'll rush to fix it (Not that we had problems at all, beyond one too-sweet margarita that was a matter of taste and they happily fixed). They have barrel aged cocktails they made themselves, are thrilled to talk about, and are happy to let you sample.Their food is fresh, light (unless you order something fried and then really, that's on you, lol), and flavorful. the locals are friendly and the decor is nice. We had a great time 2 nights in a row. The staff was all excellent, the only names we got were Scott and Jill, who were amazing, plus a (forgive me) bearded young gentleman behind the bar whose name we didn't get but who was a delight and very helpful. A really generous happy hour tops it off--that's what kept us coming back. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"$88 bill, for 3 tiny margaritas (if they had tequila in them, none of us could tell), 2 quesadillas, that came with 2 small tablespoons of guacamole and sour cream on a bed of what they call Pico De Gayo; it didn't have any peppers in it, and a Chilli Relleno plate. 15 minutes after we were served,  I had to go into the restaurant and find someone to bring us some salsa; this mexican food place does not offer chips and salsa like others do, you have to pay for it (they did not charge us for the requsted salsa though). All in all, the only thing special about this place was the over priced no-frilles menu, and the nice back patio."}
{"text":"I honestly hate going to Scottsdale.. Yes, everything is so beautiful but I love the city.. I love people and clutter on the streets and buildings that make you feel sick when you look up. However, I love Spotted Donkey. And although my parents have been wanting us to take another family trip out there, I think Spotted Donkey is what would do it for me.   I have never had this kind of cuisine taste so darn good - southwestern western. It's just sooo incredible and the way they manipulate mexican food with different flavors and ingredients is absolutely amazing. I ordered the Enchiladas and it was the best enchilada I have ever had!!! The chicken was so juicy and the fact that they didn't use a tortilla, but rather a sort of thicker and softer wrap made everything a hot gooey mess!!!  I also tried the signature tacos, fajitas and chimichanga. All very very veryyyy good!! Only thing is that I wish they would serve free salsa and chips, just because that is the first thing I look forward to when I eat mexican food. However, we ordered the guacamole and it was so fresh and very well seasoned!!  As for margaritasssss, I ordered the prickly pear - my personal Scottsdale favorite whenever I visit. Actually, anything prickly pear does it for me!!   Since my experience at Spotted Donkey, I've been on a mission to find the perfect enchilada that will even come CLOSE to what I experienced at this place.. but it's pretty tough."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chopped salad very much. We got the shrimp appetizer and it was spicy but very good. The service is precise and not pushy or rushed. The music is nice, the faculties are clean and overall the restaurant feels like it's new.  I would like to go here for dinner and see what the crowd is like. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just experience a perfect moment, and I had one at this place!    We went to El Pedregal to check it out on a typical early November Scottsdale day - which is to say, absolutely gorgeous weather!   I've only been to El Pedregal once before, and it was a ghost-town - but that was at the height of the summer with temps in the high 90s or more.  This time it was high 70s, and there was a music/wine festival going on, with good live music and lots of happy people ... the atmosphere could not have been better.    We saw the Spotted Donkey and managed to get a table outside on the patio, which was full.  I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven right then ... sitting in a gorgeous setting, with views of mountains, palm trees, blue skies ... being waited on by nice folks, surrounded by happy patrons ... it was just ideal.  Then we got the food.  To my surprise, it was all good ... the chips and salsa (pretty expensive, when most places give the stuff away) were both great - 'perfect' chips, and the tomatilla salsa was to die for.  My main course (stuffed pepper) was awesome!  I just can't describe how good it was. I've become so jaded by Mexican restaurants, growing to loath the big plates, piles of beans, piles of rice, goopy sauce on everything ... this meal was refreshing, delightful.    I'm really looking forward to coming back, maybe next time for dinner; my biggest fear is - it will be dead ... I'm not sure what kind of traffic these guys get on a typical evening - but I will give it one shot."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! Don't listen to the winey reviews. This place has the best tasting Southwestern food that I have ever tried. I have been a chef for more decades than I care to recall and I can honestly tell you that the chef here puts love into his food. The sauces have the depth of flavor that you would normally only find at your grandma's home. This is my \"go to\" place when I hunger for full service, fine dining Southwest cuisine."}
{"text":"Agree that the jalapeno shooters are a must....the steak and shrimp burrito was also excellent....and they have a margarita made with habanero infused tequila! All in all the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Not the same level of service or quality of food, as in the past. Disappointed now for the last time.  Went for happy hour recently and establishment had a problem because we took a table literally next to the bar but not in the bar.  We were a party of 6.  All our tabs together amounted to $180.    Not sure why we got such an attitude from the bartender.  The only reason I gave 2 stars is the waitress who took over was very polite"}
{"text":"How good is this place? We went two night in a row on vacation!!!! Who does that? First- the queso is the best maybe ever. But the real winner is the chocolate cake. It's the best we have ever eaten. I am going to dream about it. I may actually just move. Sooooooooooo worth it."}
{"text":"We really liked this place. Nice ambiance, though a bit touristy...as you might expect being next to The Boulders. Tried a selection of appetizers -- not as spicy as we prefer, but yummy...we liked all but the queso fundido, which was just OK. Margaritas were also delish. Surprised to read others reporting lousy service -- we had a good experience. It's on the list."}
{"text":"I am honestly shocked by the high reviews of this place. When there are so many fabulous Mexican food restaurants in Arizona, do NOT waste your money here.   The pros:  1. Neat decor and location  The cons:  1. Chips and salsa for $7.00!!!! Are you kidding me? You get them free at almost every other Mexican food restaurant. That should have been my warning sign.  2. The rest of the food was outrageously expensive.    3. The quality of this over-priced food was sub-par at best. I had the fajitas and they were just not good.   4. The bathroom sink was very unique and after taking a few minutes to discover where the water was actually coming from I found that the water was actually passing over BLACK MOLD! This was enough to make me want to vomit since I had washed my hands before eating my not so good fajitas.  5. A 20% gratuity was added on our bill. I felt that was a bit presumptuous. 15% is acceptable for a gratuity then let me add more if I want to. 20% is not a given.   6. This is petty, but they spelled \"chipotle\" wrong on one of their menu items.  Overall, I was very disappointed in this place. There are so many great, award winning Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale alone, why waste your money here? I won't return."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Kelley, is darling and sweet!! She is a fantastic waitress, in that she is ebullient, efficient and effective!!! Our fajitas were yummy and filling!! Guacamole was perfect!  Thanks Kelley!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Spotted Donkey!  Try the nachos - yum!"}
{"text":"I am surprised that this is not a more well known place.. The food is full of flavor.. Everything I have had there is well prepared. This is a destination spot for us since we have to drive from Central Phoenix to eat here."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was ok. Chips stale. Not recommended with so many other options for Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Used to be fabulous. Great ambiance and service, but food is mediocre at best and way too expensive. Hope it gets back to where it was. Very $ for quality."}
{"text":"Something has changed here... Food sucks... Very expensive ... Don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm not a fan. The food was pretty tasteless. I had the shrimp and beef burrito. Boring. My husband had the fillet fajitas, he said they were the worst he ever  had. The flan and the fried ice cream were a bit better. I'm giving this place two stars because the beer was good."}
{"text":"Like his spotted brother - \"he kick's ass\" - great food, awesome atmosphere.  Don' t miss the guac and the nachos.  I'd get on the back of this \"ass\" anytime."}
{"text":"The crowd here is totally not my scene, but you have to appreciate great ambiance and incredible food. It's a haul up to this place from where I live, even when I lived in north Scottsdale, but totally worth it. There are few cooler places to be in the Valley than a warm night on the patio here.  The inside is very New Mexican, with a totally rustic full bar that has been packed every time I've come in. I even skip my usual drink of choice to order the Scottsdale Cocktail (yup, friggin' awful name, but the citrusy goodness in this glass is just too hard to resist).   The food? Some of the best carne asada I've ever had. It comes with an avocado tomatillo sauce that is literally blissful. The honey glazed salmon is also a delight, with an interesting mix of sweet, tangy and just a bit of kick. Though it's kind of BS that they don't bring chips and salsa to the table -- shouldn't be surprised in this neighborhood, but still -- order the chips and salsa trio anyway. It's worth the extra cash for this trio of awesome sauces."}
{"text":"Meh. I did not love this place. Bartenders were great. I'd go back if I wanted to chat with them.   The house margarita (premix) was super sweet. The jalapeño popper shooters were not served to us a shooters (they were out of shot glasses), but on a plate.   My enchiladas (beef and pork) tasted good. BUT, to me, the meat tasted like pot roast. Like home cooked pot roast that Grandma serves. Good, but not really my ideal Mexican craving."}
{"text":"Went to the Boulders on a Thursday for an overnight stay for our anniversary. We didn't want to do anything fancy, so we chose to go the the Spotted Donkey for a laid back and hopefully fun atmosphere. First impression was it was old and dirty. Not busy at all. Plenty of open tables. Hostess okay but sat us at the only two top with an uncomfortable cement bench in a corner right next to two other people, and the table was extremely wobbly. It took 5 minutes for anyone to come over and when we asked if we could move to any of the many open tables, our waiter had to disappear in the back for over 5 minutes to \"see\" if we could move. Seriously? When they finally moved us and our waiter came back, we asked about the seasonal infused liquor that was referenced on the menu. He told us all that was offered was a tequila. We asked what it was infused with and he told us it had been in a barrel for about a month. We tried to get him to understand what infused meant, fruit herbs etc, but he had not clue. Finally gave up. Asked about the sangria and it also was infused but he again could not tell us with what, so I went with the white sangria and hoped for the best. My husband went with a plain margarita because we had no idea what else there was. At this point we really were a little hesitant to stay there, but as it was our anniversary we were trying to stay positive. So we decided to start with the grilled romaine and roasted tomato wedge salad to share. How bad can a salad be? Bad. When it arrived, I immediately could tell it was romaine I would have thrown away. It was very dark green and extremely woody. You could barely cut it up with the knife. We literally had a bread plate full of romaine pieces that were inedible, and the stem (the piece that comes out of the ground) was also still attached. After that we decided not to chance dinner. We flagged down our waiter (who had been very elusive the entire time we were there) and asked for the bill. We went back to the main lobby and got an Uber and went to El Encanto. It was a night and day difference with atmosphere, service and food. But what a disappointment that a place like the Boulders would have a restaurant with such poor quality and service. Would not recommend to anyone for any reason. Go to Taco Bell . You'll be happier."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and we really like the jalapeños poppers, the margaritas, and the pork chimichanga"}
{"text":"Very cute place! The chips and salsas are delicious and we ordered the taquitos.... Yum!  Great mimosas, as well."}
{"text":"I decided to try the Happy Hour on Friday afternoon. The staff was immediately friendly, attentive without being invasive and genuinely appeared to be enjoying their jobs and eachother. The atmosphere is relaxed but elegant and upper class. They have a daily happy hour 3-6 with an appetizer menu of items all for 4 dollars, discounts on some signature drinks, 6 dollar wines and 5 dollar mixed drinks, plus a deal on beer too. I ordered the machaca spring rolls and omg, they were divine! the sauce accompanying them was out of this world yummy and the garnish was lovely and tasty. I'm looking forward to going back and not breaking the bank at the same time."}
{"text":"This place was so good we went twice...and I wish they had food like that up here in Calgary because I've never had calamari like that or the jalapeño shooters.....mexican food heaven!  Okay on our first trip there we all had the calamari and instead of your usual rings and tentacles they did it like chicken fries - sticks!  They came amazingly tender (no chewy seafood texture), with an amazing chipotle sauce we all held onto to go with our main courses, and a fresh roasted tomato/cilandro dip.  For my main I had the chili relleno, which was baked with rice inside (something I've never had before), with roast pork and cheeses mixed in.  It had a little tomato sauce, two corn tortilla rounds, and it was so good I ate till I hurt.  badly.  The walk to the car for the 5 min drive back down the road to where we were staying was rough, but totally worth it.  The white sangria was very light and refreshing especially next to such a heavy meal.  On our second trip our server John was fantastic.  D and I shared a plate of Jalapeño Shooters which were so good I cleaned out my little shot glasses (when its so good you have to lick your fingers clean you know it's worth it).  The jalapeños were definitely fresh because of the sheer spiciness of them (they lose their oomph when they sit too long in a grocery store as opposed to homegrown/fresh off the plant).  We'd had to wait for our order because their quality control was so good that John apologized to us for having to hold our order of shooters - the tips had been burnt and he wouldn't bring the first run out to us.  I have no problem waiting with staff who will catch cooking accidents like that rather than serving them.  I honestly appreciate that kind of quality control and wish more places were as diligent...  I tried the red sangria this time which was refreshing and absolutely loved it.  Since mom had had the fajitas on our first trip I thought I'd try the shrimp ones this time for my main course.  They came out sizzling hot, smoking a little, and you couldn't touch the plate they were on because the cast iron was ridiculously hot.  The tortillas were too hot to touch at first so those need to cool a little before you fill them, but they were soft and tasty, and I got extras because the first 4 aren't nearly enough for the amount of shrimp, peppers and onions they give you.  Ate so much my stomach hurt...again!  And yet we still made room for the banana wraps for dessert this time.  Delicious!  All in all, I wish they had this place in Calgary instead...I'd have trouble not going for dinner every day...!"}
{"text":"Drove up from Tucson and spent a weekend at the Boulders for my birthday. Came here one of the nights for dinner. The ambiance was so fun and lively, especially during a U of Arizona game! Service was great.  My boyfriend has sampled carne asada far and wide in Arizona, and said the carne asada here was the best that he has ever had! I normally am not a fan of carne asada, and even I had to admit it was ridiculously good. It had a perfect crisp and slight char on the outside that really made it outstanding. That meal will be unforgettable for him!  I enjoyed a gigantic bowl of pork chile verde. It was quite heavy as expected, but a tad on the salty side, but I took almost 3 nights of leftovers all the way home to Tucson, added some sour cream, and it was perfect :)  Trio of salsas to start as an appetizer. I would not get this if you're expecting that classic, chunky, tomato-based salsa that you get at the grocery store. Yuck! These were flavorful and inventive salsas, and more liquid than your store-bought salsas, which I've gotten used to while living in Arizona.  We both enjoyed the margaritas! Till next time!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The calamri tenderloin is incredible and   Outdoor patio is awesome and the food is hearty but creative.unique.  The baracoa chimis are awesome.  The chips with three dips is also great.  Only knock is that iti is a little expensive.  We asked for chips with dip and guacomole and they brought our two bowls of chips and it was over $20 because they sent out two orders.  Most dishes are around $15."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to love this place but the recent changes have been unfortunate. The menu is smaller and more expensive than it was in the past and the food is extremely overpriced for what it is. Staff is always friendly and talkative and the location is great. Their patio dining is one of the best in north Scottsdale and the surrounding area is beautiful. Overall a good place for happy hour or a nice dinner but be prepared to pay for it."}
{"text":"We've been here for happy hour a couple times but it's been a while since we had a meal.  Drinks and dinner were very good.  Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. After years of our friends telling us this is their favorite place we decided as we are new to the area to try the spotted D.  No 2.5 stars on Yelp so I'll be generous because it wasn't bad or good  Staff hands down were great all except possibly at the end of the evening.  The manager seemed to run past our table asking if everything was ok... leaving before we had a chance to reply.... actually it wasn't.   First Mexican restaurant I have been in where they don't bring you chips and salsa as you sit down.   Nor do they have any salsa for your meal.  You might thing I shouldn't need it, but we both found out dishes bland and lacking any kind of Mexican flavor.  We were served a couple of dishes that contained ingredients that we told up front we couldn't eat.  Staff handled this very well.   Pork Stew has a great description but no taste. Despite having hatch chillies on the list the only evidence of hatch chillies was the hard skin found in amongst the 75% potatoes.   Atmosphere was nice, plenty of outdoor seats and great decor.  Place was about half full of people but not worth returning for us. Plenty more chillies in that local sea.    Sad part was to see the failing tax break that used to be El Pedrigal.   The Spotted D is the only thing left now other than conference rooms.   From looking at the credit card statement it appears that the HOA owns the Spotted D. So not sure of the arrangement there."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence between 3-4 stars, but for food quality I'm going with 4.  Service and value for the money would be closer to 3.  The décor is very charming, although as others have mentioned, the shopping plaza where its located is mostly deserted which is a bit strange.  For the prices and the fact that its part of the Boulders resort, I would have expected better service.  It wasn't bad, just not very attentive. The menu is fairly small and they don't provide the usual chips and salsa, so don't walk in there hungry!  The tacos were very good as was the salad with chicken.  Not sure I'd rush back, but if you're in the area its not a bad place."}
{"text":"Superb. Would highly recommend the beef barbacoa tacos and a hand crafted traditional margarita to go along with it. Tony, the bartender, kept the drinks coming!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  Did a search on yelp and once again I wasn't disappointed.   A little out of the way but we'll worth the drive North of Phoenix.   Menu selections were abundant and happy hour specials were a real deal."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We ordered the donkey nachos after reading yelp reviews. They were delicious and filling. We ended up splitting an entree bc they were so filling. We got the chicken enchiladas which I'm still dreaming about"}
{"text":"Love their food, patio, and of course, the prickly pear frozen margarita.  Perfect end to our long hike up in Carefree."}
{"text":"Wow. Not sure where to begin, but bottom line avoid this place at all costs if you are looking for good food, good service, and what you would expect from a restaurant connected with such a 5-Star hotel like the Boulders. We ordered shrimp fajitas and the shrimp were the size of a quarter like the frozen ones you get from the grocers freezer."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about a dozen times.  House margaritas and jalapeno poppers are my favorite.  I wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"This is the good Spotted Donkey! We really liked other one before the ownership change, very much so disliked it after the ownership change, and are so happy to have found this one. The menu is full of great Tex Mex-with-a-fancy-twist-foods. Prices are a little higher than normal Mexican food however you actually get more quality and freshness for it. It's a great place to come for date night, a casual weeknight meal, or a family dinner."}
{"text":"Where did the famous donkey from the movie \"Shrek\" go when he retired?  He took those royalty checks and invested them in a very tasty Mexican restaurant called \"The Spotted Donkey\" in Carefree, AZ. (Disclaimer--I am joking about the Shrek donkey, although I bet he comes here for dinner)!  We were fortunate to have reserved a Friday night table early, as those before us who came to see the hostess without reservations looking morose and ended up checking their smartphones for other dining options.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful, explaining that the enchiladas in mole sauce had gone off the menu about 6 months earlier, due to a general lack of popularity.  While this did not give us much cause for optimism for the palates of the restaurant's clientele, our waiter assured us there were other tasty options on the menu.  We made an investment in an expensive appetizer, chips with homemade guacamole.  My stocks should pay these kind of dividends--it was delicious.  For dinner items, my bride ordered a burro with steak and shrimp.  She could only make her way through half of it before waving the white flag.  I ordered two machaca chicken enchiladas, smothered in red and green chili sauces, with sides of rice and beans.  Again, these were far superior to what you would procure at a chain restaurant.  Dessert?  You have got to be kidding!  I recommend this to everyone, but do not show up at dinnertime without reservations!  Otherwise you will be spending an excessive amount of time sipping one of the Spotted Donkey's tasty margaritas."}
{"text":"Heard great things. Warm comfy atmosphere. Friendly service. Food good.   However, this is typical Americanized Mexican food in a dead convention area. Try Cave Creek for locally owned great food of many varieties!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are fantastic. Margaritas are great. The service is hit or a miss. Half the times we have come here the servers are rude or annoyed we are there and the other half they're great. I probably wouldn't go back if it wasn't for the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"We had reservations and we were late. I hate being late but I was not in control of our group that night so there you go. But even though we were late they greeted us with a smile and still had our table waiting.    We then were greeted by the wait person, a very nice woman with a great smile. She took our drink orders and appetizers .It all came very quickly. But it did not feel we were being rushed in any way.   I honestly can not remember what we all ordered for the actual dinner. But I do know it was VERY good. I was surprised in that we have had a recent string of crappy meals in other places that this is what I was expecting. But lucky for us we all truly enjoyed our food and time.    This was a few weeks ago and it is time to go back ;-[)"}
{"text":"I recently went here for the first time for happy hour. I have gone many times for lunch or dinner.  I didn't even know it was happy hour, but I will say, what great bar staff. Friendly, eager to point out what is on happy hour, ready to get your order going.  I was hesitant to try the jalapeño shooters again... (i only try these when someone else at my table orders them...and really I was in tears because they were so spicy). Well, hello July in Scottsdale, because it seems like the jalapeños delivered that day were not spicy! Good for me, I was able to enjoy the shooters, and see what everyone loves about them, but without tons of spice.  We didn't order tons of drinks, but the bar staff were still friendly, and I appreciate that. We ordered a few apps, some from the happy hour menu, some from the regular menu.  I will say the tempura shrimp skewers are one of my favorite menu items. As well as the tacos.  I always have to remind myself that the spotted donkey is there for me.. a nice consistent tasty place...."}
{"text":"First time here.  Dropped in on a weekend night about 6:15 pm... first open table not until 8:15, so we ate at the bar. Great lively vibe, nice people,great waitstaff and bartenders.  Best dish we had was the shrimp ceviche... robust flavors, with lots of crisp veggies and gorgeous shrimp.  Will be back for this alone.  Worst thing, unfortunately, was the guacamole appetizer!  Didn't taste house made or fresh.  We're returtning this weekend with friends... will definitely order the shrimp but probably not the guac."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!  Although we live a 1-1/2 hr drive away, whenever we head to Phoenix are for anything, we make sure to time it so that we can hit the Spotted Donkey in Scottsdale for either lunch or happy hour.  The frozen margaritas are to die for - they use something like a slushy machine to blend them and it keeps them slushy with no separation of ice & cocktail for the entire drink.  They are the best I've had anywhere! The tempura shrimp appetizers are the largest shrimp I've ever seen and the presentation is amazing.  The jalapeno shooters are a must have each & every time we go there and the calamari appetizer is like calamari steak strips with none of the stringy tentacle stuff attached - so delicious as well.  Everything we've seen being served as elicited comments from us such as \"oooh that looks good\" or \"we should have ordered that too\".  If you are lucky enough to go when Scott the bartender is working, you are in for a treat - he is a native Arizonian and a fountain of interesting, little known, knowledge regarding all things \"Arizonian\".  Personality plus as well and always has a genuine smile & a great sense of humor too.  Do yourself a favor and get there - if we can make it and have a 3 hour round trip each time, anyone within a 50 mile radius of Phoenix needs to experience this place."}
{"text":"$7.50 for the chips and super runny salsa- not a fan! Our waiter was nice and helpful when the kitchen messed up our order. Not excited about the food at all- maybe we both ordered the wrong thing? Chili Relleno and a chimichanga- but the ambiance was nice and the staff was pleasant. Maybe our leftover food we didn't want to eat there will be good in a tortilla tomorrow. Next time we want nice staff, pleasant atmosphere and we don't want to eat... we might be back. But probably not."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and made a reservation for our weekend in the area attending spring training games. The drive was a little longer than we anticipated and it seemed as if we going out to the middle of nowhere... but then we made it to the el Pedregal center, and found the restaurant. This is a pretty business center in the foothills near The Boulders. While the center was not busy for a weekend night, The Spotted Donkey Cantina was abuzz.  We were a few minutes early for our reserved time, but they promptly seated us at a great corner table on the patio. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and seemed committed to making our experience a good one. As the sun set and the temp grew cooler, our request for the heater to be lit was promptly fulfilled. It kept us cozy while we enjoyed the lovely desert evening.  Our server made a few recommendations. It is the first time we've eaten at a Mexican restaurant where chips and salsa are not included in the dining experience, but we ordered them as an appetizer and they did not disappoint. Fresh, crispy chips were accompanied by a trio of delightful salsas. The dark, roasted tomato salsa was especially yummy and had a surprising after burn.  I ordered an unusual entree (for a Mexican food restaurant) that was spicy meatloaf with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. This was one of the server's recommendations and it was a good one. I really enjoyed the spicy jalapeño flavor of the meatloaf. My hubby ordered more traditional fare of chicken enchiladas. One enchilada had red sauce, the other one had green sauce. He was very happy with his selection and ate every bite.  This place is not cheap, and it is a bit more than \"casual\" but it made for a lovely date night that was truly enjoyable in every respect."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. Food is great!  The Donkey nacho was awesome. Lots of flavor and the meat is tender with lots of fat. And fat is good!  Son ordered quesadilla with pork appetizer. The size is huge. I had pork tenderloin with pasta. So yummy and tender the pork I ate the entire thing.  Going back in 2 days."}
{"text":"Best nachos I've ever had in my life and that is saying a lot since I eat nachos at least once a week."}
{"text":"Better than average Mexican food for Arizona. Lovely restaurant - appropriate decorations; very good service.  Back for dinner with friends. Noisy, busy cantina - but the beer is cold and the food is good  I had an excellent Steak; M had a equally pork dish. Lots of food for less than $20 a plate. Good deal fun place"}
{"text":"We walked over from the Boulders Resort at the end of happy hour - which is 3-6. They have good mojitos here! They didn't have a lot of vegetarian options on the menu but they gladly made me something off menu- bean & rice burro. My husband had a burger & he said it was excellent.   The biggest wow was the flan. Not all flan is good & it's easy to screw up, but theirs was excellent!   The reason i dropped a star is because it was overpriced & the food came out piecemeal.   If i am in the area i will be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place has become our go to place to eat. Don't get me wrong it's not amazing - but it is tasty, consistent and convenient to us. We've eaten here 3x  - I had green chile chicken enchiladas each time and my husband had the chimichanga (2x) and a quesadilla. The green chile pretty much lacked any heat but the enchiladas had a good flavor. My husband enjoyed what he tried although he agreed the chile had no heat. The price is pretty comparable with other places in this area. Staff is always friendly and helpful (we typically do a to-go order so I can't speak to the dining in experience). This, perhaps, some of the better Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"vacationed at the boulders resort,restaurant is right next door,our family ate there 5 times, every meal was excellent ! Margaritas are the best I ever had, wish I lived closer !"}
{"text":"I travel this country and once again yelp and a little help from my Hyatt girl this place was outstanding! From the start from the greeting to the chips and salsa they had me. Appetizers we went Queso and taquitos and both where fantastic. We shared a meal after a few margaritas (go prickley pair) Roja & Green Street enchiladas! I can say maybe the best Mexican dish I've had and I was supposed to be in Cabo this week."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Happy Hour! The nachos are the best I've ever had. The tacos are great too. The bartenders and staff are very attentive and friendly. The restaurant is nothing fancy, it's just a fun, hang-out, take a break for the day type of place."}
{"text":"Went there after realizing that Brugo's was not open as advertised. I liked, just liked the food,but the service is terrible! We were a party do 4 that went in for dinner at about 415. There were only about 5 people in the place so when we entered we were quickly greeted and sat down and were the only party at the dining area.  Water was poured quickly and we were told our server would be with us soon. So after at least 10 minutes and not seeing anyone but the hostesses, bus staff and bartender,who all were engrossed in television at the bar, I went to FIND A SERVER. She arrived and seemed a bit perturbed and argumentative but took our orders. The food arrived quickly and was just ok, but very overpriced for the servings. Probably won't be going back here, there are too many great restaurants in the area with great service."}
{"text":"Eaten here for both lunch and dinner. Food choices range beyond the standard Mexican fare but are blander than I would expect. Margaritas average. If going for dinner in February or March call for a reservation."}
{"text":"So disappointing. We spent a night at The Boulders and while Mexican cuisine is not usually our go-to, we were really excited to dine at Spotted Donkey. I knew Cliff way back in the days when SD first opened, along with Luc's, and after many (many!) years of not being in the North Scottsdale area, was looking forward to the quality of food I had received years ago. I am not sure who owns it now, but the quality is def not the same.   To start, we ordered drinks (almost 10 minutes later finally got them...). I love spicy margaritas, so I ordered the Dulce Calor margarita...habanero infused tequila, cointreau and a housemade margarita mix (minus the sugared rim). It was terrible. There was no margarita flavor at all, it was almost like just chewing on piece of the habanero. I took maybe 2-3 sips, and not once throughout dinner - or even after as it sat there full, did our server ask if it was OK. (I also did not send it back, which I should have...so that is on me I suppose).   The shrimp ceviche is NOT a ceviche. It was full sized shrimp, thrown in a cup with some tomato sauce and few pieces of chopped zucchini and jicama - literally.   The main courses were OK. My husband ordered the Hatch Chili Pork Stew and said it was great. I didn't try it and he is pretty fussy, so if he says it was good, it was good. I ordered the LaGrande Chimichanga and that was also decent. It was good sized, and the crema on top was a nice touch. I am not used to the beans being in the actual chimi, but it was a different take and worked. We ordered a cheese quesadilla for our son, and it was a good size plate and would easily fill up a child of any age.   Dessert, again, disappointed. I was really hoping for a churro, but when they didn't have them, I was easily swayed to have the fried ice cream and we also ordered the 11-layer chocolate cake. The cake was eh, OK. Nothing special. I was expecting some rich flavor coming from the Patrol XO cafe, but you couldn't taste it at all. The ice cream - a disaster on a plate. There was so much whipped cream, I had to scrape it off to even attempt to find the actual fried ice cream and even that didn't have the nice crust that I am accustomed to when getting fried ice cream at other Mexican restaurants.   During the meal, I think our waiter checked on us once. My husband's water glass sat empty until I flagged down someone to ask them to refill it and we had to do the same for another beer for him.   The kicker to the entire experience was the lovely bus boy who came to the table next to us exclaiming to his partner bus boy, \"let's get this shit done...\" and I didn't catch the last part because I was too busy giving him a \"are you serious look\" as my 4 year old son is looking at me confused, knowing it's a \"bad word\". Seriously?!! What kind of training do you have?!   Food, mediocre at best.  Service, terrible.   As locals, I had such high hopes, as we need a go-to Mexican restaurant, and this is def not it!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and food considering they didn't include shrimp in a steak and shrimp burrito and added Sausage and Steak.   About 4 other people in the whole place so wasn't busy.  When I let the waiter know hat he talked to the chef and said it was a mistake.  I said no worries and ate it with my wife.  I thought because of the mistake they would take at least 10-20% off the bill.  NOPE.  No discount at all.  So I am giving them 2 stars for bad customer service.  In the Restaurant biz it's always first impression.    The responses I have seen from management on other posts on here  are pretty generic.  I'd say for management to talk to the cooks. 4 people in the entire restaurant and you screw up a Shrimp/Filet burrito?    Sorry."}
{"text":"The service can take a while and some things on the menu are iffy, but over all good. Their bean dip that you get is amazing. Drinks are a little weak, beside that is a great spot to check out."}
{"text":"Spotted Donkey is one of my favorite restaurants in Cave Creek!  I miss Robert and Cliff but the food is the same as when they were there, and it's great!  Scott is still there at the bar with the great service he has always given!  Always busy but worth it!  Love the tacos, the nachos, the chopped salad, and the enchiladas and the green chili soup, well I guess, everything!"}
{"text":"The Spotted Donkey is always good food, creative selections with a nice atmosphere and attentive service - Last night's visit was no different and the New Mexican green chilli meatloaf was a very pleasant surprise - I almost always get the Jalapeno shooters as well as the guacamole and am never disappointed. They weren't too keen on handing us the restaurant week menu which I never understand - Its a promotion of the food and brings new and regular customers to the business - take the hit, offer it to me and I will likely be back. At Flemings if you request tthe restaurant week menu, you will likely be ignored for the rest of the evening. Not so here, so I got over it. A couple of tasty margarita's helped.."}
{"text":"Came here on memorial day and place had a few customers.   Service was slow.  They charge for chips and salsa and ther meat is boiled.   Tacos were basically a flat wet corn tortilla with boiled bland meat.   Salsa was sweet and non traditional at all.   Really wanted this to be good as we are looking for a local spot but will not waste time and money again.   Pricey too"}
{"text":"Wow - this place is amazing!  We stopped in one afternoon for a snack and a glass of wine.  We snagged a great seat on the patio and enjoyed the corn tamales and the chicken taquitos...this food is legit and I can't wait to come back for a full meal and enjoy all the menu has to offer."}
{"text":"So disappointing! My wife and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon. She had the enchilada plate and I tried the chili stew. Both were totally flavorless. The chili stew was supposed to have Hatch green chilis as an ingredient, but after careful searching through the bowl, it contained NONE. You could have figured that by the (lack of) flavor, but I just wanted to be sure. Plus the layer of grease on top...ughh. Scott, our waiter/bartender, however, was great. He turned an otherwise bad experience into something nice. Thanks, Scott!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is good, very friendly and the prices are reasonable. I sat on the outdoor patio and was put off by the lighting. There were small useless lights on each table and one \"parking lot\" bulb lighting the entire patio. With some subtle lighting this place would be great but I felt like I was in a parking lot - you could not turn towards the one light without getting a painful beam of light in your eyes."}
{"text":"On our way out of the Scottsdale area and back to the airport to leave AZ (goodbye sun and warmth) we stopped at the Spotted Donkey Cantina as my friend and her family told us it was (and is) one of their favorite spots.  It would be our second day in a row eating Mexican food, but I wasn't upset about that.  I know there is good Mexican in AZ and soaking up as much of that as possible was never going to be a bad thing.  We started our meal out with the Donkey Nachos (short is $9.95, Regular is $14.95).  Our server suggested the short.  We are happy he did as this dish was still quite large.  These are not your typical nachos.  They definitely are doing something different with this dish.  La casa fried corn tortilla rounds, pulled pork, serrano chile roasted tomatoes, tomatillo salsa, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses queso fresco, black beans and mexican créma.  That is a mouthful and this dish was a mouthful.  Ended up doing some more sharing for this meal too.  That is fine by me as I can certainly eat my fair share and always nice to cut back on the portions.  For our main we had the Pollo en Mole Poblano ($15.95).  Oven roasted chicken breast, roasted plantains, chef Esteban signature mole sauce spanish rice with corn or flour tortillas.  Another very reasonable portion.  The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but the mole was very good.  It certainly helped as the dish was not lacking in mole at all.  It needed it.  All and all a nice place to occupy yourself for a couple of hours.  We were able to sit on the patio.  During this time of year it is just silly to sit inside when the weather is just about perfect here."}
{"text":"Found this place on OpenTable and Yelp looking for a fun Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that's not too trendy or too expensive.  Really happy we chose Spotted Donkey. The atmosphere was festive but not too loud. They had the NFC Championship game on and we were interested in the two West Coast teams so could see the TVs in the bar from our table.  We ordered the $15 margaritas with their house tequila. It was delicious and smooth. The margarita was a little small but for a nice restaurant near a high-end resort, we expected that price tag.  Chips and salsa are not complimentary and the waiter tells you that early. Too bad so we ordered them at $7. They refilled the chips because there was a lot of salsa. They included a chorizo salsa and avocado salsa.  I ordered two enchiladas with rice and beans. Everything looked and tasted delicious. My wife had the vegetarian fajitas and liked them. We shared food with our toddler. My parents had the cobb and house salads.  What was fun in having a child in the restaurant is there are a lot of goofy framed photos on the wall of donkeys (appropriate). And there are a few animals on the tile floors in places so we could check all those out after the meal. It was like a mini scavenger hunt that was perfect for our daughter. And I was careful not to irritate other diners.  There were a few middle aged people throwing back drinks in the bar/restaurant area but they didn't get too rowdy. This place could get a bit wild perhaps if people are enjoying the alcohol a bit too much and only have to stumble back to their resort rooms.   There's also an outdoor patio with heaters.  Really hope to go back to the Spotted Donkey."}
{"text":"Marvelous!  Mexican but something more Travis was our waiter again. Everything special. We will come back again"}
{"text":"This place was ok. The chips and salsa were good but the guacamole tasted store bought. Had the chicken fajitas which had a great smokey flavor but not enough chicken in them. I also really liked the pork Mac and cheese which was a great recommendation by the waiter. Pretty good Mexican place."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Servings were generous. The Flourless chocolate cake was awesome. Lots of gluten free items too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always had great food. On the latest trip, I tried the duck quesadilla. It's the only time I've seen duck used in a quesadilla, but the meat was plentiful and had an excellent flavor. The tortilla and cheese were cooked well. It also came with a blood orage habanero dipping sauce, which was incredible. The fruit flavors made it almost like candy, but then the habanero packed a huge punch of spice. I definitely recommend this dish.   Another tasty item is the chips and guacamole appetizer. I don't typically like guacamole, but they do a great job here and mix in a lot of fresh ingredients. You can ask for salsa on the side as well.  The staff are friendly and courteous. The menu items are priced fairly. Although it is located way out in the middle of nowhere, this is a place worth trying for a nice Mexican-inspired meal."}
{"text":"No no no no!!!! The only thing this place has going for it is the outside patio seating. That's it.   It's just plain and simple lousy lousy Mexican food. I've had several dishes here and my husband and I decided tonight this was off of our list permanently. Tonight we had the fish tacos and it was a lot of cabbage with three bites of fish for close to $16. You're better off going to Rubio's.   There are way too many really good Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale and this one is simply not worth it."}
{"text":"Just the best mexican food i have ever eaten. Not exactly inexpensive, but sometimes you get what you pay for. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst \"Mexican food\" in AZ. The food is horrible and the service isn't much to praise either. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"One complaint, ordered the filet mignon steak fajitas, to my surprise they mix a few pieces of steak and lots of chorizo sausage in this dish.  NO MENTION OF THE SAUSAGE ON THE MRNU.  ITS A SCAM."}
{"text":"Our server Melissa was Awesome. We were here for happy hour WOW great ! The Nachos were the best we ever had, California included. Restaurant is tucked away and a bit hard to find, but well worth it ! Authentic Mexican food - delicious !"}
{"text":"Jalepeno shots are great! A lil spicy for you novices, but nothing scorching for those who like the heat. The carne asada was great and salmon tostada was mmmtastic. Service what what you'd hope for in all restaurants, friendly faces, timely and proactive."}
{"text":"Don't have anything bad to say!   Good food and good drinks!   The shooter appetizer was awesome!"}
{"text":"Felt like they were doing us a favor!!  Bartender needs a major attitude adjustment!  Party of 6--no place to sit in the small bar area for Happy Hour, so after we sat down to the only table that could accommodate us right next to the bar. Felt like they'd rather us dine somewhere else! Food and drinks were nothing special. They have a great location. Sadly they just don't realize they need us more than we need them!!!    I also had a Fake Profile \"compliment me\". Sounds like an employee!! It's going to be a full time job commenting on all the negative reviews."}
{"text":"Been here a few times - meals have always been great - love their happy hour.  Great patio to sit outside when the weather is nice and enjoy the view.  Service is always fantastic.    However... I have to mention my fajitas the other night... O M G ... I don't consider myself an expert on proper fajitas ... I just know when they're done wrong - they're really wrong.  These were incredibly delicious!  I shared a SMALL taste with my dining companion.... he agreed that they were awesome!  I don't know what they did .. but I do promise - I'll be back again and again and again.  Headed over tonight to a 4 course meal and tasting hosted by Herradura Tequila... I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Seafood enchiladas in North Scottsdale? Say yes and don't look back! The Enchilada de Mariscos here is comprised of seared shrimp, blue crab, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses, rice and orange pico. And, it's 100% delicious. Be sure to order the guacamole appetizer too. The chips are addicting. Maybe the reason why the location is so far from town is so that you have time to digest on the car ride home. With the 2014 Opentable Diner's Choice award, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"No no no no. This is a busy restaurant affiliated with the Boulders hotel. It's a corporate version of a Mexican/Spanish hotel. I had a salad with roasted pumpkin seeds that was good - the rest of it, fajitas, fish tacos or enchiladas were huge portions but heavy & dull. No tamales at all.  The bar was lively & popular."}
{"text":"Great food, worth the drive."}
{"text":"We ate here twice while staying at The Boulders Resort. Margaritas we're strong and the food was delicious! My favorite was the queso and the barbacoa tacos. Lisa and Jill were our severs and were top notch. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite stops in Carefree.  The service is always great and the appetizers are delicious. We can have a meal by sharing just  the nachos. This is the only restaurant where I enjoy a blended margarita and they offer different flavors."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely grotesque! Everyone left their meals and NO THANKS to the to go boxes! No one seemed to care at all about the experience. $120 out the window for something worse than dog food! N-A-S-T-Y!!!  way less than 1 star!! Poor service too!!"}
{"text":"Spotted Donkey Cantina is one of two businesses in the mostly deserted Pedregal. This is a South West Mexican Style Restaurant. I ordered the Mexico City Carne Asada. They gave me a very large portion of chewy steak. It was suppose to be marinated with arbor chile that might have been delicious but I didn't detect that. It was chewy and not tasty. My stomach turned when I tasted the peppers and onions because they were sour tasting. I think the sour peppers and onions spread to the steak and I couldn't eat it. I asked my husband to taste the peppers and onions and he said they tasted funky. I also noticed the picco on my plate looked very old. (blow up picture this is visible) Off to the side of my plate was something that resembled pond scum....I was brave and tasted it. The green slime on my plate was oddly sweet with honey and lime and not tasty....it wasn't flavored right or maybe it was just old sauce. My tortillas were fresh tasting and the potato cakes were fried nicely and seemed free of oil with a nice crispy exterior but lacked the chile they were suppose to contain.  My husband tried the Poblano Chile Relleno. He said it was a Poblano Pepper stuffed with mushy pork and greasy mushy rice topped with a strange tasting tomato sauce. He said his meal wasn't as bad as mine.  Our waitress seemed nice and asked me if I wanted mine boxed up but I declined.  I didn't feel that I could complain about the food here because I was getting one meal free because of my Scottsdale Preferred Card."}
{"text":"On the Boulders property, this second floor bistro served my wife and I delicious margaritas and had a passable, affordable wine list.  To start, the jumbo shrimp were delicious and the poppers a jalapeño-lover's delight!. The salad was fresh and easily split, as it was huge. The fajitas were terrific and the Puerco on Mac and cheese was scrumptious!  Good service too.   Perhaps importantly we were there on New Years Eve and called for reservations but no tables were available.  We tried thru the concierge, still nothing. Thru Open Table, however, we got a reservation at he exact time we had requested previously thru the resort!?  When we were seated we were shocked to see about half the tables empty.  Guess the message is don't take no for an answer or use Open Table.  It's a good place for dinner."}
{"text":"I recommended this place to my daughter and her friends when they were in visiting us from Chicago.  I am sorry i did.   4 young working professionals (age 27-38)  walked into the Spotted Donkey.  They waited for someone to acknowledge them and 10 minutes passed and no one did.   The place had only 2 table occupied with elderly couples.   Finally a woman seated us and then took many minutes to return ...we ordered the nachos, which were horrible.  Tasteless, she returned and we asked for the check...she was so rude to the young ladies thatthey and we will never return there.  We certainly will not recommend to any of our visiting friends."}
{"text":"This place looks like your typical southwestern café on the top level of a upscale strip mall on the edge of the 5 star Boulders resort property. So I wasn't really sure if it would be trying to be more fancy or mainstream. Its closer to the latter.  The decor is exactly what you expect to see in thousands of southwest cafés around Phoenix.   However, the music is an interesting choice for a southwestern café... 70's rock!?!?  While I was there I listened to numerous songs by Supertramp, ELO, Fleetwood Mac, etc. Great songs, but it didn't really set the atmosphere of the Sonoran desert decorations.   Super nice people though. I sat at the bar and ordered food. Even though it was only 35 minutes before closing time, they were overly welcoming and nice. Outstanding service, and pretty quick too.   I had the carnitas chinichanga which was great. Super moist and flavorful. But you can't really pick it up with your hands because its covered in sauce and falls apart since it was already cut in half for me. So you need to eat it with a knife and fork, but the flavors were all there.  Considering this is inside a 5 star resort's property, the prices are also fairly reasonable. My chimichanga and iced tea were $20 including tax."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why this restaurant doesn't get better reviews! Our experience here was really great. The food was excellent, the service was perfect! We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed and would not refer anyone to go there. Food was ok, service was slow, and the margaritas were lousy.   The \"Online\" Menu items for this restaurant are not served here; they have a different menu.   Worst customer service. If a customer is frustrated or has a question, usually a manager finds out why and helps be a solution. Not here. The Manager sides with servers (at least our female server) without listening to customer to see the whole picture and context of the customers questions about a bill or situation. Servers here are too sensitive & get offended over what a normal bar server wouldn't be, and they seem to lack common sense.   Not being informed of an automatic charge of 20% gratuity at the time of the reservation or upon ordering, is not acceptable. Discovering this information is quite shocking, especially when server doesn't deserve a 20% tip for poor service & you feel it should be lowered.    I enjoy a good meal, but it's not worth the servers attitude, or walking on eggshells with your words out of fear for what mood the server is in, and then a rude manager assuming whatever their server told them is automatically the only truth to a situation.   So bottom line, we questioned a 20% mandatory tip and expressed opinion about not knowing and due to lack of service how to adjust it. Next we know, the manager is at our table scolding us that his server got her feelings hurt and we are no longer welcome there. Hmmm... Feelings hurt? I bet. She wants her 20% tip and knew we weren't happy with her service. Well... Hope you don't step on an eggshell while you are there...if you try the place out.  My group of 6 won't be back.  On top of it...they charged my client's bill on my guest's credit card. I had to call the restaurant to fix it. Luckily they did that at least."}
{"text":"We were staying at the resort and decided to have dinner at the Spotted Donkey. Kelley was our waitress and she was absolutely fantastic! She recommended the nachos and they were a hit. Probably the best nachos both my husband and I have had. We were also looking for her recommendation for our entree and instead of telling us what she recommends, she decided to just surprise us. We had such a great experience and left satisfied. Thanks Kelley for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, lousy food and gouging prices. I will NEVER COME BACK! Who the hell charges $8.00 for chips and salsa? Then keeps refilling it for $8 a pop? We were NEVER told of the charge! 20% automatic service charge for slow service that never even refilled my water in two hours. Save your money and STAY AWAY! They should be ashamed. There are plenty of good Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale this one is awful!"}
{"text":"It's expensive BUT it's worth it for a special night. Fantastic menu.. Amazing mixology drinks and an impressive tequila list to chose from. Beautiful scenery and not overly packed Bc it's kinda out there a bit. If you get a chance, check out Boulders too."}
{"text":"Expensive and not that great. Not gonna lie, I hate Mexican restaurants that don't give you chips! Anyway, it's expensive & the food is fine. The hostess was nice enough, more into the game on the tv than us, we have a kid and she did give us a high chair and a kids water but not a kids menu. Our waiter was nice."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and food.  I was disappointed that the food was very americanized the food was sweet not spicey at all."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Not sure I'm ok with paying $7.50 for chips and salsa, but it is the boulders.  We had the donkey nachos and the portion was huge. It was really really good. Service at the bar was great as well."}
{"text":"Great margaritas.  I had the donkey special margarita and it was excellent.  The food is large portion and good quality. Ambience is very ! Yes"}
{"text":"Food was nothing special. Guacamole was barely visible on my plate and gross and runny. Rojo sauce on enchiladas was good. Server never checked in on our meal. Asked for chips and salsa because saw them on all the other tables, surprised to get the check and see $7.50 charge for chips?! Are you kidding? Taquerias give you free chips with your $5.00 burrito. Mexican food for old white people I guess. Will not be returning..ever!"}
{"text":"Very good food while being a bit pricey. Great ambiance and cool location. Good upscale dining experience. Forecast for dates but not the routine place to dine."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place so I gave it a try.  It was a bit crazy from some kind of convention group or something.  The service was really sub par.  From delays to misunderstandings, it wasn't a good impression.  The food was tasty and the view was nice.  Maybe worth another try at a less busy time."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to spotted donkey for years now and it never disappoints! Great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"All four of us were disappointed in our dinner last night on both the food and beverage front.  This place has sadly gone down hill on each visit since we came for the first time."}
{"text":"Call it three and a half.  I think I'm spoiled having Frotera Grill and Topolobampo here in Chicago.  Spotted Donkey was good, just nothing spectacular.  Their guacamole was good and the ceviche was tasty.  My wife had the shrimp tacos, which she seemed to like.  I had the carne asada, which was a bit overcooked and tough from the bad cut.  The sides were typical staples like mexican rice and beans.  There was not much creativity from the menu choices and again it seemed like typical mexican fare.  They also had some really funny pics of donkeys around the place."}
{"text":"Just had lunch.  Food was awful.  Although presented as \"very hot\" the 2 enchiladas were cool, as were the beans.  The enchiladas shells were rubber (very difficult to cut and chew) and what used to be white breast meet chicken (we used to have lunch every week at this restaurant, however we stopped when service and quality of food dropped...just wanted to give one more chance because we like the decor) is now dark brown (obviously lower grade chicken).  Sadly, we will not be back.  Way too many better options."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and service! Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the different tequilas they have. The atmosphere is good for a romantic date or for a family meal. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Here we go again with ridiculously priced guacamole, but it was so good I forgot about the price.  And the jalapeno shooters?  Genius.  I only wish we had ordered a \"double barrel\" and not a \"six shooter.\"  We only had appetizers on my one visit to Spotted Donkey, but it was enough that I wouldn't mind the drive up to Carefree a second time with the obligatory stay at The Boulders...just in case we shouldn't drive home."}
{"text":"After a long hike in Seven Springs cave creek area, we decided to try this place. It's been just about a month since we've been here but definitely worth the review.  The Baja shrimp tacos were fresh and tasty! It only came with 2 tacos for $15 but they were large tacos that were filling especially with its included side of rice. My friend had the same entreé but had one of the tacos with beer battered mahi instead of both shrimp, which he reports was very enjoyable.  My hubs had the beef barbacoa grande chimichanga and it was flavorful! The outside was crisply fried, which is tough since chimis can get soggy quickly. It creatively was served in halved with one of the halves standing vertically like a \"pillar of yumminess.\"  Unfortunately, chips and salsa are not free. If you order this though, you may want extra of the guacamole tomatillo salsa out of the three served.   As far as cocktails go, the Dulce Calor delivered exactly what its name implies. It's a drink with spiciness but enough sweet to get you through it. Perfect inner warmth on a cool breezy Sunday morning. I wanted a Bloody Mary too but they didn't have any of the ingredients for it that morning so I settled for an apple pie sangria which was written on their chalkboard menu coming in. I'm not sure if it tasted quite like apple pie but it was sweet like a dessert.   The ambiance is zany and lovely with very quirky but cute large photos of donkeys covering the walls, Saltillo tile floors, and large wood furniture and booths. I really liked the inside and would love to check out the patio when it's a bit warmer outside. Service was a slower at the end but it doesn't stop me from wanting to go back at some point."}
{"text":"This is a terrific restaurant.  Good food and atmosphere.  Service is also good....especially Dan.  My only criticism is that the staff is not always clear on what items are vegetarian.  I've dined there on several occasions with vegetarians and the wait staff doesn't always know if items like rice or sauces are made with chicken stock.  Fortunately the manager is vegetarian and was very kind when rice, made with chicken stock, was served to a vegetarian diner.  Otherwise, I highly recommend Spotted Donkey!"}
{"text":"Every aspect of our meal was impeccable from the drink presentations to the fried bananas at the end of our meal.   The servers are knowledgeable and it was the best Mexican/Southwestern food that I have had in the valley.  Located in El Pedregal enhances the evening with the beautiful Coy ponds and manicured grounds. It was an outstanding dining experience...  #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Make sure you get Kate for your server if you are looking for an education about tequila. Excellent food, excellent service. Top of the list for us in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Tortilla crusted, hand stuffed cheddar and bacon filled jalapeno shots dipped in a cilantro buttermilk sauce. Enough said. Picture this. Fried jalapenos sitting in a shot glass of buttermilk sauce. You take it out of the shot glass and bite into a fried jalapeno of gooey cheese that's oozing out. Along with the cheese, you taste bacon and southwest flavor. It's so good, you must have another and another and another...until all six have disappeared and you wish you had six more. This was my most recent experience at Spotted Donkey. They are called \"Shooters\" and you can order six or 12. After tasting them, I highly suggest going with the order of 12, that is, if you're hungry for fried happiness!   This still stands as one of my most favorite restaurants in the Carefree area. I've been visiting since I was a teenager and it still has yet to disappoint. Everything here is delicious, especially the southwestern mac and cheese and the stuffed chile peppers. Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place. It's located upstairs in the El Pedregal complex, south of The Boulders. It is not your typical Mexican restaurant, but worth a try. Be prepared to pay for chips as they are not included. We selected the fajitas and the carne asada. Both were outstanding. Overall a fun place"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Boulders Resort and wandered over here for dinner. The fish tacos were so yummy and piled high with cabbage, pico and creme. I was full after ordering the chips and salsa- they come with 3 flavors and they are all packing a variety of flavors. The Prickly Pear margarita rocked too! I sat on the rooftop patio with a heat lamp. I enjoyed it here and the food is really good. If I am ever back in Scottsdale this will be a stop I make."}
{"text":"We have tried Spotted Donkey twice in the last 4 months.  Each time there has been an incremental decrease in the quality of the food and SERVICE.  We will try again but our most recent Happy Hour visit left us scratching our heads.  We love our local establishments and I encourage everyone to give them a try...come to your own conclusion.  A very very cool venue and i hope that the precipitous decline in service is short lived."}
{"text":"Cold chips n salsa. Not ideal for $7.50 when the beef and bean salsa is also served cold and none of the 3 are up to spicy standard. The seating is also odd, they try to sit you close to other tables when clearly there are empty private tables. We made friends with our neighbors and good calamari. Just came for drinks and apps-and hey my boyfriend reminded me to not be a donkey so 4 stars here."}
{"text":"Love it!  Drinks could use a little updating. Food is delicious!  Environment is casual and clean. Staff are very friendly. Chips and 3 kinds if salsa- best I've had in a long time! Muchas Gracias!"}
{"text":"Of the high end Mexican restaurants, this is my favorite.  It's not an inexpensive restaurant but the quality of the cheese, meats and veg is certainly a cut above.  The atmosphere is more upscale than a typical Mexican restaurant and the barkeep does a mean margarita.  Additionally, I love their chips and salsa.  They have an excellent salsa with light portions of meat in it which is delicious.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I was in grandma's neck of the cactus patch and was pleased to see some new ownership and style take up in the old Mexican restaurant we used to haunt.  The Spotted Donkey represents a HUGE improvement over the previous joint, in decor (saucy industrial chic), menu (crazy creative), and execution.  Everything was delicious and well presented, if a little over the top and Texas-style in proportion.  I took 2/3 of my entree home and we never did finish those chips.  Speaking of which...  $7 for chips and salsa??  Is this a social experiment???  Am I being tape-recorded for reaction?  Am I at the Giant's stadium?  Is there some unspoken guarantee that in eating these chips I will experience spontaneous orgasm daily over the next week?  Please someone explain before I take the rest of the stars away, too."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!  I had no hope or expectation that this would be any better than average at best.  Holy Moley!  The Spotted Donkey Delivers!  This place is in a nice area, yet still out there enough to feel like a destination.  It is very well decorated and service is phenomenal.  The food is out of this world too!  Here is a prime example of a place that charges a little more than normal for Mexican food but does a stellar job of making sure you get the value that they are charging you for."}
{"text":"Busy, busy spot. We stopped in on a Friday night for a quick snack.  Al of the outside seating was full and there was a short wait for tables.  We did find a spot in the bar area.  We had margaritas and the prawns appetizer!  Both were great!!   Our server was very attentive and friendly.  Good vibes all around us....we will be back!  Lots of TV's in the bar area.  Nice place to go to watch the sunset."}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambience and service.  My only note would be that they bring food so fast it makes you feel rushed."}
{"text":"Delicious food and margaritas! We had enchiladas and a burrito, very filling, the beans were great. This was a fun place with great decor. Shuttle from The Boulders took us straight there."}
{"text":"Yet again, Phoenicians, I worry about your taste buds. Have they ever actually had amazing high-end Mexican?  The Spotted Donkey is a solid option for well-executed, if a bit odd, Mexican with a twist. For the price, I expected a table-side preparation of a giant guacamole bowl. It was fresh, and if it's you're bag, impressively smooth. The flavors meld well, but it's not spicy or particularly unique. The shrimp cocktail, done in a 'ceviche' style was certainly different. The 'ceviche' term is misappropriated - it's not ceviche, but closer to a 'campechana.' The addition of cucumber to the traditional mix of avocado, onion, tomato, cilantro, lime, and hot sauce was unique - not in a bad way, just an unexpected, unconventional note among a typical preparation."}
{"text":"OK this was fun.    We just arrive at the Bolders after a six hour drive.    Dropped off the luggage and found this little gem for lunch.   The Cadillac margaritas were refreshing with a generous pour of tequila.   We shared and enjoyed the shrimp cevice and the nacho's.   Oh but not just nacho's!   You are properly warned in advance that they are not what one would typically expect.    Corn toritillas and cheese yes.    But add to it olives, black beans and red and green enchilada sauce.   An amazing concoction of flavors!  The cevice was fresh, generous and full of flavor.     Our server was attentive and as friendly as can be.    We wish we could box this place up and take it home to California!"}
{"text":"My wife's favorite place to eat and I also enjoy the place. Some of the best gourmet level Mexican food in the area. We've not found a better place for fish tacos. Service is excellent and a friendly atmosphere. Also, the prices are good, no gouging high prices."}
{"text":"The El Burro Pinto Tacos with 'Macacha' chicken are literally the blandest tacos I've had in my life.  I assumed 'Machaca' meant some sort of seasoned chicken with dynamic flavor. I was wrong. It was standard pulled chicken (available in any Mexican restaurant) with zero seasoning.  The tacos came with an extremely small amount of Pico (with no flavor), guac and sour cream (all tiny portion sizes). Are they attempting to nickel and dime you into buying more? (Considering chips and salsa are a pricey $7.50).  Got a side of salsa for the tacos, not very good.   Queso Fundido was average. If you appreciate good Queso, I don't think you'll be impressed. However, my fiancé says the Queso is good.  Not being overly critical, this place is close to where I stay in Scottsdale -- I would come back if I liked it.  But if you're wanting some top quality Mexican food, I suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge fan! The jalapeño shooters are hot hot hot and delicious! The fish tacos are also very good  I don't remember what everyone else at my table got but we all walked away satisfied. We also had an awesome waiter who was super friendly -- I'm not sure if that's a turn off to some people, but we had a blast!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here the other night.  Very friendly servers and great margarita's.  I had the enchiladas (one chicken and one beef), probably the best I have had and I am a bit on the picky side when it comes to mexican food.   Highly recommend it. The only comment I would make is that as a non-local it was hard to find the place from the street.  Thank heavens for navigation but even with that we kept driving past it since from the street is seemed more like a business/office complex than a retail establishment."}
{"text":"Wow. Ate here while staying at the Boulders. Great food. Everything we ate was amazing. Food was on the spicy side which I enjoyed! House margarita was one of the best I've had,Very fresh! I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich on the pretzel bun. We were here during off season do there was no wait."}
{"text":"It is the only place to eat mexican food in Cave Creek or Carefree.  Pulled pork Nachos with  Guacamole and Poppers are awesome!  They have great Fajitas as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome guacamole and the tacos are great! We live in AZ and stopped in for dinner when staying at the boulders. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"After hearing reviews, maybe expectations were too high.  Very average-below average.  Have to pay for chips and salsa is a downer, 5 in our party, used to high quality mexican food from Chicago Mexican restaurants, and most were disappointed, the mac and cheese was gross.  Cannot nail the easy things like burritos or tacos. Fillets de puerto was so average, nothing \"especial\".  Not trying to be a jerk, but we had better Mexican at the places in Cave Creek easily.  Nice location and patio, but the food is over-rated."}
{"text":"We went to the Spotted Donkey while staying at The Boulders. I had the enchiladas which were delicious and tried my girlfriend's chimichanga which was even better. But my favorite part of the meal were the donkey nachos. Loaded with delicious meat and so flavorful. If I lived in the area, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, with items on the \"Mexican\" menu I've never experienced before, however was very tasty !   meat loaf w/Green Chilli was wonderful, as were the Shrimp and Crab tostadas. Yummy. Good service, friendly, dark atmosphere, however if it's around a busy holiday or weekend, call and make a reservation first.  Minimal wine menu, good beer though, and food was brought out fast."}
{"text":"I love this place. Have been there many times. The food is great, we like to sit at the bar. The bartenders are awesome and very attentive. It is in the middle of no where but that doesn't stop us from going there at least once a month!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are on point; the servers and bartender were amazing! If you are staying at the resort it is such a pretty walk from the main building."}
{"text":"The Spotted Donkey is located either on or right next to The Boulders. Living here in north Scottsdale I had high expectations for this restaurant, with a yelp rating of 4 stars and over 100 reviews, how can we miss. We arrived after 8pm and the place was still quite crowded, so I am thinking we are off and running to the races! Not so fast!. The service was very good and ambience was fine, however the food was as bland and boring as a hospital cafeteria. I will not bore you with the details, just no real taste to anything we ate. So I asked for a desert menu and we ordered the sopapillas and ice cream. They coated everything with this awful tasting honey. and again the ice cream had no flavor to it. When I see 4 stars and over 100 reviews I begin to wonder about this social media review system Yelp has going on here.  But have no fear I am still a believer, most of the time when a restaurant has over 100 reviews you can really count on yelp"}
{"text":"Service and food are good.  Sit on the patio for a nice dining experience.   Not true Mexican food yet still enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was told that we were going to eat at a \"high-end\" Mexican restaurant. I love Mexican food plus it has 4 stars on Yelp, so I was really excited to go there to eat dinner.  I gave them 2 stars because the service was good, although the waiter kept referring to us as \"my people\". Hmmmm? That was a first.  The menu doesn't offer many choices, and covers only one page, the other side is for alcohol. Ordered chips and salsa, which they offer as an appetizer, in other words it's not FREE like most Mexican restaurants. It should have been though because all three salsas were bland and tasteless. I ordered chicken tacos with rice and beans. Presentation was nice but it didn't make up for the crunchy rice or the watery beans. The shredded chicken on the taco's was ok but definitely not \"high-end\".  My husband ordered a chimichanga. He was also disappointed and commented that the meat was horrible and it was fried for too long.  Personally, I would never return to this restaurant. Maybe I misunderstood and they said it was \"high priced\", not high-end. Regardless, I do not recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"I drove from MN to make sure I tasted their signature Duncan Calor Margareta. It was worth the drive, however the Donkey Nachos were recommended and did not measure up to expectations. Way too much cheese and lacking on flavor."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Wednesday night. It wasn't busy but service seemed a little slow.  I had the Mexican Mule which is their take on the Moscow Mule.  It was tasty. Also had the trio of salsas, the queso fundido and the ceviche. The ceviche needed salt, but the salsas were good. Our favorite was the black bean one. The Queso was by far our favorite I would definitely get that again. Otherwise though nothing really stood out to us. This would not be my first choice of places for a return visit."}
{"text":"The jalapeño shooters are so good!! The buttermilk ranch the poppers are dipped in is perfect! Definitely recommend the shredded beef enchiladas! I always tell people about this place and how it never disappoints!! Worth the 30 min drive out from my house."}
{"text":"Very good experience. The server was a professional walking us briefly through the menu recognizing we were health conscious The coffee and water were always filled and the fajitas were brought table side sizzling. The beef was truly filet of beef. The guacamole was tremendous. Highly recommend the Spotted Donkey."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. And they tried to bribe me with a horrible chocolate cake.  I was staying at the Boulders, Waldorf Astoria with my family.  I heard this restaurant was great so i called to order take out. 20 minutes of calling no one answered.  I decided to go and order in person.  Once was there the host was great. Nice and polite.   My bigger issue was that they messed up the order and didn't include several items in my TO GO order.  Once I was back at the hotel, sat down with family, and was unwrapping dinner I noticed they forgot a few items.  Already 20 minutes away I had to get ready and head back to the restaurant where the host was nice enough to take quick action. Severa minutes later they came out and gave me my correct order.   My gripe is that on to go orders, restaurants need to be more exact.  I think forgetting \"to go\" items is the worst next to spitting in the food.  Also the food wasn't great. The hotel bar food was better. I should of just ordered room service.  It was that bad.   Dear spotted donkey: no need to bribe your customers... Just get it right the first time.  Have some quality control."}
{"text":"We had heard so much about this restaurant but we were very disappointed with the service and the food the first round of margaritas was sent back and the second round was no better."}
{"text":"*UPDATE* I believe that one of their employees made a fake profile to say rude and nasty things to me! They said \"you sound like a giant douche bag. and have no life.\" I think this because it was sent to me by a brand new profile with no reviews or anything and its location is not even in Arizona. Anyone else have this happen?  (This is what I reviewed the first time with three stars) This place is okay. It was very slow and no one was in their when we went. We ordered the jalapeños dunked in ranch and they were cold in the middle. And we got asked by like there different employees if they were hot or mild. All we wanted was to eat lunch in peace not be asked a ton of questions. It took forever for our drinks to be filled and for someone to come get our payment."}
{"text":"We have eaten here about 6 times now!  It is really great!  We live in Canada, but own a house in Terravita so just across the road!  My favourite dishes:  Enchilladas (usually a chicken girl, but always order two beef, you get a choice)  Their classic Margarita is great!  My favourite appetizer now is the shrimp, it is around $15, but I can attest they are amazing!  The staff are great, sorry I don't remember all your names!  Lauren is one I do remember and she is super nice!   I love the outside seating!"}
{"text":"I've been to Spotted Donkey many times and have always loved the delicious food and unique menu item choices. I was there today and as much as I enjoyed the meal I ordered, I was shocked and felt totally gouged by the $9 charge for the basket of chips brought to the table when we sat down. I don't think I've ever been to a Mexican restaurant where I was charged for the chips. Shame on the owners for that."}
{"text":"First time i have been here it was such an fabulous western restaurant, they were very kind and friendly, i love the food it was soo soo delicious I recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican place in the area in terms of quality and service if you want upscale variations on classics! The cocktails are excellent and salads are delish! I recommend the salmon, which is truly original."}
{"text":"We visited two nights in a row on our recent trip to the Boulders Resort. The first night we sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed margaritas with chips and salsa. The cactus heart cocktail is delicious, and the alcohol content is perfect- not too weak, not too boozy. Both nights I ordered the signature shrimp tacos because they were so yummy. The second night we also shared a bowl of the tortilla soup, delicious with greens and tortilla strips.  The decor inside is fun and festive, with pretty light fixtures and wall hangings. Service is friendly and timely."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Barrio Cafe, you may be even a bigger fan of Spotted Donkey. Prices are not the friendliest, but the gourmet Mexican food will make your stomach sing Mexican mariachi music. I started with a prickly pear margarita - que buenisimo! Even though you have to pay for chips and salsa, the chips are delicioso and homemade and the 3 salsas that accompany are very tasty. Their \"chop\" salad was on par with Cowboy Ciao's similar version, and for an entree the pulled pork chalupas were divine. I'll be back soon for more!  UPDATE: As of January '08 the quality has really dived at Spotted Donkey. The owners opened up a new restaurant next door and I think their hearts and minds are there now. We gave them 3 shots before writing this update which brings them from 5 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Some Friends drag me back to this place, I am kicking and screaming because my previous visits have all been bad. I remain baffled at the appeal of this place, where their over salted, flat tasting, premade sauced food is difficult to eat. The chips and salsa remain the staple here. But no one goes out for dinner just for chips and salsa, now do they? If the margaritas were good, we could make an argument that this would be a good place to hang out for drinks. Unfortunately, the margaritas are sickeningly sweet and weak to boot. Ordering side shots, and pouring those into the drinks helped, but turned already expensive drinks into monstrously expensive drinks. The bartenders here, without fail, exhibit no personality, but simply act as if they are working for a resort restaurant which this place is.  No one here seems happy, but simply want to be left a huge tip from the upscale clientele that frequent this place. I cannot think of a more disappointing place to bring guests, unless you sit outside on the patio, which is very nice, and your guests don't notice the bad food and the bad drinks."}
{"text":"Another great meal. This place has managed quite a feat staying consistent over the past 5 years we have been coming. The restaurant business isn't easy but the spotted donkey makes it look seamless. Excellent and authentic Mexican food and creative and inspired drinks make this a must visit destination when we are staying at the Boulders! Thank you to the staff for being so warm and accommodating."}
{"text":"3 stars because the quesadilla was not good.  But I dined again and the enchiladas were slammin! And I really enjoyed the Loaded Mule- a tequila spin on the Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Jalapeño poppers are great and have some serious heat. Good food and fun, casual atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and have always enjoyed our food and the service.  The wait staff has always been friendly but our favorite waitress is Jill.  We missed seeing her today but still enjoyed our Calamari appetizer and the fajitas.  (I had the shrimp fajitas and my boyfriend had the beef & sausage fajita, which I've never seen on any menu before.)  Both were delicious! They charge a tad more than other places but I'd rather pay a bit more than pay less for mediocre food.  My favorite dish is the Tierra y Mar Burro which is filet mignon, shrimp, avocado, jack cheese, black beans, french fries and chipotle aioli all wrapped inside the burrito. Yum!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The spotted donkey!! Yes please! Such a fabulous southwestern restaurant with a mix of Arizona and Mexican food. Recommended by our hotel staff we ventured farther out on the resort property to sample some deliciousness at the donkey. Most Mexican restaurants are not my jam but this one offers more of an upscale feel while still keeping a family vibe to it. We ordered their top shelf margarita with tequila that is only carried here straight from Mexico. The drink was extremely smooth with a hint of smokiness, I'm typically a wine guy so one was enough to give me a quick buzz. For starters we shared the Donkey Nachos substituting the pulled pork for chicken and getting a side of guacamole. The nachos were too die for, the sauce, beans, housemade chips omg so amazing!!!! I could have ordered to more plates of the nachos and been content with the evening. For our dinner my wife ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos, huge portion which she only could finish half of. I had the shrimp fajitas with the sauce and spices this dish is highly recommend my only wish was for corn tortillas and not flour. Finally for dessert we had the fried ice cream and had I known how big it was we would have passed.  Another fantastic property restaurant that makes staying at the Boulders all the more magical."}
{"text":"Awesome staff.  Salad was excellent.  If you are staying at The Boulders it's a good option."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend. This place might have been good at one point but despite good service, I cannot give it more than one star.  Is a little hard to find. It's on the second floor near. E pedregal resort. All other shops seem to have close in the mall. The elevator to get up there is quite dirty   We went for Sunday lunch. We were seated and staff is friendly and prompt. My wife ordered a Mojito which had mint which was not fresh and almost black.  She ordered the chicken tacos. The meat was tender but had no spice or seasoning at all. Same with my shrimp tacos. Shrimps seemed fresh but no seasoning. The guacamole which we ordered for appetizer is not made to order. They apparently make one batch per day.   Our waiter was friend but we will not be going to this place again. Friendly service was the only reason this place got two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential.  Great atmosphere located in a somewhat quiet and secluded area of north Scottsdale without all the crowds.  Unfortunately, the three times that I have been here, the service has sucked.  The servers here lack personality and enthusiasm, and generally seem annoyed at serving you.  Throughout the meal, the service has been sparse with no one checking in to see if you need anything else with your meal.  If you need a fork or a refill, forget it, you will have to get up from your table and get it yourself.  The food has been good every time so no complaints there.  Be prepared to spend $$$ as everything here is over priced for what you get, like the 13 dollar margarita served in a tumbler sized glass filled with ice cubes.  The bartender might as well have flipped me the bird from across the room.  Nothing like paying 13 dollars for a half cup of margarita.  With all the great restaurants in this valley, I refuse to spend my hard earned money at places where the restaurant treats their patrons like second-class chumps.  I follow a three strike rule, and Spotted Donkey just struck out with me.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Let's ignore the fact that my wife and two of my daughters were escorted to THE worst table in the restaurant despite it being half full at 8:30PM - and after making a reservation through the concierge at Boulders. Let's also ignore the fact that the clearly inexperienced hostess exhibited 'attitude' when another table was requested. Instead let's focus on the uninspiring food. Since it is it part of the Boulders Resort, expectations were fairly high, and the food was no better than the Mexican restaurant in your local strip mall. Outdoor dining area is quite nice, and the El Pedregal margarita was quite good. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. Overall, not recommended"}
{"text":"Great for either a snack or a full meal. I don't think I'll ever order Nachos anywhere else. The Sopapillas were also standard-setting."}
{"text":"not a good ole Mexican restaurant.  can't manage to make guacamole properly. enough said.  Too touristy and I think I'm the only non white in the join other than the server/waitresses."}
{"text":"We have taken many friends here for an afternoon drink and apps.  I just love their loaded nachos.  They have delicious pulled pork, a red and green sauce that is wonderful and then loaded with cheese, a little sour cream and some fresh jalapeño slices on top.  What's not to love?  I keep wanting to try other things but get tricked into ordering those nachos every time!  Try them, I'm sure you'll love them.  I love the patio in good weather.  I've never eaten inside because it is Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Poorly managed...felt like Robert from Restaurant: Impossible would show anytime to break up the gang of waiters gossiping near the door...hearing words like \"nasty\" made me cringe yet the enchilada was ok but certainly not worth $15."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with family and friend, 5 in all. Service was exceptional. No complaints there. The guacamole was very tasty, and the chips were thin and crispy. The pork tenderloin entree was delicious, a definite plus. The tacos and enchiladas were packed with braised beef and pork carnitas. All winners!  The carne asada was the exception. Though flavorful, there was very little meat on the plate. When you push aside the pepper and caramelized onion, there was perhaps half a cup of meat, quite a contrast from the pork tenderloin, tacos, and enchiladas."}
{"text":"As stated below, the food at Spotted Donkey is amazing. The help is friendly, but unobtrusive. I ordered the Chicken Burritos, and the waitress asked if I'd like to try one chicken and one beef instead. I accepted and it was amazing. Had a chocolate cake/hot fudge desert which was incredible too."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to eat here and arrived in time for the happy hour.  Of course the wine I like was not on the happy hour list nor was my husbands beer.  Then we tried the 1/2 price appetizers.  We were not thrilled with much on the list of the 1/2 price appetizers but we tried the Camarones Tempura al Alambre.  The sauces were nothing to write home about.  I would not order it again.  For dinner we shared some sort of Mexican stew it was ok.  It seems like the place has gone down hill since somewhat in the last 6 months.  I don't know if it is a new chef or new recipes but you shouldn't mess with a good thing and it looks like they did. Right now I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Ok - maybe my colleagues talked this one up a bit too much! The most I could give this place is my three star rating.   The parking was horrible - thank God it doesn't rain here because I'd be soaking wet by the time I got to the restaurant. The selection was ok, but I didn't think it had the variety it should have. The price wasn't the highest in town, but it certainly makes you think about it, which in turn makes you believe you'd get better food and service. Though the service wasn't lousy - when you charge the big bucks - people expect the best!  Overall cleanliness was ok - but again - not the best I've seen. The portion size and the overall flavor of the meal was also good - nothing to rant and rave about.  Would I go back - I doubt it - not because it's bad, but because it's sorta out of the way and didn't measure up for my return. If they sold baseball hats with their logo and name on it - I might be enticed to return though - of course they'd probably charge 35 bucks for a generic manufactured hat!"}
{"text":"Food came out cold, over cooked and not at the same time...  I would not bring kids back here due to the poor service and the rude staff!"}
{"text":"Have been here for brunch and drinks now....Enjoyed both the food and the super tasty margaritas.  These aren't the syrupy concoctions forced on us just about everywhere else.  These are awesome!.  Love the decor and the staff is very attentive.    Next visit is going to be planned for sunset!"}
{"text":"Took my mother-in-law with the family for a Birthday brunch here last year. Beautiful drive up Scottsdale road to El Pedrigal. Upscales shops, and entertainment in the courtyard. We sat on the patio, with great views of the Boulders, and listened to the acoustic guitarist in the courtyard of the shopping center. Super atmosphere. The restaurant itself has a modern southwestern vibe that's perfect for a more sophisticated crowd. Creative, mexican menu with great margaritas, guacamole and poppers. My mother in law had the shrimp Caesar salad and loved it. A client introduced me to this on in El Pedrigal about 5 years ago. We find ourselves now going to the one on Hayden and Via De Ventura in Scottsdale since it is right by our office."}
{"text":"Do you know excellent service? Jill the bartender does! We were there before they opened on Sat. We wanted a Bloody Mary - she was very accommodating! Lunch was good too! For reasons I don't want to detail, we will definitely be back!! Jill and team know how to take care of their customers!!! Smiling faces abound!! Thanks for adding to our great day!"}
{"text":"Could live on chips and salsa...if they were all as good at The Spotted Donkey! 2 visits in 2 days.  My friends swore by the signature nachos and didn't even share! Great salads, for those of us who overdosed on Blood Orange Margaritas and chips/salsa.  Fantastic service from Melissa - outstanding - friendly, efficient and with a smile. Worth the visit.  Cold Victoria draft (from Mexico) and delicious margaritas. Designated driver. Enjoy the outdoor patio if at all possible. Had to fly back to cold snowy Washington DC the next day. Sad!"}
{"text":"This place use to be terrific but seems to be going down.  Last visit service was poor, food was bland, and overall experience was disappointing.  Maybe they were having a bad night....who knows...but it is fairly expensive for what is offered.  Much better places in the area."}
{"text":"Spotted Donkey is located in a much deserted Pedregal shopping plaza.  We stopped in for some lunch while vacationing in AZ.  The interior of the restaurant is nicely decorated with it's tile floors, wrought iron decor, paintings and beautiful light fixtures.  The staff was friendly and the food was good, with generous helpings.  My order of Chicken and Beef enchiladas was tasty.  It's tough to give Spotted Donkey more than an average rating, having had some excellent Mexican food in AZ and CA.  That's not to say the food isn't good, it is, it's just not the worst nor the best I've eaten.    Overall I would say the Spotted Donkey is a nice restaurant with a good sized bar, nice ambiance and decent food.  If you're near Pedregal, it's worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy. However, that is no excuse to have your food arrive OVER AN HOUR after you order it.   The food is mediocre at best and is a SAD excuse for Mexican food. Arizona is a great place for Mexican food and the Spotted Donkey definitely missed that mark.   The ONLY thing good about this place are the mints which you can grab freely at the hostess counter. I grabbed about 20 mints to be able to feel better about spending my money at this place.  I'm hoping that I won't be spending my night shitting my brains out. Wish me luck!"}
{"text":"Ate here last year and it was over priced. Decided to try again this year. Arrived at 5:30 to an empty restaurant and patio only to be told they had no openings and the to have the hostess take a phone call right in the middle of our discussion.  So we just walked out.  We will never be back.  Would give zero stars if i could."}
{"text":"Nice folks working there, good food, beautiful views"}
{"text":"Always good food in a great decor.  We especially love to eat on the patio.  Try the Donkey Nachos or the Shrimp Ceviche, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best Southwest Mexican in North Scottsdale / Cave Creek area!  Try the stuffed poblano peppers and the towering nachos!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on New Year's Eve. We wanted to try the original location after finding the \"new\" location at Hayden Village. Best nachos we have ever had. However had to knock my review down to 4 stars as the bartender was a little smug and not very friendly. I prefer the ambiance and service at the Hayden Village location. The food is fantastic at both places."}
{"text":"Stupid policy on happy hour. You must sit at the bar for the happy hour pricing. If you sit at a table the beer prices go up to regular pricing. So drink water. Also no chips and salsa. The food is good and fast but the happy hour is just dumb."}
{"text":"Ok...expected the gringo resort treatment and came away impressed by the nacho's and poblano chiles: authentic yet very well presented.  Nice atmosphere too. A tad pricy, but well worth it for the unique treatment of  Mexican standards. Highly recommend it.  Oh and the 'short' plate of nacho's is PLENTY!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife while staying at the Boulders resort in July '16.  PROS: The fried jalapeno shooters were excellent. Highly recommended. CONS: I killed a scorpion that was on the wall right behind my head. Smashed it with my napkin. The waitress gave us a free desert because of it after I showed her the dead fella, but the service was sub-par the entire meal at best. Lots of waiting and we had to request little things like silverware multiple times. Outside of the shooters, the meals were not impressive either."}
{"text":"Chicken Tortilla Warm spinach salad good healthy choice.  Fajitas were also tasty and clean.  Not South Tex MX food in any way shape or form. Cool vibe. Moderate to expensive."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The Arizona Mac and Cheese was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Good margaritas, tasty salsas, easy walk from the Boulders. We would absolutely go again. Next time, however, I would request a seat near the window to watch the sunset. This place gets crowded and a little loud."}
{"text":"Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!  They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably won't be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entree's come, but the medley of salsa's it comes with make it all worth it.  I've tried quite a few of the dishes here, and they've all been excellent.  In no particular order are my favorites: cheddar enchilada's with hatch chiles and rice...spicy! santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy! cod and shrimp tostada's- delicious! shrimp fajitas shrimp tacos  And for dessert: fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!\""}
{"text":"Our THIRD visit. What a disappointment!!   On two prior occasions our food orders were messed up. Wrong meat in the orders of two people in our party of four. Tonight we sat on the patio as the weather was great.  No lighting on the tables.  When we asked our waiter for a flashlight, he came up empty handed. Tonight, a mess-up on a food order once more......!!!!  Soon after placing our beverage orders our waiter, Andres, came buy THREE times in a span of 10 mins and told us our drinks would be out soon!!! (How long does it take to pop a top off a beer and to pour your house margarita??) He also had us waiting for what seemed forever to bring us our bill after he collected the dishes from the table. Dishes are pricey, no condiments on the table (you have to ask), no complimentary chips and salsa (you have to order these items from the menu). We are rather disappointed in our third visit (as we were in the last two) and will NOT visit again despite us loving the atmosphere and the ambiance.  Also, the lighting as you head to the parking lot leaves much to be desired, and if you have issues with night vision, this is an accident waiting to happen. Our lovely little town of Cave Creek has many other lovely places that we shall support!!"}
{"text":"Sloooooooooow service! Love the ambiance and the views. Waiter was a little bit of a smart Aleck. A little humility goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch today with a friend who has cancer.  We both ordered the Enchiladas and loved every bite.  Not for sissies, the sauce packed a punch, JUST RIGHT.  I fought myself between those and the Stuffed Poblanos...another favorite.  And don't forget to share an order of the Jalepenos Poppers!!!   I can't speak for the Margaritas as I don't drink them so if YOU don't like them, have a Victoria draft and dive into some of the best Mex food in the Valley!!!  And, the service was great, as always."}
{"text":"Scotty had great margarita recommendations, worthy of a refill. Don't miss the shooters app, best fried jalapeños. My wife had their special Mac & Cheese. I had pork tenderloin with M&C. A fabulous experience! It was a rare, cold night and we they wanted us to wait 30 min. I walked out, but was convinced it would take that long to go to another place.  Am glad we went back in and waited for a table."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular about the food here. The drinks are strong. Reservations are a must which can be a pain with large groups, especially when you are locked in a resort without many choices to begin with."}
{"text":"I always leave Spotted Donkey satisfied...mostly because I always get the pork nachos to start off the meal! Every dish I have had has been great.  Favorites are the Carne Asada, Enchiladas, AZ Mac & Cheese. Service has always been good, not great...sometimes can be a little slow (table full of empty water glasses probably means you should bring a pitcher over once in a while...just sayin').  Margaritas are solid & beer is cold!"}
{"text":"Great Awesome Mexican Restaurant     Great food   awesome service  Susan the Manager so attentive and sweet Doug the Waiter will make sure your food is perfect and any adhere to Any food Allergies  (they have made my food to order)  and John the Waiter incredible  Go here you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful but everything else was downhill. The Margarita on the rocks was mostly rocks and tasted like the too sweet premix they sell in the grocery store. The chopped salad was good but the main meatloaf entree tasted like spotted donkey. This is one of the restaurants at the Boulders resort in Carefree and the entire staff from the bellhops to the front desk recommended it a little too hard which aroused my suspicions. I have to believe there is a lot better Mexican food in this part of Arizona. Our waitress was on automatic pilot so no help there."}
{"text":"Spotted Donkey - Not the Best Restaurant Experience   The resort staff at Boulders Resort and Spa hyped this place up, which made us excited to have made reservations here prior to checking in at the resort. We arrive and asked for a table on the patio, which would not be available for 20 min, which was fine. We decided to sit at the bar until the table was ready. The bar staff was on point. They were friendly and attentive. The tequila menu had shots that ranged from $11 and up.   Our table was ready and we headed to the patio and were seated with no menus. At least 20 min went by and the table next to us had to tell their waitress that we have not yet been seen. The waitress then gives us menus and flags down a waiter who apparently was tending to customers inside. He was clearly not happy about having to tend to our table. He was visibly overwhelmed and annoyed.   Another 20 min go by and still our waiter has not come to take our order. We flag down a waitress by the name of Kelly, she was awesome! She was super apologetic & took our order. She even comp'd our appetizer and upon speaking w/ her manager, gave us a discount on our overall dinner for the super slow service and inconvenience.   2 tables next to us were also having issues w/ their dinner service. One customer was upset about the fajitas she received and sent them back and was not interested in staying there after that. The other table was having issues w/ their bill, which made us feel like the staff at Spotted Donkey was having a bad/rough night.    My wife really enjoyed her Poblano Chile Relleno. I on the other hand thought my Fajitas de la Cantina (shrimp) were ok. Not the best, but definitely not the worst I have had.   On the shuttle ride back to the room, our driver asked how the experience was at Spotted Donkey and we told him what happened. He mentioned that he had 3 other people mention they had a bad experience there that same night.   We met up with couple at the pool the next day and they mentioned they had a good experience at the Spotted Donkey when they sat at the bar. At that point we regretted asking for that patio seat and not having just stayed at the bar. We were trying to have an intimate/romantic setting, but that backfired on us unfortunately.   The ambiance / decor / view were nice. The bar is awesome. However, the customer service needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"As an Eater, I feel like I have an obligation to travel. Arizona has proven to have a plethora of fun and interesting choices for restaurants and the Spotted Donkey was no exception. I am a lover of foreign foods; I enjoy Asian seafood, European cuisines, and, just for today, Mexican BBQ. I have never tried a Chimichanga before. I have heard from the Marvel Comic Book character Deadpool, who was played by Ryan Reynolds in the 2014 movie adaptation, that Chimichangas were very delicious. I tried them for the first time with exotic dipping sauces and I was transported to paradise within moments of eating the delicious treat. In other words, the Spotted Donkey was the perfect restaurant to spend time with friends and family. It exceeded my expectations and many more."}
{"text":"What a wonderful time. We have been for lunch before, but tonight we went for dinner and it was great. Softly lit ambiance and MASTERFUL cocktails. You must try the habanero pepper margarita."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food.  Not too pricey.  Good portions.  Nice atmosphere.  I'm a fan..."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for a late dinner and were lucky enough to be seated immediately as it was crowded.  Word of warning - if you aren't sure exactly where this restaurant is in it's plaza, and arrive after dark as I did, you may drive around a bit.  I circled twice before spotting the sign (pun intended).   I had a pickly pear margarita on the rocks.  Excellent!  Appetizer - chips and salsa.  $7!  Underwhelming and not recommended.  My meal was the roast pork loin on a bed of mac and cheese seasoned with New Mexico green chiles, surrounded by tempting sauces.  Very well presented/plated.  Pork had crispy, flavorful edges.  Mac and cheese not overwhelmed with creamy cheese, and great chile flavor.  Devine.  Wife had salmon tostada -  salmon on a bed of black bean mango salsa. Salsa was cool and flavorful.  Salmon very good.  Complex flavors.  For dessert we split the soppapilas (sp?) with cinnamon ice cream.  Very nice presentation and subtle honey flavors in the sauce - perhaps too subtle.  $108 for the meal and it kicked Houston's butt (where dined the previous weekend) for almost the same price.  Interesting decor - the lights mounted on framed cowhide which is covered in chicken wire were ... interesting.  Variety of interesting seating available, including some comfy looking curved sofas.  Bar inside showing the Winter Olympics - of which I am just about at overload - but no TV sound to disturb the dining experience..  Next time I'll get there in daylight to enjoy the views and a drink on the patio which looks like it would be loads of fun.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Recommend the donkey nachos and chopped salad for a great lunch idea.  Wonderful service and nice atmosphere.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Best Hace Frio margaritas ever!  They also have very unique but delicious roast pork nachos.  The other food seems a tad pricey but very tasty.  Service is casual and friendly.   Very nice local hang for margaritas and upscale Mexican food."}
{"text":"Since we were staying at The Boulders we decided to try this place. For some reason we didn't go there on a previous visit.  Right off, my wife fell in love with the chips and salsa. I too thought it was amazing. NYC Mexican food is as far from Mexican as Chipotle is to Taco Bell. Everything was so fresh and well prepared.  I was recommended the braised beef tacos and the enchilada for the wife. We both really loved it so much. I was quite surprised about her liking the food since she's picky when it comes to veg food flavors.  I highly recommend this place if you're anywhere in the area. It's a bit of a drive from Scottsdale but worth going if you're there."}
{"text":"It is a beautiful location and siting outside was wonderful.  The food was good.  My husband and I had the fish tacos.  Both of us felt the meal was over priced for what we received.  The tacos came with rice but then were over cooked and unappetizing.  It was a long way to drive for an average meal."}
{"text":"The food and drinks at the Spotted Donkey are consistently good. Sit outside and enjoy the sunset amidst the beauty of El Pedregal and enjoy a margarita, excellent guacamole and some pepper poppers - just right. The meatloaf is a little blander than expected but the Chalupa's are oh so good - with guacamole, pulled pork and some special ingredients on a corn tamale. An interesting menu, great food and a wonderful view. Love their creativity. One minor detriment: the country music that has been playing on the last couple visits. Eh."}
{"text":"Still love Spotted Donkey just as much and had such a nice dinner there the other night, I thought I'd update. My boyfriend and I usually head up there when we're in an eating mood. I'm also glad we can sit outside on the patio now with the cooler weather.   We've created our \"perfect\" order and order the same every time... never fails to impress. We have Silver Coin margaritas and guacamole to start... I add a touch of salt and lime to the guac. Then we share the pork tenderloin over their green chili mac and cheese (amazing sauces!) and their beef fajitas (love the seasoning!). The fajitas include beef, sausage, bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes. It's a lot of food, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to the Spotted Donkey for Cinco De Mayo.  The restaurant was crowded as expected. Fortunately, we had reservations. I had read various reviews and we were pleasantly surprised with or dining experience.  We sat outside on the patio. As crowded as the restaurant was or service was excellent!  Matthew the servicer was always there for us. The Busser Michael always kept or water glasses full and would get Matthew for drink needs promptly.  The chicken tacos and pork tacos were excellent? I Decided that I wanted tequila instead of dessert.  The manager Susan was quite knowledgable on the tequila choices.  I deciding on a Herradura anejo. The only negative was that our guacamole was not made at the table, but then you can't have everything."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Nice area and nice set up inside. Very, very friendly wait staff. The quesadilla was great as were the enchiladas. The sopapillas could have more umph to them, but they were ok. A tiny bit overpriced, but overall liked it and will go back."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say Spotted Donkey is a neat place to eat at although priced kind of high for what your getting. Going to most Mexican restaurants when sitting down at your table they will almost instantly place salsa and chips in front of you and is nice to have while waiting for your meal to arrive, not here! They took our order and expecting the salsa and chips to arrive, it never happened. As I said for Mexican food it's not a economical place to eat and so can at least provide you with such as salsa and chips! I don't mind paying the price although would like to see more value in both food and service. I hope they change their ways because I would like to try it again."}
{"text":"First & last visit. Poor excuse for Mexican food!  Salsa tasted like it came from a can. Service ok but nothing special. Way over priced. If you want chips & salsa you gotta pay extra!  Food bland & boring. There are so many other great options. Try Dos encantos two or Jalapeño Inferno. Much better food & atmosphere.  Pass on this one."}
{"text":"Beautiful view and okay service, though one of our meals was prepared incorrectly and had to be re-made. A unique presentation of generously portioned food, that all looked like delicious, Tex-Mex.   While it was not awful, it wasn't good either. 3 out of 3 people eating got sick, to varying degrees. I don't think the food was \"bad\", more likely some lower quality ingredients. If you eat a clean diet, and tend to get sick when you eat junk, I'd suggest going elsewhere. Chips were greasy, all three salsa choices were bland. Chips and salsa was $8 and we didn't eat it. Nobody asked if it was okay, and we assumed they were complimentary, as most places in the US. In fact, most of the food was not eaten, it just wasn't very good flavor and WAY too much grease. My plate was piled high and sitting in a puddle of grease extending to the edge of the plate. So much so, that when it was served, some grease spilled over the side of the giant plate.    Lunch for 3 was $50 plus gratuity. That's a little much for low quality Mexican food in Scottsdale! I wouldn't eat here again, not even if it was free. It wasn't so awful that it only deserved one star. The view is amazing! Maybe some friends and beer on the patio would enjoy socializing. I realize some people like greasy food loaded up in giant portions. If that's your forte, go for it, just keep expectations low."}
{"text":"I like this place, but my meal wasn't as great as i had hoped.  Margaritas are spot-on.  Vibe is quite quiet and quaint (I've wanted to write that for awhile!).  Very friendly staff.  My bartender/waiter offered several suggestions but I went with the fajitas, which he didn't suggest so maybe I should give myself just 3 stars.  But seriously, a place that calls itself a cantina should have great fajitas, right?  Well, they were good, but not great.   Very good guac, nicely warmed tortillas, but it was hard to find much chicken amidst the mound of peppers and onions, and the sauce it was cooked in was overwhelming.  The taste reminded me of something you would heat up in a frozen fajita kit, not something fresh and authentic.  Additionally, for $18 you would think it would come with rice, beans, cheese, etc.  Nope.  Next time I'll go with the recommendations:  enchiladas, chalupa or stuffed pepper."}
{"text":"We enjoyed visiting the Spotted Donkey while on vacation in AZ. Service was excellent. Food & beverages were awesome. We loved the mango margaritas."}
{"text":"Spotted Donkey may be hidden in a resort/strip mall, but it stands out. The food is always high quality, fresh, and satisfying. We love the Mexican-style meatloaf and the enchiladas.   One caveat--lactose intolerant folks beware, they love their cheese here! Ask for your dishes with light or no cheese. For the cheesy people like me, this is a plus!"}
{"text":"Great N Scottsdale spot. My favorite part about this place is the outdoor seating. Food is very good and service has always been great. We do enjoy this place."}
{"text":"If you are fortunate enough to find this restaurant in the maze of stairs and empty offices, you will enjoy a very expensive culinary treat. It would be exceptionally helpful if there were signs pointing directions to restaurant and elevator for those who cannot transverse steps. I wonder how many people gave up after getting lost. They have a nice happy hour with older clientele. The restaurant is very well designed with indoor and outdoor seating. Service was good, fast and professional. Food is definitely the star here. The flavor is point on and expertly crafted. The drinks are way over-priced. This would be a great place for an evening but expect to dish out the bucks."}
{"text":"Maybe it was me not being from around the area but it was not easy to find the place to begin with. It is located in an interesting collection of buildings at the corner of an intersection and if there was signage out front I simply must have missed it.  We sat outside and service was great. I enjoyed the cactus margarita and despite the striking purple color. The 'shooters' were quite good and so was the Haas Avocado Guacamole. For the main course I had the Pulled Pork Chalupas which was a far departure from the Enchiladas I would usually go for on a Mexican outing.  Not being a fan of sour cream I forgot to pass on it when ordering but managed to work around it when eating. The bottom line was I found the food and service good but nothing above ordinary for Mexican/Southwestern fare. If that is all you are looking for this is a great place to go -- if you are looking for something more let me know what you find!"}
{"text":"Spotty.....While I find their menu good to explore, the service doesn't meet the standard.  We have been on numerous occasions and it is the continuous downside.  They are friendly, for the most part, but just not prepared for the rush. We waited extensively for every portion of our visit from being seated to paying the tab. To get their attention we actually stood up and waited for someone to bring our check and box for carry.  I also think $36 for two adults and one child at lunch (two appetizers and one child's meal) is a over priced, but we expected it beings they draw from the Boulders Resort crowd and is priced at that rate.  If you go, know they are not open for lunch during the week. Maybe only on Sunday and it would be in your best interest to have a reservation, especially if you want to sit on the quaint and small outdoor patio.  We like their gau and the chicken taquitos are incredible."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience eating outside on the upper outside terrace but the food was run of the mill Mexican at best. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Been to the Spotted Donkey in Carefree multiple times and always been happy.  (can't speak to their new location on Hayden as we haven't been there yet).  The drinks are very good, if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful.  Ordered the short stack of nachos, stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time.  All very good and tasty.  One note, everything seemed to be a bit \"saucier\" this time, especially the nachos.  While the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice, it was a bit mcuh for me.  I don't remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke.  Will definately be back"}
{"text":"We are guests at the Boulders.  We called in advance and asked if they had a happy hour.  They said it was ending in 30 min and urged us to get there soon.  We did -- we arranged a ride and hurried over.  It was hot, but we made it.    When we arrived we were seated at a table.  We then asked for the happy hour menu and the waiter... REFUSED! He said the happy hour menu was only for those privileged few who had a *bar stool*.   A bar stool? Everybody is in the same tiny restaurant,  ordering drinks from the same tiny bar, but only those handful of people plopped on bar stools get drinks?  What a crock.  Won't be back.  Won't recommend to others.    Is this worth it to you, Spotted Donkey?  So rude."}
{"text":"I don't typically go to Mexican restaurants but I'm visiting Arizona so thought I'd give it a try. I got the chicken chimichanga and it was amazing! Chicken was tender and seasoned I really enjoyed it. I also got the sopapillas dessert and it was finger licking good! Our waitress and the manager were so nice and inviting! Very nice ambiance and decor too."}
{"text":"We ate here after a round at The Boulders and were not disappointed! The food here is excellent. I had the chicken fajitas and the hubs had the pork tenderloin. Both dishes were outstanding. The restaurant was completely packed on a Sunday night too, so you know they're doing something right. Drinks were delicious. This place is somewhat pricey but I am a big believer in you get what you pay for. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is really a great spot. I enjoyed dinner here a couple times last week. The food is very creative and the wait staff is highlighted by the terrific service from John, Megan and Tony. Really great people. If your staying at the Boulders, this is the best restaurant on the property."}
{"text":"In Carefree, AZ for a wedding so we stopped by the spotted donkey for some lunch.  The margaritas were very good and the tacos were the perfect entrée to share.  We enjoyed speaking with the staff - one lady from Montauk so that was lots of fun!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here tonight on a whim and quite happy about it, but the wallet's much lighter.  Hubby had: The Spotted Donkey \"Chop\" Salad A tableside presentation of chopped romaine, roasted corn, cucumber, blue cheese, cilantro, warm smoked bacon and avocado all tossed together with jalapeno buttermilk dressing, crispy flour tortillas $12.50  It was really good, the flour tortillas was my favorite part of the meal!  They toss it for you at the table.  *Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger  with double cheddar cheese, grilled sweet onion, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard. Served with housemade fries $12.50   Wonderful!  The fries were fresh and hot with the skin on.  The burger was fat and cooked perfectly.  The bun was not bought at Sam's Club!  Warm Flourless Chocolate Fudge Cake with Roasted Coconut and Raspberry Sauce  $9.00  We've had flourless chocolate cakes before and love them, but this one took us for a spin- it had grill marks on it!  Unusual and delicious!  I had:  Watercress Jicama, Orange and Avocado Salad with toasted pumpkin seed vinaigrette $11.00  Nice and fresh, but $11 bones is a lot for this girly salad.  Arizona \"Mac and Cheese\" Rigatoni pasta with hatch green chile, Mexican cheeses and applewood smoked bacon $12.50  If you like the mac & cheese from Z Tejas, you will love this!  Very rich, but a little too simple for a main dish.  Get this and share another dish with your date and you'll be happy.  Fried Banana Wraps with Mexican Chocolate Sauce with whipped cream  $9.00  Nice presentation, perfectly ripened bananas in nice flour tortilla and fried.  I had cinnamon ice cream with it but was envious of my hubby's vanilla and that NEVER happens!  Beautiful setting, nice place for out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Thought the view from the patio would be more spectacular.  The service was reasonably good.  Food is huge portions and very southwest TexMex.  All in all good.  Would have given more stars but wasn't overly impressed with anything."}
{"text":"Took our aunt visiting from Chicago here for lunch on a weekday at about 2pm. Other than the 1 guy sitting at the bar and another single man at a table by himself, we were the only ones there.  We COULD NOT BELIEVE how slow the service was. No staff member was around when we walked in and I was carrying a sleeping 2-year-old so we seated ourselves. We were later told there was a host \"running around there somewhere.\"  It took FOREVER to get our food after ordering too.  However, the food was AMAZING which is why I am still giving them 3 stars.  I would definitely go back ( on a day I am NOT in a hurry) because the food was so good it does outweigh the horrible service."}
{"text":"Fun spot within walking distance from the Boulders! We sat at the bar both times we visited. The shooters were really good - spicy though, as you never know how hot the jalepeno will be! We also both had tacos - good, but too much cabbage? The chips and salsa trio were a delight - loved them all and the variety. The ceviche was mixed almost in tartar sauce, which I don't care for, but I wanted a light bite and that did it. The pork green chili stew was AMAZING. Hearty, just enough spice - you really need to order this!!"}
{"text":"We've been to the Spotted Donkey a few times, never very memorable. Cute typical Mexican restaurant decor, nice outside patio. Fun to go with friends for drinks. Pricier than your average Mexican restaurant but of course it is in a high-end shopping center at the Boulders in Carefree. Most Mexican restaurants you fill up on chips and salsa prior to your meal but you won't have that problem here unless you want to purchase your chips and salsa. The Sangria and Margaritas are are good and they do have a great selection of Tequilas.The food is typical Mexican fare, good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Even though this place is a good 20 minute drive from downtown Scottsdale, it's well worth it once you get there.  My wife and I dined there last year while in town for a wedding at the nearby Boulders resort (Excellent btw).  After one trip to Spotted Donkey, we were already planning our next trip back to Scottsdale just to go back.  Well, the golf and spa were other factors but I will travel for good food.  So our next trip was about a month ago and our two visits did not disappoint.  Be sure to try the guacamole.  Although it's $10.50, it's really good.  HINT: order it without one of the ingredients like onions and they will make a fresh batch.  The second time we went, we forgot to order it without onions and it didn't taste as good.  My favorite dish is the pork tenderloin, which is served over a bed of mac and cheeese and green chiles.  It's delicious and large enough for two meals.    Even if you think it's too far to drive for dinner, the beautiful town of Carefree will give you that Arizona experience you know you want and get you away from the urban feel of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Poor service on multiple visits so it's time for an update.  The most recent involved being seated at the bar with no acknowledgment from the bartender who then left the bar for a several minutes.  No greeting.  No drink order.  Nothing.  Did I not exist?  What if the other patrons at the bar needed something?  For the quasi-upscale places like this, you simply should not experience this sort of thing.  Ever.  I walked.  They're also hyping their Herradura tequila bottled for them, but they embarrass themselves by serving it chilled.  This isn't vodka.  Coldness mutes the aromas and flavors.  And tequila just isn't served chilled anyway.  What a joke.  I was polite in pointing out the issue with serving a premium tequila this way, and apparently they've received that criticism/concern in the past... yet they continue to do it anyway."}
{"text":"Spotted Donkey is definitely a bit pricey and out of the way for your average outing, but it is totally worth it for those special occasions. My wife has tried Baja fish tacos at dozens of restaurant, street vendors and food trucks over the years, but for her birthday yesterday she wanted the one she ranks higher than all others: the ones at Spotted Donkey. Like every time before, the food was amazing, although I inexplicably chickend out (pollo'd out?) and got a burger. It was really good but I regret wasting the opportunity to try something truly memorable there. Learn from my mistake. I have. We will going back next month for my bday!"}
{"text":"So awesome!!  Yummy fajitas, enchilada, guac and queso!!  Only thing missing was a dessert!!"}
{"text":"No idea who has rated this as best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale because this place is way over priced for portion size, no chips and salsa without paying for them (been to 50+ Mexican restaurants and never heard of that) and food was below avg at best unless you like the toilet. $95 bill at this place is insane and that was with no alcohol. They won't see me again."}
{"text":"Chips were crisp. Salsa was tasty. Hubby liked the queso but the tortillas they brought were cold. Decided not to stay for dinner. Service was mediocre. With all the Mexican choices around we won't be back even though it is close."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with a margarita on a weekend afternoon. Great food and atmosphere, with mountain views and quietness. They even let us bring our dog to dine on the outdoor patio. Order the calamari for an appetizer -- I've never seen it prepared so well.   My only gripe was that they didn't offer happy hour prices outside... only at the bar, where nobody was."}
{"text":"Love the food! There is a guy bartender there who has been there for awhile & he is GREAT so don't hesitate to sit @ the bar to eat if you can't get a table.   The only reason not 4-5 stars is we showed up one night for our 5 person reservation & our table wasn't ready even though I could see a couple empties..... so we told them we would sit @ the bar & wait where we proceeded to order drinks & apps, our reservation was for 8:30 & our group was getting a little hungry.  After about 45+ mins, our apps were completely devoured & we were getting ready to order another round... I, (the spokesman of our group) went to inquire about our table???  She said \"oh?  you still want it? we thought you seemed fine at the bar\"  Yeah, I am \"fine\" at the bar, I will make the most of any situation but I did reserve a table!!  WTH?  Well, of course they then seated our party but since when does waiting at the bar negate your request of a table?!    Other than that the food is great & the service delightful, make sure the hostess understands whats going on, she seems a little slow....."}
{"text":"3.5 stars is about right. The crowd is a mix of Scottsdale suburb locals and people staying at the sprawling Boulders golf resort so there isn't a boat load of original character. They have great happy hour specials, especially the food. I found the drinks to be on the sweeter/weaker side for the price tag. The food was better than average as far as Americanized Mexican goes. They had some service issues and were clearly understaffed when I was there. Overall, a perfectly serviceable option if you happen to be in that area and don't want to venture into \"town\"."}
