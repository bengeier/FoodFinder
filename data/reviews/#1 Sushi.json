{"text":"Was craving good authentic Chinese food, while I was shopping at metro center mall So I decided to try #1 Sushi, the service was wonderful very fast service, their prices are wonderfully affordable and their portions are huge. I mean $.75 cents for a full side order of noodles you can't beat that I said! Well then I finally got to sit to enjoy my meal and wow the chicken is so bland, flavorless and the wonderful deal with the noodles not so wonderfully at all they just taste like boiled pasta. So I drenched the pasta and the chicken with sauce and Siracha in hopes that it would add flavor yeah no, my mouth is on fire and it still tastes bland. The only good thing was the rice, yeah the rice cause I mean there is so much science in making white rice, right! Since I'm not for putting my mouth on fire again I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Really yummy! Amazing price! Friendly people. I love this place for a quick lunch at a great price"}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat there when ever I get the opportunity. Delicious and inexpensive. Can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Love this place amazing cheap sushi thats fresh and delish .... People that work here are so nice and friendly. ..."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good Sushi place in Phoenix that doesn't break the bank, I saw this on Yelp and decided to give it a try. The cashier was super friendly, he was extremely out going, and the food is so good, and cheap! My friend and my whole meal with sushi to go came out to 10 bucks!!! You definitely received a returning customer!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab an excellent, cheap bite to eat. At first glance, people probably turn it down or won't give it a shot. It's amazing!! Everything is delicious and you cannot beat the price of the food. They even got snacks like chips and cookies for sale too. Scrape up a few bucks and you'll definitely grub out good here."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, &delicious!! 
Teriyaki bowl is $1.99, fills you up! 
Sushi always tastes great!!"}
{"text":"Great value and good freshness. $13.00 out the door with a tip. 8 piece salmon/tuna roll and a good sized Teri Bowl with veggies; and a large can of green tea. I dinged it a star because it is located in a mall food court. Who goes to the Mall anymore?"}
{"text":"Great place for quality sushi at an excellent price. I only come for the prepared sushi, so I cannot speak about their other cooked/fried items. 

My fiance and I split three rolls and a large soda today for under $15. We were very happy campers. Last time we went before today, the owner gave us free eggrolls--talk about great customer service!  If you want sushi on the cheap, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Very good teriyaki chicken! Super cheap. Totally worth checking out"}
{"text":"Best mall sushi I've ever had not to mention the great customer service & awesome prices"}
{"text":"I visited this place about two years ago and never returned. I had no real reason to go back to it. Do not get me wrong, the food was delicious. I am Asian, and this is as authentic as it comes. It was on point. 
Cut to about a week ago. I went in the Mall again, because of the Torrid store (which was closing and needed to buy a present), Torrid was not open yet and I was getting hungry. So I went over there, once more. Man, it was just, if not even more delicious! We ordered the Chicken and Beef teriyaki with a side of egg rolls and a large drink - for $10.49 (tax included). My husband and I were beyond full! The food here beats Panda express with taste and price! I will try the sushi platters next. Fingers crossed it will be just as good!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat good sushi at an affordable price in the Phoenix area! The employees are courteous and the business is owned by real Japanese. The sushi is really good and their menu has many options ranging from sushi to fried shrimp and teriyaki chicken. I highly recommend it! Sometimes, I just go to Metro Center just to eat sushi there!"}
{"text":"The mall itself is dead...but we took a chance inside and came across this place.

Coming from Hawaii, we were obviously taking a look at the \"plate lunches.\"

Hanalei got the shrimp and chicken katsu combo and I went for the sweet & sour chicken...each cost only &6.88. 

First thing we noticed was that the plates we got were \"choke\" full, top to bottom, side to side. And these were the large, three compartment, deep plates.

Second, the food was pretty good, crispy katsu, shrimp and chicken. The sauces were also good (a bit much on the chicken).

Hawaii plate lunch places should take something from this...this was good food, a lot of it, which is locals see as a good value."}
{"text":"The owner is super friendly, the food is tasty and cheap. The sushi, chicken tatsu, and beef teriyaki with noodles are all tasty and big portions for the price."}
{"text":"I came here off a recommendation for sushi and also good yelp review.  I really enjoyed the rainbow roll.  Spicy tuna was good, not my favorite.  The rolls are huge.  Staff is nice."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST DEAL you will ever find in a food court. In fact it's the best deal you will find for Sushi, anywhere. The sushi is fresh, in fact some of the best tuna/ahi I've had, comparable so west coast (San Francisco port) or with higher end Scottsdale sushi places, at a fraction of the cost. & the cost is incredibly affordable; One teriyaki bowl (& it's AWESOME teriyaki) or one Nigiri roll will fill up one person, but you may want more. In addition to the many items they offer, which are made fresh as you wait, they have pre-packaged boxes in case you're in a hurry, also incredibly inexpensive! In addition to very affordable everything, they also often have specials toward the end of the day that will be 2 for 1 of their pre-packaged items if there's any left. 

The service is fantastic, especially Kim the owner is such a thoughtful bright person, you can tell he's doing this because he loves it, not just to make a buck. He also remembers you after your first or second visit, & offers drinks to the kids or if you're looking in need. Sometimes there's a line but that's because they are such a great deal for good sush/temputa/etc. & they also take care in doing things fresh & right. Sometimes there's a wait for your order, when you special order, but that's because it's freshly done; if you're in a hurry get one of the many choices of pre-packages, which is really cool to slip into the theater with ;) 
The portions are all generous & done well. The crispy Chicken Katsu is a little more pricey at almost $6 but so tender flavorful crispy & so worth it! Although the chicken & beef 'bowls' (which come in a rectangular container) are ample on meat, & also offer veggies (cabbage, broccoli, some bits of carrot) you can always add more veggies for $1 & then you will have ample veggies (I'm a veggie lover!) Their price on shrimp tempura can't be beat. 

The only thing I don't personally recommend, & it's a personal preference, is the noodles, which to me are a little heavy - but then they're super filling; I'm just really picky & prefer light noodles, like rice noodles. Their fried rice is okay, typical, not fancy, but includes some veggies (think carrot squares & round peas) They aim to please & accomodate requests, so if there's not a long line you can even ask for extra veggies with that. For a protein boost you can also add fried eggs to your bowls for $1! Whether you are a student just starting out or feeding a growing family, or feasting for a party, #1 Sushi can meet your need affordably & you & yours won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered Katsu Chicken and I was only able to to eat 25%. Great taste even better value"}
{"text":"Not the most amazing sushi, but it definitely worked for my sushi craving! (It is mall food after all). At $5 for 2 trays, you can't beat that! The staff was very friendly and service was quick."}
{"text":"Delicious Sushi! Very big, fresh, tasty, flavorful specialty rolls that you would expect in a high end sushi restaurant for about $5-8 a box and boy are they huge! The two older Japanese Gentlemen who run it are very polite and often times humorous if you catch it, very cool folks. I don't want to say this is the best Cheap Sushi I've ever had, more like it's the best Sushi I've ever had period, and I've had a lot all over the country..."}
{"text":"Really good food and large portions! The food was ready fast and fresh! We ll definitely be back. Hubby got the shrimp plate with 3 different styles shrimp thy were really good with the sauce it had !"}
{"text":"Good sushi GREAT pricing. Yeah it seem weird at first getting sushi from the food court at the mall but man was I surprised. Prices make everything taste better knowing you're not spending ridiculous money. Stop by and find out for yourself"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an off night but i came in with expectations based on yelp reviews. $2.50 for a teriyaki bowl? Maaaan that is insane so i was feeling a little nervous to try it. You might assume they use the worst quality ingredients to price it at that price. HOWEVER, i was surprised it was actually good. BUT that was the only thing that was good. For a place to have its name as #1 Sushi you expect the sushi to be good. HOWEVER it was B-A-D. Bad bad baaaad. Yes very affordable prices but almost uneatable sushi. Salmon was not fresh, had a funky taste. The tuna was a little mushy and had an even more funky taste than the tuna. So you get the California roll because its a safe option right? Well not here, it's disgusting, the rice is not good even a bit, yet their teriyaki bowl rice its good. If i had just had the sushi this place would have been 1 star but because their teriyaki bowl was good and extremely priced well i give it two. 

Come here for the teriyaki (even though theres better) at $2.50 
But do not come for the sushi, if you are a sushi fan you will be extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place
The food is very good at a very great price 
The sushi there is really one of a kind 
It's made fresh everyday 
The service is very friendly 
I can't wait to go back again
#1 Sushi you really are #1"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service and dirt cheap. I had chicken teriyaki and he threw in egg rolls for free. Food took less than 3 minutes and was ready to go with all accompaniments nicely laid out for me. Really fantastic."}
{"text":"California rolls made my stomach hurt. I felt like barfing but I held it in. Took abot 4 hrs to recover. I recommend them. Try em."}
{"text":"Really cool spot for a quick bite, service was good... Definitely enjoyed, will definitely come back... Love the sushi book menu as well. Lol"}
{"text":"For a small place in a mall we were pleasantly  surprised and left with a smile on our face. The owner was pleasant, made us feel welcomed and offered us suggestions. We enjoyed a feast, tried some very filling dishes and will definitely be back for more. Great job in service and customer satisfaction!"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Metro Center Mall Food Court and it opens early, I was on a business trip and I was really craving sushi one morning, this place is the only place that's open at 9am, not only that, it's also very good sushi for it's price.

Seriously I went inside the mall and all the shops were closed, the whole food court was closed and this place is the only place that's lit and ready to serve customers. So much respect for the owner. Give this place a try, if you happen to want sushi for breakfast."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes based on all the reviews. The place was busy, the prices were good, and the service was very good. 

The food was pretty much average. Average mall sushi. Average spring rolls. Somewhat less than average shrimp tempura. I really wanted to like it more. I had the cream cheese salmon roll and it was pretty bland. The rice seemed overly sweet and the roll fell apart completely. 

It's okay for a mall meal if there is nothing else you're in love with, but I would definitely not call it four or five stars. Maybe 3.5 because they are so friendly. 

I'm actually sad about it because for some reason, I want them to do well."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi. Good sized, especially considering the price. The raw rolls tasted decent, although heavily seasoned. Leaves one to wonder why. Rice was almost dessert level sweet.  I've never had to throw out sushi until this place. Ate a few pieces of my rolls and just couldn't continue. Giving them a second star due to the cheap prices. If you want cheap sushi and aren't picky about the quality, then give it a whirl...otherwise, I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"Look, I am by no means a sushi connoisseur, but I was blown away by this little restaurant nestled inside the food court of the mall. At first I was trying to decide what to eat as I glanced around the food court. I quickly realized that Number1 Sushi garnered the most customers and I was immediately drawn to it.

While waiting in line and deciding what to order, I saw a standard menu and also there were many photos of dishes. The gentleman behind the register was friendly and offered fast service.

For under $5 I got myself a tray of California rolls and a canned soda. I was astounded. The sushi was very good and was adorned with soy sauce, a healthy portion of wasabi, slices of ginger, and a fortune cookie.

For a quick healthy bite, nothing beats this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Go with the teriyaki, I hear that's good. Worst California roll I've ever had. The Crab puffs had nearly no cream cheese and they were over cooked. The crab also had an off smell to it. Even the wasabi was not what I typically receive at a sushi joint - It was light in color and pretty blan. Only perk of this place was the cashier was decently friendly (even though she never smiled), I had my utensils/ napkins & sauces in the bag, and it's cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.."}
{"text":"Cute little spot. Always someone waiting in line. Cheap sushi quick and actually pretty good. They also have some traditional Japanese try it out!"}
{"text":"This place was not good. It's in a run down mall that looks like it was abandoned years ago. The sushi is not made fresh it tasted days old as it had the flavor and consistency of supermarket sushi that has sat on a shelf. Service was nice but thier food sucked. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"OK, Sushi from a fast food place in a mall......that would lower anyones expectations but WOW this place really does a great job, they have good tasting food at great prices.  Usually Sushi places serve really small portions but this place serves more than you expect.  

The owner is really friendly, also he remembers us every time.  

They offer their Sushi for just 2 for $5, and for the Sushi-mi it is just $3.99....but near the end of the day they will also give the Sushi-mi for 2 for $5 also.  

So great deals, decent food, friendly service...sounds like a good place to go again and again...."}
{"text":"This place has great fresh Sushi at great prices for a food court in a mall. It is worth the effort to find it. They care about their product."}
{"text":"Very cheap quick lunch.  The sushi is about par with grocery store sushi.  It is mostly surimi salads and surimi sticks, and is a little bit on the dry side. It's nice to have an alternative to the usual food court fare, so it isn't a bad option, just a different option."}
{"text":"Discovering this place was like finding treasure. Super cheap. Super good, food. The cashier is always there friendly and gets the food out quickly. Definitely worth a trip"}
{"text":"Cheapest sushi ever! Friendly people and great food! Everything is so cheap. Teriyaki chicken for $1.88"}
{"text":"Okay, this is amazing. We got a large chicken katsu and 2 boxes of sushi for $10. 
Like some reviewers said, this is mall sushi, so it's not the best in the world. However, it is probably the best mall sushi I've ever had. Definitely worth $2.50. The Katsu, on the other hand, was amazing! Even compared to high end Japanese restaurants that charge $12+ for a plate. Here it costs $2.88 for a small (regular restaurant size) or $4.88 for a large (double the normal size). 

The staff was very pleasant and the food was well worth the cheap price!"}
{"text":"What the hell, Yelp?  I am going to assume that all the positive reviews weren't from people who had the sushi. They were out of eel and I think the filling I got was more Miracle Whip than crab. It left a nasty, sweet aftertaste. This place is located in the extremely slummy MetroCenter Mall food court, so don't expect ambiance."}
{"text":"I never thought a food court food stop could be so good. Even the low price makes it seem sketchy but the food is actually incredible. 
The chicken katsu is by far my favorite but their teriaki chicken and yes even sushi is wonderful. 
Its worth going out of the way to park at the mall, head indoors and find the place. Dont let the location fool you!"}
{"text":"Very good Sushi for a fast food type place.  The prices are reasonable and it's close to my house. The Spicy Tuna hand roll is probably my favorite here."}
{"text":"I rarely write review before. But now I want to do it to share with others my experiences. I never thought food court food ever taste good. But I found this #1 Sushi is very good, prices and qualities. Not only their sushi is good but they have other plates so good too! I really like this place. Thanks to my son told me about this place. Next time my daughter and her sweetheart come to Phoenix to visit I will bring them here. They love sushi."}
{"text":"Just had the chiken teriyaki bowl which was pretty amazing. The bowl it self was pretty big and the price was awesome also it had a small size of steam broccoli and lettuce which was yummy. I also had a order of crab puffs which I like to try them any where I go out to eat  and compair them, I have to admit I didn't like them but the chiken teribowl definitely made up for It. I have found a New place to eat."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype for this place. I'm not a picky sushi eater but this place was certainly disappointing. Vegas Roll was about $9 yet there was nothing inside except fake crab and cucumber. So a Vegas Roll was basically a deep fried California Roll, except bigger. Then what would a Tempura California Roll look like?? 
Spicy Tuna Roll was around $5. The spiciness came from a thick layer of sriracha!! I couldn't even taste the tuna. 
This place may sound cheap but it's still not worth your bucks. The sushi rolls really suck. If you really want cheap sushi, go to other restaurants during happy hours. 
Regarding the service, I have nothing bad to say. The owner was pretty attentive and friendly. Offered water to waiters and threw in a lot of extra utensils/sauces for Togo customers."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. All the red flags seemed present at first impression - dead food court, sketchy mall, low prices...

I ordered the Chicken Katsu and Shrimp combo. First of all, portions are absolutely huge - I could have easily shared this meal with another person. At this point, I was expecting the food to be \"quantity over quality\" - after my first bite, I was sold. Quality of the chicken katsu was actually better than most sub-par restaurants I've been to. Shrimp was great as well and I especially liked the generous portion, as most places will rip you off when it comes to seafood. Food was obviously fresh, breading on katsu was crunchy & tender, side of vegetables/rice were a good complement. 

I'll most likely give this place a 5 star review after trying out a couple more dishes. The prices are superb compared to the portion of food you get and I would contest that the food is on par with typical restaurant quality."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's probably the best sushi place I've been to. The price is so cheap, which is how Asian food should be. You also get so much bang for your buck. For $5, you get 2 boxes (20 huge pieces) of sushi. I'm a huge sushi lover who can't get enough, but that fills me up. 

I wish they had more locations or were closer to me because I'll live there. I love this place that much :)"}
{"text":"This is one of our fave sushi places for a quick bite and VALUE meal. They are number 1 because of their great  deals we wouldn't step foot in this mall if it wasnt for #1 sushi.

 The owner is friendly and from SF. He knows his regulars and always say hi. They charge $2-3 for chicken teriyaki & the rolls are usually super cheap their premade california rolls are only $5 2 boxes score! 

 I recommend their Rainbow rolls and Dragon rolls  for $7 they are colorful and have pieces of sashimi. We have taken our friends here and everyone is always surprised this gem is in a food court. Your wallet and tummy will be happy here."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best chicken and beef bowls anywhere, of course- I think it's the fantastic price, honestly! For a couple of bucks, you will definitely get value here, a meal that will fill you up, and is quite tasty! They have excellent service here, always super friendly and fast. Not a flashy joint, but when you are a pro, you just shine naturally. Certainly a gem at the mall."}
{"text":"I eat here nearly every day for a reason.  Kam (the owner) is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet,  and he seems to serve food, not to make a profit, but to feed the society that surrounds him.  People are complaining about the chicken being bland, which Imo it's not, you paid $1.88 for the meal!  You couldn't buy bread for that price. Also their 2 for $5 California roles are awesome. It makes a college student like me be able to afford the finer things.  Noones comments are complaining about #1 sushi's more expensive rolls. Nope, they paid 3 bucks for their whole meal and expected food fit for a king.  Also the 1.88 chicken bowl is healthy."}
{"text":"Okay keep in mind this 5 star rating is for mall sushi. It in no way compares to a fancy  sushi place. Okay first: location. It is in the food court of Metrocenter mall. Metrocenter mall honestly is a pretty dead mall. But this sushi place is amazing. They have several different sushi varieties, though most are different versions of the Cali roll. I have been here a handful of times, and I almost always get the 2 for 5. You get two boxes of sushi for $5. 2 boxes is definitely enough to fill you from starving to content. Well at least me... and I eat a lot of sushi. They are almost all Cali rolls, yesterday I got a box with 6 Cali and 2 shrimp nigiri, and a box that had tempura on top.... think it was half spicy shrimp half Cali. The quality is good, I have also had their rainbow rolls before, and the quality of fish is decent. Another thing that I have gotten from the place frequently in the past is the chicken teriyaki. $2 gets you a huge box full of white rice and lots of chicken. It is definitely yummy, and a great place to get a cheap lunch. The owner guy is super nice too, definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what they do but this place is AMAZING! I am an avid sushi eater and believe you me when I noticed this place, I assumed there is no way it can be that good! I mean who eats sushi out of the mall and one of the worst malls in Phoenix if that. I'm telling you that you have to try it! The owner is super friendly and their prices are spectacular. I was full after one roll...less than $6. Love it, they have a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Would have given four stars BUT cashier and I couldn't understand each other. Food arrived with no drink...should have checked receipt. No worry!
    But the Red Dragon sushi roll was spicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Okay so I was REALLY hesitant about this place. Like sushi inside the mall? The thought made me cringe, but it was the only sushi place around my work and I was STARVING. So, I gave it a shot. The chicken katsu was superb, and the spicy tuna rolls were to die for! Aside from the surprisingly excellent food, the prices were soooooooooooooooooooo cheap! I paid $10 for the small chicken katsu (which I didn't even come close to finishing) & the sushi rolls (which I also had surplus of). In summary, I think this is going to be my new lunch joint! I just hope they can survive in this economy especially since they're located in a dying mall. Oh, well, they have my money!!! Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Mall sushi!! Arrrggghh! You would think it was certain death. Not at  #1. It is not a Scottsdale sushi place, but prices are good and the fish is fresh. I have eaten here approx 5- 6 times (times were approx 1 month ago to 3months ago). The sushi is still very good.  I am not sure what the person that said there were only two options of sushi was referring to. They have Nigiri, Sashimi and rolls.  There are other options, but I do not remember them. They also do hot dishes like, Chicken Teryaki and others. The fish seems fresh and portions are very generous.  The owner (?) and cooks/ preparers are all very friendly.

And the people watching in Metro Center is second to none!

I have been to other, so called  'better' places that charged more and did not give the quality that #1 does. 

Note: I am going Wednesday and will update."}
{"text":"The mall sucks and I've heard it's actually going to be torn down and if that's the case, I really hope this place relocates somewhere else! Excellent sushi, friendly service and an overall great experience! Total, diamond in the rough! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here atleast 10 times a month. The prices are perfect for a budget and the taste and quality exceeds expectations. From afar, the place doesn't seem appealing. But please do not let looks fool you. Kim, the owner, is amazing. He makes us ice water as soon as he sees us coming to his counter. Today he gave us free suckers. We have never had a wrong or cold order come out to us. Please give this place a chance. Also, crab puffs are soooo good."}
{"text":"i used to go there every single day!! I always get the chicken teriyaki bowl! sooo good!"}
