{"text":"Extremely disrespectful staff. I normally don't complain but this was just too much: Soup nutsy was my comfort food but I am never coming back here again.   It was the lunchtime line up and I just got to the front of the line. The lady at the counter took my soup request and then started pouring another soup into the container. I ask politely that it wasn't the soup I ordered. She then motioned to the man behind me and completely ignored me while I stood there wondering about my order as she poured the soup that the man behind me regularly orders.   Seriously?! Could you not just tell me someone else down the line will serve my soup while she serves her favourite customer who was just behind me in line? What's the point of the line in the first place then?!?!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried is delicious! A little expensive for 1 person, but the soups are very filling and they give yiu two sides (bread, fruit, veggie sticks) so overall value is good! They have about 8+ soups a day to choose from: meat, seafood, veggie."}
{"text":"Soup Nutsy has probably one of the best lineup of soups that feature rich in flavours and texture. I had a seafood jumbalaya and to be honest, it was the best seafood soup I ever had. Though I think it is slightly overpriced, I got a combo with the large jumbalaya with a slice of bread and a banana, which came out to almost $10. The soup is quite filling to a lot of other people, so I suggest you try it out for yourself! Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"Very yummy soups. Expensive, but average for lunch in the area. Long lines at lunch hour so go early or go after the rush (though some soups will become unavailable). Lots of options so great choice to grab take out with a friend and head to a local food court for lunch."}
{"text":"The soup was average, the customer service was terrible.   Today I went to Soup Nutsy for the second time and ordered a small soup - Butternut Squash and Apple.   When I went to pay, the cashier told me to choose two sides. I responded that I only wanted a small soup. The cashier told me the policy was that I had to have a meal - a soup with two sides. I explained that I wanted a soup, not a meal. He kept telling me to choose two sides since it was their policy to only sell meals and not soup alone. He said I would be charged for a meal even if I didn't want one.  I ended up paying $7.90 including tax for a cup of soup, around 250 ml. Imagine if a deli forced its customers to pick a a soup and salad when they tried to buy a sandwich or if you were forced to buy fries and a drink with your burger.   The attitude of the cashier was a complete turn-off."}
{"text":"I looooove soup and it seemed like the perfect meal on a cold cloudy fall day.  I arrived at the location after 3pm and it turns that its buy one get one free for any soup.  So I ordered the large lobster bisque and new england clam chowder.  The lobster bisque was very creamy but had no lobster flavor. It was very thick with large chunks of potatoe and some lobster but there was no lobster flavor whatsoever as it was lost in the sea of cream and potatoes.  There were onions, green peppers, and a bay leaf is all that I could make out.  It was very filling but not exactly tasty or flavorful, which was a great disappointment considering the premium price.    I paid $14.46 for two large soups and 4 sides (apple, orange, panini loaf, or carrots/celery sticks) which included a discount of $7.98.  I have yet to taste the new england clam chowder - hopefully its better than the lobster bisque.  The other soups looked tasty so perhaps I should have picked something else.   I got 4 fruits so it lessened the disappointment. I think I would go for a medium or small next time, if i ever get around to going back."}
{"text":"Dear Soup Nutsy,  You say your shops offer service \"with less emphasis on cantankerousness and more on carefully prepared soups with a smile.\" Ummm...no. It was more like \"NO SOUP FOR YOU!\" There are staff who really are Soup Nazis.  I used to be a regular customer who would buy your breakfast soup at least 3 times a week on my way to the office. Unfortunately, I will not be going back because there are 2 staff members who tainting the otherwise pleasant experiences I have had there. Today at around 8:45 am I stopped by to buy a large beef bone broth. Usually it is a very friendly staff member of Vietnamese descent or another taller brown-haired guy or a lady with sandy brown hair usually in a ponytail who all happily assist me. Because the soups are scalding hot, I usually request and am given a double cup and a double cap. Because you don't offer coffee cup sleeves, the double cup insulates the heat and makes the cup manageable to carry as a have another 15 minutes of walking to reach work, climbing stairs etc. Without the double-cap, the scalding soup spills all over my hand as I walk and it burns or ends up staining my clothes. I've never had an issue until today. One of your staff, a female with burgundy red hair (who has been very rude in the past) told a short male staff member not to give me a double-cup and double-cap. When I requested these, he told me \"I can't give these to you because it's wasting money.\" If you provided sleeves and a proper cap or cap plug, then I wouldn't need to request these things. I'm not about to have boiling soup spill all over me. It's a matter of customer safety and courteous customer service. I was made to feel like I was asking too much. I was so disappointed that I cancelled my order. I really loved your breakfast soups so this is unfortunate.  I hope you will rectify this for your remaining customers. I am sadly no longer one of them!"}
{"text":"Excellent soup...have dried both their dairy and non-dairy soups. Free bread and fruit/veggies. Several other options on the menu, but have not tried them yet. What I really love though is their Android app. It makes viewing the daily menu on your phone so much easier than having to navigate to their web site. And it's free on Google Play!  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thecc.networking"}
{"text":"Soup Nutsy is amazing BUT on the pricey side.  Definitely a rainy day treat.  My go to soup is the Jamaican crab bisque.  It's a bit on the salty side, but it has some kick to it, has a lot of goodies inside, and is amazing when you dip bread into it.  Every time I choose a different soup, I always wish I got the crab bisque - not because the soup was disappointing, I just love the bisque that much more!  If you love soup, this place is for you!  Don't forget that with every soup purchase you get 2 sides - bread, veggies or fruit.  They're not always great at reminding you, and I've heard of some new customers not even realizing you get sides included and walk off without it.  I usually get 2 pieces of bread - #ilovecarbs   This location is in the food court at Metro Hall.  The line can get pretty massive during the lunch rush, but SN is pretty good at keeping the line moving, so you're not waiting for long.  \"mmmm soup... I mean noodle soup... I mean soup!\" - Joey Tribbiani"}
{"text":"When I forget to pack my lunch or just don't feel like packing it, this is my go to place for lunch. They have lots of vegetarian and vegan options, which is appreciated."}
{"text":"Ordered Chilli .. Chicken Chili.  It was beyond salty.  You could gargle your sore throat with it.     It was terribly difficult to eat something so salty.  Very dissapointed.  It made Wendy's chili look beyond good."}
{"text":"The best soup in town.. hands down! The lines are long during the lunch times but its worth the wait; I would even like it better if they increase they sandwich collection. Well i highly recommend the place; My fav soup is the \"Jamaican Crab Bisch\""}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite options for lunch in the PATH. Great value. For less than $8 you can get a thick, filling soup, along with a choice of 2 sides (bread, fruit or veggies).   My favourites are the Butternut Squash with Roasted red apples, Curried Lentil and Tomato Bisque, Potato Leek Chowder, Creamy Garden Vegetables, Asparagus & Blue Cheese, and Mexicali Tomato Corn Tortilla. All of these are \"specials\" though, and are not on the roster every day. So I like to check their website which is updated every day to list the current menu. Many specials sell out fast though.   Lots of meat and seafood options as well.   Sure, there is always a lineup if you go between noon and 1:15 pm, but as others have said, it moves fast and is worth the wait. Keep your bag and bring it with you next time to save 25 cents. Also, make sure you get a \"frequent buyer\" card - buy 10 soups, get the 11th free."}
{"text":"I think it's fair to call me a regular.  In the winter, I frequent this place at least twice a week.  In the summer, it's down to around once a week.  I suppose I'm a not-so-fair-weather soup fan.  My personal recommendations would be the Beef Stroganoff, the Vegetable Miracle Diet Soup (surprisingly good!), and the Tomato Roasted Pepper Fusion.  The Tomato Roasted Pepper Fusion is only available on Fridays and makes my week.  I count down until Fridays, not only because I love Fridays, but because I know my favourite soup is waiting for me.  The line is long (especially in winter), but it moves fast and never takes much more than five minutes, even when there are thirty people ahead of you.  It's intimidating for new-comers, but what hurried and harried food court restaurant isn't?  Plus, it's worth it.  Bring your bag back and you'll get $0.25 off your next purchase.  Buy ten soups and you'll get your next meal free."}
{"text":"Have been eating lunch there for years. Incredibly good soup. Reasonably priced and a great selection. Comfort food at its best!"}
{"text":"I get the seafood soup at the Metro Centre at 200 Wellington Street West very often and I love it.  It has changed my entire impression when one of the employees dropped a stack of the soup containers on the floor and put it back on the table without washing it for serving today.  The guy looks new to me.  This is absolutely unacceptable as the soup containers are expected to be clean."}
{"text":"I've tried the creole shrimp bisque (which was really good) and the cream of shiitake mushroom ( this was good but not great)  I love the concept but felt it was overpriced. Nonetheless, I'll probably be back because if their veggie options but only when they offer discounts before closing."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great things happening over at Soup Nutsy .  The lines really are always massive over the lunch hours but they move surprisingly quickly. Another nice touch is that their daily menu is online - I usually look it up on my blackberry while I wait. For the indecisive among us, the line gives me some time to sort out whether I'm craving tex mex chili or peanut chicken soup...  I don't really think it's any more expensive than any of the other food court lunch spots.  $6.50 for a small soup combo that comes with a bun/piece of bread and your choice of an apple, banana or veggie sticks. Healthy and wholesome my friends.  They also offer a stamp card for frequent shoppers - I had a free soup combo just this week for buying 10 meals. Also - if you reuse your soup bag and get 25 cents off your meal. Unfortunately I constantly forget mine, but you get the picture."}
{"text":"This is a great place for soup for lunch. Large chunks and rich broth in each. My favourites: miracle vegetable soup, chicken chili, Jamaican crab bisque.  Comes with a choice of two sides, and I usually pick a slice of brown bread and a piece of fruit.   The line up can be long but it moves fast!"}
{"text":"Likely the best soup I've ever had, anywhere. I'm still looking for a better alternative, but have not found it. I take anyone who is coming in from out of town and needs something tasty, nutritious and fresh. A little pricey (can be around $10 for a medium bowl of soup, bread and veggies) but if you have it once a month... it's worth it. Try every kind and be mindful of the legend posted on the site and wall! It'll help you find the perfect lunchtime meal for you. Oh... and it's half price after 3pm! Line up starts at 11:50am or so."}
{"text":"OOOHiiigawdditsAliveee! - Is what you will be saying once you have had a spoon.  Soup Nutsy offers an array of gourmet soup choices that tickle your papillae buds. The combinations are wild and really not conventional  - which makes it ever more fantastical! It really puts a spin on the 'soup' experience.   The staff is really cordial towards allergies etc. This is my 4th visit and no visit has the same experience. This location is only open for lunch until 5pm Monday to Friday. Not open on weekends or evenings.  They always have staple soups along with featured soups as specials and during lunch time , expect a lineup. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food. A combo is a soup and 2 sides. A side of fruit and or veggies or bread.    I have become so addicted to this place it's ridiculous. Now I get what all the Sienfield Soup Nazy fuss is about When you find good soup, it's hard to let go.   fun fact: After 3pm you can purchase a second cup of soup for $2.00. Considering the price is $8.98 (large). It's a sweet deal.   My favourites :  Russet Potato & Leek Chowder - This creamy deliciousness has a lovely aroma and a very erotic mix for a Vegetarian option. With the same yummyness of potato flavor in a rich cream sauce, you will never be able to have just fries again without craving this. I added some lemon and it blended really nicely. Normally I don't prefer leek in any dish but I can barely taste anything other than the potatoes so this ones a win to me. ^_^  Butternut Squash w/Turkey & Walnuts - YUMM. This is just a heaven sent meal on it's own. The luxurious sweetness of butternut squash broth partnered with chunks of roasted turkey is just a world of flavour. Just when you are about to get used to all the soft bites, you get a crunchy surprise. It has walnuts mixed into the rich base. This soup is one of my absolute favorites.It's hearty and the large will last you for another 2 servings.  Tomato Roasted red pepper fusion - Think rose sauce but with much MUCH more flavour. I really like this soup and unfortunately they don't offer it as much. So, if you do happen to be here and see this one on the menu - order it! You will not regret it. This soup is the perfect blend of tomato that everyone loves in a standard pasta - except with more richness and soul. There's tiny dices of red pepper that melt with the creamy broth. I can never get enough of this flavour and often use it to mix with any other dish i.e pasta, chicken, dipping veggie sticks etc. It's a really great oomph to a regular tomato soup.   Avocado & Cucumber Soup - This isn't my favourite but I should point out that he combination is really impressive. It's a cold soup and that is usually a no for me. I prefer to use it as a yogurt type of dish over chicken :p The combination crushed English cucumbers and avocado with the right amount of spices and a hint of cilantro blended in a rich cream is a unique option for summer. I should warn you that it is quite heavy in base and a small was more than enough for me.     if ever there was a time where you could be spontaneous and worry free - at the same time- it would be here. Seriously, close your eyes and pick any soups (with restrictions to your dieter needs and such) and you will not be sorry.   Soup it up folks!  xoxo M."}
{"text":"Although it might easily seem that spending so much on soup isn't exactly worth it, I think Soup Nutsy might be an exception :) Every soup I've gotten here have been jam packed - they definitely don't skimp on ingredients here! The chicken noodle soup had such large chunks of chicken that I had trouble dipping my spoon in...not that I'm complaining of course. Also, their combos are a great deal since you also get a sandwich or salad - essentially 2 (or errrr 1.5) meals for the same price other places charge for 1.  I do have to note that ordering here seems to be pretty disorganized. Even when I went at a time when they weren't busy, it was hard getting a server's attention and figuring out where to pick up the sides and so on. I also overheard another customer who had ordered online getting confused over her food being mixed up or something. So I wouldn't recommend coming during the lunch rush; it must be an absolute mess then. That is, more of a mess than the other messes around here..."}
{"text":"I visit Soup Nutsy occasionally, when I am in the mood for a hearty, satisfying soup. Their menu changes daily and you can find the daily specials on their website which is very convenient.  They have a soup and a sandwich special, but I always just get a medium size soup which comes with two sides (veggie sticks, fruit or bread) and it's a perfect lunch portion. The cost comes to $9.15 including tax which really isn't bad.  If you have food allergies, their website clearly details which soups are dairy free, gluten free or vegan which is a very nice touch."}
{"text":"I love soup. So when my office moved down to the PATH, I knew I needed to try all the various soup places in its maze.   Enter Soup Nutsy. Points for having the soups that day on their web site (http://www.soupnutsy.ca) and also for clearly stating which are gluten free, dair free, vegan, etc!   They were nice to explain what we got with the meal (two items, I believe the choices were either fruit, saran wrapped carrot and celery sticks, or a piece of bread). They explained the bag and how when I returned with it, I'd get 25 cents off my next order.  Tried the West African Senegalese Peanut Chicken. Very good and filling. I will definitely be back to try their other soups!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal with this place is.  Soup is good, sure, there is a big selection, sure, but why would anybody wait in such a long line to get soup?  The good thing is that you get some veggies and bread with your soup - but still the line up is a killer and I don't have time to wait for 20 minutes for a $10 bowl of soup.  If you're crazy about soup - go there, the soup is good - but there are other places you can get soup in the PATH and not have to wait half your lunch our to get it.  This place would get 4 stars if they could figure out how to serve quicker."}
{"text":"Loving the Seinfeld references to the Soup Nazi episode!   Beyond that, the first thing that surprised me was the cost! Holy cow. It was like $9.80 for one of the specials, Creole Shrimp Tomato Bisque. It does come with two \"sides\" where bread and fruit are your options.   The second surprise was how gosh darn good the soup was! Holy moly. What amazing depth of flavour. The bisque was so velvety and creamy in texture without being too rich in flavour. Every spoon was as good as the last! The shrimp flavour sung brightly throughout. And the bread side was very fresh and was perfect for dipping!   Gosh darn I hate the idea of paying $10 for a soup but it's hella worth it! One of the best bisques I've had!"}
{"text":"GUMBO? WHAT? DONE. FIVE STARS. YEPP. alright, y'all you can go home now.   (Kidding!)   I first came to know of this place after looking for places to grab soup for a sick friend of mine who lived nearby at the time. One of the best food discoveries I've ever stumbled upon, as its been four years and I still come back here when all I can think about is a big, tummy warming bowl of well flavored deliciousness and then I read what kinds of soups they have and well...  *ends up teleporting over*   Pros:  -SO MANY CHOICES UGH BEAUTIFUL -daily specials that cater to the meat eaters, veggies and crazed cream connoisseurs -free samples!  -I like how they have the 'pick two items' thing with your soups, it's nice to have a piece of fruit or soft bread afterwards (makes a good snack for later!)  -after three, the soup special! Two huge soups, four sides, $15. BAM.   Cons -after 3 special sometimes doesn't have everything (not a dealbreaker in my opinion)  -semi-expensive otherwise, but on the same page as other edibles in the area (not a dealbreaker either)   Totally worth a try if you're in the area during the non-lunch periods!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying Soup Nazi but definitely not my last, i've been working in this building for two months and never found this place until today. What a great first impression! I showed up at 1 PM to ask for either the seafood bisque or the chicken gumbo as I like my food very spicy, and unfortunately both were sold out - sure enough just like the Seinfeld skit their response is \"no soup for you! \" so I ordered  amazing beef stroganoff, and a medium which will feed me for two days was only eight dollars and came with 2 delicious fresh baked whole wheat roll. Plus when I was paying the lovely Jamaican cashier came over with a medium size gumbo that she had found in the back or something, and gave it to me for free with a wink. I think it's cute when people from spicy countries find it amusing that Caucasians like their spiciness. What an  amazing deal, so now I have enough food for three days for eight dollars. Who would've ever guessed you could get a great deal financially on Bay street?"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for Soup Nutsy, as it was recommended by a friend. There are lots of different flavours each day. I really like how you can check out the menu of each of their locations (they have 3) and its updated for each day. The soup was good, but definitely on the pricier side. I got the Lobster Bisque (12oz) combo with a fruit bowl, and it came up to a little over $10. After previously reading other reviews, I thought the combo came with a piece of bread, but I was told its $1 extra. Probably won't be returning on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great Soup. Price depends on type - seafood, meat and veggie. Expect to pay close to $10 bucks for you soup. I loved everything I tried. Even the basic chicken noodle is delicious. Chili is also good.  They let you taste before you buy - just ask to try it. You also get a fruit and bread with your meal. If you bring your bag back, you get a small discount. They also have a soup card where you a get a free soup. The line gets big at lunch but don't worry - it moves quick. They also note low fat options - beware, some soups are very high in fat."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Is it healthy? No, probably not especially with the cream soups. But it is good and when you do the soup+sandwich combo the price is very reasonable. Personally I would stay away from some of the cream soups as they are a bit too thick for my liking but overall pretty good for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Yes, it is named after a character of Seinfeld. So?  This place is tiny. The layout actually has you go into the store only to pick your soup, move to the left, get your soup, make a U-turn and make a line-up out toward the cashiers.   As Stephanie mentioned, I found myself, in line, then not knowing exactly what selections they have so I sent my partner-in-soup in a recognizance mission to pick her soup while I held to the line. Then when she had made a choice, I did the same. There is no other way to do it, unless you do that once you are there and then you will hold up the line forever. Hence the line today easily made it's way out of the store. Like in the show.   I personally got myself a gumbo which had barley, not a real gumbo in that regard, however it was tasty but you can imagine there are some old grandmas in Louisiana spinning in their graves due to such blasphemy to the original recipe.     Now the one thing to remember that they are not necessarily cheap. A medium \"sized\" soup, which is on the small side is $8 and a large is $9 plus taxes. They try to soften the blow by offering \"any of the sides\" on your side of the counter. Which normally are some bread, a banana, apple or some celery & carrot sticks wrapped in plastic.   True they are tasty and the presentation is alright but I do not think they are necessarily worth almost $10 for a soup. Especially since you might get twice the amount at a Ramen or Pho fast food place for $7-$8 where at least you can seat in and enjoy what you just bought rather than to seat in a smoky (that's another review) food court.   Oh, and under the \"not-sure it is a great idea,\" if you get their rewards card then after purchasing 20 (medium or large) soups you get to receive a \"small\" serving for free. Holy-anti-climatic-reward-Batman!   That means you have to spend around $100 worth of soup to get a small serving. Yes, it beats a kick in the face but I do not think I will be doing that, thank you."}
{"text":"Within the Banker's Bunkers, this place has the most inventive and delicious soups, by far. Being conveniently located under a spacious stairwell helps ensure that there is plenty of room for the 25 people in line ahead of you. There are always about 10 varieties of soup available, with everything from rich bisques, stews and cream soups to the lightest veggie soups around.   I hardly ever go here because I find the lines prohibitive, but if I happen to spy an unusually short line up, I'll rearrange my day to get a bowlful."}
{"text":"Decent soups, lots of variety. My only issue is that they use cream heavily in all their soups. Walk a little further and grab ravi soups instead! Soup nutsy comes with variety of breads, which is nice as well.  Repeated several times, but the use of cream can be a turn off."}
{"text":"Great soup. Expensive but tasty. Usually a HUGE lineup around lunch time. Jamaican Crab Bisque is where it's at. Stroganoff is so so. Hearty Vegetable is refreshing and healthy. A nice luxury every once and a while for sure."}
{"text":"Homemade // Lovely Employees Healthy Options // Excellent Value   Pick two! That's right you can take an apple and an orange or bread with your soup.  Soooo many great flavors to choose from. Cannot thank the ladies who work here enough for all their hard work. Could have had lunch here every day but there were so many great places to try in Toronto.  I must have tasted four different kinds of soup and loved them all.  There are also some healthy options already made in the fridge. Looked like an interesting smoothie, and some juices too.   Nestled under office buildings in a shopping area / food court this little gem is great if you're in a hurry and are alone or with friends who might want to eat something different.  Was co-working out of a friend's office nearby and was craving soup. Will come back again.  The Scene: Healthy, Quick  Destination Rating: 6 Date Rating: 4 Hob Nob Potential: N/A   Strong Suggestion: Add quinoa to any soup if you are extra hungry. Grab and Orange and an Apple and keep up those healthy habits!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked right at the bottom of the escalator from my work place to the underground. Seeing as how I'm lazy all the time, I was intrigued at going here due to its proximity. I then saw the line that snaked outside and around the corner and was further intrigued. If that many people are lining up, then it must be good. That mixed with the name--I had no choice but to stop there.   I went early (I was told never to go here at noon or after) and loved the names of the different soups. I also like that they have acronyms beside each soup letting you know if it's dairy-free, low-fat, spicy, etc. This helped for me as I am lactose intolerant and love spicy soup. I settled on Caribbean Chicken with veggies and wild rice. Being a self-professed snob when it comes to Caribbean cuisine, I ordered it to find out if it indeed was Caribbean soup like my family would make and if it was spicy. Now, the soups are relatively expensive (small is about $7-8) but they come with two sides (your choice of bread, veggie sticks or fruit). I didn't want the two sides and was a little annoyed at how they kept pushing it on me. I mean, technically, they're still going to get the full amount from me. Still, it reminded me of my Italian godmother when she insists I eat so I let it slide.   When I took the lid off, the aroma of the soup had me salivating. Mind you, it was no Caribbean soup we would ever make at home, but it definitely looked like something a Caribbean chef would come up with to serve the tourists. It was delicious. It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked but it still tasted very good. It's definitely a spot I plan on frequenting with the cold weather approaching."}
{"text":"I decided to get a chicken soup here today since I'm suffering from a cough. For $9 for a SMALL I expected this to be pretty damn good soup but was disappointed. It wasn't really anything special and I think I can make something better at home, maybe it wasn't the right soup to get but man that's highway robbery for a soup."}
{"text":"Use to be a regular at lunch. Great hearty soups, healthy sides e.g. veggie sticks, sandwiches, crusty rolls  My favorites were clam chowder (large tasty clams), cream of broccoli, Cajun shrimp chowder, crab bisque, mulligatawny, and Sherry beef stew. Loaded with flavour and yummy goodies to fill you up.  Nice affordable lunch option for people who work downtown."}
{"text":"Amazing soup. Friendy staff. Tons of choices. Free samples. Now you can get a combo with a sandwich, which is a great addition to the menu. Sandwiches are pre-made but still of high quality. The soups are all made fresh daily. If there was room to improve it is in the cream broths...many are full of starch to make the soup thicker."}
{"text":"Yep, we've had the Soup Nazi but this is Canada so since it's a bit more offbeat up here, Soup Nutzy may be more appropriate. I came into TD Centre looking for a Harvey's and that's gone and instead I found this soup paradise with around 10 soups offered each day. They come in three sizes but at around 8-10 bucks a serving, it's a bit pricey considering it's just soup. Much like Baskin-Robbins, you can try any soup you want before you order, which was good because I wanted to try the gumbo. When the server first opened the pot, the gumbo looked more white than red. So right off the bat, I knew it wasn't a true 'gumbo'. Not a bad one. Just not a true one.  Instead, I stuck with the Chicken Noodle and this was loaded with a ton of chicken, noodles and veggies. You can also have two 'sides' which are actually bread or fruit. So I got a thick, lengthy slice of Italian bread and a banana for later. Bread was very hearty although I would have preferred crackers which would have been ideal for the soup.  The soup may be good, but what's the deal with the website? Looked like it done in '96 for Mosaic browsers with the butt-blah interface and the 'online ordering' which in reality, is just a lengthy and confusing form for people to fill out who work in the office towers the soup bars are located. Couldn't these guys get with the times and come up with a site that is just as nice as the restaurant itself?  While it is pricey, the soup itself was very hearty and tasty. I would definitely consider a return upon my future visits to Toronto."}
{"text":"In search of Gumbo for awhile and Nutsy was one of them. For some reason, Soup Kitchens of any kind are located Downtown. Finally got to give Soup Nutsy a go during the 9-to-5 crawl.   2.5 *Star*  Line up, another line up.  Fck Look at menu boards. Soup staff calls NEXT. Place order(soup type, size). Go to 1 of 2 cashiers. Pay.  Oh, we're suppose to choose 2 sides(breads, veg sticks, fruits,etc..)? Didn't look in my bag, charged me double.  Paid me back diff in cash. Next guy had butter, where's mine?  Go to cashier, wait, ask, receive. Looks like I'm a rookie-in-training.  Thought it would be simple & easy.  Cajun Seafood Gumbo  -   Lobster meat(?), Juicy(?) baby Shrimp, Moist(?) Snow Crab, Tomatoes, Green/Red Peppers, Cajun Seasoning, and Rice.  Gumbo looked beige(sorry I'm bad with colors) and quite thick. Good weight to the bowl and tasty enough. The Shrimp had the dried shrimp reconstituted feel. Could have contained Lobster and Crab, but in the mess I wouldn't have known.  I still can't explain the color.   Did the Rice overtake or is it some Cream/Milk? White or Blonde Roux overdose?"}
{"text":"Craving soup and up for a change, I finally ventured out into the path the other day and found my way to the TD Centre where the famed Soup Nutsy was located.  I was initially greeted by a long, discouraging line up that snaked outside the soup shop, inching its way towards the bank of ATM machines. My impatience was immediately assuaged as I noticed the line was moving quicker than what I initially anticipated. Inside the establishment was a fairly simple set up consisting of a counter with rows of soup cauldrons and an assembly line of staff members pouring each patron a cup of their desired size and flavor. All soups come with a fruit/veggie bag + bread for roughly $8 (depending on what type of soup you get as meat, veggie, & seafood vary in price). They provide reusable soup nutsy bags that gives you 25 cents off on your next visit and also a loyalty card with the promise of 1 free small soup after the purchase of 10.   The menu is pretty consistent offering an array of soups and a few seasonal changes and daily specials. That day I had a hankering for some crab so I ordered the Jamaican Crab Bisque. The small size soup is filling for lunch, especially since it is a thick soup. Smooth in texture, the creamy bisque was extremely flavorful with a hint of celery and spice. The chunks of crab meat in the soup were sweet and tender although scant throughout the cup.   Overall, a delicious soup at a reasonable price for lunch in the PATH. I would not consider getting a \"plain soup\" (such as chicken noodle) that you can get for less than half the price at another chain restaurant in the path. This place is definitely worth a try but if you are going to spend $8 you may as well get a specialty soup."}
{"text":"yummy yummy soup.  Toronto's equivalent to Seinfeld's 'soup nazi' for sure!  I had their soup as a catered for a work event. It was the butternut squash and apple soup...good gosh it was tasty. I've never tasted a butternut squash soup like that. It was hearty and filling. My mouth is watering talking about it. The apples were soft lumps you found here and there. It inspired me to make my own version of this soup at home (which in no way will compare to the delicious soup nutsy version).  Our order came with buns, so it does make a filling lunch. Delivery was on time, and soup was piping hot. It stayed hot for the 2 1/2 duration of the meeting!  I will have to check out this place in person! I've heard long line-ups, but who cares, this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"Soup is okay - nothing to write home about.  Lunch queue/lineup's are huge with the Bay Street crowd.  For what it is - it is on the pricy side -(sure they give you a piece of fruit choice of an apple or a banana, and a bread choice) but around $6 for a soup that doesn't taste nor look home-made is a little pricy.  I have purchased here a few times (as there isn't really anywhere in the PATH concourse area around my office that has good soups) - and each time has been mediocre (not good/not bad - just so so)"}
{"text":"If you work in the Finical District, I am 100% sure you have seen HUGE lineups outside this place call Soup Nutsy. This soup fast food chain is only available in downtown and they are scattered around all the Financial District food courts.  All the Soup Nutsy serve the same type of soup with different daily soup specials, but whoever decided to introduce Wrap/Sandwich Soup combo was a GENIUS!  This place previously only serves Soups and one medium soup that comes with two sides (bread, veggies or fruits) will cost you around $10.  Their NEW Wrap/Sandwich Combo with a combo size soup (one size smaller than small) is also around $10 and you can always upsize the soup to the next size for $1 per size higher.  Doing the math, I strongly think the Wrap/Sandwich Soup combo is more worth it!  Their soup has always been good and I was surprised how good their wraps and sandwiches are also.  I personally prefer the Wrap especially the Mediterranean Lobster Wrap over their sandwiches because the breads they use are HARD.  Combo the wrap with a small Lobster Bisque, Jamaican Crab Bisque, Clam Chowder or Cream of Mushroom and you have yourself a legit meal in downtown core for around $10.  If you want to skip the line AND be able to choose whatever sandwiches/wraps and soup you want, make sure you are here around 1145am.  With all the overpriced healthy food or the greasy/fatty Greek and Chinese food within the PATH, 2 meals a week from Soup Nutsy could be a very decent option."}
{"text":"Good for a treat when you're going to a food court and want something a bit more indulgent than a run-of-the-mill burger or general tao chicken. Their soups are generally very tasty, but also very pricy. Seafood soups, in particular, tend to be very creamy, rich and pleasing to the taste buds. But my two overall favorites are the Senegalese peanut chicken and the beef stroganoff.  Public service announcement: if you're a person who likes mac n' cheese, don't buy theirs- it's gross. There's too much liquidy cheese relative to the amount of pasta and it's served way too hot."}
{"text":"It gets only 4 stars because I wish it wasn't so exPENsive!  That said, this is THE place for lunch in the winter. The PATH system can feel like a desolate culinary wasteland sometimes... so why not perk things up and warm your body with the best soup underground? I could do an infomercial for this place.  Like others have said, try NOT to go between 11:45 a.m. and 1 p.m. - the line-ups here get unbelievable! But that's just evidence that the place is good, in my opinion!  I am also a fan of the RM soups, and they are cheaper ($3.89 for a small soup), but Soup Nutsy soups are much superior in terms of selection, freshness and upscale ingredients... too bad the small soup rings in at $6.50!  Let's compare their cream of mushroom-type-soup, for instance.  Your spoon will stand up straight in the Richtree version. There is always a noticeable (somewhat separated) bunch of oil on the top of the soup, even though it is self-serve and it's only a 10-minute walk back to my office... and that's just gross. How much butter has to be in a soup before it starts separating like that? I have to admit, it's really tasty!!! Also, Richtree has \"toppings\" for soup, including Parmesan. You plop a couple of spoonfuls in there and it's like oatmeal consistency. Can you tell I don't like cold weather?  The Soup Nutsy version features Shiitake Mushrooms. 'Nuf said. Start with the right kind of soup mushroom and you get the right kind of soup.  Here is the description of the SN Cream of Shiitake Mush Soup: A vegetarian journey into richness and elegance. Shiitake mushrooms plucked from oaken forests. These are raised to unbelievable heights of sophistication--bathed in cream and robed in fresh herbs and seasonings. It's a soup fit for Kubla Khan and his stately pleasure-dome in Xanadu.  Hmmm.  Description from Richtree? \"Cream of Mushroom Soup\". Exactly.  So, either one is satisfying on a cold winter's lunchday, but if you can spare a few extra bucks, go Nutsy!!!"}
{"text":"If soup had a god this would be it. This place has by far the best fresh cooked soup you will ever taste. they have the staples, chicken noodle, vegetable, but they have some insane soups that are hearty and delish. The seal the deal : you get 2 out of the 3 sides with your order of soup. They are carrots/celery, fresh bread slices (thick delish bread) or fruit (apples/oranges) The soup cost the same a mcdonalds meal but it clearly 10 times better for you. I have been here too many times now for someone who works no where near it mon-fri 9-5 and its only open mon-fri 9-5. I have met by BF here for lunch a few times and have gone over the xmas break as well. The service is really fast, theres always a line up but you never wait longer then 5 mins. You have to check the website for the next days specials and soups. They have chilli as well which is phenomenal. I highly recommended this place. If you don't consider soup a meal, this place WILL change your mind.   GET HERE"}
{"text":"The chicken noodle soup was as good as I recall eating.  There is a line, it moves quickly, they are used to being busy.  If it was closer I'd return often, hope they expand, people obviously love this place."}
{"text":"It's soup!  What can I say? I had their Jamaican crab bisque.  Full of flavours and sodium. I've also had their roasted pepper.  Full of thick heavy cream. I would love if they post how many calories and sodium each soup has and then you can shake their hand goodbye when they go bankrupt.  Don't kid yourself thinking a broccoli cheddar soup here is healthier than a whopper combo at Burger King.  It's not.  People think it's healthier because it's soup.  Ask yourself this; If I blend a Big Mac with some broccoli and nacho cheese is it healthier? Also do you need have to serve the food the same temperature as lava?  I want a hot soup not one that will burn my tongue and esophagus. Also this bag return program needs to F off.  Do you think I'm going to collect a bag to save 25 cents.  Your already charging me 10 bucks for a bowl of blended molten lava do you think the 25 cents matters?"}
{"text":"I first heard of this place in the cheap Toronto eats book. Yes! Long time ago. I remember distinctly traveling to downtown to eat here.  It is worth the trip, whether you are a visitor or a newcomer to Toronto.  I now work in downtown and during the winter, I am a regular patron. My favourite is the Fiery Thai soup. I have also had the Mexican Chipotle Corn Chowder, the Chicken Noodle soup, the West African Senegalese Peanut Chicken soup, and the New England Clam Chowder.  All these soups are homemade, hearty and warming esp on a cold winter's day!  I've also had their salads and their sandwiches. But I now stick to the Fiery Thai soup b/c it is a spicy, chicken miracle soup. It restores you when you are ailing; it lifts your spirits on a cold, dreary day.  The service is top notch! 2 yrs ago, I called to complain about the avocado in the salad b/c it was not ripe. I was offered a different salad free of charge. I felt ashamed redeeming it b/c I am not used to this exceptional, top quality service. This is best practice.  Well played Soup Nutsy and carry on!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place our since it had some very good reviews.   Firstly, keep in mind what their name is... Soup... so you'd think that is what their core business is... Soup.    First time I tried this place, I made the mistake of arriving shortly after noon.  Needless to say I was about 20-30 ppl back in the queue.  My first thought was... well this is a good sign.  So many ppl queued up, means it should be really good.  I finally go to the point where I could order, I had picked up a pre-made sandwich from the cooler, and got a soup.  I saw that they did some taste tests, but due to the number of ppl in the place, I decided not to try any, and just ordered.  I had ordered, there were of course no spots to eat it, so I went back to the office.  The soup was still volcano hot.  However, it wasn't overly flavourful.  Hmmmphf !  Go figure, being their core business, I would have thought it should be the best soup.  The sandwich was good, but nothing overly fantastic either.  I chalked it up to maybe it wasn't a good pick of a soup.    About a month later, I decided to try it again.  This time, I went before noon, was able to try a couple of the soups.  Again, they were ok, but nothing fantastic.  I had decided that I'd settle on one, and took that back to the office.  Again, it was volcano hot, and again, it wasn't overly stellar.  I gotta say, if your business is only soups, I would assume that you'd have something really fantastic.  Again, I was disappointed.   Overall, the price for the meal is a bit high, but I guess this is downtown Toronto.  The soups I tried left me with a, meh, I've had better feeling.  The sandwich was ok, but again, I'd rather pay for a freshly made sandwich instead of something that has sat in refrigeration all morning.  I'm not feeling the love for the Soup Nutsy.... No Soup for me.  I'm going to try other places thanks."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for soup or chili this place is for you. They also have a fridge with freshly made healthy wraps etc. it's a great place. Remember to keep your bag they provide you for a discount on your next order. They also have a membership card towards collecting and redeeming for free soup.   4.0/5 *"}
{"text":"Soup Nutsy is a close-to-work and hearty lunch option for me in the winter time. I don't get it too often because the soup here is ridiculously expensive. The soups I order normally range between $8-10 for a small soup with two sides. I could really do without the two sides in return for a lower price, but this is the system you have live with. Onto the soup itself, I have absolutely no complaints! The heavier cream-based soups are rich, delicious, and above all, flavoured perfectly. The downside is that the soups are loaded with cream and butter, which may be of concern to those watching their waistlines.   The following are the soups I gravitate toward, in no particular order: 1. Jamaican Crab Bisque 2. Creole Shrimp & Tomato Bisque 3. Butternut Squash w/ Roasted Apples  4. Sherried Lobster Bisque 5. Cajun Seafood Gumbo  Tip: keep the Soup Nutsy paper bag and reuse it to store your next soup for 25 cents off the purchase. Also, remember to get a Soup Nutsy card at the cash to register each soup purchase and you will get the tenth soup for free (averages out to a dollar saving per soup purchased)."}
{"text":"I feel like I died and went to heaven, in the Richmond / Adelaid centre of PATH (Toronto).  This is my ultimate dream restuarant. Just soup. Lots of them. Exotics and gourmet. No, that does not mean anything with a lentil.  It means mouth watering selections like Spicy Hot Tom Kha, Creme of Shitake, Cream of Asparagus w/ Blue Cheese or Sherried Beef Stroganoff - to name only a few of dozens. And for you purist, there is Chicken Noodle and Clam Chowder.  Like Chipotle, they keep it simple and assembly line efficient. A recipe for success.  Order a medium size soup, and choose your bread, fruit or a veggie cruidite.  Throw it all into a paper bag and you've got a combo meal for under $8 unless you need a bevy. That's a healthy and cheap alternative to most places you will find in PATH or Eaton Centre.   The only difficult part is deciding WHICH delightfully created soup you want. There are a dozen hot soups and a couple of colds. Who knew you could make a cold Mango Lobster Gazpacho ??  You know Soup Nutsy is hot because the line up is clear outside the door.  Which is why they include a sign at the line up that clearly says, \"Line up here to order or No Soup For You!\" Nice!   Being that I have a weakness for East African cuisine and I want to try West African, I chose the Senegalese Peanut Chicken Soup. First bite - pure food porn. Then, just like after indulging in porn, the guilt comes. The peanut buttery goodness is probably a calorie grenade, but so worth the extra 45 minutes of cardio I'm gonna have to do.  I was so happy to find multiple recipes on the web. I will definitely be making a batch when I get home. I want to share this amazing synthesis of flavors that remind me of Thai cuisine, but really very unique on its own. Must be the cumin versus the tamarind and tendancy to be more savory than sweet like many coconut milk laden Thai dishes.  Sadly,  I can't think of a single West African restaurant in  California :-(     The only bad thing - There are no Soup Nutsies in the US. I can only pray they will go franchise."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I can't believe I spent almost $10 on soup. I visited a few weeks ago, around 11:45 AM on a weekday, and ordered the chilli, with two \"sides\" (if you could even call them that), where my total came to around $9.00, more or less. Again, on soup. Yikes.  If the soup were made of gold, I'd understand the pricing. Then again, if quantity and quality matched the cost, I'd understand the pricing. But, for what it actually was, and what I actually received, I'm skeptical. The chilli was average and on the saltier side, and the two \"sides\" were: a) one small, measly piece of sliced bread,  and b) a few chopped sticks of celery and carrots, wrapped sadly in a small piece of plastic wrap.   As others have said, I don't understand the hype. With all the options there are in the PATH, I'd rather spend that $10 (or much less) on food of greater quality and quantity."}
{"text":"I actually had a Groupon for Soup Nutsy I'd been sitting on for a while, but I found myself in this food court and figured now's as good a time as any.  Soup Nutsy's got a lot of choices. It's almost overwhelming but I finally decided to go with the Jamaican Crab Bisque (\"A smooth & flavourful bisque filled with crab and sprinkled with minced celery, black pepper, and authentic seasonings.\") I was told to pick an accompanying side and went off to eat my lunch.  (As an aside, I've noticed a lot of other reviewers mentioning two sides, so I'm curious why I was only allowed one. Perhaps this was a limitation of the Groupon that I didn't notice.)  It's a decent bowl of soup. It's piping hot, too, so one is forced to eat it with a lot of care. (Better too hot than not hot enough, as far as I'm concerned.) The flavors are decent, if unspectacular, and there is a sameness to the soup that threatens to become oppressive. Luckily, the copious chunks of crab and hint of spice generally compensate. And dipping the accompanying bread into the plentiful concoction is delicious, admittedly.  The regular price for a bowl of soup is evidently close to $10, which seems a little ridiculous. But if you can get a Groupon like I did, it's a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Have been going to this Soup Nutsy location at least 3 times a week ever since moved back DT.   So far I have tried Mexicali chicken, mulligatawny, Tex-mex turkey beef Chili (my fav!), Texas bean medley.   I love the fact that every day has different menu and you can see the soups before ordering, because personally I don't like creamy based soup or plain soups such old fashion chicken noodle. I prefer Chili, tomato, beans based soup.   Also, they have nutrition facts for every soup on the website, where I can see and calculate the macros I'm consuming.  The service is always great every time I'm there.   The soup has not disappoint me so far.   Looking forward to try more varieties!"}
{"text":"The dictator of soups has opened up another downtown location.   The Richmond-Adelaide Centre is newly renovated and it includes a lot more shops and fast food places including the Soup Nutsy.   Today was my first time visiting and the fact that it's been open for over a month, this location isn't as crazy as the one at TD. Well, not yet.   The layout is particularly odd for a business that sees long lineups. I can totally envision people walking up to look at the menu, stepping ahead of others and bumping into other people behind at the cash register. But maybe it might work out. That has yet to be seen.   As always, the Soup Nutsy offers great and hearty soups for an affordable price with tons of variety that suits any diet. Be sure to check online at their daily menu.   For now, enjoy the quietness because I have a feeling this place will be buzzing once the weather cools down."}
{"text":"If you want to avoid the line-up, it's best to visit the Soup Nutsy before lunch time or after the rush. If you can't wait that long, head there and be prepared to wait. But why go, you ask? The answer is simple: they have awesome soups.   You can get a variety of choices that accommodate to different diets such as vegetarian, lactose intolerant to full-fledged meatarian. I've sampled most of their soups but once I find a soup that I like like their Old Fashioned Chicken noodle, it's hard for me to not order it again. But needing a change once and a while, I do love their Jamaican bisques and clam chowder, both of which are calory-induced bowls of heaven; the West African Senegalese Peanut Soup is nutty and spicy, and their Miracle Vegetable Diet Soup is full of flavour.   Both small and medium sizes will cost you less than $10, including taxes. Expensive for soup, yes, but their portions are generous, and you get a small bread bun (whole wheat, sourdough or baguette) and a piece of fruit or vegetable (apple, banana, celery and carrot sticks)  And don't forget to keep your paper bag handy for the next visit. They remove 25 cents off of the final price."}
{"text":"I love how this place plays off the Seinfeld episode of the Soup Nazi - if you were wondering which episode like me its season 7 episode 6. There was even a photo of the Soup Nazi himself which was autographed.   There was lots of different flavours to choose from but once I read out the flavour which was right in front of me I was sold. Jamaican crab bisque. Medium was $9 and change and the size was pretty decent. The soup itself was a perfect texture, not too thick and not too watery. Nice amount of crab meat. Packed with all kinds of flavours. When I took the first sip I was just overwhelmed with how many different flavours I could taste. Salty, peppery, a hint of curry I think. After each spoonful I enjoyed it more and more.  Probably one of the best soups that I can remember. Just a bit on the pricy side though."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I ordered some sort of a turkey apple soup. What I received was a heated glop of heavily-salted starch, heavy cream and butter, with meagre pieces of highly processed turkey meat. The amount of fat that must have been in that thing was incredible. My girlfriend took it home to save it for another time, and it turned completely solid after having been refrigerated.   Anyone who wants to go here for a lighter lunch: don't be fooled. I would rather eat a Big Mac than stomach one of these soups again."}
{"text":"Decided to come to Soup Nutsy since everybody's been hyping up about this place. This place is not worth the hype. Ordered Jamaican Crab Bisque and by the way... I highly recommend that you do not order this. The bisque was too salty and all I tasted was pepper and not the actual crab. The bread that you get on the side tasted so bad and had a rough texture. Given the price tag of this soup, I had high expectations.... This place is definitely a disappointment. There are probably better soups that this place serves so I will try again sometime soon..."}
{"text":"The line always wraps around the corner during lunch, but they handle their work pretty efficiently so the wait is never as long as it seems.   Soups are overly salty, but generally very good. Nice selection of cold foods too!"}
{"text":"Love Soup Nutsy!  The name immediately caught me as one of the few references that I remember from Seinfeld.  Soup Nutsy offers a variety of different hearty and creative soup flavours.  Sure, it is a bit pricey, but isn't everything a bit over-priced at the heart of the financial district?  Many of the soups are dairy-based, but if you're lactose intolerant, I recommend that West African Senegalese peanut chicken soup.  Each of the soup has an indicator such as vegan, lactose-free, dairy, etc.  How it works: pick your soup size, your soup of choice and then pick 2 items as free sides.  The side items that I like are banana (which can be saved for later) and carrot and celery sticks.  I say, ditch that salad and try a warm hearty soup instead!"}
{"text":"My rating's based strictly on the service.  Apparently, you can't get a napkin when you've spent $10.40 on a soup from Soup Nutsy!  The cashier (woman with accent and dark hair) quickly covered the napkin pile with her hand as soon as she saw that I was reaching for a napkin and she wasn't removing her hand away anytime soon.  When I asked for a receipt, she had to ask what I bought and what kind of card payment I used; this was interesting since I was the only person she served in this period of 2 minutes (Note:  I saw her toss away my first receipt printout without even asking if I wanted my receipt).  This will be quite the story to tell everyone hence \"Soup Nutsy AKA Soup Nazi\"!"}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed by their soup game! Came for lunch on a week day, each soup comes with 2 \"sides\" such as whole fruits or breads. The concept was weird at first - if you factor in the price, $8+ for a tiny cup of soup plus bananas & cold bread? Nonetheless, everything smelled so good, I had to give it a shot. I got a chicken pot pie soup, which came with little pie bits you can add in. The soup was PIPING HOT, I couldn't start eating it until I was done my bread. Bread was nice and fluffy and tasted nice with the soup. Soup itself was GOOD. Very rich and creamy; chunky with chicken, veggies and potatoes in every bite. It wasn't a chowder like soup, but more like you took actual chicken pot pie filling, added just a tiny bit of liquid and there's your soup! It was so indulgent and filling, I felt like I didn't need dinner that night. The price on the high end for me, especially if you're getting the meat/seafood soups and the cup you get is a lot smaller than most places. However, you do feel comparably as full when you get a sandwich for the same value. I will definitely come back to try all their other soups!"}
{"text":"Soup Nutsy offers a large variety of soups with the menu changing daily.. I believe you can check online for what soups are offered at each location.  Soup Nutsy can be quite pricey if you order just a soup alone, but the combo is a good deal. For ~$9 you can get a combo size soup and a salad/sandwich/wrap.. which is not bad at all for lunch in the PATH. My favourite soup is the crab bisque.  Remember to go early to avoid lineups and there is not much of a salad/sandwich/wrap selection if you come after the lunch rush.   For returning customers, remember to bring your paper bag back for a $0.25 off your meal! :)"}
{"text":"Why do I keep coming here?  From the very first time I ordered I knew it wasn't very good. At ten bucks for a thing of soup and two sides - don't forget your two sides! - it's a bad deal on its face. But what kind of idiot pays that kind of money when what you're getting is bland mush that is - in my non-expertise-based allegation - reheated from frozen?  Well, this kind of idiot. I've known it was bad since my first fateful visit two years ago, and yet for some reason I've filled up my loyalty card at least four times over. This place has truly mastered the art of *seeming good* without actually being good, to the point that it's choked with crowds of us gullible Bay Street types every lunch hour despite spewing out some truly mediocre soup.  Anyway, some observations.  First, brace yourself for a quote-unquote premium soup experience. You get a nice bag (use it again for $.25 off your next order), a nice little napkin-wrapped spoon and, as I noted before, two sides - don't forget your two sides! - of your choice (apple, banana, carrot & celery sticks, bread of various sizes). This is how one convinces oneself to pay $10 for soup, I suppose.  If you really must eat here, stick to the creamy soups. I have to admit the bisques and other heavy cream soups are savoury and quite good, being unaffected by the (alleged) freezing process. Word of caution though: the creamier soups are RICH and heavy as lead, so don't try em before anything you'll need energy for.  Outside of the creamy stuff, to put it bluntly the soups are ingredients bloated to puffy mush coated in bland salt sauce. This is especially true of any of the starch-containing soups: african peanut chicken is chicken and peanuts floating in mushy rice, tomato tortelloni is floury paste with vague tomato flavour. Same holds for chicken noodle, minestrone and  pasta fagioli (minestrone with a few chunks of bacon thrown in to justify the higher \"meat\" price). Just serve the noodles separately if you're going to have it simmering all day (and then freeze and reserve it, allegedly)!   The starch-less ones are less mushy but still mediocre, sharing the same bland bases (god help you if you try the miracle diet soup and want to actually taste something) with none of the creamier soups' richness of flavour. I know spices are expensive, but come on. These are just objectively bad soups, and you should avoid them.  Don't look to the chili to be any better. It doesn't matter what kind you get - and I've had 'em all at least twice. Especially bad is the chipotle chili, which often (but not always?) has chunks of odd-flavoured lunchmeat turkey. The \"kick-ass\" chili they were serving for a while did no such thing, so don't let the marketing fool you.  The soup is also rather glitchy. Sometimes I've had soups that were clearly mixed together: for example, I used to like the peppery beef goulash and ordered it regularly, until one day I had it and suddenly there were unexplained chunks of chicken and AWFUL discordant flavours - I'm pretty sure they mixed it with the carribean chicken. Similar experiences with the chili and other ones too, where soups I'd had many times suddenly changed dramatically for the worse. I don't know if it's a cost-cutting thing or just mistakes, but they definitely combine soups sometimes to disastrous results.  One thing in its favour is that the service is always good. The staff are very helpful - don't forget your two sides! - and friendly. Also, it's nice to be able to check out the website in advance to see what they have for the day.  To conclude, a metaphor. This place has pinned up a signed picture of the actor who played the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld, expressing how great he thinks the soup is. While Larry Thomas clearly has a certain aura of soup-authority (soup-eriority?) about him, if you think about it he presumably has no substantive soup-related skills or qualities whatsoever.   That is the Soup Nutsy."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a mediocre review. I used to love the soup and would rave about it, but today the soup felt like it wasn't fresh. I had my staple west African chicken peanut soup and the base just felt off. It was too thick and the consistency was not smooth. The chicken was ok but and there were too many peanuts. The bread was better than the soup which says something. For 9 dollars the medium soup meal I got was just not worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best soup in all of Toronto.  I'll agree with most Yelp-ers that it is a bit of a wait so if you can beat the line I'd recommend it. But then again I'd be content waiting 20 minutes for the soup as well.  I usually ended up getting the Sherried Stroganoff and Jamaican Bisque soup  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Meh, not sure why there's such a big lineup for this place during lunchtime weekdays. I hear of this place many times from my friends who work downtown, and I finally tried it out.  I don't get it. Soups are not bad.. They are hearty which I would expect since they charge so much. It was $9 for a combo - side soup and a sandwhich. I got the clam chowder which was pretty decent, and a chicken wrap. They have premade sandwhiches and salads in the fridge which you pick up before getting your soup.  Sandwhich was healthy but I was expecting them to heat it up.. Like how Zoup does, and I believe they make their sandwhiches fresh too. There's also no sampling of different types of soup which Zoup also does. The one thing going for Soup Nutsy is their variety. I just didn't feel like my money was well spent here :(  Is there a Zoup nearby instead?"}
{"text":"VIBE  Not one of the easiest places to find. Go with someone who knows or ask along the way. It's very tucked away in the TD Centre.   But a lot of people know about it and they are sharks! So go early or wait in line.   Make sure you have your money ready. It's not a time to chit chat. It's very quick and dirty here.  Cash works best but they accept debit/credit.   I ATE  I'll talk about my favourite: The Lobster Bisque. That sweet, sweet lobster bisque. Creamy and gooey and addictive as crack (not that I would know). But damn. Oh, and you get two sides; usually, bread and a piece of fruit. Five a day!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Nuts to pay $10 for soup? Yup. But it's soup nutsy! Wish I could get back here for some of that crack loving lobster bisque. Store front location on the Danforth please?"}
{"text":"I just paid 10$ for a tiny really salty soup and 2 pieces of stale bread. This is what a soup costs in a steakhouse like Keg."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have stomach flu so I can't eat anything spicy or greasy. How I got it is another story.  Back to the review. So I was on the lookout for a non-spicy, non-greasy option in the PATH, and spotted the chicken noodle soup here. Initially I thought $9.05 (what the medium size cost with taxes) was pricey. Well I still think it's pricey, but it was very flavourful so I'm willing to forget that for a few minutes. It was good hearty soup. But I didn't necessarily want the sides that come with it--I'd rather pay a little less.  The line was long, but moved at a reasonable pace. Soup of the spicier options looked delicious, and I bet those are more worth the money than the chicken noodle. I'll be back to try those.   This should have been a 3.5 but I'll update soon."}
{"text":"This place is way too expensive for soup. But their Jamaican crab bisque always pulls me in everytime!"}
{"text":"First time here and on an excruciatingly hot day, my buddy decided to have lunch here. I ordered the Jamaican crab bisque which was very delicious! Initially, I was hesitant trying this because most crab soup would have the imitation crab meat (white fish), but not here! There's celery in the soup, but you can barely taste their flavour (I'm not a celery fan). Thank goodness for both perks!   The service was great, I have no complaints here either. The servers also allow you taste the different types of soup they have that day in a mini-cup.  Upon purchasing, there is an open caf area where you can enjoy the meal.   For a small seafood soup plus any 2 sides (apple, banana, orange, celery/carrots, or buns), the lunch cost less than $10 which is quite rare, especially around the financial district. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"I just love to go to \"I don't know where I am going to eat\" food crawl.   Soup Nutsy have so many soup choices and just thinking for to order just makes my head spin... and my Yelp Eating Friend has no choice but to line up, pick the soup, pay for it.. and screwed up the order.....  Busy playing with my Yelp App.. checking in and uploading photo.. no idea what kind of soup I was eating..but really so so creamy..and wondering if my YEF wants to make me fat..   Should have come after 3 pm for Specials? Why we not doing that??   Why YEP kept mumbling that why soup so expensive? Why there's a line up? Why I picked 2 breads as a side?   Why, I don't really know?!"}
{"text":"Located in a food court on the path near Sheraton  Centre. Wide variety of soups available in several sizes. They also have salads. I enjoyed the Spicy Southwest Lentil. The soup is served piping hot with your choice of two sides. Tasty and filling. A good choice for lunch. Prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  This is one of my lunch mainstays. People at the office make fun of the fact I eat here seemingly every day. (But really no more than three days a week.) To be honest, however, I come here because it's not greasy or rabbit food like 99% of the other options in the PATH, and doesn't feel too unhealthy as long as you stay away from the heavy cream-based options.  Most of the soups aren't great. They use too much cream in the cream soups, and too much oil or thickening agents in the other ones. The chilis are disappointingly bland with frequently undercooked ingredients. I stick to the Jamaican Crab Bisque (great flavour but a little light on the crab), Italian Wedding Soup, Aztec Chipotle Chowder and Senegalese Peanut Chicken.  This is a good option for the PATH but if you don't work downtown you're better off walking a few blocks west to Ravi Soups."}
{"text":"Yum! Another soup option close to work. Soup Nutsy is located in the PATH below Metro Hall. Just follow the signs to 200 Wellington. The line was fairly long and there were lots of specials listed on their board, all of which sounded good. I decided to go with the large Jamaican Crab Bisque. The soup comes with 2 sides, displayed in front of the soups, which include large slices of bread, a small bread roll, oranges, apples, bananas, and carrot and celery sticks. I decided to go with a large piece of bread and an orange. Overall, I was able to get in and out of Soup Nutsy quickly. There are tons of people serving soup and 3 cashiers.  The soup was really good -- a bit spicy, not too salty, and good chunks of crab. It goes really well with the bread. I'm a fan. The orange was a good end to a terrific lunch. The large soup was a little too much. I was really full after eating it all.  Apparently you can get 25c back if you re-use the bag on your subsequent visits."}
{"text":"My team at work were ranting and raving about this place for a while so we decided to go on a magical journey to find it one day. Being used to really great home-made soups from my fiancées mother, I was excited at the prospect of finding a great soup place near work. The selection is great but I have to warn you that some of these soups are basically the equivalent of Tim Horton's coffee - they are mediocre at best and made tastier by adding a sh*t load of cream. One experience that really put me off was having the Lobster Bisque (my favourite type of soup) and finding more massive chunks of potato than lobster and also finding shells in every third spoonful!  This place does not live up to the hype in my opinion."}
{"text":"I like the Soup Nutsy but holy moly, they are expensive.  $10 for a cup of soup?  Nuts! (pun intended) The price is defintiely a key reason in why I rarely go, even though their location is very convenient to me.  My favourites are: *sherried lobster bisque (rotational item) - not as good as Lobster Royale, but it's still delicious with the sherry laced through it...however, they've recently added nutritional information to their website and HOLY MOLY it's high calorie; definitely more of an occasional treat *Jamaican crab bisque (daily item) - it's spicy and creamy but still light-tasting, with shreds of crab meat and pieces of celery everywhere; also not too high calorie *sherried beef stroganoff - tasty but kinda thick and gloopy if you let it cool; this one is also super high calorie  Honorable mentions: *they do a solid chicken noodle soup here *the cajun gumbos are good - I prefer seafood over chicken *the chili is also decent but I prefer the one I make at home  By the way, if you use the points card, you earn a free meal after buying 10, I think - but you have to pay full price and can't take advantage of the after 3pm deal (buy a meal and get a second meal for $2 for meats/veggies or $3 for seafood.)  ETA: Looks like the 3pm deal has changed to $3 for meat soups and $4 for seafood.  Am taking this down a star!"}
{"text":"Soup Nutsy is at the food court at the bottom of my office building so I tried it for lunch one day. It's crazy busy at lunchtime!! They have a really good system going though, lots of people working behind the bar, and the line goes efficiently.  Main negative for me is that their soups are salty, but I find a lot of things overly salty.  They have a pretty huge selection to choose from."}
