{"text":"Went for dinner Saturday night. Sat on the patio. The atmosphere was definitely high end and romantic. We had the kale salad, duck confit meatballs and the seared scallops. And for dessert, the caramel upside down apple pie. It was all delicious. I will definitely go again and look forward to it."}
{"text":"Amazing food...try the goat cheese appetizer, brisket biscuits, and cheesecake for dessert :) 
The pimm mule cocktail and coffee martini--both were excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch, haven't had a bad meal. Small and personal but very big in taste and service."}
{"text":"The House is just how it sounds. It is amazing that Matt Carter(Zinc Bistro and Mission) continues to evolve. So comforting and service was amazinng, especially considering it has only been open a few weeks. King crab and smoked gouda fondue! Roasted Halibut! and the Lamb Bolognese was suprisinglyreally good, the lemon marscopone and mint worked fantastically! Patio is amazing weather permitting."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my mom who was visiting from out of town. It was quiet and adorable and the food was delicious. Definitely having my boyfriend bring me back here for a romantic dinner sometime soon ;)"}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend for Valentines Day and it was amazing. The staff was very friendly and the service was very good. 
We sat outside and it was nicely decorated and had a very romantic feel to the place. 
I would recommend it for sure. The food was also good altho not very big portions for the cost."}
{"text":"Oh Holy Deliciousness!  This charming little place has made it to my favorites list with just one visit! The atmosphere is lively and comfortable as well as romantic and a little elegant. Think candlelit dining room and bar, chandeliers, and comfy chairs. There is a nice outdoor dining patio as well. We had dinner at the bar which we enjoyed even better than if we had a table in the dining room. The customer service from the minute you walk in the door was phenomenal! The bartenders were very knowledgeable in their trade as well as the restaurant's menu items. Keith was a master at directing us on the house specialties for drinks as well as food.  For the meal itself, we decided to do several of the small plates rather than two entrees. 

Our meal: 
Buratta with truffle oil - delishly rich
Pork Belly with Kimchi and udon noodle - the combination of flavors was amazing
Short Ribs on a biscuit - (yes, we had pork belly and biscuits in the same sitting - don't judge!) this dish was devine
Apple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream - my husband says this is the best dessert he's had in a while

I can't wait to go back for some of the items I didn't get to....we'll opt for the bar again, it was so much more fun!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there Friday night and has an 8:30 reservation. Got sat right away. The dinner from the Brussels sprout salad through the Swordfish and the Beer Brined Chicken was about the best we have every had....THE CHICKEN ROCKS...the service was perfect and it has the best garden sitting in the city. We met the manager and he took the time to share the history of the house and the chef. Go try this place."}
{"text":"Over rated beyond belief!!
The restaurant setting is unique in its cozy ambiance, but you pay $250 for two to eat good food not the ambiance. Our 30th anniversary, as a visitor to Phoenix, was not something to be stamped out in our culinary diary as \"outstanding\". The staff has been trained to \"sell\" the \"Goods\", but the Goods' are not there to be sold. Upon our arrival, we were given the privilege of being seated in the patio area, provided we vacated the table in \"one hour forty minutes\"!! Our server was very accommodating, well informed and courteous, but the kitchen did not take any notice of his recommendations and most of our food had to be returned for revision. The menu is structured around the fancy names, extravagant ingredients and presentation, but the quality and the \"yummy factor\" is just not there to match the intentions. My wife's orders had to be modified due to her numerous allegories, so in the spirit of fairness, I will only comment on my choices which were presented exactly as described on the menu. The lobster appetizer starter, with a fancy name ($18) turned out to be a few pieces of tasteless lobster meat in some kind of equally tasteless sauce buried in an unimpressive French Bread and accompanied with soggy and limp French Fries. The main course, the stake ($38+) was a lump of un-seasoned meat on a pile of fiery hot chilies and corn (out of a can), with a failed attempt to camouflage the tasteless meat. The reprieve came at the end of the meal. The desert and espresso was well presented and very tasty. 
If you are seeking bragging rights for a night out, this is your place. On the other hand if you are after good food, look for an establishment serving a true gourmet product.

{"text":"Super cute atmosphere - large covered patio with heat lamps and great mood lighting.

The night started out mediocre. We had been sitting at our table for what felt like a long while when some one finally asked if we had been helped. Once they had realized the start to our night was not impressive, they more than made up for it. Our server, Michael, was great and suggested some very yummy options. Before we even got our appetizer he brought out a very light and delicious cheese pastry. We ordered the brisket to start - very good!

Throughout our meal not only was Michael very attentive, but the manager, Watson, had been out a few times to check on us. It always makes you feel good when a manager gives some undivided attention.

Dinner was very delicious - I would recommend the filet. It was cooked perfectly - exactly how we had asked. To top off the awesome meal, both Michael and the manager came back out with a little sample of a dessert cookie and an after dinner liquor. We will definitely be back for future vacations - maybe even once more before we leave to head back home.

Thank you Michael and Watson for the great service and great experience!"}
{"text":"We dined @ House Brasserie this weekend for the second time. We love the atmosphere and when it gets a bit cooler here in AZ, the outdoor seating will be a wonderful place to enjoy a meal.
We ordered 4 appetizers to share:  Steak Tartare was delicious; Foie Gras was pretty good; House Brisket and Biscuits was fine but nothing special and the Duck Meatballs were terrible - dry and odd flavor. 
Our entrees were delicious - Scallops and Halibut - both presentations were beautiful and the fish was cooked perfectly - very moist. Ordered 2 desserts - Chocolate Budino which was good and Apple Upside Down Cake which was good but the delicate flavor of the cake was a bit overpowered by the strong flavor of the Pistachio ice cream, which was delicious. 
Wine list is very small BTW. They offer @ 4  \"inexpensive\" ($70) bottles and the rest are over $100."}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I've had the privilege of meeting many of the people that work here at one of the nearby bars I frequented while I worked on a project in Phoenix.

This place has an awesome front patio, and it's off-the-beaten path so you don't get the street traffic that plagues a lot of other outdoor patios.

On my most recent visit (only my 4th overall), I was here for a roll-off dinner with friends and co-workers as my almost three year stint in Phoenix was coming to a close. We were seated on the outside patio in the corner. The staff promptly came out and greeted us and made sure we were taken care of.

For our group of nine, they put together a great sample platter of appetizers and charcuterie. For dinner I opted for the Lamb Ragout. And for dessert, they again put together an amazing dessert sampler for us.

Needless to say, I am loving this area in Old Town. The food from House and other restaurants in this area are eons better than the other areas in Old Town, namely north and east Old Town. Great food and atmosphere.

All-in-all, this was a wonderful experience with great friends and co-workers, great food, and an awesome staff. Thanks to Tom, Tommy, Ren√©e, Debbie, Heather, Watson, and others for making my farewell dinner such a memorable one! I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Another overpriced and overrated  restaurant in the Valley.  Had an arugula salad that appeared mixed with other lettuce - was overly dressed, to the point of have soggy veggies.  Followed by the halibut which had a strangely metallic taste to it - definitely pass on this.  Not worth the splurge.Lackluster in my book, perhaps more of a 1 1/2 star place.

The ambiance is quaint, the service good - the waitresses wore matching dresses, but with a lower than necessary neckline, revealing more than necessary.  Easy parking."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places that we have found in Scottsdale! The service was top notch and the food was impeccable! The drinks were very well made and their specialty cocktails did not disappoint. The food was fantastic! We split the daily special and loved it. The GM came over to our table to personally welcome us and our server was great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously AMAZING. first off, 5 stars for the service she was so sweet and had wonderful reccomendations pertaining to the menu and drinks. She also gave us the history of the building which was really cool and was just all around one of the best servers ive ever had. 

The food also gets 5 stars. The flavors are unique and complex. You feel as if the chef is in that kitchen cooking every dish to impress you. The pork cake (?) Had the perfect amount of crunch and savory flavor paired with a bitter arugula blend for a contrasting flavor pairing. The buretta was soft and creamy and their pomegranate jam is so delish!!! 

The atmosphere makes you feel as if you are on vacation at a little cafe in france. Its really something else. Cant wait to return for dinner on the patio. An extra kudo for finding out that amazing server we had?? It was her first day out of training. That blew me away!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and saw the great reviews so i had to check it out. Let me just say....awesome place.

The staff was friendly and helpful, the food was delicious, and the decor and feel of the resturant was fantastic. I was a bit nervous that it would be to classy for my casually dressed family, but they had no problem and treated us like royalty.

Highly recommend.  Im excited to try put there sister establishments soon. 

Keep doing what your doing!"}
{"text":"I have been to House many times for dinner and drinks and it is outstanding to say the least. My wife and I wanted to have a small reception for our friends and family in a unique outdoor setting. House was the PERFECT place. I have been in the bar/restaurant business for over 15 years and this was the easiest planning I have ever done. Service was A+ and Chef Matt Carters food was OUTSTANDING. This is a perfect place to go for a romantic dinner, business lunch, Sat/Sun brunch, or hold a small reception/shower/reunion on their patio. What a great spot all around. If you haven't tried House you are really missing out."}
{"text":"Love this place!!
Absolutely Amazing appetizers & ambience! Service is great & staff is friendly!
One thing is entrees are not as incredible as appetizers
Totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"So, I went on Saturday night, tried to sit at the bar, but the seats were so tight there was no way one could be comfortable.  On top of it, the bartender spent about 5+ minutes chatting with someone who came up AFTER I sat down, completely ignored me.  I got up and walked out.  Too bad as it came recommended."}
{"text":"Used to live in Scottsdale for years...back on spring break with friends.  Heard this was special.  It was off the charts with great covered quiet patio seating, excellent wines, amazing small plates.....black kale salad so good we ordered it again before entrees...scallops just right. Filet done to perfection. Definitely leave the kids home....even teens.  One of best dining experiences I have had."}
{"text":"The food is amazing Chef Matt Carter certainly knows what he is doing with his new concept. The menu is well-rounded and has a bit of European influence, with a touch of South American and Asian if that makes sense. Pretty much a little bit of everything. 

The owners did an amazing job decorating what I came to find out was the second oldest home in Scottsdale. A truly beautiful dining experience. The bar is lively and fun, yet the patio is intimately different in a way that makes you feel like you aren't i the Scottsdale tourist district. 

We were greeted with complimentary champagne upon arrival and enjoyed the most fabulous cocktails and shared plates at the bar before seating (the bar menu is ridiculous). Bartenders have tons of personality and you can see how much they pay attention to the details of their craft with the way they make their cocktails and one even showed us some of the many syrups and liquors they make in \"House\". 

We then moved to one of the Cabana tables by the front of the restaurant (closest to Main St). It felt like we had our own private dining room in the middle of a candle lit garden setting. We continued with some very competitively priced reserved wines and even worked our way into their extensive beer list. Our server explained that the dining style of \"The House\" was to order a few of the larger Entree/Main Dishes along with several sides and shared plates to accompany them for the group to enjoy the meal in a family style environment while also giving everyone at the table the opportunity to both try and taste everything was the best way to go. Our server certainly gave us the right direction because every plate left empty and everyone loved everything. 

Several people ordered dessert which all looked amazing, but I saved myself for what our server said was \"The House Irish Coffee\". I have been to the Buena Vista in San Francisco where this drink was created, but their version was absolutely unreal. I am not sure exactly which person working at \"The House\" came up with the recipe for that cocktail but I need to shake their had because they truly revolutionized an amazing classic in their own special way. Perfect nightcap to an amazing evening with great friends."}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting in Scottsdale  for a bachelorette party.  (we should have gone to vegas instead lol)  We decided to come here the first night and i have to say i was not impressed.  We were told this was the best restaurant in the city but i surely did not think so and neither did half my freinds.  Our waiter was very nice and the outside seating was nice.  We were able to get a large table under the tent closest to the road so it felt a little more secluded.  I ordered the crab leg appetizer and found that it was very over cooked and rubbery and tasted as if they were cooking it with kerosine.  Then i ordered the halibut and the only thing i really enjoyed becasue my fish was over cooked was the mashed potatoes it sat on.  Their mixed specialty drinks were horrible.  Stick with wine cuz they cant screw that up at least lol.  All in all i would not recommend this place to anyone.  They do not do well with larger partys since half our table got our food and the other half waited 20 minutes before theirs arrived.  So we were sitting there with our food getting cold waiting for the rest of the people to be served.  Also i am not sure what is with Arizona water but UGH gross.  Stick with bottled and sparkling water.  All in all i would say the best part of Scottsdale was the weather and coming home lol.  Very over rated!"}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and service. Oh and don't forget the cocktails. Really enjoyed the beef brisket biscuit and the jerk chicken. Kale salad was tasty too. My only complaint is on the cheese plate, the piece of cheese + bread was pricey for the amount you receive. Our waitress was wonderful and I'm sorry I don't remember her name. She gave great suggestions and spaced our food delivery out wonderfully. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience, I had a work group of 12 people scheduled for dinner on a Sunday night, got to the House, no reservation in there system, my admin in Chicago dropped the ball, I'll deal with that later, the staff at the restaurant gave a big \"it's not a problem give us a few minutes to set the table\" all is good. We order cocktails really good from beers, martinis and mules all excellent. Apps around the table fantastic. Salad and soups came out quickly, then we had a delay for entrees, the manager comes out and informs us that there POS system had crashed, not good! But the team recovered quickly steaks were \"perfect\" other entrees way above average. Also the patios on a nice October night is down right beautiful. I highly recommend the House Brasserie!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed!  Menu is unique and hard to pick just one dish to try.  A must do in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Go here for the ambiance. Seriously. If you are looking for a date night, this is it. 

The food is great, the staff are very knowledgeable, and me and my dining partner felt satisfied by the food and beverage, along with the staff."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and had the chimichurri skirt steak and it was really good. Place has a really cool atmosphere on the patio and good service. I had a lot of friends in town from LA and Vegas and they said they enjoyed the place as well, have to trust their opinion when it comes to food."}
{"text":"From the cocktails, to the appetizers, to the main course!  This place will make you feel at home (no pun intended) and make you want to come back.  Service is phenomenal and the price is totally in range.  Bartenders keep it lively so feel free to go in for just drinks too.  The recipes they come up with are simply awesome!  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Read their reviews and looked up their website.  4 of us showed up today for brunch to a COMPLETELY empty restaurant.  We asked for the table in front next to the window.  Next thing we knew the rude hostess was ushering us to outside seating.  NOTE: it is cloudy and raining today.  The group consisted of 4 / 3 women in their 50's and 60's.  No one was interested in sitting outside on a day like this.  We again asked for the table inside the empty restaurant and she then told us that they were completely booked.  IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY.  I am assuming it was booked for a party or something, but shouldn't you post that on your Facebook page or on your website?  It was handled poorly by their staff and especially the hostess.  WOULD NOT EVEN CONSIDER RETURNING.  Guess what folks... great restaurants are a dime a dozen here in the Valley.  We walked without even looking back."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful dinner, great service, good wine list and very nice ambience!  I would highly recommend The House for the excellent main courses and side dishes. I personally wasn't a fan of a couple of appetizers, as I thought they had too many flavors (ahi tuna), but every main course that our group of 14 had were praised by every person. I will definitely go back when I am in Scottsdale and will recommend to all my business partners!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! My boyfriend decided to take me here for dinner on New Years Eve. He had been here with his family before but it was my first time. We sat outside under white tents that had heaters, which were actually very warm and nice to sit outside. The patio is so romantic, all tables are candle lit and the fireplace is beautifully decorated too. Our server came to our table with a sparkler and a complimentary bottle of Perrier Jouet...... WHAT I SAID ....never have I heard of such a thing, and I use to be a server back in my younger days:) . The owners had decided to give every table a bottle in celebration of being here and open!!! I still can not get over this I have told everyone how awesome that was. Nice touch!! Food was fantastic as well we shared a warm shrimp dish to start. I had a filet which came out perfect and was served with roasted corn and shishito peppers which are  my new favorite thing. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, as was the server but the service itself was slow.  A great place for a date or a small group when you are in no rush or when wrapping up wine tasting at Lawrence Dunham Vineyard around the corner.  I would recommend the scallops, the fillet and the fried rice."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant a couple of weeks ago with two friends. When we made reservations, we were asked if there were any dietary considerations and we replied that one of us was a vegetarian. \"No problem\" we were told and the dietary concern was brought up by staff when we arrived, so they clearly had documented it.

Now for the pros:

it is a lovely, warm space and the service was wonderful. At the risk of sounding like an old fart (I'm in my 40s), some well known restaurants in the area hire very young staff and do not train them in service. Any one can take an order and carry dishes to the table. Not everyone understands that this isn't where good service ends. Our waiter was amiable, available and clearly knew the menu well.

The food was ambitious but approachable. The portions are small, but ya know what? Most US restaurants serve way too much food. The smaller portions make it easier to try several things and not leave feeling like the proverbial stuffed turkey.

The cons: pretty much the choices for vegetarians. I have eaten with this vegetarian friend at many many local restaurants. A good chef will be creative and that doesn't mean serving you a pasta primavera or risotto. They will create something. My friend prefers to eat lighter on the carbs and is honestly happy with a selection of side dishes. You won't believe what she was served as her entree: a VERY small plate of kale and brocolli. That's it. When the check arrived, she was billed $6 which is the price for the side dishes. Did anyone possibly think that even a small woman might not find that a saucer sized plate enough to eat for dinner? We actually went to Taco Bell on the way home (a running joke amongst us, despite being foodies, we appreciate the lure of late night Taco Bell). Frankly I was aghast and seriously thought something else would be coming out. I suspect that either the Chef was not in attendance and the decision about what to serve her was left to the line cooks, or the Chef simply cannot think outside of the box or pigeonholes all vegetarians into the \"stir fried carrots/brocolli/zucc\" or pasta primavera category. Really, there are more creative options out there."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, great location, awesome staff, and amazing food and drinks! Went on a Thursday night and the place was hopping with energy and fun. Fire apple cocktail with housemade cinnamon whiskey was sinfully delicious, fireball enthusiasts prepare for heaven! Crab fondue and the scallops were absolutely incredible and the boys raved about their ribeye steaks. We were greeted with champagne at the front door and our server paired some amazing wines to go with our dinners. We loved this oldtown gem, we felt literally \" at home\" as we enjoyed cappuccinos and Irish coffees in the outside living room right next to the fireplace. We will be there regularly!"}
{"text":"In rec from a friend went to HB for Sunday brunch. The food was fantastic and though it was noon it was not crazy loud, a pet peeve of mine re brunch. The rose sangria was great and the steak chilaquiles had the perfect amount of heat to let you know we are in PHX. The bahn mi is a stroke of genius; I have never had with egg before, defined an improvement. I only wish they were open for lunch so I could enjoy this every day. The salmon salad plate was a scrumptious combination of beet pickle egg, onion and a chive creme fresh with crispy crust bread. The corn crepes were totally not what I expected...much better! Great way to end the meal. Great plates to share and the waitstaff top notch. Will be back fer sure."}
{"text":"Great service and menu. We were especially drawn to the atmosphere and history behind the house. If you haven't been yet it's highly recommended."}
{"text":"My first impression of the House Brasserie was a disappointment. My boyfriend had made reservations several weeks in advance as a surprise Valentine's day gift to me. The reservations were confirmed  for 8:45 via Opentable. Then a voicemail was received confirming the same time but we would need to be out of the restaurant by 10:30 as the table was needed for another reservation. At 5:50, a text was received confirming 5:45 reservation time. My boyfriend called the restaurant ask about the mixup only to be told in a condescending voice that they would TRY to accommodate the 8:45 time slot. My upset boyfriend was left with the impression that the restaurant was trying to coerce him into canceling his reservation so someone else could take our place instead. This is just poor form for a restaurant that is supposed to be such a fabulous place."}
{"text":"Sweetie and I went for her birthday. Two words. Just go. It's just so different from any other place in Scottsdale. 
Make sure you get a table on the patio as it's like dining in a secret garden. Everything we had was really terrific. Frankly I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. If you can take some time to have a before dinner drink by the fireplace. It's not outrageously expensive if you don't dip into the wine too heavily. Service is super professional and attentive without being snobbish."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Our waitress set us up with a variety of recommendations. Everything was delicious, the roasted cauliflower and Baja grouper were my absolute favorites. This was a beautiful evening that stands out as one of my best restaurant experiences ever."}
{"text":"My wife took me to The House Brasserie for my birthday dinner.  We told them we wanted a \"Chef's Choice\" experience - this means we'll eat whatever they send out.

Our server was awesome and very helpful.  She helped guide us through the entire evening with wine pairings and wow, did she do a great job.  The chef, Matt Hobbs, also came out a few times to see how everything was going.

The food was amazing - I love that they're not stuck in any particular genre; instead the flavors included traditional, Asian, BBQ . . . 

Anyway, I highly suggest THB, especially if you're adventurous to let someone else choose the plates."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a work colleague while in town for the week.
Pros:
1. Reservations were easy on open table. 
2. Ambiance was nice. This would be a good place for dates. Temperatures was perfect outside. 
3. Food was pretty good. I ordered the chicken and coworker ordered some veggie pasta. Portions were also a good size. Not skimpy like you would expect. 
4. Decent wine collection. 

Could be improved:
1. Reservations were at 715 and we arrived at 645. So we checked in early , asked to get seated if there was a table and waited at the bar. 40 mins go by and finally we are seated. Now normally this wouldn't bother me the slightest bit but the restaurant was 50% full. Not sure why they made us wait for so long? 
2. I don't know if this is a thing in Arizona but why can they not combine the bar tab with the meal tab? Ok if it's a bar bar I can understand. People gotta get their tips but this is a nice place. Was just weird how we had to pay the bill twice. 

Overall good experience though. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'll drive 3 hours to have their cheesecake any day! Very cozy and quaint with a European flair. YUM!  Service is usually pretty sharp."}
{"text":"Great place to take a date. Sit outside. Not pretentious or overpriced.  It's top notch..highly recommend."}
{"text":"The house is cool first off - a 1939 Sears kit house.  Probably cost $800 back then, still here! Has a huge Ponderosa Pine planted in 1944. History & ambiance matters and this place has it. Started with foie gras - Very good! Crispy artichoke, mostly cheese but very good. Asparagus worth it! Roasted cauliflower the best. Waited a long time between food items, shared selections not very large. Good for maybe two skinny people. Still a nice experience."}
{"text":"Pros=ambiance and service 

Cons=Kitchen ran out of 3 different things we tried ordering.  Way over priced. Micro portions. Food wasn't really that great

All in all save your money and try somewhere else. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Yes! Such an amazing place in the Old Scottsdale area. Lunch is out of this world and dinner on the patio is so charming.! We will be back"}
{"text":"The food is excellent especially Sunday Brunch! I love the atmosphere it is totally cool. Scottsdale's oldest Christmas tree"}
{"text":"Very cute little house, but the food is overpriced & not worth the hype. I had the shrimp and corn. My shrimp was tough & rubbery. I've eaten better cooked  (& cheaper) seafood at Red Lobster. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"We were a party of five here for Mother's Day dinner, a special occasion. Being avid Yelpers, my daughter chose the House Brasserie after reading the reviews. It has always helped us dining traveling all around the US. It is amazing invention! In a restaurant I look for ambience, food and cocktail/wine selection, and of course, professional  service, especially at these prices. I always think on Mother's Day or other special occasions, the establishment should make an extra effort. This could include fresh flowers on the table or a flower given to the women, and the host at least making a greeting.  A majority the time the women are making the dining decisions, their target market.
The setting is a good statement. It included a beautiful patio area with mood lighting, always a plus to dine outside in the spring in Scottsdale.
The host who had a warm greeting and a good smile, stated, \"it is a good thing you missed brunch! It was mobbed!\" Thank you for sharing, I do not want to hear this at the start of my dining experience. The host sets the mood. He showed us to a table of our choice outside.  The lighting was lovely and set a warm mood.
House Brasserie, as the name suggests a French style.  The menu, the style and the service were anything but. The music was overly loud and sounded like a disco that I would visit after dinner to dance, not one to eat my leisurely supper to. I asked  them to turn it down as I could not hear the person next to me, and finally after a second request, halfway through the meal,  it was done. Dining is about sharing the experience with your friends at the table. In order to do this, you have to hear what your dining partners are saying.
The server was a show in and of himself. He couldn't decide if he was doing stand up at open mike and putting on a show for us, or he was a server. He was so full of himself,  we wondered what he was trying to do. At first comment, he made a personal comment about my appearance, had no knowledge of most of the menu items, and inserted himself into the personal conversation between two of my friends.  When pouring the sparkling water, he chose to serve the solo gentleman in our party first, a big faux pas, by any standard.  In fact he had to bypass the four women to do so and he made a point of going around the table to do so, this is a very uninformed server.
Not to mention that the service was extremely slow. Once we got our food which took a long time, he was no where to be found.
The menu is all over the place.  They have foie gras, nice, this is French. Then they have chicken fried oysters. What is this, is this French? The swordfish at 28.00 is the same price as the beer brined chicken at 28.00. I have no idea why??? The filet mignon is 36.00 which seems OK but does not come with a thing. The 16 oz . rib eye is $50.!! This is excessive, we are not dining at a premiere steak house. The menu is as confused as is the service. But, there are different choices. There is mac and cheese, I guess something for everyone. If you didn't cook up your mac and cheese for your lunch, you get another chance to have it.
The cocktails were good and made well with a good selection, and they did not skimp on the alcohol. Two of us ordered the swordfish which had a nice crusty finish but was overly salted, noted by other diners and again there was a lot of empty space on the plate. The chicken was good but again very over priced for chicken, and finally the filet, prepared beautifully and cooked to perfection. But, the filet, again comes with nothing. The water man was excellent . The water glasses were always full and we did not have to hunt for him. The food runner was confused as to who ordered what, the burden should not be on the diner to inform him of who ordered what dish. Once we instructed him of where the orders were to be placed, he did have knowledge of the food. When our meal was almost concluded the server finally showed up to check on us. The restaurant was not crowded. Where was he??
We did not order a dessert from the limited dessert menu as the service was tedious. It was time to say good bye to House Brasserie. Maybe lunch will be better when they get a cohesive concept and service staff to assist their overall restaurant goals.

If you are expecting professional service at these prices, they have not met this goal yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant find made our day.  We just walked in to this appealing looking restaurant and found the best of surprises.  From the beginning, the service couldn't have been better, hostess, waiter, busboys.  Then the food: kale salad, brussels sprout salad, smoked burrata, lamb pasta, and scallops.  The burrata was the only thing that seemed as if something was missing.  Not much smoky flavor, and without that the cheese was just cheese.  But the other dishes were great, especially the scallops, not something I expected to find and enjoy so much in the middle of the desert.  Overall, a great experience, great food and great service.  Would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice and exquisite each time.  I did not originally intend to order the hamburger for lunch but it was the best I have ever eaten.  Earlier had fish for dinner.   Each instance a superb meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very charming. My boyfriend visited with some friends on a prior occasion and decided to take me here for dinner the other night, and I was happy he did! 
He ordered brisket and I had grilled salmon; both were delicious. This restaurant is a gem--I'm looking forward to dining on their beautiful patio when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Perfect for happy hour, dinner, dessert and coffee, or really any reason to go out. We sat outside on the patio and even though still chilly, the atmosphere and the service made us quickly forget it. The menu is unforgettable - crab fondue, brisket biscuits, popcorn grits, scallops, lamb bolognese, and of course the apple upsidedown cake with pistachio ice cream! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review.  The House Brasserie was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time.  I had a group of 15 people for a birthday party this past Saturday night.  I called for a reservation a month ago and reached one of the owners- Brian.  He was extremely helpful.  The food was very good and excellently prepared.  I could go on and on, but by reading the menu you can see how inventive some of the dishes are.  In addition to the great food (and drinks) the service was fantastic.  Many times in a larger group either the food or the service fall short and sometimes both.  This was not the case at all- everyone enjoyed their meal and the service and I am excited to return again."}
{"text":"What an incredibly gorgeous place to spend an evening:  sitting outside on the patio, surrounded by twinkling lights, underneath a massive redwood tree.  The ambiance could not have been better (full moon didn't hurt), but add in the stellar service and the incredible food and this might be my favorite new \"nice place\" to dine.  This is not an inexpensive place to eat, but worth every penny.  In particular, I recommend the steak tartare appetizer, the scallop entree, and the side of basil and brie smashed potatoes."}
{"text":"After hitting up The Mission (and loving it) and being told about this sister restaurant, we decided to check it out on our last night in Scottsdale. It was delicious, the service was excellent and I definitely recommend it although I do like The Mission better.

The star dish of the night was the halibut. Amazing. Hubby ordered it and I was kicking myself for not getting it too. It had the perfect balance of textures and flavors. The halibut was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy sear on the outside. Underneath was a blend of all sorts of things - clams, beans, greens, and the plate was drizzled with balsamic syrup (or something similar) and topped with fried capers. All the flavors really worked together - little bit of sweet, salty, briny, vinegary. It was the best dish we ordered. The duck confit meatballs with fois gras I ordered were good but the fois gras flavor got lost in the sweet and sour sauce. And I wish there was more white bean pur√©e underneath because it was so delicious. I also got the date and arugula salad with Gorgonzola. It was ok, but nothing special. The duck confit buns were delicious and spicy. Too spicy for my 5 year old and I wish our server had told us that there would be a spicy sauce on it otherwise we wouldn't have ordered it for him. He couldn't finish them, so hubby and I did. Our server made up for it by comping us a dessert which was very thoughtful. We ordered our son a side of krinkle fries which were excellent. We also ordered the homemade sweet butter and bread. The butter was divine, it just melted in your mouth and tasted so good spread on the variety of breads offered. My favorite bread was the olive and walnut. Hubby also ordered a side of potatoes with melted Brie and pesto. He loved it, I thought it was just ok. Not my flavor profile and the potatoes were soft, not crisp.

Desserts were just ok. There were only 3 to choose from: chocolate bandino with homemade marshmallow and salted peanuts, buttermilk blueberry crumb cake, and an apple almond cake with pistachio ice cream. We ended up ordering 2 chocolate bandino's, and 1 apple almond cake. The chocolate bandino (basically a thick chocolate pudding) was way too sweet. And the marshmallow put the sweetness over the top. I needed a salted peanut in every bite to balance how sweet it was but you only got maybe 5 peanuts. My son didn't like it at all (and it's chocolate!). The apple almond cake was on the house (prob because of the duck confit buns that were too spicy for my son) and I thought it was just ok as well. There was just nothing special about it that stood out. I thought it was overly sweet as well. The desserts we ordered had no balance of flavors. Everything was just sweet, sweet and more sweet. I should have ordered the buttermilk blueberry crumb cake! Maybe that would have been more promising.

There were many other items on the menu that I wanted to try. I definitely recommend this place. The quality of ingredients were superb and there were a variety of items on the menu to order. Our server was excellent overall. He chatted with us, was very attentive and gave us his recommendations. 

If you are ever in Scottsdale, check out The Mission first, then come here for a more upscale french influenced meal."}
{"text":"A most disappointing evening! We were greeted by our server,he took our order and we never saw him again! The food was unremarkable with one exception,the lamb bolognese which was like paste and tasteless. We spoke to the manager,no apology only an excuse that they were very busy. They take reservations and know their seating capacity so when people show up it shouldn't come as a surprise."}
{"text":"Ambiance/Decor = 5 Stars. Service = 5 Stars. Food = 5 Stars. Doesn't get any better than this. I've now been there for lunch, late night apps/cocktails and most recently brunch! All were wonderful but must say brunch was the best. I can not thinking about the scrambled eggs. Seriously the best scrambled eggs on the planet. Not sure how they do it but they are so fluffy, creamy and over the top scrumptious. Can't wait to go back again!

Insider Secret: The massive pine tree in the backyard was the Christmas tree of the first family to live in the house. They planted it after enjoying it for the holidays in 1939."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a week in January and looked forward to The House on a Friday night. Enjoyed their sister restaurants so felt confident our meal would be fantastic and had so many great Yelp reviews. 
So disappointed from start to finish!  Either we ordered the wrong items or the regular chef was on vacation. 
Appetizers:
Warm Shrimp Salad: corn was great but the shrimp had a gummy texture and inedible. 
Steak Tartar:  taste was fine but did not pair well with chunky French Fries. Waiter said it was American style and only French serve it with bread. 
Duck Confit Meatballs:  dry crumbly texture and  seasoning was way off! Waiter said they were taking this off the menu. 
Arugula Salad was fine  
Roasted Jidori Chicken: dry and the risotto was so heavy, could not eat. 
Pork Country Ribs: huge serving but dry
Scallops were the best of the evening. 
Waiter felt so bad, he gave us an order of broccoli. Ended up charging us, but took it off after we noted it. 
Also had drinks but declined dessert after the worst meal ever!  With so many restaurants in Scottsdale to choose, we just had a bad evening. Lots of diners eat outside in the front. We were seated inside and it was not designed with the feeling of an older House.   It was like eating under a tent.  I never complain, but this was a real expensive disappointment."}
{"text":"Very classy!! Loved the food, loved the ambience, loved our blonde-haired waitress... But what the hell was up with the intoxicated hostess? This girl was on one last night! She was WASTED! She was falling all over the place, slurring her words, oh and the poor \"trainee\" she had... She was so apologetic after seating us. This intoxicated hostess couldn't even remember after 5 minutes while waiting for our table what our parties name was and if we wanted to eat inside or outside. Girl, we just spoke to you 5 minutes before, get it together. Poor thing could barely keep her balance. Whatever she was on, it made for a very interesting start to our evening!!!"}
{"text":"I popped in previously to book a group for a work meeting, but had never eaten there. Even though my managers decided to eat elsewhere, the customer service left a positive impression. The hostess greeted me by opening the door and a manger walked me through his favorite menu items. 

I returned tonight to have appetizers and drinks with my dad and loved it. We sat inside at the bar, which was crowded, but Heather, our server, and Ryan, the manager, took great care of us. They knew the menu well, could explain the wines in depth, and treated us to some yummy desserts! The shrimp appetizer plate, date and espresso cookies, goat cheese cake, and glorified s'mores were all amazing. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it is not destined to be a positive experience and this is a case of big disappointment.
When you order in advance for a group and sample the menu and what you get is totally different from what you expected, there is something really wrong. Not to mention the small portions and the huge quantities of bread to get you full and the total indifference from the staff - I CAN ONLY SAY THIS THIS PLACE SUCKS AND WE WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN....
It is a nice venue, but a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wanted to love this place.  And it's not that it's bad, but they are missing the mark on the dishes I tried, albeit in easily fixable ways.  My first course was the smoked burrata.  LOVE the idea, not their result.  The burrata was very lightly smoked, as it should be, you don't want to overpower this delicate and luscious cheese.  I get that.  But a little adjustment is needed.  The MJ bread they served it with was white on white, tasteless and textureless.  You could hardly tell if it had seen a broiler or grill, it honestly looked and tasted like long rods of wonder bread, and the very little grilling or toasting the bread received just made it seem stale.   I love starches of all persuasions, beyond reason actually, but I left this bread on the plate after the first bite.  The cheese was simply served with a bit of vinaigrette, a bit of green onion, the bread, and nothing more.  I get keeping it simple and letting the cheese be the star, but it seriously needed something.  Perhaps a drizzle of a lightly smoked tomato coulis, a smear of parsley or basil pesto, or a little gremolata of finely diced preserved lemon with parsley and garlic, something to complete the idea, please!  And consider serving it with medium to large house-made olive oil fried croutons.  That would make a huge difference.

The duck confit bahn mi also fell below the possibility the dish offers.  There is a restaurant in the Seattle area that serves a version which qualifies for my short list for \"last meal on earth\", so my bar for such a sandwich is admittedly high.  But The House could get there, or close anyway, with just a bit of tweaking.  First off, replace the MJ soft bread with a section of lovely french baguette (does MJ make one?), as should be used on a really good bahn mi.  And consider replacing the cilantro mint pesto with a sauce that would have a more complementary flavor profile, maybe a hoisin aioli, maybe a fruit based slightly smoky, not too assertive BBQ sauce (rhubarb?).  To my mind, it would be greatly improved with a sauce that was slightly sweet, and with just enough of a balancing tang to cut through the rich fat, like one of the choices I mentioned, or a myriad of other options.  I would also add some caramelized shallots or onions to the duck.  And please, get rid of the mushy centered crinkle cut fries.  Seriously?  How about a little arugula salad with fried shallots and oven roasted tomatoes, or small round discs of a waxy potato (yellow finn or red bliss) cooked in duck fat, caramelized around the edges, or something else simple but satisfying.  Just something else, please.  The same frite they serve at Zinc Bistro would be a huge improvement, but just a little fatter would be even better, so you get more potato to balance the richness of the sandwich.

Bottom line, I will likely give it another try, see how it goes with different choices.  But my gut reaction is that a visit from a menu consultant with an impeccable palate is needed to turn this into a place I'll regularly want to visit.   

As an aside, I know I'll probably get slammed for dissing the MJ breads used here.  Yes, his breads are very popular locally.  And he does make some good breads, just not these two maybe.  But why oh why is there no truly great and complete bakery here in the Valley?  Essence in Tempe makes good baguettes, but doesn't sell them, darn, and doesn't make any other breads, only pastry, darn again.  There are a couple of restaurants and markets that make their own very good bread that they sell, or will sell if you ask.  Andreoli's and Christopher's come to mind, but each one only offers one or two types.  There is no single bakery I've yet found that has great baguettes, and loaves or rolls of campagnia, walnut, olive, ciabbata, pugliese, or assorted other rustic style breads.  Give me that, add some great pastries, and I'd be in heaven.  If anyone can steer me toward the great place I'm missing, I would be forever grateful!  Otherwise, guess I have to make my own starters, get a new pizza stone for the oven, and go back to baking my own."}
{"text":"I went to The House on January 2nd with my girlfriend . We shared the Kale salad which is a must have! She had the scallops and I had the filet both wonderful.  We both ha a couple cocktails off of their specialty menu, our server insisted we try the pimms mule. We tried the mule, and the green lantern. We both went with a second round, highly recommend the drinks. The service and ambiance were excellent ! The owner even came by the table an introduced himself, he also bought us a round of the house made cinnamon everyone else seems to be writing about, it was awesome!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my second review for \"the house\", my husband & I were there a few months ago for our anniversary & this time we went  for my birthday, & I must say I still LOVE it!

It's dark, sexy, & just the right amount of loud! 

Fun, sexy & romantic all rolled up in one!!   If that was the feel  the owner Brian was going for, we'll the he nailed it! Great job.  

P.S.  the food is outstanding especially the lobster gnocchi . OMG delicious ."}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place before and found it on Google Maps. I thought it looked interesting based on previous reviews.

AMBIENCE: The interior was quaint and cozy with excellent subdued lighting, mirrors, candles, etc. and the exterior had some great tables, too. However, we were seated at a table right in front of the kitchen pick up window which had an extremely bright light pointed directly into my eyes. I didn't mind having to wait for a table and at that time, a bunch of other tables opened up minutes after we were seated. I would have preferred a smaller table with at least a candle and would have waited a few more minutes for it.

SERVICE: Our server was very friendly and sweet. I just thought it was odd that she suggested that we order everything at once because big parties would be arriving soon and she didn't want us to wait too long. Huh? And we weren't always asked if we were finished when plates were cleared so it was laughable that we were asked if we wanted more bread only to have 2 small ovals of pretzel bread brought to the table after our plates were gone. While we did order everything at once, we were asked if we were ready for the next round. Ok, what happened to tell me everything you want now so the kitchen won't be overloaded?

FOOD: Our first impression was that we were taken aback by the strange flavor combinations and loose interpretations. The White Bean Gruyere Fondue was more like a shmear with hardly any detectable cheese and yes, it was melted but don't except a pot of melted cheese, which is really what a fondue is vs. what it means. Semantics. The Duck Confit Meatballs were tangy, a little dry, but kind of lost their flavor by being overpowered by the Agridolce. The Dr. Pepper Ham Hock Poutine was definitely NOT a poutine. I guess the Canadian chef wasn't working that night because ours didn't have any cheese curds. Oh, and the potatoes were like Ore-Ida crinkle cut fries. The star was the Foie Gras: perfectly cooked and seasoned. I'm glad we only had appetizers to try out this place as the entrees are really expensive. I got a look at the sea scallops coming out of the kitchen: 3 for $28, methinks not. I can get 2 dozen from Whole Foods for the same price.

While not 5-star, I prefer the more rustic and more reasonably-priced French food of Petite Maison, also in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We happened to park out front of the restaurant on our first ever trip to Scottsdale and it had been open only two weeks.  We went in because the chalkboard out front had listed some of our favorite Oregon  cheeses on it.  We were extremely impressed they had lobster rolls (random, and thank  you) we ordered the pastrami sand. very tender, very flavorful, a cheese plate, the lobster fried rice, the chicken parm. sand. but the stand out for me was the fries with the pork hock and gruyere, i wasn't expecting much, but the flavor was just excellent.  We'll be back when we get back to Scottsdale -  the drinks, they needed just a little more life - little more flavor, but they get a pass, the food gets the 5 stars all day"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night (3 small plates & a salad). I had the duck meatballs, the ham hock dish, brisket biscuit, and butter lettuce salad. It was a great building and the ambiance was really nice. I found all the dishes, except the ham hock dish, to be very under-seasoned. I don't think there was any salt in or on my food. The salad was nothing remarkable - I got excited when I thought there was bacon on it, but later found it was dried beet. While I can see myself returning here for drinks, I doubt that I will go back for a meal (unless I am trying to impress someone with how much I can spend on a meal). On a positive note, the service was pretty good. 

As I was sitting there trying to read the menu, I was surprised that anyone ordered anything at night on the patio. There are next-to no lights outside. I had to use my iPhone to get enough light to read the menu. I even saw waiters using flash lights to show people the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful, welcoming ambiance with unique preparation & warm friendly staff!

We tried this spot for a girls date- we choose our spots on the criteria they must have cocktails or wine, good veggie options, and be someplace the husbands aren't excited about trying. 

We arrive around 6pm and there are very few people though some at the small bar.  We are greeted by a dapper gentleman and then a girl asks if we've been helped.  We opt to inside despite a large party arriving soon.  Nice they gave us a heads-up because said party was super loud.

We start with a blueberry hill & gimlet cocktail with basil & raspberry.  Both delicious not-over sweet and balanced.  Unique enough to entice but not so unique you avoid it.  The chef sends a delicious cheesy pastry as an amuse bouche which is light salty and delicious.  

The food here all looks delicious but we were most excited for the sides and salads- no mains really enticing us as we don't prefer meat usually and the only veg entree is tofu.  There are still so many great things we struggle to decide.

The mj bread is a lightly grilled pretzel bread & almond pumpernickel of sorts. 

We share both the Arizona arugula salad and simple salad which are light & refreshing.  We both prefer the arugula salad due to the delicious vinegarette and plentiful toppings.  

We also share the pesto potatoes which was the highlight of the food.  Yummy tender fingerlings with warm Brie & nutty pesto.

With dinner, my friend goes for a blueberry hill again and I try the acai tequila \"world\" drink which is my ultimate tangy margarita I've been searching for.  Delicious & refreshing.

For dessert we opt for the chocolate bundito which is a graham cracker cookie served alongside a little jar of chocolate goodness with homemade banana marshmallow.  This dessert has amazing gooey texture that you must feverishly lick your spoon to get every last drop.  We mentioned how we loved the cookies & our sweetheart sever says \"well next time well bring extra\".  

Speaking of service- the people here obviously take pride in their cuisine and love to create a great dining experience.  Our server Emmy was kind & good at listening to capture our requests with ease. 

Next time we will opt for the beautiful patio as it was a little warm out still."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place! Chef Matt Carter has done it again, creating a menu that will delight whomever you bring. 
My first visit - I came in on a Tuesday and ate at the bar. Kevin took great care of me, recommending a drink called the Bambaataa. It was so tasty! I started with the duck confit & foie meatballs and was very glad that I did. They were a great first course. Next, Kevin recommended the the crab bisque. I can honestly say that it is the best I've ever had. Tons of lump crab meat, squash and maple cream on top. He paired me up nicely with a table white which I can't remember the name of (dammit!). That was more than enough for one night. 
I came back a week later and started with the Sazerac cocktail, then ordered the pastrami brisket. It was so wintery and delicious - a really creative dish - you don't see neeps done properly very often.  A gent next to me at the bar was eating the lobster fried rice & kept making yummy noises. I think I gotta try that one soon...
Really can't wait til my next visit - the staff is super knowledgeable, treats everyone like you're special, and are happy to chat."}
{"text":"I love this little neighborhood joint. The bartenders are expert mixologists, and the chef is always creating awesome presentations. The patio and side garden are wonderful in the cooler months. Note: make a reservation...it is difficult to get a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday dinner seating as a walk up. Also, this is a place for epicureans. If you are not adventurous, this may not be the right place for you."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Definetly worth trying if you live or pass by Scotsdalle . 

We were a party of. 6 and tried many different dishes. The ones that stood out were
Jidori chicken
Carbonara broccoli 
Smoked burrata 
Crab fried rice

Home made cocktails were delicious too.!

Big thanks to Tommy out waiter who was amazing and so sweet. !"}
{"text":"Went here because they own another restaurant in old town named the Mission,  which is one of the best Mexican restaurant I ever went to, the food here does not even compare, great atmosphere but would never eat here again,"}
{"text":"Last night we ate at The House with a group of 16.  Food was great and Tommy our waiter was top notch.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has a very cool vibe to it.  We decided to sit outside but the inside is darling.  The bar is also nice front and center as you walk in the door.  Waitress was ok.  She sort of disappeared right before we were ready to order.  Other then that the service was decent.  We started with a melted cheese similar to Brie it was good but the portion was very small.  We also shared a small roasted peach salad with arugula which was fine.  Two of the diners had the Halibut.  Again very good mix of flavors but very small portions.  The other diner had the lamb bolognese.  Another small portion.  We had two deserts a chocolate cake and a butterscotch pudding.  Hadn't had butterscotch pudding in years and it was good and rich like it should be.  I was with all women and I barely felt full when I left.  I think my husband would have left hungry had he been there.  I would be willing to give this another try for sure.  On a side note, I always leave Zinc Bistro hungry too."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing!!! Not only is the food exceptional but their customer service is by far the best. Every single employee is so kind, they all truly make you feel welcome and at home. To top off the experience the atmosphere is serene."}
{"text":"After being a HUGE fan of the Mission I decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though I was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great. To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant for over a year now. First off, it's set in a perfect location, just to the East of Hotel Valley Ho; in the third oldest house in Scottsdale.  The ambience is something out of an F Scott Fitzgerald novel. The spacious front patio is set in a rose garden with beautiful lighting. The inside, with chandeliers and textured golden walls, is absolutely beautiful, and complete with a built in bar that I love to sit at and chat with the bartender. The House Brasserie delightfully ends up being a mix of historic quaintness with modern luxury.

Everything I've ordered at House Brasserie I've loved. I usually let my friends/guests decide what to order and share family style because every option is too good-- I get overwhelmed choosing. The service is excellent and I love being surprised by extra appetizers 'compliments of the chef.' The handcrafted drinks are unique and delicious. If you are one of the rare people in this world who likes fernet, try the House Call! It's my favorite.

I'm also always appreciative of nice/fancy bathrooms. I love how the bathrooms are in the converted shed/garage and incredibly well done.

Don't pass this up if you are looking for an all-around excellent experience on your next culinary adventure!"}
{"text":"I don't post negative reviews.   However when I find a gem I tell people.    Went to this restaurant owner's sister restaurant in Scottsdale, The Mission, and was disappointed to find a 2 hour wait.   The owner, Brian, noticed my irritated expression and approached me.   He referred us, a party of 5 to The House Brasserie.    Brian even called us a golf cart taxi.    
By any means this place is great.    Food, service and ambiance all reflect everyone passion for their brand.   It is obvious when employees believe in what they are selling.    The Chef, Ashley, even made an appearance at our table and sent us some items.    
In Scottsdale, eat at either restaurant and you won't be disappointed.   We went to the Mission the next night and were equally impressed."}
{"text":"Let me start with the place.

It's a beautiful house with a nice bar, backyard and outside area right in Old Town Scottsdale. Five stars for that. As a curious fact, the restrooms are outside and are small. 

The food was good but nothing memorable. Everything in the porkbelly dish was tasteful except the porkbelly, that's sad. The noodles and egg were a great mix but the meat lack flavor and it was undercoocked from my point of view.

The Dr. Pepper meat with cheese fries was pretty good.

I had the filet and it was uneventful.

Although I have to say that the goat cheese cake was delicious. I would go back just for that.

Coffee was good too.

The service... well, the service was pretty bad. We learned about the special of the day because the table next to us was told (while we were already eating). To get refills was a journey. My friend asked for fresh napkins and she ended up helping herself. Oh well, good news is that there's plenty of room for improvement.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Loved this place. You will definitely pay for it though. Very expensive."}
{"text":"What a charming place. I have been meaning to go to The House for a long time and finally made my way there this weekend. I wish I had not waited so long- The food and the service were fantastic. Our server Megan was very knowledgeable and you could tell that she was passionate about her place of work. Something I truly appreciate in a hospitality professional."}
{"text":"I have been to this all around marvelous restaurant on numerous occasions and LOVE it! The ambiance exudes beauty, character and charm. Like every one of their stylish establishments, I walk in feeling like a dignitary, confident that anyone I bring will have an exceptional experience. 

Matt carter never fails to deliver the most delectable assortment of food choices catering to the palate of any level of sophistication. They offer a wide variety of small plates as well as family style entrees using the finest and freshest ingredients resulting in a staggering eruption of favors in every bite. My last visit i had the bound corn and leek, creamy tomato soup served with sourdough gruyere grilled cheese and fresh Oregon truffle slices And the sweet yet savory country pork ribeye, served with popcorn grits, apple glaze with braised fennel. I am convinced they add crack to every dish because it is ADDICTING!!

It doesn't stop there either. The bar does not fall behind to the slightest degree. Definitely try the Housemade root beer and the famous cinnamon whiskey fireball shots (they use their own secret ingredients) one of my favorites is the sazerac square- sazerac whiskey aperol and fresh grapefruit ( yummmmmmmy!) and an absolute must have is the Irish coffee made with a hand picked house espresso, Jameson whiskey, topped with a Madagascar vanilla whipped cream and Demerara sugar pieces, I am not a coffee drinker and had 4!

The best part of the restaurant is the fun and friendly staff. Brian and kevin definitely know how to have fun and will show you the time of your life!!!!! Needless to say if you haven't been by yet you need to stop in as of yesterday!!! They are open for lunch, brunch on the weekends and dinner 7 nights a week so what are you waiting for!!!!?????"}
{"text":"I've sat on this review for days thinking of what I wanted to say. And not because I don't have much to share but rather, too much! This restaurant is brand new and unlike most experiences at places that have only been open a day or two, everything was absolutely picture perfect. Even for our large group of about 12 people! Seriously, not a single glitch. 

I heard that building this restaurant took two years and it's no surprise they executed everything so well because the details here are so well thought out. From the precious, romantic location, the sturdy, handsome furniture and the spectacular outdoor dining area. Built around (and in) a house, this restaurant has the makings of getting national attention for its beauty and most importantly, the food and drinks.

Sitting down at two large tables under romantic canopies adorned with strung up white lights, I knew we were in for a treat. Because we tried a number of items in our group, it's tough to compare or even mention each thing I ate. Some honorable mentions were the peel and eat shrimp with a Oaxacan chili paste, Maine Lobster fried rice, the kale salad with peppercorn dressing, the duck confit banh mi, and the shaved pork belly. Wow!

This restaurant is absolutely ideal for any occasion where someone would like to impress their guest. Perfect for dates, taking the folks out to dinner, showing off to the boss or just sharing a dinner with a good friend, The House will really wow anyone who is looking for a quiet atmosphere with higher end food. Prices are absolutely worth what you pay and then some. I will never come back to Scottsdale without eating here!"}
{"text":"The decor was amazing and the service was fantastic. The food was absolutely immaculate. The lamb dish was to die for and the chicken was very succulent and had nice sauces. The wild sea bass was cooked to perfection! The appetizers and salads are also very tasty. It was a very good overall experience. I would defiantly like to go back again."}
{"text":"WOW. This place is FANTASTIC!! Came here for lunch one day before we were leaving to go to Sedona and I'm THRILLED we found it.  We walked in during Sunday brunch time and they were booked but they had seats at the bar.  The bartender was super nice and informative, just what you want to see in a bartender.  I would seriously fly back to Scottsdale just to come here.  5 stars easily! Keep up the amazing work!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time-- 
Ok first- the ambiance warm but there super cool vibe here. First time I ate inside with business colleagues. Second New Year's Eve on the patio.
The patio with the lights and heaters made for an amazing NYE.  We started with the steak tartare .. OMG amazing with a romesco sauce and traditional but served with Crinkle cut French fries with a Harissa infused ketchup.  That spice was enough to elevate these fries to another level!
Ask for extra toast points when you order.
We also started with the baked Robiola -a burst of flavor with the crispy artichoke and pistachio! Robiola is like an Italian Brie- not as strong though.

Dinner was the small plate of gnocchi with lobster in a broth scented with truffle oil- giant pieces of Maine lobster. Amazing. 
The special was the rack of lamb.  A large 4 bone rack that melted in your mouth!!! It should be a regular item on the menu. 

An amazing place with great food, ambiance and service. It won't disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Good food and nice service. The patio is great, and there is not much inside dining."}
{"text":"Brand new. Stumbled into it Excellent execution on all plates. Roasted halibut, roasted broccoli soup, nice choices for charcuterie plate and interesting texture for shrimp and grits. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to have dinner in arizona. Lindsay as our server she was beyond!!!!! So knowledgable of food and wine. Made the night. The FOOD ! Was high quality fresh and delicious. We are visiting from la and it topped some of la restaurants we frequent! Loved it."}
{"text":"I kept reading how this was a nice place for dinner and the patio is where you should sit. While the patio is nice, it's nothing that I would rave about. It's just some tents and a few shrubbery with tables. 

The important part, the food, it was amazing. My pork chop was probably the second best one I had in my life. The mac and cheese was amazing. The lobster gnoochi was really good. The charred broccolini was good. 

The service, was terrible. I don't know if our server had too many tables or what, but it ruined the dinner for us. We were starving by the time we got there. We were seated promptly. The place was not at all crowded and didn't even have a wait at 7:30. The initial greeting took a bit. We ordered drinks and an appetizer soon as we were greeted which took a good 5 minutes. Our server was super friendly and gave his opinion on the drinks which was great. 10 minutes after ordering the drinks/appetizers we ordered our entrees. A good 15 minutes or so went by n total from ordering our drinks that we actually we got our drinks. The drinks were great. At this point a table of 3 sat down next to us.  Constantly we saw trays of food come out but never did our appetizer come out. After a good 25 minutes or so from ordering the entrees, our food came out first. We never saw our server since ordering. I asked the person about our appetizer when they delivered the food. About 5 minutes had gone by and our server came by, apologized about the appetizer not coming out and that it would be on its way out now. Okay...things happen. 10 minutes later our appetizer comes out. At this point we've already eaten most of our meal and our $20 appetizer now reaches the table. Our server never once came by to ask how our food was, how it turned out, offered us more drinks, even when the apology for the appetizer happened. We literally got no service from this point on except for the water guy. We counted 4x that we went to another table near us that we noticed. Again, never once anything in our direction. We were annoyed and wondering why we were being given the cold shoulder. He finally came by after I can't even tell you how long, but we had been done, drinks were drained more than half an hour ago, and we just wanted to be done with this place. He asked if he could clear our plates. We said yes. Honestly we hadn't finished half our food because we over ordered. I didn't notice at first, but he stacked the plates and wasted a good amount of food instead of asking if we'd like it to go. He showed us the dessert menu, but again, at this point we said no thanks and wanted our check. After waiting a good 5 minutes, I gave him another 5 minutes before he got our check before I was ready to go find it myself. Finally the check was delivered and we waited another 10 minutes for the whole process to take place. We were looking around, it had been two hours. Things had definitely slowed down. This is not what I expect for $150+ dinner. I expect better service and get better service at Chipotle. 

Again, the food was amazing and maybe our server was having a bad night, under staffed etc. but I expect more for my money and not sure if I'd ever go back or recommend this place. It would've been far better if we hadn't watched him cater to the people near us repeatedly without even glancing in our direction. I would've preferred to go next door I said at the end of the night and gotten a pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Everything we ordered was mouthwatering! We loved our two appetizers and the grilled peach salad.  For the main course, I ordered the halibut on top of shitake mushrooms and parmesan potatoes. Perfectly cooked. My hubby ordered the filet, which was a tiny bit overdone. My favorite thing was the side of basil/brie smashed potatoes he ordered. And, you MUST order the butterscotch pudding for dessert!  

The owner stopped by at least twice to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying the food... that was a nice touch. We were also seated at the table closest to the fire pit... a bonus on the first chilly Valley night. Our waitress was also fabulous and very on the ball. 

If there's room for improvement, it would be with the hostess and the food runners. We waited quite awhile for a table, despite making reservations. (Although, it might've been because they were trying to get us onto the patio. If that's the case, they should just say so... so we're not wondering if we were forgotten about.) Also... the food runners gave us the wrong plates at first. They returned quickly after realizing the mistake... disappeared around the corner for a second, only to come right back out and set the SAME plates at the neighboring table. Those guests didn't notice, but we were a little surprised that would happen.

Still, we'd go back. The restaurant hasn't been open long and I'm guessing the kinks will be ironed out in no time."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to my lunch date with The House, after all I love the Mission.  However, our meals really lacked WOW factor-- for the prices it should be impressive.  In a group of six no one ooooed or awwwed over the meal and one had to be sent back.   We had the lemon curd cake but the blackberries were to seedy and affected the overall texture of the cake. The apple upside down cake was better but not amazing.  Our service was average and then they ran the wrong amount on the credit cards so it took a bit of fixing on the tab. Not sure, if I will do a dinner date at these prices."}
{"text":"I have been several times and it's one of my favorite spots.  Brunch is amazing.   Wonderful place to have a romantic dinner the patio is cozy ... the entire place is cozy.  I love unique dinning and amazing food. This place top of my list!"}
{"text":"God I love this place! Old school cocktails, beautifully prepared and tasty food and the perfect Old Town Scottsdale Location. Eat at the bar and watch the masters of mixology at work. You're seriously going to think you're in San Francisco when you dine at this gem!"}
{"text":"First time here, brought another couple and the food was good but was overshadowed by poor service from our waiter, who seemed not care about anything. Our waiter showed no enthusiasm when we were seated and didn't mention any specials but told us what they were out of. Three of us had chicken which was good, one had the ribeye which came with what I thought  was a baked potatoes but came with a potato in a small dish which was about 65 percent blue cheese and 35 percent actual potato, I did not like it and when the waiter came around I politely mentioned it and he said, ok and walked away, he made no attempt to offer me something's else or redo the side dish. Later the manager was making the rounds, at this time we were finished with our dinner and she offered to get me another side, which she did about 15 minutes later which was about 30 minutes after we finished our dinner. The dinner was $45 for the steak which was fair at best. 

We ordered coffee and some deserts and the coffee came late and the waiter mumbled something about the coffee maker, my guest wanted a refill on the coffee and the waiter was no where to be found.  

Given our first and only experience here taking some clients out for dinner I would say it greatly disappointed us all. It isn't inexpensive, the food was fair and the service was a 3 out of 10.

Additionally make a reservation earlier in the week became complicated on their end and they called us three times to change things and told us we would get champagne for being so patient with them in trying to book a reservation, we of course did not get champagne, nor did they likely remember they even told us that. One of the calls they made TO us to change the time after they called US they put us on hold.

Based on the other reviews perhaps we just had a lot of bad luck?"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been a huge fan of The Mission, the sister restaurant to The House. We decided to spend our anniversary at The House. What a beautiful place! We told them of our special occasion and they sat us at the outdoor fireplace. Our service from the second we walked up to the property was fantastic! The drinks are delicious and so was the food! We had a shared plate, the brisket on a biscuit and we both had the filet for our main course. Everything was spot on! It's a casual atmosphere and very low key... The food is upscale and wonderfully prepared. Prices are reasonable too. Hidden gem. Great place! We look forward to dining here again!"}
{"text":"So Good I Forgot to Chew!

Being new residents of Old Town Scottsdale, it took my wife and me too long to get to House Brasserie. We sat on their shady, quiet patio on a perfect day for what turned out to be a perfect lunch--better than any lunch we can remember. 

My wife had a moaning-good chickpea salad that was beautifully presented. I had the lamb cavatelli with green olives and San Marzano tomatoes. We judged both meals to be practically perfect. The chef, to show the kinds of foods he serves his guests at home, created every item on the menu. (How could we get an invitation there?)   

Then for dessert we shared the chocolate cake, unlike any chocolate cake we have seen or tasted. As we were eating dessert, my wife said she had just picked the place she wants to go for dinner on her next birthday! So that's a date! 

We failed to get the name of our waitress/hostess, but the management of House Brasserie should know because we learned she is from Pinetop, Arizona, of Italian and Spanish heritage. She was just superb--welcoming, friendly, informative, and with a delightful sense of humor. 

The House Brasserie is an easy walk from anywhere within Old Town Scottsdale. Take a hot tip from us: Go there as soon as you can. It's among the finest places to eat that we have found in a very long time."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and we loved it! Have been meaning to reserve here for a few years now but was not able to. Got a great romantic setting by the fireplace. The server asked us to wait at the bar while they cleared it up and it was well worth it. The food was delicious and the service was great. Very attentive staff. We are definitely coming back for other occasions."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great! Group of 9, some came early for a cocktail at the bar. Cheerful and attentive service there. When all arrived we were seated at a long table near the back. This is when things went south. Service was disorganized. Friend waited 30 minutes for a glass of wine while another was served 2 drinks in that time. Wine list is limited, overweighted with Chardonnay, and they didn't have wines that were on their list. Food was overall good. I agree with another reviewer to stick to the simpler items. My faves were the Mac and cheese, brisket and biscuit, fingerling potatoes.. and I'm a protein lover. Seared tuna was lost in the busy dish. Smoked burratta was bland. Brussel sprout Caesar salad was good. Blue berry hill cocktail was very good. Sounds weird but try it. Overall food quality was very good as expected, but table service was surprisingly disappointing and the main reason for the 3 stars."}
{"text":"After trying to get a table at \"The Misson\" it was suggested we try \"The House,\" their sister restaurant several blocks away. Wow! What an incredible waste of $200!  The only saving grace was the company of great friends that we hadn't seen in four years.  The atmosphere and service was excellent, which is why I feel it deserves at least one star.  The food? After all the rave reviews I'm thinking maybe the executive chef had the evening off.......

For starters we shared:
Berkshire Pork Belly
Duck Confit Meatballs w/ Foie Gras
Bone Marrow 
We could have skipped all of these!

Dinner:
Lamb Bolognese, ok, but tasted no mint, lemon or marscapone
Seared Diver Scallops, of which there were three 
Roasted Jidori Chicken, so dry it turned to sawdust in your mouth - yuk!
Berkshire Pork Ribs, the only thing that was plentiful and tasty (never mind one side of the rib was undercooked!)

All the fancy buzz words used to describe the dishes on the menu I think were there to impress as almost everything was truly one-dimensional and underwhelming!  The loud overhead, hip-hop music was so inappropriate - you would think in a cozy, romantic, intimate environment the selection would be a little more subdued.

Never again!"}
{"text":"After our third attempt for dinner at House Brasserie, the Hubs and I finally completed our mission for date night at the new spot this past Saturday.  We called the night before, and were fortunate enough to get their very last reservation for the night at the high-top table in the bar.  As our wonderful waitress informed us, we were sitting at the best table in the house and I can confidently say I agree.  Parking was a bit tricky, but once we walked in I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant itself is very romantic with great lighting and interesting decor, especially in the bar area.  Our waitress took the time to tell us about the amazing house that is now the restaurant, and it made me appreciate the experience that much more.

As far as the food/drinks go, this place isn't cheap by any means.  The prices are worth it though (for the most part).  I had the watermelon cooler, which was refreshing and interesting - I would probably try something else next time, but all in all it was good.  The best things we ate were the brisket and biscuit and the goat cheese cheesecake.  HOLY SMOKES!  Those two things were close your eyes and have a moment good - even three days later I am still thinking about them.  A must for sure.  The biggest miss we had was the shrimp with sweet corn.  Just didn't taste too great and it wasn't anything special like the brisket and cheesecake.  We shared the lamb pasta and duck confit meatballs.  I felt like these were pretty good, but didn't blow me away like the previously mentioned items.

So thankful we finally made it to House.  We love the Mission and are equally pleased with House.  The service was fab as was the food, so in my humble opinion this spot is a homerun!"}
{"text":"We stopped by House Brasserie for dinner during my sister's bachelorette in Scottsdale. The restaurant decor is absolutely beautiful. The staff is friendly and the service was great. Everything on the menu looked great - we asked our waiter for advice on what to order - and he raved about absolutely everything. We ended up trying: the brussel sprouts, the chicken meatballs and gnocchi, the lamb bolognese, the tomahawk pork chop, the skirt steak, and the filet. The food was delicious - well seasoned and flavored. Would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Limited selection for both food and drinks. A little towards the expensive end of things."}
{"text":"One of my top three restaurants in the valley. Creative and intensely flavorful food, killer atmosphere, knowledgeable/helpful and friendly staff. Food is a playful mix of French and modern American fusion. They also threw us a few surprises, like a delicious puff pastry amuse bouche and a shot of house-infused apple cinnamon bourbon at the end. Inside, the place almost looks like a French cottage, but with a few modern updates and a subtle trip-hop music selection, which is new school in a way that offsets the old-world decor in a fun way. Will absolutely be back with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere and staff!!! A wonderful experience and I will be back every time I visit the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"We took some friends who have not been here. Great food as usual with superb service. Very professional and friendly. The hostesses could use a little class in manners."}
{"text":"Tricked again.  (See my review of 1/2014)  I am the fool. But,NEVER, NEVER, NEVER AGAIN!  Several years ago, I reviewed this restaurant on Yelp and stated that I would never return due to the extremely poor service and the attitude of those who work there.  However, I had no choice but to make a reservation here for Valentines Day, since this was literally the only restaurant that had a reservation available before 9pm (in retrospect, it is obvious why they still had reservations available).  What a mistake!  Nothing has changed.  The server was very patronizing, inattentive and arrogant.... and actually tried correcting me 3 TIMES on the pronunciation of the word \"Haut\" on a bottle of wine (I know my French, know my wine, and know my pronunciations-she was wrong.  In case you read this madame, the \"t\" is not pronounced in French when a word ends in \"t\" so you might want to quit trying to put your customers down and embarrassing them). The time it took to get the starters, main course and desserts out was incredible.....and it was not the kitchen's fault, as a table of 4 next to us were seated after us  served before us (by a long shot) and left the establishment before we had dessert. And our waiter never stopped by to give us an update on why it was taking so long.  When I inquired, she said \"Oh, it's a very busy night\".  I get that...which is why they had a price fixed, limited selection menu last night so the kitchen could handle it.  Our waiter never came by and asked if we would like more water, there was not a set up of utensils or napkin on one side of the table (which the waiter should have noticed when she first came by), never stopped by to ask us if we were enjoying the meal and was just generally acting like a stuck up, spoiled brat child-snob.  This place is the absolute worst for service.  The food is very average, nothing special, but not outstanding, so I am okay with that, but  the interior of the place has seen better days, the chairs are wobbly, the wood pretty beat up on the table tops and it is pretty dirty inside.  Restrooms are outside, by a busy serving corner past the kitchen.  Honestly, I am shocked that anyone ever returns to this place, and shame on me for being such a moron for returning. Take a pass on this place, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot with a wonderful outdoor/patio area.
We ate outside and it was a wonderful experience.
They have a very nice inside eating area too.

Great place for a date or special evening out.

Our server was great and most food items were very good.
Trie 8 different plates among the 3 of us and the only weak plate was the shrimp appetizer. Rarely order a steak, but the ribeye was the highlight of the meal.

It's a bit expensive, but a very nice restaurant.
Definitely need a reservation for the weekends.
Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"We arrived to the quaint little street just past Old Town and it was immediately charming, lined with attractive businesses and lit by the glow of twinkling lights strung across the lane, with the retro-awesomeness of Valley Ho looming at the end of the street. The parking scenario is not pleasant -there was a  vacant,ghetto-ish valet stand propped haphazardly out into the street. We did a quick driveby just in case regular parking became evident elsewhere, but eventually gave up and returned to valet. It was difficult to tell where we needed to pull up, and then we waited a significant amount of time before finally being greeted by the valet. The valet himself was curt and unfriendly, and when we returned at the end of the night we once again had to wait an interminable amount of time before we were finally able to get our car. Anyway, we meandered past the lovely garden to the hostess stand, where we were greeted and advised that there would be a wait for a patio table. We're not typically picky about where we sit, so we suggested we'd sit inside if they had tables ready? They did, so we did. 

After being seated on a banquette at a 4-top table in close proximity to other diners, our server swung by to say hello. It was pretty obvious from the outset that our server was new - she just didn't quite have the polish that the setting (and prices) set the stage for. She gave us a very short explanation of the restaurant (second oldest house in Scottsdale) and took drink orders. We picked up a little bit more information from the server taking care of the table beside ours, who animatedly launched into a detailed description of some of the history and the concept of the restaurant. It sounded interesting!

Our appetizers came out very quickly : I had just quietly commented to my husband that it made me sad that nice restaurants which are at least slightly French-influenced don't send amuse bouches anymore when ta-da! Out came an Amuse Bouche from the Chef: Cheese Puffs that were delicious. It was very nice and obviously I had to eat my words :) BUT it was weird that they came out after we had recieved and started on our appetizer - it was the first of some strange pacing issues during our visit. amuse bouche = yummy. Now, back to the appetizers! The House Brisket was generally tasty, although the temperature was cold (how is that possible? We had just ordered and it came out so quickly!) and they were difficult to eat - the portions weren't single bites, but they were tough to cut into and divide into smaller bites as everything just sortof pulled apart. The meatballs: When I think duck confit, I think juicy, fatty and flavor packed deliciousness. These were a bit dry, and the sauce was very thin and difficult to sop up to offset the dryness. They tasted okay but were generally a bit disappointing. 

Entrees: My Filet was alright - it was cooked to temperature (medium) properly and the accompanying sauce had nice flavor. The corn on the plate seemed like a bit of a throwaway; I always enjoy sweet corn in summer dishes, but this seemed to just be a filler. My husband's braised pork was amazing - the accompanying apple and grits were just perfect and it was one of my favorite parts of the meal. The Basil and Brie Smashed Potatoes were also a let down - the potatoes themselves were very basic fingerling potatoes with little to no flavor, and they were just smashed a little (I was expecting something a bit more mashed or perhaps crispy) Admittedly, Brie is not my favorite and so I avoided that element of the dish, so perhaps I was missing out on the most important flavor component..

My dessert was delightful - a pear (or apple? I'm pretty sure it was pear) upside down cake that was just so tasty. I'd go back just for that. My husband's chocolate banana budino was okay, but not super exciting. There didn't seem to be any banana to speak of, so it was basically a quality chocolate pudding. 

I had mentioned pacing, our food came out so incredibly quickly, we were actually in and out of the restaurant with three courses in an hour and 15 minutes. I feel a little strange complaining about getting our food quickly, but it just seemed rushed, first with the amuse bouche and appetizers at the same time, and then followed by the rest of the courses hitting us so quickly one after the other. It is the sort of meal you want to linger over, but I felt a bit pushed to finish by the way that it was paced.

The atmosphere was a combination of nice and not-so-nice. They've done a wonderful job of transitioning the house into a beautifully furnished restaurant. . I didn't love the closeness to the other diners, especially the bachelorette parties in front of and beside us that got rowdier as the night wore on (general screechiness and shot-taking does not make for a romantic evening) The club-like music was out of character for the otherwise upscale and serious setting. 

It was weird, maybe we'll try again."}
{"text":"I was referred to this establishment from Cowboy Caio as they didn't have their Buffalo Carpacioo. So I went to the house brasserie for their steak tartar which was a mistake.  It was a \"FAIL\" for anyone looking for a traditional steak tartar as it came with fries, a small pigeon? Yolk (overdone) which didn't add to the moisture of the dish which was more of a pate than a tartar.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here for Valentine's Day Dinner and it couldn't have been better.

We had a great table on the beautiful patio.

Service was outstanding.  Attentive, kind, and fun.  

The food was incredible.  We ordered appetizers, sides, and entrees, and all of it was delicious.

Be prepared to spend around $150 for a table of 2.  If you can handle that, you'll be very happy you chose to come to The House Brasserie."}
{"text":"Best chicken dish I've ever had! The scallion reduction/sauce with some root veggies very well rounded and I had to stop myself from over eating. The chicken meatball appetizer...I could've eaten as an entree...yummy yummy! Our server was great. But...I would have to say...the time between dishes was long. Perhaps it's because we sat on the patio, but we at times felt forgotten. That said, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. We had the best server I've ever had in my life and the foot and atmosphere were both awesome. I will def be back and this is my new favorite spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First time diner with the best experience. I was visiting friends in Paradise Valley and the last day we were there we came here for brunch. The outdoor ambiance was posh but still very cozy. I was blown away by the food and bottomless mimosas ; our server made them just the way I like them...lots of champagne and a splash of Orange juice. However, the thing that stood out the most to me was in the beginning when my friend finally joined us and she sat down at the table, placing her purse on the ground next to her and the server came by, with out even asking, and placed a napkin out to set her purse on top of it.

Love this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. For $30s-$40's for a dinner entree, much better options around Scottsdale. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We ended up at The House Brasserie for my husband's 50th birthday, coming all the way from Seattle to celebrate by staying at The Biltmore and eating at Cafe Monarch... it's a long story, but Cafe Monarch was not at all accommodating even after  making reservations 6 weeks prior, so luckily their chef, Christian, sent us over to House Brasserie. What a gift! House Brasserie has a beautiful setting, top notch service and wonderfully creative and delicious food. Our bill was quite large, but definitely worth it. The wine was special and our particular menu favorites were the ribeye and the fois gras. We had top executives from Microsoft and Expedia and we all agree- we will be back! Thank you to Chef Matt for a very special, memorable evening."}
{"text":"HUNGRY! That is how our party of 7 felt after we had dinner at this restaurant.  The patio is lovely - but that is the only thing House Brasserie has going for it. The short ribs were dry, overcooked and full of fat.  The salmon and chicken were also very overcooked.  We were so disappointed!  We have been here before and things have certainly changed.  We definitely will NOT be returning.  Very expensive for a lot of   NOTHING!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome gem right in Old Town!  It is located in an hold house.  The inside is very elegant.  I've eaten here twice. Once for brunch and once for dinner.  For brunch I had an outstanding homemade crepe.  For dinner,   I ate the brisket and biscuit and it was A+!   One of my new fav places!  The also have a large patio seating area!!!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate our anniversary.  Generally these occasions are congratulated upon arrival when you request in your reservation.

The service was extremely slow (aka 1 hour per course). It was so bad we opted to skip dessert.

The food: this is what you are coming for, right? Well skip the house brasserie if you want good food.  The food was inventive concept with an interesting perspective but did not deliver in overall flavor. It will leave you flat, and not worth the wait."}
{"text":"i was looking for a comfortable yet delicious place to take the boyfriend for his birthday and the friend recommended the house. i'm soooo glad that we came here! not only is it ridiculously charming and romantic, this place can seriously serve up some delicious dishes!

for starters we had the berkshire pork belly with kimchee/udon noodles/fried egg as well as the steak tartare with fries dusted with a spice rub and avocado mousse. the pork belly was super tender and juicy with a bit of sweetness which perfectly offset the vinegar tinge of the kimchee. i loved the udon and i'm a sucker for a fried egg on top of anything so i was in heaven. the steak tartare was prepared perfectly with a great citrus taste that worked with the avocado mousse. the fries kicked ass. i mean, c'mon, who doesn't love fries?

the waiter was extremely attentive and had a whole host of great recommendations when it came to the entrees and drinks. we ordered the seared diver scallops and the pork country rib. let me warn you, the portion on the pork country rib is HUGE. i wasn't even able to finish half of it and took it home (which made a badass breakfast in the morning). the seared diver scallops were buttery and melted in your mouth. 

we topped off dinner with the apple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream. holy crap that was freaking great! the perfect end to a perfect meal.

thank you, the house brasserie, for making my boyfriend's dinner fantastic and extremely enjoyable. we will definitely be back for dinner and will have to check out brunch on your dog friendly patio :)."}
{"text":"After tonight my stomach Was full but my wallet was empty. Really enjoyed the food and had a grate times every thing is sooo good. Really worth it every  sent. Supper expensive like way to much for my wallet if my parents weren't there I would probably be stuck doing the dishes. Lol 
   Maybe that how they got so many young wasters and waitresses. Jk. 
  Fun looking food and drinks, dad had a neck of lam. Is was a pice of are how they layout  the food one the plate in a pattern. Mine was pulled duck and pasta.  It was just enough where you my be want more but don't get more. You be broke unless you really wanna eat some delicious chocolate pudding with peanuts and marshmallow."}
{"text":"Awesome patio, ambiance and service. Chef Carter and Brian are fantastic. Will be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last Saturday. Best date of my life... From my date ( of course) to the amazing service and then... Oh yeah... The delicious food! You know you're in a neat place when there is a leg lamp on your table. Service ... Don't even want to call it that... Our newest buddy for the evening and is co hort room mate were so funny And had us in hysterics all night. The ambience ... So very nice. Hint... I just bought Ikea out of tea lights and votives so I can recreate their ambiance in my home. The food, you ask? Oh my! I had crispy short ribs with fried crab rice. My amazing date had beer marinated chicken and side of mushrooms . All insane ! Mushrooms were to die for! I'm a mushroom foodie . Try this place out. You will have a new favorite dining spot !"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Been wanting to come here for a while and I wish it had been better. The place is very cute, small and romantic. We sat at the bar while waiting for our table. The bartender was lovely and the specialty cocktails were super tasty. I had the Manhattan which was delicious. We sat and ordered promptly. It took about 25-30 minutes for us to get our food. The food we received was our entrees. However we had ordered an appetizer which just never showed up. Our server apologized and asked if we wanted it then, with our entrees in front of us. We declined. My SO's steak was cooked very well. I had the pork chop which was ok. The broccolini side was tasty, but the egg was slightly over poached and the yolk was not very runny. We had a dessert cocktail which was very good. We were also served complimentary limoncello. However when our server returned with the check I glanced down and then looked up and she had bussed my limoncello of which I had only had one sip. For some reason it really irked me to be served something complimentary and then have it removed before I had the chance to even enjoy it. Definitely left me with a bad taste. There are definitely some positives to the place but I'm not itching to go back. Oddly enough, if I did go back, I think it'd just be to go to the bar!"}
{"text":"The decor is shall I say overdone \"eclectic antique,\" but quaint.\" Music was too upbeat for breakfast, but then changed to a nicer soft jazz.. The ladies bathroom didn't have the toilet seat covers replenished.  The place must be esthetically romantic, but a fire hazard with all of the candles at night, but I wont bother to find out and this is why:
A big dining out day and they failed for brunch. Vday brunch=meh. From overpriced Evian at 7 a bottle to a 12 sangria; reasonable prices for repeated visits would be 5 and 9 respectively. We shared the scrambled eggs which were delicious, but they failed to give us the two small accompanying toasts, and a bit of a simple carb was needed. Same with the salad; no toast or biscuit served and every dish that pased me had one or two. The smattering of pruciouto was expected....eating in Spain definately spoiled us. We also shared the crab loie salad and it had a sprinkling of crab, at 20, this was pretty sad. If they want to emulate Barcelona, (and prices in Barcelona are less, at least were just a few mos ago)  or anywhere in Spain, start with some olives and breadsticks, gratis and add a croquet or 2 with a carb free dish--meal idea 101. And no butter or olive oil needed guys, save your money if you need it more than your reputation. And instead of investing in another restaurant, how about a small olive grove, they grow like weeds out here and you could serve them on the side! I understand that rent and chef wages are high, but restaurants are a competitve market, and the ingredients were not organic --which makes me wish that I could open my own because I could have created all of this in my own kitchen and better, but it's my day off. The water men were very nice, as was our waiter, but no biscuits on menu. I feel bad for those who drank bottomless mimosas with no crackers or breadsticks to soak up the alcohol. I didnt even want to stay for a coffee. We left hungry and had a croissant and espresso at Starbucks afterwards. The saving grace was my handsome, generous and loving husband, who would have taken me anywhere upon my request."}
{"text":"Went to brunch had the apple pancake was very good.  Wife had the scrambled eggs ( 6 yes 6) were fine. There were no meat choices for sides.  Cost $96 including tip for 4 people, NO BOOZE.  I noticed that some of the wine prices on a per bottle basis were as high as $455++, but high end brands.  I saw some by the glass Chardonnay for $19, $66 per bottle.  I want to try it for dinner."}
{"text":"A lovely patio, and impeccable service. Food was mostly excellent. Three of us started with two shared plates -- gnocchi and grilled zucchini, both of which were yummy. Two of us had entrees -- I had filet mignon which was excellent, and perfectly cooked. Another member of our party had the lamb bolognese, which sounded really good but she felt it was too heavy on the olives and said she didn't quite enjoy it and wouldn't order it again. We also had the grilled cauliflower and asparagus as sides, both of which were delish. Would get the grilled cauliflower again."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonite.  We also had dinner there 10 days ago.  Maybe we should have thought twice and went to another place but the ambience is so nice and on a gorgeous nite here....why not.  I know why not.  We had the mall plate of meatballs and gnocchi....mediocre at best.  I don't know what seasoning they used in the sauce, but my Italian relatives would be modified.  I had the pork belly and it was good, a bit dried out, but it's what they put with it, that was a total turn off.  Cabbage was not good and they had some fronds of the fennel, with hardly any fennel, and some mini mystery vegetable.  There was no taste to any of the veggies.  Husband had the duck both times and enjoyed it.  The fist was the choice of our friends.  They enjoyed it, but didn't like the lentil under the fish.  The prices might be a bit high for very small portions.  The thought of Brussel sprout salad sounded enticing but the taste wasn't exciting....lacked any definition of flavor or seasoning.  Quite boring! The restaurant is OK, but not a rush-to-go-back type of place!"}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give 4.5 stars.  We celebrated our anniversary here this past weekend.  

The restaurant itself is extremely charming and in cooler temperatures, the patio is probably a wonderful place to enjoy a meal.  

Do not miss the craft cocktails.  They are interesting, unique, and tasty.  

We shared the brisket on a biscuit and the crab fondue.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The fondue was tasty as well but it did tasty unfortunately fishy.  

The filet was perfectly prepared and the brie and basil fingerling potatoes were delicious.  My husband's lamb was enjoyable but he was disappointed to find that the kitchen had substituted peas for fava beans.  He let the waiter know and they were kind enough to buy us dessert.  

Our waiter was charming, friendly and appropriately attentive.  

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Could have been great but not. Took 25 minutes to get the first incorrect cocktail and another 10 to get the second and then a manager to get the correct very simple gimlet to the table. Bibb salad was excellent. Cod was rubbery over cocked and not tasteful.  Service was subpar and unapologetic . Won't be coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"A friend and I dined at \"The House,\" for the first time today.  It was our annual Holiday luncheon and I was disappointed.  I am familiar with the other two restaurants, in the mix (Zinc Bistro and The Mission) and enjoy both, very much.  I was expecting the same caliber of food and service in the newest addition.  That didn't happen.

First of all, their on-line menu and \"actual\" menu are different.  The on-line version listed entrees, in the Lunch section.  Not so, in real life - sandwiches and salads are it.  I had already decided on the Hangar Steak, so was disappointed when I had to settle for a turkey sandwich.  Not my idea of a gala lunch.  The sandwich was okay and that's the best you could say for it.

The service staff actually argued, with me, about the on-line menu listings (which I checked when I got home - yes, entrees are listed, as I write) and so did a manager type, who checked our table, at the very end.  This is just not the caliber of service that I personally know that Brian expects of his staff.

On the plus side, the Apple Shandy cocktail was delish; ditto the Irish coffee.  So the outing wasn't a complete bust but it came very close and for $90+, for two, for lunch - yeah, I am disappointed and would not go back again.  At least not for lunch.  Because I know of the caliber of the other two restaurants, I'd be willing to give it a go, for dinner."}
{"text":"Finally able to try the House restaurant.  It has a very sophisticated atmosphere where you can enjoy a relaxing night out with your guest or friends. You are not rushed through dinner and have adequate time between courses.  The service and knowledge of the waitstaff was excellent.   

The restaurant is a a bit pricey so it is definitely a special occasion time of place.  For starters we had the shrimp with roast corn and Arizona ricotta toast, Creekstone filet and Halibut as the entrees and for dessert we tried the caramel apple cake and goat cheese cake.  Everything was cooked perfectly with wonderful combination of flavors in all dishes. A great dining experience."}
{"text":"My apologies for not writing this review earlier, but you can thank me now.  I have had the pleasure of dining at The House Brasserie on more than a handful of times during brunch, lunch and dinner.  When I find a new place that I obsess about, I find myself making up reasons to return and the holidays provided just the perfect excuse!
This is an old house that has been converted into a restaurant.  You will feel like you have been transported out of Arizona.  I am already thinking of throwing a baby / wedding shower on the beautiful patio.

I will start with brunch, the brunch menu is limited at this point but the staff said Chef Carter plans to add more selections.  But heck, I do not need more selections. I dined with 2 friends and we started with the family style marscapone eggs.  These eggs were exceptionally tasty and fluffy and serve with warm baguette on the side.  The highlight tho was the crepe. This should come as no surprise since the chef said his first job in France was as a creperie.  The crepe was filled with marscapone with just the right amount of sweetness and topped with an assortment of fresh warm berries. I begged the manager to add this to there dessert menu so I could indulge more often.

I have had the pleasure of dining at The House for lunch a couple of times, an absolutely charming place to enjoy and leisurely lunch on the patio.  Luckily I have dined with friends who do not mind sharing a bite of there meal.  I have been impressed with all of the items. So far I have tried the turkey, pastrami, chicken parm, shaved pork belly and the double burger. All of these sandwiches are served with outstanding crinkle fries.  The standout sandwich was the shaved pork belly BUT you really cannot go wrong with any of the selections from my experience. 

On to dinner, where to begin...  I definitely recommend starting with one of the amazing homemade soups and salads.  I love the kale salad. Then you can go in either directions and try a bunch of share plates or order a entree. I have done them all but whatever I order I an sure to get the kale salad and popcorn bacon grits; simply divine. 

See you again soon House Brasserie!! I love you"}
{"text":"First of all, the atmosphere of this place is phenomenal. Sitting in the outdoor garden/patio makes you feel removed from all of Arizona and into a rustic countryside inn. I was excited for a great experience as I walked up to my friends who had already been seated. Unfortunately, the food took FOREVER to come out. We finally ate after twiddling our thumbs and repetitive requests about what's going on in the kitchen. Granted, we were a large party but the restaurant was not busy at all on the weekday dinner service. The food was nicely plated but I don't think the taste warranted the wait and price.  Too bad because this would be a perfect date night if the food were actually good. My lamb ragout was passable. I liked the little crostini better than the actual pasta dish.  My friend did say the ribeye was cooked very well and the halibut special got a nod. Manager did come over to apologize and tried to make things right for us which was appreciated."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

It is mainly patio, but it is a beautiful patio! Lots of heaters and a gorgeous fireplace to keep you nice and toasty on these few cold nights we will have. 
All of the staff seem very friendly, starting with the ladies at the front. Pleasant smiles, and offered champagne right away! I felt like I was walking into a very welcoming home of one of my families. Most people would expect an Old Town Scottsdale \"fine dining\" place to be stuffy, but this is far from! Extremely comfortable. 

We sat at the bar with Kevin. We found out later that he is the bar manager there. What a friendly, funny, and knowledgeable guy! We asked for recommendations from scotch to wine and he nailed it every time! Not to mention the things he has created: house made root beer, that he apparently created with a fellow bartender at his own home. He reduces all sorts of amazing spices (star anise, sassafras, and many many more) with a special type of sugar to make a syrup. He then simply adds soda water. AMAZING! Oh, any Fireball lovers out there? Its the new hot thing right? You HAVE to try his house made cinnamon whiskey. Holy crap. He also told us the story about the history of The House. Ask your server when you go in! It is a neat highlight. 

Every ounce of food that we had was spectacular. I didn't expect anything less with Chef Carter creating the menu. I'm sure he has some amazing talents back there helping him out as well. We started with the Brisket biscuit . Probably my favorite out of the entire meal. We then had the Bolognese, this absolutely blew my mind. We had a caramel apple up-side-down cake with pistachio ice cream to finish. Outstanding! 

All in all, great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to come back for dinner a year after a food tour took us here. Everything was fabulous. We split the Brussel sprout salad and it was so simple and tasty. I had the duck bolognese and it was divine. The red sauce was well balanced by the green chive butter. So happy with my choice and the service was so friendly."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for Valentine's Day as it was listed somewhere as being one of the most romantic restaurants in Scottsdale (I think all the Phoenix romantic restaurants were already booked).  So my impressions of its looks: indoors, the flocked wallpaper, crystal chandliers, many ornate mirrors, all lend a quaint, old time charm.  (Our waitress was sure to tell us that it is the second oldest house in Scottsdale, although it has been renovated).  But the ceilings are exposed with metal struts, and the music goes along with it to lend an urban vibe.  To me, it was inconsistent, trying to please everyone but a bit bizarre.  So, okay, I didn't stare at the ceiling.

Our waitress was great.  She was dressed in classy black, not the usual waitress garb, and definitely seemed to know about the different wines and the dishes that were available.  That spoke to some good experience at this place, which seems rare to find these days.  

The menu had plenty of choices, and let me say this right now, you really need to pick multiple courses in order to not leave hungry, as the portions are small.  This is one of those special occassion places where you get looks over portion sizes.  Where the price of the course is inversely related to the amount you get.  

We started with a complimentary amuse bouche, with some cheese baked into a pastry coating I think.  I considered getting the caviar special, but when I later found out the price ($80 for an ounce), I decided on something else.  I got a \"smoked burrata\", which was supposed to be a mozzarrella cheese on the outside, riccotta on the inside, and some other stuff served with toast points.  What I got was a mound of white cheesy stuff which had no discernable flavor at all.  It came with pomegranate seeds, caramelized pearl onions, and non-descript white french bread smeared with some kind of fruity thing.  Not toasted.  This dish was a flop, in my opinion.  My wife got the foie gras.  She had to ask twice to get the advertised toast to put it on.  Finally she got some hearty, raisin-filled toast with which to put the foie on.  I tasted the toast and it was good.  If they had used that toast on my dish, it would have been passable.  I'm not a fan of foie based on the animal cruelty issues brought up, but the wifey wanted it.

We shared the lobster bisque.  Again, a small bowl, where it comes with lobster pieces and some chopped veggies in the bowl, and they pour in the soup.  And unlike many bisques, this was fairly liquidy, not rich and creamy, so no waistline worries there. It was quite tasty.

A nice feature is that all of their wines are available by the glass, so no need to pony up for a whole bottle because you want to try something only available that way.

For the main course I got the snapper.  A nice piece, very well cooked.  It came with a mild red sauce, a couple of tiny potatoes cut in half and chopped haricot verts.  I ordered a side of roasted cauliflower for the table which was very good, coming with browned butter, parmesan, and other flavors.  The wifey order the special, a strip steak which came with a dollop of mashed potatoes.  But there was enough steak left over to take home.

For dessert, we ordered a variation of their special, which was a chocolate cake with Kahlua, peppermint cotton candy on top, with a chocolate espresso sauce surrounding it.  We got some honey lavendar ice cream on the side, which was delicious.

Our waitress check on us just the right amount; our water was frequently refilled, and food was brought out and plates removed with excellent timing. 

With the exception of the appetizer mentioned, I'd say all the food was delicious and well-prepared and presented, with excellent service.  I do think it is a bit pricey for what you get, so even factoring everything in, I'd say the value isn't the best.  If you're in the mood to splurge and you're looking to eat in Old Town Scottsdale, then consider this place to go."}
{"text":"The lamb ragu pasta will ruin any pasta I ever order. The meatballs with fois gras was amazing. Overall, our whole meal was perfect. 
The service was also the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Had the house with some good friends and enjoyed the the patio seating.

Tried 6 appetizers and 4 entrees like we were cool, took food home as the was only 4 of us.

The duck buns, the fried rice were really good.

The owner was very cool knew our friends bought us a round on much not needed tequila as we we're already tipsy, but nice night cap...I think...don't really remember much. After that."}
{"text":"Always walke past this place and finally decide to try it. Unique location which I liked. Wait staff was friendly and accommodating. Good drinks and old fashion was very good. The bake brie was very good and I am not a brie person we also had the chicken and gnocchi starter and that was very tasty. The Bolognese and swordfish for dine were tasty and flavorful. Portions were good, as they were just enough ( hate walking/ rolling out of a resturant because I ate to much). the drip coffee at the end was great. Would recommend to eat here"}
{"text":"I loved this place in a recent visit to Scottsdale. A smooth, sexy vibe with a sleek, well managed environment and menu. I loved the Foie Gras with eel, the scottish salmon, and the Goodnight Kiss after an excellent meal. We tried half a dozen appetizers including duck confit and lobster roll and all were excellent. Party of about 20 but they handled us all very, very well."}
{"text":"After many dinners at the house, last night was the disappointment.

1.  Hostess called to confirm our reservation. We were told we would need to leave out table promptly at 8:45 to give our table to the next reservation. The restaurant was never at capacity with many empty tables throughout the evening.

2. Whe we were sat there were no menues! The restaurant was half full and they don't have any menu's? Really?  We waited 15 minutes to get a menu.

3.  The Crab rice was WAY oversalted! After bringing this to the managers attention, we were told it was to the chef's taste.  Minutes later the manager returned to the table and said the chef tasted the rice and it was oversalted when prepares by the sous chef, they pulled it from service.  Does the chef not taste his own food?

I have frequently dined here, this last dinner may be just that.......the last."}
{"text":"You have to be drinking the cool aid if you like this place.  Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is charming and the staff is great (two things that are super important in dining).  But if you want a great meal and a fair price, this is not the place for you.  Portions were TINY in comparison to the PRICE.  Food was okay, nothing to write home about.  

It's funny, at the end of the night my wife and I said \"wow, the best thing we tasted were the french fries.\"  At any rate, after a $350 bill with tip NOT SUPER IMPRESSED.  I would not go back based on that.  If the food was AMAZEBALLS, then maybe, but it wasn't that.  

When I got home I ate a Cliff bar so at least I had something to eat.  Place doesn't work for me, if you want to just blow cash and say you were there then fine.  For a great meal I would (and will be) looking somewhere else.  

Again, no disrespect to the staff, which were very attentive.

Have fun, and Find Your Sizzle

{"text":"Having so many options for Christmas Eve dinner, we chose to go to the House, one of our favorite \"Go To\" date night spots.  My husband is a vegetarian, so there were many delicious side options for him.  I ordered the filet, which I have had in the past, and enjoyed very much.  Tonight, the filet preparation was just \"off\" to say the least.  It was tough and simply not a good cut of meat.  Our server was amazing, and she kindly returned it to the kitchen.  They sent out another filet, this time, well over cooked.  The manager, Vincent, came by to check on my meal, and I honestly let him know that my meal was \"OK\".  I felt awful that I couldn't honestly say it was up to the usual House standard, and Vincent insisted that they bring me another entree to make it right.  He suggested I try the swordfish, and it truly was amazing.  Vincent made our entire evening enjoyable and we were so happy with the service once again.  I understand that every restaurant can have an off night, and tonight, the entire staff at the House made our dining experience right...and we will definitely be back again.  Brunch is one of our favorites at the House!!!"}
{"text":"We had a large party This past weekend there and they totally took advantage of us . We told the waiter we wanted to share some things and do a tasting type of menu ... He proceeded to bring at least one Appetizer and one entree for every guest - $2k later we walked out of there with sticker shock- some of the dishes like the chicken and duck entrees were good, the steak was overcooked and not close to the value of the price they were Charging - none of the 16 in our party will be back"}
{"text":"7:30 birthday reservation on a weekday, we get there at 7:15 and the hostess asks us to wait. Really?  As I walked to the restroom, there were plenty of open tables.  They must be preparing for a nice bday surprise was my guess ... Nope. When we were seated our server asks if we were celebrating a special occasion. Why the need to ask when that was noted in the online reservation? Pointless!!

The food was all really salty, I should've sent it back but hubby didn't seem to mind as he finished everything after I took a few bites.  They did bring me a birthday pudding which was nice but it still doesn't change the fact the food was subpar.  Disappointing since French is my favorite cuisine. Guess any place would have a hard time standing up against Bouchon in Beverly Hills, CA. 

Loved the ambiance, romantic with a touch of rustic. Our server was friendly but hard to track down at times, and left us waiting a while for the bill."}
{"text":"Two stars for service or lack thereof. Had a fantastic meal here without a wait person through 90% of the experience.
Difficult to give a good review even though the food was outstanding.
Sat for a bit without any service ordered immediately. Found out after our meal that there were specials on the menu as overheard from another table who had wait service. Served s meal but no one ever checked to see if okay.
Had to ask hostess for another drink or
Go to bar ourselves as no one was ever coming to our table other than to drop off food.
Service did not equal prices 
Food was delicious"}
{"text":"Our second visit to The House was just as delightful as our first!  The service at this restaurant is better than we have ever experienced - it's just amazing.  Warm, friendly, knowledgeable but not bothersome or overbearing.  
Our choices on this visit did not disappoint and included Baked St. Andre Cheese for starter followed by the Arizona Arugula, Shallot, and Strawberry Salad.  Our entree was a special on this night - a Rib-eye on Udon noodles with Saffron and a side of Dungeness Crab Fried Rice.    We would order each one again, but we so enjoy trying the new offerings at The House!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations and was left with a bitter taste in my mouth.  For my appetizer the fried chicken oysters tasted like flour and were over cooked.  They actually left a very bitter aftertaste.  The short rib was tough and I was not impressed with the olive and pickled yellow tomato combo.  The smoke mushrooms had a great smokiness but with a sweet sauce that was not to my liking.  The cauliflower side was okay, but I have had better.  My wife had the filet.  It was flavorless and not seasoned.  The pepper and corn that comes with it is just okay.  The dining experience itself is okay and the staff was good.  However the food did not live up to what I expect. I hope next time when I try different items it will be different."}
{"text":"Recently visited Scottsdale and stumbled upon this jewel of a restaurant off the beaten path. It was so inviting from the street that we HAD to stop; little house under big beautiful trees, twinkling lights, outside patio with table lamps becconing us in. It was so warm at night that an outdoor table under the trees was perfect. The music was a nice, down-tempo house variety which set a great summer mood. We ordered food to share... brussel sprout salad, smashed fingerlings with basil and a pork dish. I have to say that with the same owners and chefs as the Mission, the food tends to be over thought a tad pretentious. The sides were simple and great but the main dish was all over the place in terms of it's flavor profile...in other words no cohesion.  The dining room and restroom are gorgeous and make for one really romantic night out and definitely worth a visit. I would recommend though, that one select the uncomplicated dishes because when they keep it simple, the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!!!! I love this place! I came to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and was blown away with this gem! A house transformed into a romantic escape! I am obsessed with this place! I have always wanted to come here! 

The service was very fast, friendly, and 'on point'! Our wine was perfectly paired and all the suggested plates we tried and loved! 
Besides the celebration of my boyfriends birthday he ended up proposing!!!! Even a better moment! The night kept getting better! 
I'm so happy he proposed here as it is now my new favorite place to go! Our night couldn't have been more perfect! Many thanks to the wonderful staff!!!"}
{"text":"I feel really terrible for the review that's about to happen here, however this was a not so awesome experience and for feedback's sake it needs to be done:

Last night of restaurant week, I show up with 5 friends and 2 more on the way around 8:30.
We're seated immediately, which was nice, however we're seated at a table with a dirty cloth (looked almost like blood on the cloth but I'm assuming it was wine). While the 5 of us are sitting in our chairs, they change the table cloth out from underneath us awkwardly. 
Our first waitress of the night comes over, we ask for restaurant week menus and waters. The menus came eventually (5-10 minutes), however it took 25 maybe 30 minutes at least to get waters. 
We order our first rounds of drinks, they arrive quickly enough. Nice little gruy√®re popovers arrive at the table - yummy.
In this period of time we receive a new waiter, he takes drink orders for the rest of our table, and our two other friends arrive.
This is where things start going downhill. Two remaining friends order wine, and we all place our food orders.
Majority of the table orders Cavatelli - some of our dishes seemed undercooked while others (mine) were cold. Still no wine for our friends.
Second round of food comes out a bit later, everyone at the table ordered the skirt steak. I ordered mine rare, which is next to impossible to mess up, and it was delicious. The rest of the table also received rare steaks in spite of whatever temperature they were ordered at. Still no wine for our friends. One of our friends had to send her steak back to be re-cooked, because it was not up to par. Another friend commented on how portions seemed inconsistent across the table and how they were plated differently (she got sauce, I didn't, etc.) Our waiter was also visibly upset by how poorly our service was going, which is understandable but sort of uncomfortable to witness. 
We had to request the wine several times, maybe 3-4, before they were served -- at least a half hour after they were ordered, maybe longer, and in the middle of our dinner service.  

Now, in fairness, the waiter comped a round of drinks, apologized profusely, and served a complementary kahlua shot, however as mentioned I think it's important for upper management here to understand the extent to which things were falling apart. I hope you guys get your shit together(!!), The House is walking distance from where I live, and I'd hate to see you not exist due to experiences like this one."}
{"text":"This AZ native found dining outside on a Friday evening in late January fabulous for the ambiance on the patio. Our party of five were seated very comfortably at a round table, with extra elbow room, but not too huge we'd have to shout to be heard. Prices are high, as you would expect in this part of town.  But the food, good sized portions on main meal but skimpy on appetizer and dessert, was outstanding in every category, from the 3 appetizers, red snapper, pork chop, and 3 desserts we shared.  Must try the lavender ice cream...  This is a great place to take someone on a first date, or even a romantic celebration for two. There was another large group just a few feet from us celebrating a birthday and having an awesome time. The noise was not a factor because of the layout of the place. Tim, our waiter, was attentive, recommended selections that we weren't disappointed with in the least and we loved that he played back with our sense of humor. Only negative: one bathroom stall, ladies, and no room to wait except outside the door. Not a big deal for most folks. Otherwise, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in here this evening right when they called last call, and Keith the bartender was nice enough to pour me a good red wine and even a complementary shot of flavored whiskey. The ambiance is simply seductive. Shades of Belle Epoch Paris, with chandelier lighting, and a great drink list...I will have to come back with a date and do dinner and the whole works."}
{"text":"The House Brasserie was amazing. Todd and Tommy were our waiters and they were so nice and very helpful in every way. We were there this past weekend for a bacherlorette weekend and the food was amazing. We ordered sevewral dishes and split everything. A few of our favorites were the brisket and biscuit, the duck meatball, the country pork rib, the halibut, the grits, the broccolli. They even gave us a free bottle of champagne to celebrate the night. The atmosphere was so cute and fun. We would definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Sat outside with another couple and had a great dinner! Little pricey, but the quality of food was good. I love to share plates and this place is great for that!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The atmosphere is fantastic, I love the homey feel. The lighting is perfectly romantic with all the candles and string lights. The food is to die for, I loved the Creekstone Filet, it was so tender and delicate. For all my vegetarians out there, they can make the Lamb Bolognese without the lamb. The food was great but so was the service. Lupita made the night great."}
{"text":"What a magical place to enjoy my very first dinner in Scottsdale! Fellas, if you're looking for a place to DAZZLE your lady, look no further than The House!

I came into town for a work retreat and was completely taken aback by the tranquil beauty of the property and outdoor patio. We were seated outside and enjoyed a beautiful meal under the stars. Months later my head is still spinning from course after course after course which stuffed us til we were barely able to walk!

The owner came by and told us that The House is one of the oldest homes in Old Town and I loved all the wonderful stories he told us about the property. Be sure to take a walk around the property and you'll see that the renovations have blended together the historic charm of the property with contemporary accents."}
{"text":"Great venue- interesting and delightful food, quality wine list and top notch service."}
{"text":"This place blew me away. I'm a huge fan of The Mission and didn't anticipate that the food would be as good as it is. The staff was excellent. Try the house made whiskey. It tastes nothing like whiskey and is amazing! Brian and Matt have done it again."}
{"text":"Really upscale food. If you're not interested in trying something new and different then I don't suggest it. However, I really do love the food. I like how its unique and different. The place itself I absolutely love. Sitting outside in the courtyard is the way to go. It's been a while since I've been there but I will most definitely be going back soon enough!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite part about eating here is the ambiance. We read that the patio is rated one of the most romantic spots in the area and decided to give it a try for date night. It isn't super romantic in my opinion, but the candles and overhead string lighting do make it a cozy outdoor experience. 

The food was very good, my favorite item was definitely the smoked burrata which offered a delicious combination of savory soft burrata cheese with the light sweetness of the date gastrique. 

I was disappointed that although the menu lists a soup & salad section there was no soup available. The salads were okay, I preferred the \"Little Gem\" salad to the Arizona arugula which lacked flavor and substance. The Gem had delicious candied walnuts and crispy lettuce with enough dressing to make it taste great. 

The chef brought out a couple of complimentary pastries with parmesan and truffle oil that was delicious. In fact, I liked it more than anything else we had. 

The crispy chicken was good, not dried out like you find at most restaurants. I also recommend the Brussels sprouts, they are crispy and full of flavor.

I had the Smokey Manhattan which was surprisingly tasty and refreshing. If you aren't in to sweet drinks then it isn't for you."}
{"text":"Scrambled eggs are fabulous!  Yes, scrambled eggs and no, you can't make these at home!! Topped with a very tasty Bloody Mary (homemade hot sauce) ,this brunch is amazing!!! Wait staff is knowledgable and very kind."}
{"text":"Amazing great food. A quaint location that's intimate and cozy. The dishes are a little pricey but, worth the splurge"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful anniversary dinner last night on the patio. I think the thing I was most impressed with is the fact that there were several LARGE parties--like 10-15 tops--and the restaurant handled it with ease! The kitchen wasn't ridiculously backed up. The servers weren't harried and terse with other guests. In fact, 2 of those large parties were prom kids and I was very impressed with how the staff handled it all. Certain Italian restaurants in downtown Phoenix **cough cough**CIBO **cough cough** should come take note on how to handle large crowds while still treating all guests like they are important. 

The food was spot on. We started with the smoked burratta for an appetizer. Creamy, silky, heavenly cheese topped with smoked leeks and truffle oil...what's not to love? I had the kale salad and husband had the Italian farro salad. Both were delicious, not overly dressed, and chilled. Love that. For entrees, I enjoyed the Jidori Chicken which was PERFECT. It was not overcooked or overseasoned and I love the frenched bone in. Wonderful. My husband had the Creekstone filet. He likes his steak well done and House Brasserie did not disappoint. For dessert, we shared the apple upside down cake. The pistachio ice cream really made the dish...the cake itself was just kind of meh....the ice cream definitely saved it. 

The patio is BEAUTIFUL with lots of space and I highly recommend requesting outdoor seating if possible. 

While this is a \"special occasion\" priced place, we will definitely keep this one in our repertoire of places to visit again SOON!"}
{"text":"Excited to give the House another try since their opening. Our welcome consisted of not being offered the open \"champagne\" at the front door, because it was not busy enough to warrant a splash. However, there were no outside seating available, yet open tables were visible. 

The appeal of the bar drew us in and we enjoyed a great glass of wine, beer and appetizer.   (Side note) we asked the sophisticated couple next to us their suggestion and all they could say was, food great and cold. Aware that the enjoyable coveted outside seating was not available we decided to order our entree at the bar. ( it is the \"House\" and dinners are made to be shared) we ordered the Tradori chicken.   Unfortunately, we were denied once again because they only a have certain amount of food for the restaurant and would not allow us to order entrees at the bar.  Needless to say we went to the other less pretentious \"House\" Eddies.  Bon appetite"}
{"text":"The place is beautifull inside and have a warm feeling to it. The patio had an intimate ambiance. I sat at the bar and had some of the shared plates like steak tartar and arugula salad. Portion size was small so definitely you have to order couple plates. When ordering from the menu make sure you ask what comes in it so you won't be surprise because items change more often. 
Well done overall and staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Such a romantic, cozy neighborhood spot. On a beautiful evening I recommend reserving a seat on the patio. The cocktails are delicious proving the bartenders are well trained and reliable. My reco's include smoked burrata, diver scallops and the house mac & cheese. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, so freaking good!  When we arrived the waitress told us all about the building and the restaurant.  We had a rather large group (10) and they were great with serving us.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely go there again and again!"}
{"text":"Chocolate wrapped in velvet rolled up in a Sinatra song. Warm. Soft. Smooth. That's how I felt when I got here. That's how I felt while I ate. That's how I felt after I left. 

The House is home. A place where friends gather. But not to play charades and romp in the rec room. No, this is where they gather for cocktails, where they gather for supper club and ya, maybe even whisper a few secrets about the neighbors.

Remodeled from what I was told is the second-oldest house in Scottsdale, no corners were cut or expense spared in honoring the old home but completely repurposing it to be a restaurant. The massive tree in the back, the inviting patio in the front. The bar. The bathrooms. It's all meticulously planned and well-executed. That patio? Yes. That. Eat your meal there. 

And what's a house without a good meal coming out of the kitchen. The food was sublime. We dined family style, and that's the way to do it. Just order up a bunch of things and share with friends. Amongst the highlights--the crab legs, the kale salad, and pretty much anything sweet.

It's hard to describe the food. It can't be placed in one category, so don't try to pigeon hole it. It's a direct message from the chef. He's exploring and inviting you along. Certainly it will continue to be refined, but the bursts of genius were enough for me to see that this place has legs.

Charming but swanky, sexy but simple and down to earth. Bravo."}
{"text":"I went to the house tonight to celebrate my birthday with my girlfriend and our experience was incredible! Our server, Tommy, had great recommendations and really knew about the the menu and even picked out the perfect birthday dessert! The duck confit meatballs, scallops, and brisket were amazing! Jimmy, the manager, came by frequently to make sure everything was going well and after dinner we stopped by the bar for an after dinner drink and Billy created some great cocktails for us! We couldn't have had a better night!"}
{"text":"Let me clarify, we didn't actually eat. We went here on our way to a show... . We didn't have reservations admittedly, but let the wait staff at the door know that we were on our way to a show and just needed to know if we could  be sat in time. Rather than giving an answer they kept saying they were waiting on menus. They clearly didn't want to serve us, they indicated that we could eat in the bar but then didn't provide any service there.
I walked away feeling like the staff were very elitist and the experience put a damper on our night out."}
{"text":"\"We don't do shitty food, and we don't do sober\" - Par, our waiter. Perfect. 

I only really got a little taste of this place but it is definitely enough to get me to come back for a full experience. I arrived seeking a group of friends who already had a reservation. We were a large group for the place but all of our servers and waiters were amazing. Especially Par; he was funny, encouraging, accommodating, and entertaining. 

There were plenty of appetizers ordered for the table. A few of the ones I got to sample were the very savory chicken oysters, and the smoky mac and cheese. I know there were more but they were all delicious! I also had the Midnight Gaucho cocktail which was tasty and strong!

This was the first stop of many that night and it really started the night off right! I will definitely be back to try more of their delicious food and drinks. The ambiance was also something I really liked - classy and classic."}
{"text":"If you were ever having a dilemma of choosing to go here for food or drinks between cafe monarch, Fnb, or virtu, go with any of the other 3 rather than here. Food, if you are hungry, they are tolerable; drinks, you are better off going all the way to bitter twisted in downtown Phoenix. The location and ambiance are nice."}
{"text":"The House sits on a quiet tucked away lot in Old Town. I know; Not what you would typically expect , but it's delightful and romantic in its beauty from the street. It's quiet so you don't know Old Town is bustling right there! 

Walking in thru The House, the rustic, yet fancy appeal is perfect for this fall evening and on to the patio we are guided with its white umbrellas and flickering small, white lights amongst woven vine'd fencing; this is exactly the setting I wanted for a night to celebrate my husband. 
We were greeted with waters immediately and my purse was given a small nappie for my purse. Nice touch. We started with aperitifs : mine was the usual sparkling rose ; I am immediately impressed that the waitress suggested my daughter try a Housemade Lavender Lemonade , it was tasty and refreshing with a hint of lavender. My husband started with a Smoked Manhattan: Makers Mark; Carpano Antica; Cherry Cola Redux; Smoked Alder; & Black Walnut Bitters. Tasty! But strong! This is when the 'amuse bouche' of small cheese courgettes arrived. These small biscuity puffs are full of flavor and honestly , could fill you up! 
We love foie gras. Here in Arizona we find the rich, french, tasty, good stuff hard to find! Here at The House, it's exceptional and excellent! Ours had a fruity relish that I can't quite recall, with toasted bread points and again.. ALL kinds of yum! 

On to our entrees: My daughter and I both ordered the Creekstone Filet, which is housed upon Shishito Peppers; Roasted Corn ( although I can not have , and they had no issues removing ) and a Sherry Onion Demi. It came with amazing mashers too and this filet was all kinds of filling and perfectly flavored & prepared. My husband had the Baja Grouper; a ample serving of amazing white fish also cooked to perfection over Hedgehog Mushroom; Zucchini; Chorizo; a really unique Black Rice and Saffron Cream. We also all shared the Simple Salad; The Mac & Cheese ; and the Dungeness Crab Fried Rice. Rich! But worth a sampling! Needless to say, we came home, AS always with a ton of leftovers and our tastebuds happy! My daughter had to try Emily's Donuts which are served as 3 with 3 different sauces: Chocolate; Caramel and Apple were tonight's sauce. My husband was treated to a Chocolate Nut Torte. The House is a beautiful, swanky place that is perfect for date night; family night or even girls night ( there was a bachelorette party getting started here the night we dined! Fun! ) The wine list ; beer and mixology list is all on point and impressive. Even the bathrooms to the side of The House are worth a step in to ... they are some of the fanciest I've seen. Service was grand and we left happy and can't wait to try The Mission next and come back again.. my family simply hasn't stopped talking about The House a month later!"}
{"text":"First time here, homemade cinnamon bourbon was delicious. Thanks Billy! Decor is gorgeous , would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely quaint, charming restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale with an amazing dog friendly patio!  We stopped in for brunch today and fell in love with this place all over again.  Beautiful decor, great service and outstanding food.  I highly recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes...I am going to crave these over and over again - an absolute must try!"}
{"text":"The service was awful but the food was worst.  A number of dishes from the chef's tasting menu, which is $75 per person, were over-seasoned and unimpressive.  The potatoes and carrots in the turkey pot pie were undercooked in addition the turkey stew had way too much pepper which blew away my palate.  The following course was a white fish that was so salty that it was inedible.  Save your time, money, and palate by going to either the Citizen Public House or Tommy V's Urban Kitchen in downtown Scottsdale for a better meal."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for this place and arrived on time. We were seated at a little table with a nice intimate seating. 
The service was great. The hostess recommended different options and explained things on the menu, while also answer in our questions. 
We ordered the chicken, the fillet, a Mac and cheese, and then a brisket and biscuit as the appetizer. The food was very tasteful with its different flavor combinations. We also tried the chocolate butino for dessert. 
The only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the lighting. I know the presentation was nice, but I couldn't really see it, and couldn't see very well what I was eating. 
Overall this restaurant was a nice place to visit, and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! LOVED the ambiance - my husband and I sat on the patio and it was perfect. The service was out of this world and the food... oh the food... if this place wasn't on the pricier side (and rightfully so) I would be here every night! My new favorite restaurant. I don't eat meat and was a little concerned about having something to eat - when I let the server know and asked for recommendations, he told me about a leek and potato ravioli special that was one of the best dishes I've ordered. My husband ordered another special, halibut with squash blossoms, and he loved it! We also had their cornbread and guacamole and a salad to start - both of which were insanely good. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love. This. Place. This restaurant is just simply perfect. I love the atmosphere (chic), ambiance (cozy), cuisine (modern American) and located off the main street which gives it a more low-key feel. It is a smaller restaurant with a great outdoor patio and amazing decor both inside and out. And don't forget about the oak tree, oldest one around.

House brisket and biscuit was superb. It was rich but extremely flavorful. All of the cocktails are hand-pressed and exquisite. 

Save room for a cup of coffee and if you're going to do that you may as well have some dessert. Coffee is amazing (and dessert). I will be back to try more!

An extreme fan of Chef Matt Carter! You definitely will not be disappointed, the best combo of service and hospitality for all!"}
{"text":"Came to dinner here based on the yelp reviews. Where do I start? The short rib entr√©e had one rib. One. The extra rare filet was cooked medium. The food in general was mediocre at best. The best part of the meal was the coffee. Oh and the men's restroom floor was so slippery that all the members of the party that went to the restroom almost fell. For one hundred dollars per head I expect much much better."}
{"text":"This place is a dream come true in your mouth....my husband and I went here for our first dinner out after our wedding...it was amazingly perfect.  We ordered the bacon streak appetizer to start.  Wow...I've never seen bacon cut that thick, it was perfectly juicy and had fabulous little flavor sauces around the plate.
Next we had fois gras...never have I had fois melt in my mouth like this.  Never.  It was explained to us that this dish is prepared differently every time, depending on the ingredients the chef had and creative mood he was in...he had to have outdone himself that evening!!!  Muah, the best!  
When our server found out we had just gotten married, she brought us a glass of French champagne on the house...later, we were given another glass of French wine...I can't remember the name, but the host gave a great long description of how long it takes to harvest and how very particular the wine it, I truly enjoyed it!
Our premier meal was filet-thick cut, incredibly juicy, just perfection...it's not the cheapest place, but we will be back in a heartbeat...or after our next paycheck."}
{"text":"After hearing so many great things I brought an out of town colleague for dinner. Unfortunately our experience was soso. I knew it would not be an inexpensive dinner but I was disappointed to pay 36$ for an entre and not be wowed. My fish was good but not amazing. My friends salmon special was a bit dry. The bright spot was the bread board and the drinks. And of course the patio. The staff was nice but a bit over coached. I like a genuine atmosphere. Maybe we will try some drinks and appetizers next time and skip the entree."}
{"text":"Food was great but.........we felt rushed! Our server Lindsay kept saying no rush, no hurry, however she convinced us to order in advance because the kitchen can get backed so we did and asked her to space it out accordingly however, our salads were at our table within 5 minutes followed immediately by our main dish. Just way too fast to enjoy the beautiful outdoor patio. And the most shocking part was the price of a cup of decaf - $6! We had to ask if this was an error since my husband had a cappuccino for a reasonable $4. Lindsay said No, it is the cost of a cup of coffee. At a fine restaurant......a cup of decaf should not be $6 and refills should always be complimentary as this is what establishes a restaurant as classy."}
{"text":"Food: Amazing. Best we've had in Phoenix.
Drinks: Also great!! Best we've had in Phoenix.
Service: Couldn't have been better.
Ambiance: So romantic! We had an early reservation (6:15) on a weeknight, so we were the first ones there, and got our pick of tables. Of course, I chose the table for two in front of the outdoor fireplace."}
{"text":"A short distance from where we stayed (Hotel Valley Ho), this became our favorite place of choice for drinks.
Maybe one of the best Bar Tenders ever - Billy make crazy craft cocktails and knows his wine. The entire staff is trained well, friendly and nice.
One MUST try - FOIE GRAS. Since we cannot eat this in Cali, we had it every day with the chef making different variations. YUMMI.
I could write a long long review, but just go there and you will happy like we were."}
{"text":"One of the best new restaurants I've been to in a while. A converted 1940s-ish Scottsdale home, this place has the Best ambiance--especially the outdoor patio. The brisket appetizer is amazing. I had the scallops for the entree and it was fantastic. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale, their gnocchi & chicken meatballs, lobster gnocchi, baked robiola cheese, Cold creekstone steak tartare and smoked burrata are some of the best starters of any place I know. My favorite dish is probably the Atlantic Halibut, but the Creekstone Filet is always a hit, as is the Lamb Bolognese. Too much flavor!"}
{"text":"Nice creative menu in a beautiful setting. Great cheese plate and more"}
{"text":"Fantastic Bar...great ambiance....awesome drinks... Cordial staff.  I tried their cinnamon infused whiskey and their beers and they are fantastic. They have duval on tap!
I didn't have any food but heard good things about it. 
The ambiance is incredibly inviting and cozy. They have a nice fireplace in the back patio."}
{"text":"There is a very short list of restaurants that we will bring foodie friends visiting from out of town for a special dinner. After our second meal there, House Brasserie is definitely in the rotation (the others, in case you're curious, are Crudo, Roka Akor and Virtu).

The setting is intimate and the lighting is great. it's not so loud you can't have a conversation, but not so quiet that it lacks energy.

The service is truly top notch. On both occasions out waiter was Tommy. He was attentive, helpful, professional and pleasant. He made great recommendations yet never intrusive. Food came at the right times and temperatures.

On this occasion we dined with a group and tried just about everything on his suggestion. The cheese and meat boards he brought were fantastic appetizers. The scallops were the star entree. The pasta with lamb ragu was also outstanding. As sides the grits, broccoli and gratin potatoes were all done perfectly. Only problem is that we had no room for dessert!

One of the true 5 star spots in Phoenix. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Interesting concept from the creators of Zinc and the Mission. I love the Mission and probably rate it my top 5 AZ spots. So, flying into Phoenix to meet 2 colleagues, I'm trying to clean up my gmail account when I find a \"ribbon cutting\" email from The House Brasserie. I'd planned a dinner at Maestro's Ocean Club and cancelled via my GoGo wireless account and re-booked the House, simply based on ownership. (No offense meant to Maestro's---but, I live in So Cal and can go there anytime.)

I read the menu and had my eye set on the Paella. WARNING: The website wasn't current and therefore no paella.

We opted to try small plates v entrees and perhaps we were steered incorrectly. My favorites were the peel and eat shrimp and the lobster fried rice. I was not impressed with the lobster roll, Berkshire pork belly on kimchee, or the kale salad. (No better kale salad exists than Chelsea's kitchen because they properly massage and cut up the kale.) We also tried the duck confit. It seemed many of the dishes were \"overdone\". I don't mean overcooked, more like too rick with too many sauces and tastes which took away from the actual entree v adding to it

The positives: We had wonderful service and the ambiance in awesome offering seating inside or outside. It happened to be unseasonably cold, so we opted for inside. 

I'll probably go back, especially if the fare is lighter as winter comes and goes."}
{"text":"One of the most charming restaurants I've ever been too with a powerhouse, creative menu!  We sat outside under a giant canopied tree with standing lamps, candles, a warm breeze right at sunset.  Beyond the cozy setting, the food was simply delicious. I enjoyed the lamb bolognese which was perfect for spring. That paired with Stag Leap Petit Syrah was just perfection. I will be back when I return to Scottsdale next month!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying the house. I'm a big fan of the Mission! 
The atmosphere and deco get an easy 5 stars, such a cute little place. I wish it was cool enough to sit at the patio. But in August... we sat at the bar. 
The service was friendly but sometimes over friendly...in an awkward way. But really the food was just okay, nothing special. we had the smoked burrata and the ricotta on a toast, both were okay. the presentation was very nice, flavors were good but nothing that makes you want to lick the bowl. For main course I had the fish and he had the chicken jidori. My flavors were good but for him , the dish was too small. For dessert we had the goat cheese cake, really good and very interesting combination of flavors. Overall good! but nothing that made me want to go back."}
{"text":"This is a small Bistro with a patio in Old Town Scottsdale. The building is an older converted house so there are very few parking spaces so you have to park in the street. The interior is dark and sort of dark shabby chic with lots of candles and old mirrors. The menu is Modern American with international accents and prepared using French Techniques.

I drove across town to try this restaurant for the restaurant week menu that was three courses with an amuse bouche for $45.00 a person. When I was seated I didn't receive a restaurant week menu and there was no mention of restaurant week from my server so I had to ask about it. I thought that seemed weird to me and afterwards the server quickly handed out restaurant week menus that differed slightly from what was posted online. It turned out to be an even better menu that what was posted.

For restaurant week they gave us two amuse bouches, a generous glass of wine and three great courses.

The first amuse bouche was so tasty I could have eaten a bowl of them. They were little scoops of yummy corn bread with pickled mushroom and a fresno chili. It was like a little taste of Thanksgiving.

My first course was the malted rice with mushroom dashi. It was just delicious! I never had anything like that before.

My main course was the Scottish Salmon. The fish tasted and was prepared just as well as the salmon I had at Bouchon's in Napa Valley. It was perfect. The cauliflower and dill topping complimented the fish without over powering it and those horseradish pickles on the side might have been the most interesting pickles I ever tasted. They were delicious and I wish I could buy a jar of them.

For dessert the roasted apple pain perdu with melted camembert and cider caramel was a perfect balance of savory and sweet. It also was light in texture and oh so buttery. It was just delicious.

Service was superb.

It was a great dinner and worth driving across town for."}
{"text":"Loved the location and ambiance. Can't say the chef and I share the same taste for spices. Lots of Harissa and an un-identifiable spice on everything from the filet, the steak tartare and simple salad dressing that I didn't love. 

I had the scallops that may have been a tad over-done because they were pretty rubbery. 

Skipped dessert but had great service and a wonderful night overall."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!! Best meal I've had in a very very long time! Service was incredible, food was ridiculous, even the regular customers were excited to help w reccomendations. Fantastic date night or solo, will be back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is super exciting. The music sexy.  This would be a 5 star review. The food is effing amazing. I need a moment with my lamb. 
The service, well.....

1. I didn't order wine, please remove my glasses
2. Bubbly & a cocktails shouldn't take long. Did you go to France to get my bubbles? Are you growing the trees for the oranges?  Don't tell me that the bar got busy. The table sat after us got their drinks quickly. And they had wine & a cocktail. Hmmmm 
3. Don't try to give me bread plate to \"prepare me for possible slow kitchen\".  

Thankfully the excellent food was delivered promptly. Still service is lacking, except for the bus boy. He was prompt."}
{"text":"Never got to the food. We (2) were seated next to a party of 8 when the place was 80% empty. It was so tight, we had to shift the chairs for the wait staff to get through. Asked the young hostess and she said she couldn't move us as the front garden was reserved for 3pm Valantine's Day folks. It was 12:50pm.  Meanwhile, the waiter was pantomiming the words \"No\" and making a slashing sign with his hand past his throat to the Hostess. Apparently, he didn't want her to move us.  All this while standing behind my wife, not realizing I saw it all. Some customer service training/reasonable accomodation response is highly in order. Good bye. Too bad, other trips there were very good experiences the past few years."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for sometime, so my roomate and I stopped in for their Sunday brunch. Now I see why the reviews are so good! I had the arugula salad, my friend had an omelette, and we shared the burrata. Sooo good and I cant wait to come back for dinner. The only complaint I had was that our server was a bit pretentious,  but otherwise we really enjoyed the House Brasserie!"}
{"text":"Really cute little restaurant tucked away in downtown Scottsdale. Somewhat expensive but great unique dishes, beautiful outdoor seating and wonderful service. Nice wine list too."}
{"text":"We went to House Brasserie Friday night for a friend's birthday and loved it. The atmosphere is warm, the perfect kind of dim, absolutely charming. We had really nice drinks and the bartender was very accommodating about my requests to change the French 75 - and it was delish.  We had smoked burrata and the Barolo salumi, both were delicious.  Two of us shared a salad, which was good, and I had the filet. I like well-done meat, which is often a problem because it offends the kitchen - not here.  Thank you!!! Everyone lived their entrees (huge ribeye, scallops).  Didn't love the texture of the duck meatballs, but flavor was great. Dessert was yummy - especially the apple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream. That doesn't sound good, but it was amazing! He service was absolutely fantastic (thanks Tommy), too. I cannot wait to return - and sit on the gorgeous patio."}
{"text":"First off, to THB's credit I will say that the place was very busy the night I went (3/14/2014) and the ambiance was amazing. I chose this restaurant solely on the great Yelp reviews, so maybe my particular experience was just an unlucky one. That said...I won't be coming back.

The evening started off kind of shaky. Service was very slow to greet, and we felt like we'd been handed off back and forth between waitstaff from the outset of the meal. Waitress was definitely spread thin, and we felt rushed to put in our full order from the get-go. Personally, I like to eat my appetizers before ordering main dishes, but it seemed like this was not an option. So after waiting about 15 mins after getting our drinks, we were finally able to order. The app was great, we had the Baked St. Andre Cheese. AMAZING but we ran out of bread quickly. We ordered more...but it never came...waited for it but the cheese was getting cold, so we just ate the cheese and cancelled our order. Strike ONE.

We soon received our main dishes, the filet and the scallop entrees respectively. Scallops were great, 10/10. The steak, which we ordered medium rare, was uncooked...not undercooked, but practically BLUE in the middle. We sent it back immediately and got some cheese puffs, the night's amuse bouche, to hold us over. When we got the steak back after a good amount of time, it still wasn't cooked properly, but we were tired of waiting at this point and just decided to deal with it. STRIKE TWO.

Finally, dessert comes and it is a birthday dessert, which was a deconstructed goat cheese cake. I know this is an experimental restaurant, but this was a failed experiment for sure. However, since it was a free dish, and of course everyone's taste is different, I wasn't too upset. 

What did bother me, though, was when a waitress grabbed our UNFINISHED bottle of wine off the table before we could get a word in, and immediately threw it in the trash. We were definitely planning on finishing it or at least taking the corked bottle home. STRIKE THREE.

There was one more thing that bothered me. When I got the check, I saw that we were charged for the cheese puffs sent out by the kitchen when we sent back our undercooked steak. I brought this to the waitress' attention and she quickly removed it, but not before making a remark about how \"the first ones are free but additional ones are extra.\" When I explained that we didn't order them, she rudely interrupted me to remind me that they were indeed removed from the check so it was a non-issue.

Perhaps a one-off bad experience, but in this case; when it rains, it pours."}
{"text":"I decided on The House for our first wedding anniversary based on a recommendation. Fantastic all around - food was amazing. We started with the Licorice Pork Belly which is the best pork belly I have ever had. For the entree, I chose the scallops and they were really, really good. However, my husband had the ribeye. He let me sample it. It was probably one of the best steaks I have tried and although the scallops were great - I regrettably wished I had got the ribeye. As for drinks, out of this world cocktails. Their Manhattan is my new obsession. The House also let's you have their reserve wines by the glass which is an awesome option. Service was impeccable and personable. 

We've since returned, getting our favorite items (the ribeye all to myself finally!) and each trip is just as fantastic as the first. This is our newest much loved spot!!"}
{"text":"Lovely, rich food, adorable atmosphere, spotty service and prices that are about a third more than they should be.  If you're trying to wow a date, or just have drinks, this is a great place.  For dinner, for the money, you might be able to do better.

I've been to two parties here, and it looks really impressive.  The atmosphere alone is worth the trip for a special date night.  

I've tasted/ordered many of the dishes.  They were all delicious and well made, rich but not too heavy and in perfect portions.  However, the dishes are quite pricey, and, in my opinion, not quite remarkable enough to merit it.  I think there are plenty of fine restaurants that charge a little less and wow a little more.  

The service is, well, odd.  The hostesses and bar tenders seem nice.  However, I noticed that asking even simple questions sent the servers back to the kitchen to check - when I was a server, that was pretty rare, and they had almost the same menu many months apart, so constant changes weren't to blame.  The first time, the server was nice.  The second time, the lady was just bordering on rude, and bizzarely insistent that the salad I ordered contained no avocado (even though the menu expressly listed it).  In a place that charges so much, I would have expected polite, knowledgable staff."}
{"text":"I should give 2 stars but I'm feeling generous. I really like the place and want to give it another chance.  This was the second time here after a great first time.  I think this was a Murphy's Law meal.  It happens once in a great while.  The ambience and service are fine.  No issue there.  My food was the problem. I ordered the scallops minus the creamed cabbage, I avoid most dairy.  I asked for the Brussels sprouts from their chicken dish instead.  They didn't want to substitute.  The bartender spoke with the kitchen and they agreed to go ahead and do it.  I get the dish and it is enveloped with creamed cabbage all over the scallops and no Brussels sprouts.  I tell the guy that delivered it and he takes it away.  I decide to just play it safe and order something else.  A side of lobster fried rice.  I told them to make it as is because I didn't want to special order anything and I'm ok with egg in fried rice.  It shows up with no egg, underdone, lobster cold in the middle, yuck.  It was basically mushy rice, some lobster, and coconut milk I think.  Bland and disgusting.  I had ordered a cab and my wife ordered a champagne cocktail.  When we finished one round we both said we wanted the same.  The bartender took that as we both want a champagne cocktail.  That would be a big fat No.  Anyways, I told her and she gave me the cab.  The bartender was sweet and was trying but things were just not going well.  I was hungry and frustrated so I just let it go and said fuck it.  It happens.  Loved the place the first time and will try it again but let's hope that Murphy's Law doesn't get involved next time."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Wonderful food, cocktails, and service!  My husband and I frequently dine and enjoy trying local places and we are so pleased that we came here.  The server was great and when we were seated he was honest and told us we could order cocktails and relax a little so the kitchen could catch up!  We went for a relaxing evening and that definitely started it - he offered great input for various items on the menu based on what we said we like.  The food was top notch - fresh scallops cooked to perfection, and the chicken gidori was delicious.  We shared an upside down cake with pistachio ice-cream, yummy.  All courses were great and the price was very reasonable for the food we received.  The ambiance was cozy and sophisticated.  We highly recommend trying this - we will go back !"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in town right now!  The food is amazing, atmosphere unique, and the waitstaff is always super attentive, friendly, and knowledgable.  I can say we have experience some delays in getting food out from the kitchen, however the waitstaff has always communicated whatever issues in a timely fashion, and even brought us house-made cinnamon whiskey as a thank you for understanding.  I have had almost every small plate offered and they are all amazing.  Some favorites include the Poutine, Biscuit and Brisket, and the Arizona Ricotta.  We also always get the Popcorn Grits - to DIE for.  The drinks are truly handcrafted concoctions and the wine list is expansive and complete.

The setup of the restaurant is really wonderful.  There is plenty of inside seating with the focal point being a vintage mirrored bar that just screams \"sit here, order a drink\".  There is also patio seating and some very sexy seating around the fire place.  Additionally they have area for private events.

The bathrooms are super cute and located in a separate small house on the side of the restaurant.  Quirky and fun.

We have also had good luck with finding street parking but they offer a valet for $5."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Elegant..lovely..romantic.  Wonderful knowledgeable staff, awesome chefs..one most delicious culinary adventures ever had.  I highly recommend this when you are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The menu is great! Very different than any other place I have been. The patio is extraordinary! You have to try the Arizona Arugula Salad......."}
{"text":"Going out with work colleagues can often be an arduous task and feel as if you are merely extending a meeting beyond the borders of a traditional conference room but this 'work' dinner was not like that at all! The wait staff at The House were amazing. The ambience was perfect, quiet enough to hear each other talk but busy enough to feel the contagious energy of the other diners. Each course was impeccably presented. The description of the dishes by the wait staff was mouth-watering. The wine list was generous and even premium/ reserve wines are available by the glass. The foie gras was like butter. The rib-eye was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  While this was a splendid place for a work dinner, this location would very appropriate for special romantic occasion. The history of The House was shared and the chef deserves accolades for the meal we were served tonight."}
{"text":"Intriguing flavorful combinations and an intimate atmosphere make for a fantastic dining experience"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had great experiences both times. My sister in laws took me here for my bday earlier this year and we had a great girls night here. Fun dishes and drinks in a cozy atmosphere and of course close to old town so plenty of bars nearby for after dinner. Second time came here just sat at the bar for drinks and they had a good selection and the bar tender was able to make some speciality drinks for us"}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you for bringing such a charming restaurant to Old Town! I am giving The House a solid five stars and it's because they have the perfect ambiance and delicious food to accompany it. The ambiance is what really sets this restaurant apart from any other restaurant in Old Town. 

When I go out out to eat, I like to experience the complete package: experience + delicious cuisine. Many times, restaurants focus so much on their culinary creations that they forget about working on the environment. This is not the case for The House. The House is 'housed' within the second oldest house in Scottsdale. During my visit, I learned about the delightful woman who grew up in the house and how she loved her rose bushes. She was a member of one of the first families in Scottsdale and during one of the wars, she would deliver fallen soldier notices and then lend a helping hand to the families while they went through their time of loss. The history alone of this house defines the charm.

Hidden in a quiet street that's often missed (luckily) by the bar/club scene, The House is like a place you wish you could call home. Twinkle lights light up the spacious patio and large and luscious trees surround the perimeter. The interior of the house is just as charming as the exterior. At night, the intimate indoor glows with romantic candlelight while the warmth from the wood fired oven heats up the environment. It's the perfect environment for a date night or if you're looking for a nice setting for out of town guests, etc. 

Now that I've gushed about the environment, I will move on to the food. The food here is nothing less than spectacular, but I am not surprised because this is Matt Carter's brain child and he also runs The Mission down the street. I came here with a group of 15 and they did an excellent job serving us a variety of delicious food. The menu allowed us to sample the following:

Wood Grilled Crab Legs with Aji Amarillo Lime Butter - this is buttery goodness at it's best. The crab is fresh, completely buttered and delicious. 

House Brisket & Biscuit - this is a nice option for a hearty appetizer. The brisket is tender and well seasoned. 

Peel and Eat Shrimp - spicy alert! This dish as a serious kick and if you can handle the spice, this is definitely worth ordering. 

Kale Sale with Miso Peppercorn Dressing - I'm not a huge fan of kale, but I will say that for kale, they did a good job flavoring it and making it eatable for even the non-kale eaters. 

Italian Farro Salad 
Duck Confit Meatballs - I had no idea I was eating duck! However, it's tasty and just the right size to pop in your mouth. 

Berkshire Pork Country Ribs - the meat falls off the bones out of tenderness and it's seasoned with a spice that has a kick. 

Chateau Briand, Marinated Jidori Chicken, Lobster Friend Rice , Broccoli Carbonarra -- all these dishes were good. None of them stood out in my mind, but they were still incredibly tasty. 

Caramel Apple Upside Down Cake & Crumb Cake & Sacher Torte - pure sugary bliss!! 

I've already written a lengthy review, but before I say goodbye, I will also mention their hand crafted cocktails. They are superb! The drinks are made with freshly squeezed fruit, etc. They are a must if you enjoy craft cocktails!"}
{"text":"Well, we are back in Scottsdale so we had to come back. Was this place a one hit dinner or does it hold up for round two? I am pleased to say it was just as good, if not better! It was perfection. Every bite, every minute of the service, the ambiance, all of it. This is a must eat at place. Tonight I had the chicken meatball and gnocchi with a side of the smoked broccolini with poached egg and smoked salami (holy smokes it was too decadent to be called a vegetable). The dessert was an expresso mouse coffee cake with berry. The cake had the sugar topping (like a creme br√ªl√©e) all around it. Just stop y'all. I can't even. A-mazing! 
#winnerwinnerfrenchdinner"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Matt Carter uses the freshest ingredients around. They change the menu depending on the season and what is available. If you are a foodie get your butt in here."}
{"text":"Was so cute! A hidden gem :) In an old house lies this restaurant covered by a huge beautiful pine tree. We had the house brisket and biscuit on a food tour last night. Sat outside under the tree. Started with a glass of prosecco. Kind of reminded me of restaurants in Napa, local fresh food. Laid back atmosphere like a summer day on the back porch. 4 stars because we didn't try everything and well...After looking at the menu it is a bit expensive. Definitely will be back for a romantic date night though!! They need a happy hour to be a bit more affordable."}
{"text":"By far, The most amazing dinning experience of my life!
Chef Carter and His amazing team, from Tommy as our server to Chef Himself created a flavorful story this evening....
Just a simple girl, the love of her life Bill and our beautiful daughter Sydney had an experience that we will remember for a life time.
Thank You
Diana

Hope to visit your world again soon.

{"text":"I was here for lunch and ordered the burrata because they told me is was buffalo milk. It's not. It's not even burrata. It's regular mozzarella, and they're charging $10 for it."}
{"text":"I adore this place. Food is always consistently great and the bar manager is always a great source of new whiskey suggestions. The outside patio area is cute and the inside is nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Incredibly unique place to eat in AZ. The food is unbelievable, the service is great, and the ambiance has to be one of the best in the entire state. Outside seating recommended. There is nothing like it. Great music and vibe as well. In my opinion, this is one of the best places to wine and dine, especially for dates and anniversaries. Dinner menu recommended over lunch."}
{"text":"what a wonderful experience we had at this cozy dreamy restaurant. the food was great and staff were super friendly. definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting scottsdale just like us."}
{"text":"This place is awesome hands down the best place to go to in old town for anything great food they make me look good I'm a cab driver when I recommend this place to people they call me thanks that place was great we love it"}
{"text":"This place is terrific. Same owners as The Mission and Zinc Bistro, so of course you will find terrific ambiance, great and friendly service, and top-notch food, drinks, and wines. You will also likely be greeted by one of the owners personally at some point, and treated like an honored guest. Meanwhile, the hostesses and wait staff will take great care of you.

As for The House itself, it has a story and a life of its own: it is one of the oldest houses in Scottsdale, and the large pine tree that shades the side dining patio was a Christmas tree planted by a little girl who lived there in like 1940. The integrity and charm of all this  rich history has been thoughtfully retained -- elevated, even -- while the parlor and dining room inside have been artfully transformed into a Parisienne-type setting, like Les Deux Magots, or some other place Hemingway would have hung out in the 1920s.

It's like a fine Paris brasserie, without any of the snoot, built on a foundation of Scottsdale history and hospitality. Highly recommended!! 

In a town with a lot of top-notch options, this will surely be one of my regular stops!!"}
{"text":"Warning! Had the foie grass dish. Worst ever. Do not order this. Asked to have it redone and they brought the same platter. Do not order. This is junk."}
{"text":"Cool feelings about this spot the food smells great! Turns out the chicken dish my wife had was so good it made me order another! Very tasty dish....."}
{"text":"Biggest restaurant disappointment of the year. I've had this place bookmarked for over a year and after coup de tarte closed its door, my husband and I have been searching for a new French favorite. When our anniversary came around I jumped at the chance to try this place out. 

The restaurant is right smack downtown old town Scottsdale so I shouldn't have been shocked that parking didn't exist; we had to pay for valet across the street for the privilege of spending hundreds on dinner. Not a huge deal, but valet closed at 8pm and \"if you're staying longer, come get your keys before we close up\". Who closes valet at 8pm? My husband had to leave in the middle of dinner to get our keys. I know this isn't necessarily the restaurants fault, but they really should find a way to offer their clientele free valet (with a generous tip of course).

The restaurant as a whole is pretty charming but the patio had a huge tarp covering any sky view. 

There was a HUGE party next to us and I was afraid that service and food speed was going to be rough. It wasn't. The servers are top notch. The wine menu was definitely overpriced; there was literally a $100 glass of wine. Wowza. That aside the wine and cocktails were probably the best part of the experience.

For dinner we ordered the pork chop, duck ragu and crab fried rice. My husband seemed to like the pork but it had such a bizarre seasoning or sauce that just didn't work. The duck Ragu was good for a few bites. After that it just became a soggy pile of pasta with mushy \"duck\". I ate about a fourth of the plate and gave up. Such a disappointment. The crab fried rice was really delicious and we both ate that first, over our entrees. Nice heat but I didn't find an bits of actually crab?!

Honestly I feel this place is very overrated and hyped because it's cozy and the location is prime. Skip this and go to cafe monarch instead."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars.  My wife and I came here for a date night, and was very happy with the ambiance of the place.  This has been ranked as one of the top 10 most romantic restaurants in Scottsdale, and I believe that this is accurate.  Food wise, I was pleased.  The foie gras seemed like a good option, and the chicken meatballs seemed like it would be tasty as well.  We ordered cocktails and they were inventive.  We had the lamb pasta dish and it was yummy and appropriately portioned.  So why the lower score? 
Some logistical hiccups.  First off, we called to make a reservation and were told 845 was the earliest they could do.  Then we book on open table and get a reservation at 815... What?  Also, my goodness was the service slow.  We had planned on ordering appetizers, desert, multiple drinks but couldn't because we could never found our waiter.  The lack of attention really put a damper on the evening though and as enchanting was the atmosphere, the service was the opposite.  There is a chance for a real turn around on this place.  All the ingredients are in place.  It just needs to hire a few more waiters and it could turn into a must go."}
{"text":"The House is most definitely a new favorite restaurant in our household... I've eaten there several times already in the few months they've been open, and I plan on being back again soon.  My husband is a regular; he gets out way more than I do!

Food highlights we've had to date include the kale salad, hangar steak, brisket biscuits, chicken parm sandwich, crinkle cut fries, and broccoli carbonarra.  Desserts are pretty delightful as well, and the drink selection won't disappoint either with a ton of California wines to choose from and a unique selection of cocktails too!  Note that the menu does change often, so be open to trying the latest and greatest from Chef Matt Carter; he obviously knows what he's doing!

The House is extremely charming, with both indoor and outdoor seating in a renovated historic home.  You can tell there was a lot of thought and attention to detail put into this place.  You must take a full tour when you go and make sure to stop in the restrooms; they are pretty swanky.  Take a peak into the kitchen as well - the staff does an incredible job working in such a small space.  

Go with a friend, on a date, or with a large group... Go for lunch, dinner, or drinks.  Just go!  You will thank me later.

***Note that you will probably want to make a reservation ahead of time just in case.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot! My girlfriend and I yelped it and were not disappointed by the 4.5 star review. 

We tried 4 appetizers. The Udon noodle and Biscuit brisket w white cheddar were tops. Food was outstanding. 

The service, decor, ambiance, and quality were all top notch. The best part of all? The drink menu. Try em all!"}
{"text":"In town with friends, we wanted an early dinner and relaxed environment. The patio seating was delightful. The staff were very attentive and understanding as our group size dwindled when part of the group was delayed at the airport. We enjoyed tantalizing shared plates as starters - especially enjoying the lobster gnocchi and the bursts with bread and house made apple butter. Entrees were excellent as well."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. We ate on the patio. We had the meatball and lobster gnocchi for the table. The meatball was far better. Each of us ordered the Veal pasta. It was excellent. We also ordered an order of roasted cauliflower which was equally good. Will be back."}
{"text":"The House has a beautiful patio with a great atmosphere, perfect for date nights! The food was very delicious and rich. Our server Anne was very helpful and easy going. The only thing that was unexpected was that our food was ''auctioned off'' and with the price of the food at this restaurant, that shouldn't be happening."}
{"text":"Went to The House Brasserie on a lunch/brunch date with a friend, and I have to say this is an absolutely lovely place, we had a table out on the patio, which is right near the street, but never once did traffic or voices carry over the fence. You truly feel like you are the only ones there, well besides the other guest enjoying their meal as well. It was tranquil. I enjoyed it.

I arrived early due to traffic, so I started off with a glass of Sparkling Ros√©, I have to say I did get lost in the watching the bubbles float to the top of the glass to realize my friend was 10 minutes late, I was enjoying the peacefulness of the place.

After checking out the menu, we started with the Artisan goat milk cheese with spiced fruit jam and olive bread, the goat cheese was great and the crispiness of the bread gave it great texture, but what made it really pop was the spiced fruit jam.

For the main dish I ordered the Chimichurri Skirt Steak  Fingerling Papas Bravas, Paprika Aioli, Padr√≥n Peperonata, Raison & Marcona Almond, wow sounds like a mouth full right? I wasn't too sure about how the raisons would work with the beef, but they turned out to be perfectly paired with the steak.  I was pleased with this dish, the steak was cooked perfectly and smooth like butter. In fact I'm even craving it while writing the review! Must go back!

For dessert I had this incredible chocolate mousse with fermented strawberries with homemade vanilla bean ice cream, the mousse was extremely rich the ice cream balanced it out well. I have to say if I could would have licked my bowl clean, this was just a perfectly done dessert! 

The House Brasserie was a great choice and I look forward to many other visits!"}
{"text":"Really Good Food! Plain a simple. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Great service, great specials."}
{"text":"Nice part of history...The drink menu is crafted by local bartender Billy Bessinger...try the specials...love the local feel...it's literally a house but dressed up and a great place to hang out.   You must stop by!"}
{"text":"Lovely little cottage turned into a restaurant, with a cute outdoor patio cooled by aircon/fan.  We just wanted some quick apps and a glass of wine in the afternoon while shopping so we sat at the bar.  Turns out their primi menu (apps) is very limited unless you are there for dinner.  we had a couple cheese selections and the salami plate with wine.  the one soft cheese with truffle oil and leeks was pretty nasty (smoked burratta).  but the other cheese was really tasty (goats milk with plum jam, and we had plenty of bread. the salumi plate was good, not off the charts.  Overall, I felt it was pretty expensive.  Probably better experience to come for dinner when the full menu is available. Seems like it would be lovely and romantic with the lights on the patio."}
{"text":"First time we went here the service was amazing and the food was great. We sat outside by the fireplace which was very special and romantic. Tonight the food was once again fantastic but the waitress was so so at best. For this price I would expect professional, warm, passionate, and engaged servers. All the support staff was really great. We ordered the $6 coffee which is really good but the waitress would have left it until it was cold if we wouldn't have asked the bus boy to help us. 

Also, if you sit inside be ready to talk over loud and odd music. Also be ready to share your conversation with the patrons on both sides because there is very little room. 

All in all I would still recommend The House Brasserie but it has way more potential than it is delivering."}
{"text":"WOW! Thanks to Lindsey F, I feel like I'm becoming a PHX/Scottsdale culinary aficionado in no time! I live in Tucson and heading to Phoenix doesn't always feel like a \"getaway\" type of visit until now. I'm officially in the \"know\" of some remarkable spots and The House Brasserie is one of them. From its unique story, to incredible makeover to the quaint and romantic outdoor patio lined with twinkle lights to the fabulous bathrooms and of course the divine cuisine this place is nothing short of a solid 5-stars. The House Brasserie had recently opened and they treated our group of about 12 people to seamless and delightful evening.

I learned that night the that The House is actually \"home\" to the second old house in Scottsdale. The owners did an incredible two year remodel without compromising the original structure of this historical home. It's worth a visit even for a tour of the place. But, really the food and drinks are just as incredible.

We sat down for dinner out on the patio. Even with a group of 12, it felt intimate. We dined family style and it was more food than I could dream of! Chef came out to greet us and share a little background about his menu. I'm thankful that he did! Although the menu appears to be heavily influenced by European cuisine, there's no real category for this place and that's with intent. Chef cooks what he thinks will be delicious and his dishes draw from various global cuisines. 

My experience with most family-style dinners is that the food runs out or by the time you eat it it's cold. That was not the case here! 
Our first course sampling was as follows:
-Charcuterie Board with Saint Andre Cheese (my personal heaven!)
-Wood Grilled Cab legs with Aji Mamrillo Butter. Fresh as can be. 
-House Brisket & Biscuit with a chili jam and white cheddar. 
-Kale Salad with Miso Peppercorn Dressing: I love me some Kale and I could eat this salad all day long!
-Farro Salad with Arugula and Butternut squash. Hearty and flavorful
-Peel & Eat Shrimp: worth the effort with a spicy kick
-Duck Confit Meatballs- need I day more?

By this point we were all wow'd and the main course offerings kicked it up another notch. From the Berkshire Pork Ribs that were fall off the bone tender and juicy to the 
Chateau Briand and Marinate Jidori Chicken. It was an incredible feast. But the sides were superstars too! Lobster fried rice and Broccoli Carbonara. I was smitten.

Somehow we had room for dessert. I didn't. But I had to taste it. Missing out was not an option. Caramel Apple Upside Down Cake. Blackberry Crumb Cake. Perfection.

The House Brasserie is all about the culinary adventure. I loved everything about it. And don't miss out on their craft cocktails, as they also put as much effort into their freshly squeezed juices/mixes as they do in the kitchen.

If you haven't been, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing! Although, a very compacted place the food was phenomenal. Server was consistent. The decor is really modern and my favorite  would be the velvet wall in the break room."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try another of Matt Carter's restaurants because I am a big fan of The Mission and Zinc Bistro. Hopefully the night I visited was an \"off\" visit or this venture will fall VERY short of the other well established restaurants in this group!

The ambiance is very warm and welcoming, they do have that going for them. The waitress that we had was very disappointing though. Our party had a 9:15PM reservation on a Tuesday night and it was clear she wanted to leave from the moment we arrived. Throughout our meal, we felt so rushed and she was not shy about speeding the service up. They served our entrees to us 5 minutes after we started our appetizer course so we had a million plates on the table, and she asked more than once if we wanted our items wrapped to-go while we were clearly still eating. It was very irritating. She did not ask once throughout the meal how the food tasted. I can easily look past spotty service if the food makes up for it but this was not the case. 

Now for the food: on a side note, we were dining with a vegetarian friend (not a strict one, she eats fish and seafood as well). While I am anything but vegetarian, a well-equipped menu should ALWAYS have a few vegetarian options on hand. Her only option on the menu was a kale salad, which she said was very tasty but based on the limited nature of the menu, I would not recommend this restaurant for vegetarians. Seafood options had bacon and ham incorporated in to the dishes. We ordered two appetizers, the ham hock poutine and warm shrimp. The poutine was the only item we ordered of the night that I honestly enjoyed but the shrimp were bland (even though harissa was supposed to be in the dish!) and the very small type, though that was not specified on the menu. For entrees, we ordered the seared diver scallops, lamb ragout, and we were sent out a compted Pork Country Rib because we were dining with a former employee of a sister restaurant. The best dish was the pork one that we didn't even order, I have no complaints about that one, it was actually quite good. I found the lamb ragout to be lacking in flavor and the scallops were not seared, they were closer to steamed. Our side of crab fried rice was so salty that we couldn't eat more than one bite. After the average food, I was reluctant to order desert. 

It is possible we visited on an off night and it is also possible we ordered all the wrong things but based on our experience, I will be sticking with The Mission."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a baby shower here for my sister. The service was phenomenal. Brian, the GM was very accommodating. He put together a fabulous menu and saw to it that we had everything we needed. I love the ambiance at The House; the food and service put it over the top. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and it was awesome :) we were seated outside which is so cute and quaint. Cannot wait to come back when the weather starts to cool down. My husband ordered the filet which he loved! I wasn't as hungry so I ordered the Mac and cheese and it was really good as well. The drinks were really good also..I got the gimlet and it was delicious. This restaurant has such a great feel and the staff was so friendly. Great overall experience and perfect date night :)"}
{"text":"The beginning was rough. Bad time of day to find parking. Had a reservation for inside but our table wasn't ready and had to sit outside. Don't get me wrong it was a super nice night to be sitting outside and they have a great patio but our chairs were wet from the downpour. If I were a witch, I'd have melted. 
Want to get hammered? Order a mai Thai. Super strong. 
Great wine menu. 
Started with the foie gras. It was a nice change of pace from where we started. So delectable. And great presentation. 
The duck with handmade pasta was good for a classic dish but it didn't wow me. My partners veal chop on the other hand was wowable and well seasoned. His Mac and cheese was packed with flavor and had a nice crispy top. 
The blueberry Mochi was a superb finisher. Their ice cream comes from sweet republic which sold me immediately.
Our server Chelsea was awesome. Gave good recommendations and told us the history of the neighborhood cat Kane. Any place that feeds a stray is an immediate favorite."}
{"text":"High five Matt Carter - LOVE The House! Everything we ordered was fantastic, our service was great, and the ambiance was just perfect. Will be our new favorite place to sit outside on the patio at all winter long!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! They have a great patio in the fall it will be great. Just had a lovely Birthday dinner there. Chef Carter hits another one out of the part. I usually have the Ribeye, but opted for the pork chop. You need a to go box. They have redone the goat cheese cheesecake, birthday boy not a fan of goatcheese wants to go back just for that. And I would be remissed if I didn't mention the Brisket and Biscuit! 

I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday night with another couple.  The ambience is nice, but so dark that we all needed to use our phones to read the menu.  Food was prepared well and artfully displayed.  Wine list was pricey, but a nice selection.  Service was terrible.  We couldn't get anyone to take our dessert and coffee order.  Was told our server was focused on a bigger party.  After 20 minutes, we needed to \"twist someone's arm\" to get us the check to leave.  It was not a really busy night since it was a couple days after Thanksgiving.  Definitely not worth the premium price."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and fantastic atmosphere. Took a friend here for their last meal in Old Town and couldn't be happier"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for business, we wrapped up,our trip at The House.  What a great choice.  We started with foie gras and the cheese apps. My first time with foie gras.  Had to try it, not bad not sure it's for me though.  I had the veal chop.  Other than being slightly overcooked, (asked for med rare, got pretty heavy med). Other than that it was still a pretty darn good veal chop.  Couple others had the scallops which were amazing.  Our other companion had the ribeye, also amazing.  The crab fried rice was fantastic!

I will certainly eat here again when back in town.

Well done!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this restaurant and will definitely be our last . I am not sure if we have ever had such mediocre food . The menu looked enticing but the pork was overcooked on some pieces raw on others . Do not get me started on the sides .. Worlds smallest portion of bland tasteless macaroni and a crab fried rice that lacked any crab , flavor or dignity . This meal made me reconsider why I enjoy eating at all . There are many great local restaurants in the same price range with much bigger portions and for the love of god flavor !! I suggest mastros city hall , cafe monarch and cowboy ciao . This is not a house I would ever like to step foot in again ."}
{"text":"amazing food, cocktails & service - a great date spot, we really enjoyed our time on the patio"}
{"text":"Ambience 4 stars
Service 4 stars
Food 3 stars

The staff recommended the lamb bolognese but I didn't think it was all that special. What I truly enjoyed was the kale salad!   Next time I'll try the Mission, but will only return to House for patio seating and drinks. Thank you to our server who wrote down a couple of lounges for us to visit post dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant simply rocks. I've been there three times for dinner and each time I'm wowed all over again.

Service each time has been exceptional, with food so perfectly done that I couldn't imagine any improvements to be made.

I recommend the pork, the lamb bolognese, and of course the chicken. 

The only negative thing I can say is one that I can't say for sure, and that is what happens when the weather gets hot out! The outdoor space is inviting, and simply delightful, but they haven't been open in the heat of the summer. I hope they come up with something because I can't imagine not going there all year long!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. I will be back. I would recommend this location to anyone that wants to eat great food. So glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Fair...nothing special at this restaurant. Wine by the glass is expensive with a limited selection."}
{"text":"The meatballs tasted like rubber, the steak tartare was warm, the rice tasted like a deep fryer hadn't been cleaned in 7 years. The only good thing we're the French fries.... but who can mess up french fries?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is busy and came recommended. The decor was chandeliers, mirrors, old wallpaper... To look like an old home/cottage, but we get in and house music is blasting like its a night club. The hostess said it's because patio is busy so the music is to ensure patio is happy???? OK. Confusing. Then the menu.Very difficult to read because it was sooooo dark. Menu wasn't great, limited.  We put in an appetizer order to which the seemingly annoyed waitress said \"the kitchen likes the whole order at same time so they can time it...\" What?! Then we ask some questions about some entree descriptions and waitress again seemed  annoyed  as she told us she'd give us some time and walked away... No offer of help, no recommendations, nothing. The lobster bisque (which I live for!) Was so gross- bitter and tasted like a spoonful of burnt sherry. The amuse busch was flavorless and the chicken meatball over gnocchi was terrible. It was so bad and unpleasant we quickly canceled the firing of the steaks as we decided to leave - I've never done that before. The manager was very nice. Asked us to give the place another chance and charged $0.  Unfortunately he was the only good experience of The House."}
{"text":"Menu looks fabulous. Closed early in \"the summer\" at 9 pm. Posted here at 10.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant perhaps at least 4 times. It is a fabulous venue to take guests for a really nice meal. It's not one of the rowdier places that is located in Old Town. A wonderful wine list, a menu that is different from others. I do wish there were more gluten free options but the menu can be easily adapted. Having said that I have to say that last night meal was a disappointment. I ordered the filet with a corn garnish and French fries. Brussels spout starter. The food was far too salty. In fact it was so salty I could eat the food after only a few bites of each. Since there were four of us the Brussels sprouts were eaten quickly by the rest of the group. They said it was salty too but did not think to send the item back. The corn side that came with my steak also was extremely salty. So much so that I did not eat it  but the fries were good and the steak was fantastic so I did not send back. I did make mention of the saltiness to the server but he only made a soothing clucking sound and that it was it. It was not until later at home and reading other reviews that my thoughts that the food was overly salted confirmed."}
{"text":"Visited The House Brasserie for lunch. What an insanely charming restaurant, both inside and out. It reminded me of many European establishments I frequented while living there.  I ordered an Arizona arugula, crispy shallot, roast strawberry, Mission Figs and radish salad. My guest had the arugula, Italian farro, avocado, Bellwether Farms Crescenza, hazelnuts and salumi salad. The service was friendly, our waitress well educated on the menu. The salads were delicious, perhaps a little smaller than I had expected. Although I was there for a work lunch, this is definitely the place for a romantic date, especially at night. As a vegetarian I was disappointed in the lack of choice; however the menu looks great for people who enjoy not being vegetarian. The parking lot for the restaurant is small with room for perhaps 6 cars; there is however ample complimentary street parking. 

The good: atmosphere, food and service. The bad: limited vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Go here sit down.  Tell the server if u have any allergies and what protein u don't eat and then let them plan ur dinner!  And wine pairings with. Best experience.  The server brought out food that I would never have ordered before and everything was phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"I am a vegan and have dined at many fine restaurants in my life. This restaurant was the most unfriendly I have ever experienced. 
When I told the server I was vegan she replied that I could have one of the salads without dressing. Or maybe I could have vinegar and oil. 
As far as a main dish, there were none. None. 
I got overly spiced broccoli and bland mushrooms as my main dish. 
I ordered bread in order to be able to eat something that would satisfy hunger. 
I left hungry and when I got home I ate nuts. 
I have always been offered at least one vegan option at a fine restaurant. 
This restaurant does not serve sustainable seafood (swordfish??- endangered) and also serves the very politically incorrect and cruel foie gras. 
Do not eat at this restaurant if you are at all conscious about animal cruelty or endangered species."}
{"text":"Great place. Went there for an important date and we had a lot of fun. The wait staff was a lot more fun and personable than I've experienced at restaurants of this caliber. Everything was just perfect - we will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant... Amazing food, awesome wine selection, classy setting. Great spot for a date night!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere on the patio! Great selection of  small bites for sharing! My friends and I shared about 8 and they were all tasty!"}
{"text":"Just WOW again. Came by on foot with my dog and decided to dine at The House for lunch. Again, the patio incredibly comfortable, my dog welcomed with water. My ice tea very good and refreshing, the arugula salad great. Service fantastic from newbie Nicole, and managers Debbie and Watson stopped by to see how everything was. On Debbie's recommendation I had the chicken parmesan sandwich. This is something I would have never considered on my own and it was Amazing. Thank you to The House!"}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary dinner. We didn't have a reservation, but we must have gone at the right time as we were seated immediately. Reading some other reviews and tips, this sounds pretty freakn rare. 

Ended up getting the Aged Goats cheese plate, wild sea bass, duck bolognese, and brussel sprouts.

The aged goat cheese plate was really good. I am not a fan of blue cheese, but that whole element of the aged goat cheese was not overpowering. It was a perfect balance. Really enjoyed it, more than i thought i would (my wife prefers it thats why we ordered it). The sea bass itself was just okay, The skin could have been crispier, but the plate as a whole was delicious. There were so many elements on the plate, that when eaten together, it elevated the plate a lot. The kimchee they used on the plate was really tame for kimchee, but it had the perfect elements needed to enhance this sea bass. The duck was rich, I enjoyed it. I wish there was more duck in there, or larger chunks instead of shredded. It was my wife's plate, so the few bites I had I enjoyed, the creaminess of the marscapone, with the pasta really balanced out the richness of duck.

Brussel sprouts were well cooked, but a little heavy handed on the salt, for our preference. 

The service was great, and they brought us out some champagne and a deconstructed cheesecake, which was a great way to end the meal.

We'd come back and definitely try something different on the menu, not necessarily cause we were unhappy, but because everything sounded delicious (and some other dishes at the tables around us looked tasty)"}
{"text":"My first visit here was for the annual company holiday party and I'm jonesing to come back! The party was in December around 6pm at night - so when we arrived it was dark. The parking lot for The House Brasserie is actually pretty small, but luckily there is valet parking nearby or if you are really lucky, a spot on the street might be available. My husband and I valet parked then walked to the restaurant. Walking up you really get to take in the whole scene. The patio is lighted beautifully at night and feels very welcoming. (A little history:  The House actually used to be an older house converted into a restaurant, so the front \"yard\" is the patio, the \"driveway\" is the parking, and where a covered garage would be is the bathrooms.) 

We were greeted by a hostess and we indicated we were here for the holiday party. She guided us to the back of the patio, where a large canopy was set up with three long tables and plenty of heaters. Everything looked really nice and one of our servers for the evening stopped by for drink orders. Since I looked up the venue before the party, I knew the House was known for its in-house craft cocktails and asked for a menu. She was happy to oblige and came back saying every cocktail is made by hand with fresh ingredients. After mulling it over, I decided on a blueberry and yoghurt liqueur cocktail. After the first sip, I was in heaven. I admit, I almost didn't order it because it had yoghurt liqueur but let me tell you, it made the drink creamy, refreshing, and decadent. I really enjoyed my drink and ordered a few more throughout the evening.

When we finally sat down to start the multi-course meal, our waitress brought out the House Brisket and Biscuit with chili jam and white cheddar. The brisket was tender and juicy with a hint of spice from the jam. Next appetizer was the Jerk Chicken inside lettuce with cashews, banana and grapes. This was one of my favorite appetizers - it was both sweet and savory. I would definitely order this the next time I am back. Next on the list was the Brussel sprout salad. This had olives and parmesan cheese. This was good, but not my favorite. Finally, the actual entrees starting coming out. First was a delicate salmon atop parmesan white beans with artichokes, tomatoes and pistachios. The salmon was cooked to perfect - a little crunchy on the outside but flakey and moist on the inside. Definitely one of the best salmon dishes I've had.  Next, the Roasted Jidori Chicken with risotto was brought out. The chicken was extremely tender and moist but the risotto.... Oh, this was perfection. It was the perfect texture with mushrooms and oh so tasty. The final entr√©e was the Creekstone Filet with roasted corn. The filet came out about medium and was extremely tender. At this point, I wasn't sure if I could eat any more but it was heavenly... so I did. For dessert, mini salted caramel shakes were served with fresh house baked cookies. 

Overall, the entire multi-course meal was amazing. Being able to try so many items off the menu was pure food heaven and prepped me for when I go back. I will definitely be ordering the jerk chicken appetizers and the salmon with a blueberry yoghurt cocktail. If you are ever in the area, definitely check it out. Even if you aren't, grab a date and make plans! This is one of Scottsdale's restaurants that should not be missed."}
{"text":"Just give it a try. Anything I say will not do it justice. A perfect special occasion go to. This place will be on top for a very long time."}
{"text":"Mother's Day brunch in the patio was excellent.  The buffet choices, entree, and mimosas were delicious.  The service very attentive.  Cool vibes here."}
{"text":"This the most romantic place for foodies in Scottsdale. The service is five stars; the folks who work there love this place. Our server, Tommy McMahon, was amazing. Every recommendation was perfect. The goat cheese is the best I've ever had and the jam and bread really brings out the flavor.  Don't miss the smoked burrata; it is truly an interesting and delicious twist. Black kale salad is phenomenal. My husband had the rib eye and was in love. It came with a roasted garlic spread we could not get enough of. Each dish is thoughtful and done with creativity and care. If you love food this is a place you should not miss, it has everything, the ambience, service and culinary excitement!"}
{"text":"Same owners as The Mission, same brilliantly executed overall customer experience.

You have a good chance of meeting the GM or owner while here. Waitresses are super attentive and wear fun, matching dresses. 

You'll notice every dish is planned to nail more than one flavor experience. Something rich accompanied by something that cuts through it, which I TOTALLY appreciate: house braised brisket w/ white cheddar, then chili jam to cut thru... rich pork belly/ udon noodles, then housemade kimchi to cut thru... etc.

Typically don't like French food, but I imagine this is the best place for it. Super inventive, cutting-edge menu. Loved the duck bahn mi with housemade kimchi. Black kale salad with pepitas (same pepitas I noticed from The Mission's OUTSTANDING tableside guac) and peppercorn dressing was perfect for brunch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wine list. Our server lacked basic product knowledge which I expect from a high-end restaurant. The food was fine, not spectacular, not worth the prices."}
{"text":"You know when you order wrong and you're super jealous of what the other person orders?  That's me with this place.  I am super jealous of my other person's kale and salmon salad.  Dang it!  I'm totally going back and getting it.

I personally got the pork medallion salad with arugula and it was delicious.  Perhaps I should've checked to see that the pork served was deep fried and changed my mind, but honestly the salad was delicious.

Now we were not there during happy hour and you *pay* for your drinks otherwise. ;)  But the sangria was outstanding nonetheless.  

The patio is adorable, chic, quaint, romantic, cozy.. all those words. ;)  It's not super pretentious however.  

I'm eager to return, get that damn salad and go during happy hour so I don't end up with a $50 lunch (35 of that was booze, baby)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. It reminded me of the old scottsdale I was very fond of. Food was excellent, but more importantly, the environment was warm and romantic. We met a few friends here and had an excellent evening. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Booked a table here as we had some out-of-towner friends (from Boston and Seattle) visiting for a few days. I had eaten there before and was REALLY impressed with the quality of the food, service and surroundings.

This place is really great. Its part of the group that also has Mission (Scottsdale and Kierland) and Zinc Bristro, and all of these are superb places to dine. Gorgeous layout and decorations, low mood lighting (almost too low, as I had trouble reading the menu (without my reading glasses!) but its just a small oversight.. (excuse the pun)..

We all had a variety of meals, but started with the Fois Gras, which was just out of this worldly good!! I posted a pic of the platter when I checked in but will hopefully show it in a group photoshoot of our meals..

We all selected several different meals so we could try each one (just a little taste anyway!!) - the chicken, lamb, filet.. I think the pictures speak for themselves - these were lovely meals and I would definitely consider another visit back very soon! Great thing is that its just around the corner from home!! Even better! Enjoy/godere/disfrutar/genie√üen/prendre plaisir"}
{"text":"All I can say is... AMAZING!  

Such a quaint little cottage with adorable outside patio and brick fireplace on cold nights.  

The food is exceptionally \"foodie\" and delicious.  I had the Berkshire Pork Rib with Popcorn Grits and my friends had the Bolognese with Marscapone.  I could not stop eating!  Just pure food fantasy.  

As appetizers we had Pork Belly with Noodles and an Egg over the top - sinful.  Really.

We sat at the bar with Keith - who was so friendly and knowledgeable - he really made our experience fantastic!  Oh, be sure to ask for a cinnamon whiskey shot - a magical brew from the bar gnomes.  Thank you magical bar gnomes!  

And Thank You to The House for being everything you are."}
{"text":"This could possibly be the worst place I've ever eaten in my life.  I ate here with a group and this is the only time I've actually seen people spit their food in napkins. two of the appetizers tasted like *#*T, now I know why the keep the lighting so low, because if you could actually see the food you would send it back.  The side orders of cauliflower, Brocatini(or whatever it's called) were a pile of mush covered with something. The swordfish I ordered was a dried out small piece of fish. The person next to me ordered the trout and it looked and tasted like salmon fish sticks. The only good thing about my entire meal was the slices of dry bread. One of the other people at our table ordered the steak and that was even bad. No one really said anything during our meal but when we got into our Uber Cab we all opened up and unanimously agreed that this was some really bad food. Our Uber driver said that he's heard horrible things about the place lately and would never recommend it to anyone.

PS. I think I heard the waiter say \"The Chef\" does this, \"the Chef does that\" over 15 times during our meal. The Chef needs to be fired in my opinion. I've had better food at Applebee's.

The prices are outrageous. 

Time to for an episode of Restaurant Impossible to be filmed here."}
{"text":"11/14/12

What a romantic spot!

A friend and I decided we'd meet for dinner here (neither of us have ever been), and we elected to be seated outdoors.  Thank goodness it wasn't too chilly out, as I soon detected a repulsive sulfuric scent and were told by either manager Sal, or our server Todd, that the heat lamp was the likely source of the fumes and that he would turn it down to mitigate the repugnant odor.  Nice!  The setting outside was very pretty (lighted trees, window sills, and fences), but it quickly turned very dark, and not even the lone votive candle on our table could cast enough light for me to see my friend's face, much less read the print on the menu.  Thankfully, Todd brought us a couple of mini-flashlights to use.  

We started off by ordering the House brisket and biscuit http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=LkEx56NcRC4E9Xwo5W3qbQ#LkEx56NcRC4E9Xwo5W3qbQ, the Crab fondue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=t2WMfle_zu9MCgk-FTWP3g#t2WMfle_zu9MCgk-FTWP3g, the Arizona arugula salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=rMk1Ocoa7ddSbwltgPMXlA#rMk1Ocoa7ddSbwltgPMXlA, a Gone A-Rye cocktail for him, and a glass of Conn Creek cab sauv for me.  For entrees, he chose the Roasted Jidori Chicken (I said we could compare this dish to FnB's at a later date) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=679m8eFoykKTLfDrede3GA#679m8eFoykKTLfDrede3GA, while I was enticed by one of tonight's dinner specials, the Day scallop entree http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA?select=v9AQf7SwNC7fbdbXGYTBNw#v9AQf7SwNC7fbdbXGYTBNw.  He chose another glass of Gone A-Rye, while I opted for a light and buttery Lioco chardonnay.

House brisket and biscuit: Came with a brush of chili jam on the side, but didn't need it.  My favorite of all three apps, and I think it was his, as well.  I chose the biggest piece of the three, since he was going to get the other two!  

I really liked the viscosity and the chunkiness of the fondue, which came with a lot of crab.   However, it was a little too sweet for me, so the saltiness of the accompanying toast was appreciated.  We didn't finish this one, even though I gave it my best shot.  

The salad was lovely- I enjoyed the crispness of the grilled slices of peach, which presented a gorgeous color and glaze!  The dressing was a little too acidic for me, but my friend thought it was just right.  I really liked the triple cream crostini that came alongside the salad, for it helped to cut the sourness of the salad's dressing.

If I weren't already too full with the apps and salad, I may have enjoyed the scallop entree a little more; However, the dish did arrive with a strong seafood odor, one more akin to say a shrimp dish, rather than the lighter scent of day scallops.  I found the bites too sweet, and a little too rich.  I enjoyed the salty and crisped bacon bits and the texture and flavor of the spaetzle, but came to find out a little too late that it had a mustard base, so I'm assuming it was taken off my friend's bill.  I do know that we were offered a complimentary dessert, but we were already too full, so I elected for the caffeine in coffee, which helps to lessen food allergy symptoms.  My first time trying Chemex, and the coffee was delicious!

Hope to return soon!

p.s.  He absolutely LOVED the roasted Jidori chicken.  It came with mushrooms that sounded divine.  Too bad I couldn't try any of it.  :(  I was able to sample the second Gone A-Rye cocktail (I wanted to try a \"spicier\" version of the first) and found it a little too bitter to enjoy.  I did, however, really like the heat.  Perhaps I could talk the bartender into making a spicy mango mojito for me to try in the future?

p.p.s.  The House is so adorable, even down to the \"outhouses,\" but I doubt these will be appreciated when winter comes.  I'm picturing heat lamps taking up more space in the already crowded walkways."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal!  Very friendly, approachable and knowledgeable staff made our night even more enjoyable.  We started at the bar with a cocktail and the charcuterie sampler before moving into the dining room for our dinner.  Both salads we had were very tasty (the Brussel Sprout Salad edged out the Black Kale Salad in my opinion) as well as all three meals we ordered (Lamb Ragout, Diver Scallops and Filet).  While I didn't have the Irish Coffee, the people I were with raved about it.  

Compared to Zinc Bistro, their sister restaurant, The House Brasserie was considerably better!"}
{"text":"Renovated and transformed into a restaurant on par with many fine Manhattan eateries, this second oldest house in Scottsdale joins the ranks of CIBO and Arcadia Farm with its warm, inviting ambiance.
You're simply taken-in by its intimate decor.

The staff was cheerful, friendly and highly attentive.
The food, superb.

Mashed potatoes so silky smooth, you'll wonder how this is even possible as you make the quick comparison to the slop you eat each year at your Aunt Mary's Thanksgiving Dinner table.

Popcorn Grits. 
This side will make you lose interest in your entree as you feverishly scour the table for a large serving spoon rivaling the size of your mouth fully outstretched.
I ate this dish so quickly, it was like David Copperfield was in the house!

Imported from a mill in Tennessee, the grits are reduced into a risotto-like texture along with kernel corn, crushed popcorn, and a cheese you'll probably never find on the grocer's shelf. These grits are so wonderfully delicious, after the first bite you won't care what's on the dessert menu as you fill up on this heavenly creation.

Between the mashed potatoes and the grits, I'd eaten more carbs in one sitting than I do in a month.

The ribeye is served with marrow butter atop its caramelized, dark brown goodness.
Both the flavor and the smell will captivate you as you're quickly reminded why it is you're so fond of a good steak. SImply delightful.
The House knows its beef.

Visiting The House was a treat I won't soon forget, but sadly, and I think I'm right on this one, the next time I attempt to dine here, they'll have a wait list as long as those fine Manhattan eateries you can never get into.

PS:
The large pine tree in the rear yard was actually the family's Christmas tree circa 1943. I looked for carvings, but was informed the family consisted of four daughters so it's highly unlikely any of them had ever received an 'Old Timer' pocket knife from dad on their birthday or Christmas."}
{"text":"I was here for a baby shower so I can't speak for the regular menu, but can for the staff and the food we did have. What a great, cute set up they did for the party. We were on the back/side patio and they provided fresh squeezed OJ and champagne for mimosas. The staff were very attentive - to the point where they even came around and put a napkin down on the ground for the girls who had bigger purses. 

For the food, we started with a grilled cheese - but it was fancy! HUGE slices of truffle with gruyere melted in between thick garlicy slices of bread. Then we had a bruschetta that had pistachio pesto and local creamy ricotta cheese. We were also served two salads: one was a very basic salad with a light vinegarette, dates, fresh horseradish and butternut squash. The other was a kale salad with a creamier dressing and some cheeses mixed in (I am particular about how my kale is prepared so I didn't try this even though I should have!). We also had fillet and shrimp skewers which were good but they were really spicy and I am pretty sure it didn't say that on our menu so it was too spicy for some of the girls. To round it all out, we had crepes for dessert with a mint ricotta filling and fresh berries. The was more savory than sweet but it was still yummy.

We then had cake and opened presents and it was all around very sweet and well done by the girls who planned it. Judging by the food, you could tell this place was more up scale, but it would be fun to try it on a date night!"}
{"text":"I've been to the House twice now and I'm more and more impressed after each visit. For starters, the atmosphere is perfect. The setting is very personal and intimate inside and their patio is equally inviting. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to food and drink selections and very courteous and attentive. On our first visit our bartender Kevin welcomed us and after finding out it was our first visit he took the time to suggest several food selections and drinks. 

The food is some of the best I've sampled in the valley; every dish is off the beaten path and an unexpected joy to taste for the first time. Far to often new establishments play it safe and don't stray to far from the norm of southwestern cuisine but The House Brasserie's kitchen and chef do a remarkable job of introducing their patrons to a sampling of dishes that are both creative and amazing. My suggestion, try the Duck Confit Bahn Mi!

If you're looking for an excellent meal that outside the norm you've got to stop by The House Brasserie."}
{"text":"I do not generally yelp because I feel that you should always experience it for yourself instead of read about it. However, this is an exception to the rule because this place is just that great!! 
Yes they are associated with The Mission and Zinc Bistro and those places are great but the house is different. This place could be anywhere L.A., New York, London, San Francisco, and you'de still feel at home. The ambience is romantic, cozy, and chic yet not overdone. The food is amazing! The steak tartare  with house cut fries that dish alone is worth going for but then there's the beef tongue wrapped in a house made scallion crepe... if it hadn't said tongue on the menu I would have never know, it's that delicious! Matt Carter takes risks with food but in a non-confrontational way, which is so refreshing!
The guys at the bar...these guys are mixologists! The house \"remedies\" are top notch. I am usually not a huge fan of gin but the Green lantern is my new favorite drink in Scottsdale! Gin and chartruese with a touch of serrano chile... sounds crazy, tastes crazy good! 
This place is small and for being so new it is busy!! You may not be able to sit right away but there is always a cute hostess at the front with a smile and a glass of champagne while you wait. 
Once seated we were greeted almost immediately by our server who was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She offered some great suggestions, beef tongue being one of them, and though reluctant at first to try it, we loved it!! We also had the scallops and bone in ribeye which were amazing! At the end she also suggested the house made cinnamon whiskey which was ridiculously good, fireball's got nothin' on this stuff!
We will definetely be returning to this unique little spot! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a romantic evening out.  We went here for Valentine's Day and were very happy with the food/wine we ordered. The only thing that was disappointing is that they were out of our first wine choice, but everything else was really good. I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went there with my roommate a few weeks ago and we loved it. Food and cocktails were fabulous! Definitely recommend the crab fried rice and the lobster gnocchi!"}
{"text":"Delish! Went for valentines. Loved the atmosphere, great date night spot. The service was great but the food was even better. My boyfriend got the filet he said it's better than what he has gotten at Mastros and Ruths Chris. Also the Mac and cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that makes you love food and drink!  Garret and Nicholas, behind the bar, are knowledgeable and creative mixologists and our waitress was top of the line.  The food is fantastic; the chef runs an unmatchable kitchen, and the entire experience is fun!   An added bonus is the history and story behind the pine tree!   Visit soon and often."}
{"text":"This was our second visit....it might be our last.   Our first experience was excellent and we planned on taking our family here for Christmas after raving about it.  

The second visit was mediocre.   Service was spotty -- possibly because we were having an early dinner?   Timing for our food was problematic and the overall meals were under seasoned and just not anything special.   

What is so frustrating is that our first experience was so good and now...I don't know what.  It certainly didn't feel like it was worth the $400 for the 5 of us."}
{"text":"Now having tried all 3 restaurants owned by Broken Plate Concepts, The Mission, Zinc Bistro, and then finally The House Brasserie. The House Brasserie loses. Maybe it was an off night, but with those prices you shouldn't have an off night. Dinner for 2 at 6:15 on a Saturday night on one of the coldest windiest nights in Arizona, we were seated next to the patio door that was being used regularly with huge gust of cold air blowing on us, not to mention the table next to us. The restaurant accommodated us and moved us quickly. Luckily it was not full, because we would of left if there was no other table. Our server Katie was excellent. She first announced all the item menus that were not on the menu that evening, The Baked Robiola, The Clam Chowder and the Main Lobster Bisque. Really?, On a Saturday night at 6:15 you run out of all those items, which I personally was looking forward to trying the Lobster Bisque, bad kitchen planning and management.

We ordered cocktails, a Cosmo and The Smoked Manhattan, both excellent. Appetizers were Virginia Ham (corn bread, jalapeno peanuts, bourbon, maple) and the Cold Creekstone Steak Tartare (roasted pepper, romesco, frites). The Steak Tartare was very good. The Ham was very OK, too little meat, too much Corn Bread. For Entrees we ordered The Veal Chop (bernaise, charred cucumber), The Spice Cured Duck Leg Confit (smoked pasilla cherry glaze, cornbread \"stuffing,\" foie gras, caper, brussels sprouts, pearl onion) and Spicy Broccoli Raab (san marzano tomato, calabrian chili, black garlic). All 3 dishes were missing the target. The Veal, though beautiful looking and perfectly done was tough and should melt in your mouth for $50. The Duck, the flavor was there but again the duck was tough, not tender as a confit should be, and the brick of cornbread served no purpose. The Broccoli Raab tasted OK, though not spicy at all and was soaking in the sauce. Again an off night. I don't know what's amiss after dropping $200+ on a meal for 2.

Atmosphere and decor we loved, service excellent, food missed the mark."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an overly pretentious  dining experience, then this is the restaurant for you.  Now mind you, the food is ok, but only ok.  Overpriced fare and small portion sizes are their soup du jour.  Decently flavored, but not worth the money or the wait.  Unless you are trying to impress a date by spending a few hundred dollars for a couple rounds of drinks and some mediocre food that comes complete with an absentee server, then you could do much better elsewhere.  The Valley has so many wonderful restaurants that I won't be surprised when this one closes, nor will I be disappointed."}
{"text":"Such  a cute quaint little restaurant. I love the history of \"the house\" too. Way more seating and space than I thought there would be. Service was fantastic and food was very good."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. We had a reservation for 7 girls and were seated immediately on the patio upon arrival. The service was great and the atmosphere is very cozy. I got the lamb bolognese with a side of brussel sprouts and I couldn't believe how good it was! Great portion sizes and the flavor was amazing. I would definitely return to this restaurant the next time I visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Always a stress eliminator going to The House.  I've been to The House a couple times now, for dinner and brunch.  It's now my favorite restaurant in Old Town.  One just feels taken care of there.  The ambiance is comfortable and classicly elegant, every one of the staff act like they just genuinely want you to enjoy your time there.  The menu isn't intimidating but is still elegant and fun at the same time, and the food and wine are all excellent.  

We still haven't tried the patio, but I'm looking forward to that as soon as the weather allows.

It is fairly expensive for dinner, but their brunch is a great value.  Brunch entrees are roughly $15 a plate, they have $15 bottomless mimosas and HALF OFF all bottles of wine."}
{"text":"Yet ANOTHER amazing evening at House Brasserie. We've been here for our anniversary, my birthday, and now Christmas Eve. The food is creative and always delicious. The service is superb, and the ambience is romantic and most comfortable. Needless to say, we'll be celebrating many more events here."}
{"text":"Very romantic, great patio, great food. The Whiskey River cocktail is amazing - I can't stop thinking about it."}
{"text":"Some of the most friendly and knowledgable service I've had in a while! The food was all delicious. Rich and on the salty side but interesting and unique!"}
{"text":"Just had to add this. We came back for Valentine's Day and had another fabulous experience - from the amazing food to the incredible staff!  Worth every penny!  Our waiter, Tommy, was awesome.  Other restaurants should learn how to train their staff by observing this place.  Hands down, our favorite place in Scottsdsle."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite restaurant...it's made the top 10 list. The past two Fridays, I've been here for dinner and everything is amazing. The second you walk up, you can just tell this is going to be a great dinner spot. The patio is just about the cutest thing ever - it's like you're transported outside of the Valley into this magical little courtyard with twinkle lights everywhere (what girl doesn't love twinkle lights?)

The only cocktail I've had there is the Watermelon Cooler (I'll add the pic). It's a refreshing gin cocktail equipped with fresh watermelon juice and effen cumcumber vodka - everything I love in a cup. The food is amazing. Both times I went, my girlfriends and I shared everything. Some of the highlights are the Burrata with leeks, the berkshire pork belly with udon noodles, and the Duck Confit meatballs. We also tried the lobster fried rice, crab legs, Pork Ribs, and Halibut. Everything is good but my favorite is the pork belly with udon noodles. It's just so GD good. 

They've only been open about a month so they warn you that they're working out the kinks in service and what not. It doesn't matter. They could make me wait a year and I'd still sit there and sipon my cocktail among good friends to wait for their amazing food. 

Hats off to you House Brasserie. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The House is Old Town's best hidden gem. It hosts the most warm and inviting atmosphere in town. Upon entry everyone is warmly greeted with a friendly smile, as if being invited over to a friend or family member's home. Soft and romantic lighting fill the inside and bar with a cozy glow as the candles flicker playfully in numerous mirrors decorating the walls. inside seating is very intimate and perfect for date nights. The outdoor patio is beautifully lit by tiny lights high in the surrounding trees and shrubbery giving it a very whimsical feel. The patio is an ideal setting for any size group but it's picturesque for a girl's night outing. 

Get ready to be whisked away as you dine on a very worldly menu. Chef Carter has masterfully incorporated a little piece of each of his other restaurants into the menu at The House, but still remains uniquely original. Everything is sinfully delicious and it makes you want to try a little bit of everything. Start out with some shared plates like the smoked Burrata, and the Brisket in a biscuit. Grilled crab legs come out with the perfect texture with a tiny hint of smoke from the grill. Indulge with the Lamb Bolognese or the Creekstone Filet. Your tummy will thank you. 

The House also has an excellent cocktail menu to perfectly pair unique, spirits with homemade syrups to provide delicious accompaniments to any entree.  The staff is very knowledgable and take great pride in providing their guests with a unforgettable dining experience. So whether you are on a hot date with your hubby or just want a playful night out with the girls, The House is the perfect spot to meet all your dining and drinking needs."}
{"text":"Not too bad!!  Expected better for the price tag.  Disappointed w/  dungeness fried rice.  Too wet!!  Ribeye steak spiced well.  The ambience is great!!"}
{"text":"I just wasn't feeling it here.  Maybe I've been spoiled by all of the great restaurants in New Orleans lately.  I'm not sure, but The House Brasserie was a disappointment.  It wasn't bad.  It was better than average.  It just didn't meet the expectation build up.

- The service was good, although if the female server touched me one more time, my wife (on Valentine's Day no less) was going to throw down.

- The space was amazing.  Very cool.  Urban gothic.

- Waiting in the parking lot kind of sucked.

- The charcuterie was a la carte, which bummed me out.  I wanted a traditional charcuterie board with the chef selecting what and how much we receive based on our party size.  The salumi was ok.  The smoked burrata was bad (and I love burrata).  The goat cheese was amazing.

- The chef's prepared seared foie gras was good, but the preparation didn't bring out the best in it.  I'm not sure large slices of corn go with fatty duck liver.

- For my main, I got the veal chop.  Medium rare.  It was overcooked at well.  Not a shred of pink or tenderness.  The crust that wasn't burnt was good, but seriously, dry veal is terrible.

- My wife had the short ribs and mashed potatoes.  It was excellent.  Tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"I made reservations for this place a week before, and we sat outside with a party of 6. Now the food was good, I enjoyed everything however the outside area is so cute and nice but you can't see a thing! I had to ask the server for extra candles. 

You know how people say you eat with your eyes first, well I would of enjoyed the entire experience if there were more lights! I mean at least so we can see our food.

Watermelon cocktail was good, I also enjoyed the brisket biscuit small plate. The broccoli soup was good, I prefer more cream based but it was still good. The rest of the party enjoyed their meals!"}
{"text":"Always great service and delicious food! The bartenders here are TRUE mixologists!

Heather and Tommy are both incredible servers, knowledgable of the cocktail, wine and food menus. They will never hesitate to acquiesce any request, and they are sincerely two of the funniest servers that I have ever met. I enjoy every time I come to The House and they take care of me!

FYI- Steak tartare, foie gras, and scallops are incredible."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was perfect. Started out with the chicken thighs with crispy skin, just that dish would have been great for dinner. Pork chop was amazing, next time I am not sharing. Mac and cheese was superb, can't wait for more. Finally, the deserts were phenomenal, I wish all donuts and vanilla cake were that good. Luckily for me the wife was willing to share her desert. I will be back, and looking forward too brunch."}
{"text":"Unimpressive meal in an impressive setting.

Narrowed down our \"special occasion\" dining choice to Cafe Monarch and House Brasserie, with House Brasserie winning the coin toss.

Found the patio area to be very pleasant due in no small part to a perfect evening weather-wise without any need for the outdoor heaters.

Service was uniformly friendly and professional throughout the meal. Cocktails were expertly prepared.

Unfortunately, the most important element in our dining experience, the food, was disappointing.

Presentation was lackluster and in some cases the dishes tasted odd or were spoiled by distracting ingredients or were served luke-warm.

In the case of the smoked burrata appetizer, a lump of cow's milk cheese was placed alongside some toasted French bread slices, presentation one would expect at a much lower-end dining establishment. 

Why not place individual slices of cheese on their own crostini and garnish? The dish struck us as being very lazy.

The Tomahawk Pork Chop was smothered in some type of hard seeds. Imagine trying to enjoy one's meal, while removing tiny ball-bearings from between your teeth. It completely ruined the enjoyment of the dish.

The Lamb Bolognese had a decidely sour taste, so overpowering that it was left half-eaten by the two individuals who had ordered it as their entrees.

Finally, considering the cost, as well as the formal tone of House Brasserie's website, we were surprised at the number of families with toddlers as well as patrons who were comfortable dining in pajama bottoms and baseball caps.  

It was bad enough that we had suggested this restaurant to our friends. It would've been even more uncomfortable had this been one of our formal client dinners."}
{"text":"Absolutely the number 1 restaurant in Scottsdale for variety, flavor, service and ambiance!  We had the duck meatballs for appetizer, I had Scallops and my date ordered the Lamb.  All prepared with wonderful flavor!  Dessert we had the pineapple/caramel/pasticcio upside cake~~amazing! Their coffee is prepared table side in an aerated glass flask, fresh ground.  A real treat to experience.   We sat outside by the big fire place under the HUGE Pine tree, music was low an easy listening.  Our server, Ann, was a delight!  EVERY employee conducted themselves in a happy, professional manner & all sharped dressed in black.  Congratulations to Brian, owner, for another 1st class restaurant!"}
{"text":"Having been warned about what to expect in Old Town Scottsdale, was completely taken aback to find The House, more Southern Charm and less Jersey Shore for sure! 

Plumpjack wine and fine whiskeys? But of course. Daily foie gras specials? NBD. Velvet wallpaper and candles everywhere? Duh.

Having visited SUR and PUMP recently in LA (both Vanderpump establishments), they should pay The House a visit for some tips on decorating and customer service. The House is more than a facade, they actually care about the customers - every customer, not just the \"famous\" ones. 

On Monday evening, the foie special was a gluttonous dessert dish of Brioche French toast, maple brown sugar butter and a generous piece of fatty duck liver on top. Each bite melted in my mouth. Very well executed.

The ambiance, the wine, the food make this brasserie tops on my list in Scottsdale. Upscale, but not pretentious. 5-stars."}
{"text":"Worst decision ever to change the brunch menu! Absolutely disappointing! No pork belly, no fried rice, and meat balls. Giant thumbs down on the menu change! The server is still uhh-mazing! Awesome vibe and awesome service!"}
{"text":"I came here for a nice date night with my man. This place definitely lived up to the Yelp expectations. I am truly happy Yelp tool me to this gem. Now onto reviewing.

The concept of the restaurant is what kind of food you would get if you went to the Chef's house. This restaurant is 1 of 3 sister restaurants in the Valley. (The Mission and Zinc Bistro are the other two if that gives a good baseline for expectations)

The ambiance is very homey and classic. The inside has baroque wallpaper and chandwliera, and there ia an amazing patio, bigger than the inside dining area. This restaurant keeps the classic feel aince it is the second oldest house in the old town area. 

Now onto food.... 
I got the Lamb. It is a pasta with shredded lamb and a juicey sauce and spinach.  It was great mught have ruined all other pasta for me.
My bf got the rib eye. Medium rare and cooked to perfection. The whipped garlic was amazing and the best of the three sauces that it came with. 
On the side it brings some whipped pommes (fancy mashed potatoes for us common folk) they were great but if you are sharing.. I definitely recommend taking the pasta juice and adding it to the potatoes. Yum.

For dessert we got the Chocolate boudino which is a modern take on a smore. The cookies werent spectacular but the chocolate it self with nuts was great. 

Drinks get the express yourself. It has a nice kaluha kick. 
All in all.. thoroughly impressed. And had a great night."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and crafted cocktails! The snapper and skirt steak were impeccable!!!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with friendly staff. We had drinks and tasty apps but thought it was a pricey experience."}
{"text":"Went with the family (party of 8) for NYE dinner.   For appetizers we had the burrata, crispy chicken thigh, lobster gnocchi and foie gras.  The gnocchi was the standout dish.  Also had the tomato bisque (relatively spicy but we were not warned and one of the people who ordered could not eat it) followed by grouper, tomahawk pork chop, NY steak, scallops and lamb bolognese with roasted cauliflower, dungenes crab fried rice.  Had one of each dessert.  
Of the dishes I tasted the fried rice was my favorite. Chop was fair but we've had much better.   The other dishes were not bad but nothing stood out.
The big disappointment was the service.  Seemed like one of the servers was in training and the timing of various dishes was off (in particular, 1 of the soups we ordered arrived before the appetizers and the other one after).  Many other little faux pas that one would (should) not expect from a restaurant of this claimed caliber.  Our bill was $600 before tip so I expected something a little better than what we received.  
Am giving 3 stars because the meal wasn't a disaster and I don't know if I can do 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was the absolute nuts. 

Amazing food, several attentive waiters for our table of 15 (which is a big deal because I usually feel like big parties are underserved), well priced wine. 

Potato appetizer was the highlight followed by the pork dish.  

Great place.  Highly recommend it when you want to spend a little something extra for a little something extra."}
{"text":"if this is the place i recall.. the sangria was way over priced for what it was.   wayyyyyyyy to much ice in it. and the waitress and waiter kept bringing more cups of ice to us.   then one tried to pour some in a cup of ice they brought us and i said ummm no thank you its watered down enough.. then they looked at me like i was crazy and questioned me again why i didnt want it poured in the ice.   was not worth the price whatsoever.  plus there was broken pieces of glass on our table that we kept showing the waitress."}
{"text":"Full review in the blog.  This place has potential, but thus far that potential is not fully realized.

seven plates, four desserts...and a $1 'bread supplement'

\"Shrimp and Grits,\" a savory and intense composition of sweet and snappy head-on shrimp atop creamy popcorn grits enlivened by charred onions and smoky pork glaze with a touch on honey.  Sweet and savory but perhaps a bit steep at $14 this was a dish where the ingredients and the execution came together beautifully.

\"Arizona Ricotta, Sicilian Pistachio Toast, Roasted Radish\" at $8 arrived as a trio with only a single flaw - a dearth of salt to liven up the otherwise beautifully cooked radish.  A bit of a disappointment even despite the high quality of the tender taproot the dish certainly improved in moving on to the bread crisps as the ricotta was ever so slightly melted while the bread itself was herbal and crunchy but at the same time subtle.  With a bit more salt this one could be great.

For Duck Confit Meatballs, Foie Gras, White Bean, Tomato Agrodolce it would be hard to say exactly how/why such decadent ingredients did not live up to my expectations, particularly as the meatballs were tender and rife with flavor, but if I had to pin it on one thing I think it would be the expectations arising with the word \"Foie Gras\" and the $14 price tag as the sapor of the foie was largely lost to the tomatoes while the puree of white bean was okay, but mostly just filler.

Berkshire Pork Belly, Kimchee, Udon Noodle, Fried Egg arrived with some joking at the table about the ubiquity of pork belly these days and as much as I cannot argue that said ingredient is delicious I just didn't find it well utilized here as the fattiness of the swine simply overwhelmed any semblance of kimchee while the noodles were soggy and limp.  Decent flavors though garnished by a rather inconsequential egg I had a few bites and that was enough.

\"Maine Lobster Fried Rice, Mullet Egg, Aji Amarillo\" was actually a rather nice plate of risotto with a lot of umami and a touch of heat but \"fried rice\" it most certainly was not.  Nice enough, but certainly not a sharable plate, one of my tablemates summed it up perfectly when he commented that all this dish really did was make him want to go elsewhere and get a dish of \"kick ass\" fried rice - something he could have done at 1/3 the tab and had enough for lunch the next day.

Moving last to a pair of sides, each $6 and far more generous than the rice, Grilled and Buttered Shiitake Mushrooms, Truffle Honey along with Grilled Broccoli Carbonara, Pancetta, Egg, Black Pepper arrived and where the first showed strongly in its simplicity the second fell flat once again due to a lack of salt - a lack so pronounced that frozen broccoli straight from the bag has more flavor thus making me wonder exactly what sort of pancetta was even present.

Buttermilk Blackberry Crumb Cake arrived as a dense butter cake with a downhome toothsomeness that I really enjoyed, but with ample notes of buttermilk dominating the sweetness of the berries I think this one could have benefitted from one of two things - a dollop of ice cream or a cup of coffee.  I'd definitely order this as a breakfast item anywhere.

Caramel Apple Upside Down Cake, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio Ice Cream.  A long and linear presentation with the apple flavor a bit overwhelmed by the salty caramel but still potent and tart what truly made this plate shine was the ice cream - creamy, rich, and rife with nutty flavor...had we been dining earlier I'd have probably driven over to Sweet Republic for another round.

Under other circumstances Sacher Torte would have been the highlight of the meal and served with \"Toasted Almond Amaretto Mascarpone Mousse\" this one was a fine example.  Dense, intensely cocoa, and appropriately dry without suffering the Americanization of making it too birthday-cake in texture this was another dessert that would have gone great with coffee but the use of the mousse and bold apricot flavor kept everything balanced and bright.  It was awesome.

If there is one thing The House should keep doing from this point until the day they close their doors it should be keeping the Butterscotch Pudding on the menu.  A fan of all puddings - from rice to bread to budino - and having had a number of similar presentations elsewhere this version was simply outstanding - sweet and salty, dense and creamy, and bespeckled with chocolate and fruit adding both texture and flavor.  It goes on the short list for Phoenix's best desserts and will likely remain there for some time.

Overall, The House is off to a decent start but still has a lot of room for growth in every department except perhaps dessert and d√©cor.  A lovely setting already with great service I think the focus should start with improved seasoning and working to nail the basics before experimenting with 'fusion' and once the kitchen is hitting on all cylinders perhaps improving the portion/price ratio."}
{"text":"House Brasserie, you're such a flirt. You weren't even modest about it, you flaunted that sensuality before I reached for the door, tarted up in your tinkling necklace of lights and gown of vine. I have to admit, I was smitten. For a dame of such established pedigree (I hear you're the second eldest home in all of Scottsdale), you're Rita Hayworth, Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly wrapped in kale and orecchiette: divine.

You titillated me with your silken, endlessly long crab legs, lime buttered above the heel. I wanted to peel and eat your spicy shrimp, but that would've been a little too adventurous for a first date, so I... chowed down. Immediately I cooled my fiery palate with your amazing kale salad, something we both agreed was both delectable and smart from a dietary perspective. But oh, how our sensibilities were fast to wane as you prepared cocktail after fabulous cocktail...

Your Chateau Briand, oh my! Delectable. Lobster Friend Rice: it's an Asian fusion love affair! Broccoli Carbonarra: you have me at your doorstep. Marinated Jidori Chicken: I'm swimming in your silk sheets. So get it over with already, Brasserie. Take me.

You did. I feel like such a floozy. Your crumb cake and sacher torte made me your slave. I'm done. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I feel used.

And I WANT MORE.

Don't get me started on your wallpaper..."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me for my Birthday and took me here. We sat at a special table right in front of the fireplace, It was very romantic! The service was impeccable, we were treated very well. Not only was our waitress amazing, so was the rest of the staff. 

The Food was even more amazing. I had the scallops with grits, and my husband had the 20oz Ribeye with horseradish mash potatoes. For our sides we had the fried rice, cauliflower, and the macaroni and cheese (each had a delicious unique flavor). For dessert we shared the donuts, they had a perfect crispy outside with a delicious fluffy inside. The sauces that accompanied the donuts were a perfect match. I highly suggest this restaurant for a date night or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"All around excellent dining experience made for a perfect date night!
From the friendly valet across the street to the attentive waitstaff and the friendly host, all were just terrific.
The food was excellent. The chef masterfully combined an eclectic array of ingredients to create flavor masterpieces. I personally loved that the chef was daring to push the spice limit... I enjoyed my Creekstone filet. finally something with flavor and heat. Not another safe, bland and boring steak dish!
Awesome job!"}
{"text":"The most amazing restaurant! The food and the ambiance is impeccable. The restaurant is stunningly beautiful. The farrow salad was so good.  My fianc√© raved about the brisket on a brisket he said the creamy cheese on top is heavenly.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing!!!!!

If you are the type of person that only reads the 5 star reviews then you get what you deserve. Like we did on this one. Should have went more with the Google reviews which had it closer to 3 stars.

Not sure what they are thinking here with all these flavors and weird dishes but they don't work!

Add chopped onions to the Mac and cheese? Why?

Huge pieces of Lemon Peel on top of the Short Rib? Why??

Deconstructed Lobster Bisque? Weird and no one seemed to be a fan.

At the end of the day you just have to ask yourself if you'd order any of the things you've ordered, again. The answer was a resounding NO.

Even the mixed drinks were weird.

Not to mention the prices. Just retarded"}
{"text":"Delightful food in a magical setting.  I suggest going at night when the lights and candles are flickering.  Eat outside.  The food is fantastic.  The only thing we did not like was the shiitake mushrooms.  They were \"too\" smokey.  Worth the money."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the most consistent yet unique, romantic dining spots in Greater Phoenix. Many visits, never disappointed, and more than once service WAY beyond expectations .  Literally an impromptu tasting when it was an otherwise slow summer night, and another night the pressed clean shirt straight from the GM, when I blew it with my red wine covering my white shirt, was beyond belief. My fault and yet they somehow still made it an amazing experience without embarrassing me one iota. That's class. That's service. And it's innovative 5-star food on top of that!"}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant during Restauant Week and we're not given a menu for their Rest. Week options. When we asked our waiter, he said they were out of many items and he could pare items from the regular menu much better. He tried to push an expensive bottle of wine and when we requested another option, they were out of it or he wasn't happy with our choice because it was $30 less than the bottle he choose. My husband asked for fries with his dinner, which we were told they were out of- seriously how are you out of fries at 6:30 on a Saturday? So my husband choose another option - fingerling potatoes. We were almost finished with our meal, which was average, and guess what was delivered to the table next to ours, fries. When we asked our waiter if they suddenly got an order of fries, he had no response. Another waiter came over and explained that the only way you could get fries was with the steak tartare and that 'he wished he could control the kitchen'. We were so irritated that we left, leaving a 1/4 bottle of wine and went to another restaurant for a drink. They need to train their staff and order more supplies if this restaurant wants to stay in business. There are too many good restaurants in Scottsdale to deal with that."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing brunch on Mothers Day.  The lady who wrote a book about her experience has way too much time on her hands.  The wait staff was excellent. The scrambled eggs with prosciutto and blue berry banana French toast was to die for. Unlimited mimosa and the beautiful bottle of chianti as a gift was a plus.  The goat cheese cake put us over the top. Can't wait to return. It's my new favorite neighborhood restaurant - and we have a lot of them in Old Town. The ambiance was just as fun as the food. See you back soon."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and laid back. The cocktails are pretty good. The food was just ok. I am not familiar with Matt Carter, but from what I've heard I was expecting a little more. The Smoked Burrata was under salted. The Pork Belly and Udon noodles were confusing, I couldn't tell what that dish was supposed to be. The pork belly was tender and delicious on its own but with the noodles, it was a strange and unapproachable dish with too many conflicting flavors. The Farro salad had a lot of grapefruit flavor. We liked the pistachio ice cream, however the butterscotch pudding tasted like it was made from a box of instant pudding. 

It was strange being able to stare at the busser station the whole time. It was slightly messy and unkempt. 

When we first sat down the music they had playing was techno. It felt out of place. However by the time we had our dessert there was light jazz playing. 

Overall, I wasn't blown away by anything. 

I'm excited to see what Chef Carter is capable of in the future. As for now, I'm still a little lost trying to interpret his cuisine at The House."}
{"text":"The hubby and I decided to try this place for date night.  We are relatively new to town and hit a home run with this restaurant.  When making a reservation online I requested a booth and mentioned that I was pregnant.  We were seated as requested and our server bent over backwards to make sure he was aware of any and all food restrictions I had.  The food was all delicious.  We had the st. Andre cheese (my favorite) and the brisket and biscuits as well as the rib eye.  My hubby indulged in a glass of red and just for fun we split the chocolate dessert.  It was a deconstructed s'more and was melt in your mouth yummy.  The service was spectacular, we were checked on often and never wanted for anything.  The food was worth the price and the ambience was wonderful.  Overall a fantastic date night and we can't wait to return (and try the executive chefs other restaurants)."}
{"text":"I love trying new restaurants, and was so happy that my husband chose this gem to celebrate my birthday last evening. We were greeted immediately and sat in a beautiful corner booth. The ambiance is romantic, and I can't wait for the weather to cool off so I can sit outside next time.  The place is upscale, but you can dress in jeans and some heals and still fit in fine. I have no other words except sensational! If food sex is a thing, then House Brasserie is my new boyfriend. My server made me feel special and immediately offered me champaign for my birthday when he asked what we were celebrating. I opted for a martini, as it was a long day! My ONLY feedback is to get some martini glasses, as they served it in a margarita glass. But the drink was just the right amount of dirty!  We started with 2 small plates: Smoked Burrata and Frois Gras....If the meal ended there I would have still been happy. For the main we ordered the Jidori Chicken and the Filet, and shared. As sides we got fries and the lobster rice. You could cut the fillet with a fork, seriously my husband did it without using his knife.  But the chicken stole the show. It had an incredible flavor that couldn't be topped. The flavors of every dish we tried burst in our mouths. I could not have had a better meal at any other restaurant. I was actually mad at my husband for making me wait till 8:30 for dinner because we couldn't get a reservation earlier, but if I had to go back at 3 am to taste this wonderful food again, I would do it!  I closed the evening with a great glass of Rose' and a complimentary Creme Brule' which happens to be my favorite dessert. The simple details like the sliced strawberries on my desert were the freshest I have ever tasted. Find a way to dine here, you will not regret it! Thank you House Brasserie for a wonderful evening! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place magically combines French charm with comfort. Their dining room is dripping in French d√©cor, but, the air of casualness is hard to miss. Love that they fuss over the food rather than you. 

The small plates were delectable. The duck confit meat balls (who would have thought, right?) set the bar high, and, everything that followed matched up to it; especially, the luscious crab fondue. 

Service, while attentive, was non intrusive. No mundane \"how's everything?\" while drifting across the room to the next table. The questions were genuine, and, they patiently heard us out and added to what we had to say without hijacking too much of our time.

The party poopers were the desserts and the $100 bill for two. I know. I know. Good food is always worth the money, but, I am not sure I will (can?) go back often with the hefty price tag. However, I will go back as often as I can afford to!"}
{"text":"I hosted a bridal shower brunch for my friend here and it was a wonderful experience.  The staff made the entire event incredibly easy to plan and they went out of their way to make it a special day for my friend.  Everyone loved the food and the atmosphere and the prices were very reasonable for what you got.  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"3.5 to be fair !!!

Okay this place is hands down super trendy and romantic and just adorable inside ( I love all the mirrors). We had two mishaps without food being undercooked...they fixed both without giving us any grief and were very nice about the whole situation. Our service was great overall and they definitely made up for the food situation. 

We tried quite a few things- the kale salad is flippen fantastic. I'm not a huge meat eater so i was happy with the kale salad and brie potatoes we got also. My dear bf is the meat lover out of us and he was disappointed a little with the pork he got but said he would like to go back and try again so it was not alllll the bad.

The desserts were sinful and delicious and paired well with some shots of peppermint schnapps :)

I want my star rating to go up so we will give it another go around in the near future...there is definite potential to be found at The House Brasserie."}
{"text":"This was my second time there for a drink.  Haven't eaten there yet. The place is an old residence, hence the name \"The House.\" It is very cozy and homy and has a very inviting bar.  The bartenders have been very friendly and service minded.  My fianc√©e  asked for a shot of Tequila and one of the bartenders (female, who also turned out to be the manager) recommended a brand she swore by.  Little did we know that a shot was $15.00, however after we complained she comped the shot and apologized for the situation."}
{"text":"We were excited to come here.   Friends did say it was fantastic.   Our experience was different.   Food was average at best.  Wife got the grouper and didn't care for it.  I got the lobster gnocchi and it was a bit salty. I also ordered the tomahawk porkchop.  It was burnt to a char on the outside.  Smoked Manhattan was average.  I've had better drinks at other places.  The dessert menu was uninspiring.  We ended up going to hillstone for their sundae.  Service was average.  Our meal was $150, and at that price point there are a lot of better options such as any Hillstone restaurant, Virtu, Monarch Cafe, Elements and Olive & Ivy to name a few.  I wanted to like this place.  If you're debating on a place to go, House Brasserie would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Old fashioned and manhattan were both delicious and boozy.  Sat at the bar. Ambience both inside and outside were fantastic.  Trees around you and lots of hanging lights.  Inside reminded me of back east 1950s; very elegant and classic.  Service was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Yummy! Loved the bartender. Loved the food (chef trained at French Laundry). Great ambiance. If your looking for history this is your spot house built in '37."}
{"text":"I was in town for Spring Training with my boyfriend so we are unfamiliar with the area and going off of pure Yelp reviews without some friend recommendations made us nervous. We finally zoned in on The House Brasserie because of its variety of food beyond just steak like many other nice restaurants in the area.

The food did not disappoint and prices/portions were totally reasonable. I'm from the SF Bay Area where there is no good shortage of food but I would say THB is on par with all the nice restaurants in SF.

We started off with cocktails - Green Lantern for me (gin, lime, honey dew, and other flavors) and a Roiboos whiskey drink for the bf. Both were great, I think the green lantern is one of my favorite gin cocktails I've tried thus far. 

Apps- Thick-cut bacon and Foie Gras. FG was paired as a charcuterie plate with almonds, mustard, pickles, daikon radishes, and some other pairings and seared to perfection and nicely seasoned. Thick-cut bacon was tasty but had the texture of pork belly instead of bacon.

Main Dishes- Ribeye for the bf and Duck Bolognese for me. Both were awesome dishes and we agreed they were 5-star worthy. Neither dish was overcooked or over-seasoned. We also ordered mushrooms and basil+brie fingerling potatoes as sides. 

Dessert- Because I let them know it was my boyfriend's birthday, they took care of dessert and brought out a deconstructed vanilla bean goat cheese cheesecake with reduced strawberries, coconut crust crumble, mint, honey lavender. I don't usually like cheesecake but I have to say this is the best cheesecake and one of the best desserts I've ever had. They also brought out two glasses of complimentary champagne which was a nice touch.

Overall- Service was above and beyond my expectations and the food was delicious. Total bill was just under $150 before tax, and that's including 2 cocktails and a generous amount of food! There is outdoor and indoor seating available, but choose outdoor seating if you want a quieter romantic setting. They have heat lamps and extra blankets in case it's cold out.

Thank you House Brasserie for making my boyfriend's birthday dinner experience and our sole fine-dining experience in Scottsdale a memorable one!"}
{"text":"Already loved this place before tonight but after trying their smoked Manhattan cocktail - I'm putting it on my list of \"Safe spots to send your friends to and not worry about looking like a jackass\"..  As soon as my group walked into the bar we were greeted by the bartender (Kenny I think is his name). He made our Manhattan's to perfection and treated my douchebag friends with undeserving respect.  The food menu is also amazing, I have had it several times and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, the patio is even better. Anniversary brunch by the fire and even allowed us to bring our large dog."}
{"text":"Charming place, extensive wine list including wines offered by the bottle can also be requested by the glass ( so many good choices !!). I enjoyed the red snapper for dinner and roasted cauliflower. The service was excellent. All staff including the manager were attentive, friendly and social. The restaurant appeared to be short staffed so there were a few minor glitches but overall a delicious and extremely enjoyable dining experience. I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"I came here once when they first opened up and liked it. The hubby and I decided to come here for a romantic date night and we where happy we did. Everything we ordered was fantastic, delicious, and fresh.
We first had the lobster gnocchi...WOW!! Big, chunky fresh pieces of lobster mixed in with their home made gnocchi. 
Second, we had the foie gras. This is the best Foie Gras I have tasted so far. The serving was only 1oz, but worth every succulent bite. I was not a fan of the sauce they added on the side. I like the Foie Gras flavors to shine through.
Lastly, we ordered the Filet with Brabb. Yumm Yumm Yumm!!
I cannot wait to come back and try more of their delicious plates on the menu.

Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner.  It was exceptional.  Remember you are paying for exquisite dining, not big portions.  (if that is your intent go to Claim Jumper :( )

I've seen several comments on the service.  I would like to note something extraordinary happened.  We were introduced to our server who was going to be right back when another one of her tables broke a glass of wine and she had to attend to them.  Within a matter of minutes another server took over for her and we were not left waiting while the first waitress assisted the other patrons with resetting their table.  Personally I see a lot of merit and selflessness in this which is indicative of an establishment that focuses on the needs of the customer.  So whatever other negative comments there may be on service I'd like to counter that ours was a positive experience.  Thank you Ashley, you were a great server.

The dining experience and quality were as expected for a high end establishment so we were not let down and very satisfied.  We had the scallops, fillet, mac & cheese, Dungeness crab fried rice and (for fun) the crinkle cut fries.  Everything was great but the crab fried rice was mildly spicier than expected and we wished there was more of a crab taste and an indication of crab pieces.

The ambiance was wonderful both inside and outside.

The bar - THIS is what a bar should look like.  I want to go back just to sit and have a drink at the bar it was so classy.

Also, they are experimenting with fixed courses and wine pairing which are limited to a few number of people each night.  The table we saw that opted for this dinner looked like they were having lots of fun and the manager and chef came out and engaged with the table often.  I suggest you splurge for this at the extra cost and enjoy it yourself. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for my BF's birthday, and everything from the ambiance to the service to the food was nothing short of amazing. We had the smoked manhattans with the crispy chicken thighs (amazing also) and they are so good. The twist of the smoke with the cherry coke was delicious and unexpected. We loved them. We then switched to wine, which the waiter recommended a bottle and it was awesome (again!). My bf had the lamb and they were cooked so well, so tender and juicy. I had the Halibut, so good! the veggies on the plate and the mushrooms were so well done. We then ended with complimentary dessert which was unreal- Whipped Ricotta and Poppy seed with sweet berry compote. YUM! Just go here - everything is so well done, you can't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Flexible with reservation and the place was packed.  Good atmosphere and diverse crowd.   Menu is amazing with great options for \"small plates\"/appetizers.  Main courses were also like looking at multiple different nice restaurants. Incredible range that makes me want to go back tommorrow. Reasonably priced food for the quality that's served.   Attentive staff, including the hostess that had the most drinks in the entire place."}
{"text":"Ok, I am high maintenance and very picky!!!!! Saying that, This place passed the test!!!! Everything about it was over the top!!! It is pricy but so worth it!  If you are about the price this is NOT your place.  Love this place!!!! Top notch all the way!!!!"}
{"text":"Another impressive accomplishment from the team responsible for The Mission and Zinc Bistro.

In consistent form, House Brasserie is a unique and enjoyable dining experience.  The eclectic light fixtures and wallpaper establish a feel of elegance that is both comfortable and approachable.  The menu delivers creativity and variety with a number of small plates that are perfect for sharing. The cocktail list is fun balancing some familiar classics with a few innovative options as well.

The difference between good and great often lies in the details, and once again those are well attended to at House Brasserie.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Beautiful decorations, cozy mood lighting, and a comfortable layout make this a perfect place for a romantic evening

The waitstaff are friendly and knowledgeable. The shared plates are a must: amazing brussels sprouts, delectable cheeses, and incredible cauliflower.

The main plates were delicious as well, although vegetarians will need to look elsewhere since everything has meat or fish. Or perhaps just stick to more delicious shared plates, of which several are vegetarian.

The drinks were tasty, although all at our table questioned if there was much alcohol in them. They definitely seemed lacking in strength

Entree prices are high but you get great food. Handmade pastas, high quality meats, and wonderful decor.

Looking forward to coming back again sometime when I visit AZ again"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here and was not disappointed. Staff showed an immense amount service. Establishment has an exceptional atmosphere and is even better under the night sky. I ordered the lamb bolognese and a kale salad. Both dishes were very good and hopefully on some other special occasion I will return."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night as part of the BF and I's V day date exchange. This restaurant had some extreme highs and some middling points. 

The highs:

-House made cinnamon whiskey and the whiskey apple.....I don't even like whiskey and I love this!
-Our waiter, Tommy, was awesome, helpful, and honest
-Brisket biscuit..... tiny, but packed a lot of flavor, the meat was tender and the sauce was tangy...just delicious.
-Broccoli carbonara....not healthy in the least.... so delicious, creamy and cheesy sauce over perfectly cooked broccoli. 
-Apple caramel upside down cake - this cake is phenomenal.... the perfect amount of sweetness and the pairing of the pistachio ice cream is just wonderful. 
-Popcorn grits....extremely tasty, Definitely will get this as a side next time (got it with the pork this time). 


The Middling points: 

-We were seated right next to the door to the restaurant on the patio, which was ok....but it was a very high traffic area next to the waiting area/lounge thing and it was cold out and this particular table was not near a heater or a fire....not awesome. (and yes, we made reservations a week ahead of time)
- The pork entree was pretty mediocre....pork should be extremely delicious, but this pork was just lacking flavor. The portion size was big, but that doesn't matter if it's not something you really would like to eat. 
-The goodnight kiss drink was just alright....it had chantilly cream in it, which sounded amazing, but in reality made the drink just a bit too thick and heavy to be very enjoyable. 


Overall, the night was nice, the food was good, and I would definitely return, but next time I might stick with sides, apps, drinks, and desserts (with an emphasis on dessert...yum)."}
{"text":"Brunch started off well. The restaurant was incredibly cute with the feeling of walking into a cozy cottage decorated with flowers. Seemed like a great place for a bridal shower or girl's brunch. However, things quickly went downhill from there. 

This establishment is operated by the same owners as The Mission which we went to the night before and all thought it was fantastic. Therefore, I'd like to assume that our experience was a one-off disappointment, however, I don't think any of us will be back to Phoenix for a while (all east-coasters) to actually prove that. 

The restaurant was 90% empty when we arrived for our 1PM reservation. However, it still took them 15 minutes to bring us water and ask for our orders. We had to wait an additional 10 minutes for our drinks to appear. We had mentioned to them that we had a time constraint so please rush our food and drinks, however, it didn't seem that was taken into consideration. I would understand if the restaurant was crowded but it was majorly empty. When the food finally did come out, they forgot my meal and had to go back and search for it. 

We were given a full menu to look over and were not told that only the brunch menu (on the last page) would be served. There is NOTHING worse than getting a menu, picking something you think sounds delicious, having your mind set on it, and then being told it is not available. If they are only intending on serving their brunch menu, generally restaurants only hand out their brunch menu during brunch. At the VERY least, we could have been told to disregard the 5 other pages of menu options prior to being seated. 

The food was average and the pricing was also average for the area (but not for the service). We would have probably been a better eating experience if the service was at a higher level. We were all looking forward to a great Scottsdale brunch experience and left feeling very disappointed and, quite frankly, annoyed."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, been there twice and going again today.  The brunch   selections are perfect, service  is amazing and the decor is beautiful."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I decided to go out for girls night and check out this new spot for dinner. We had no idea what to expect as we had never seen the place before, but we knew it had to be good if it was anything like the mission. Well it was so much more than that! It was the cutest little place set in an old historic house with a charming candelight patio and the hugest tree I had ever seen sprawling over the place! 

We were greated and told a bit about the menu and drinks after we were sat outside in front of the lovely old fireplace. I chose the watermelon cooler and my friend went with a margarita of some kind. OMG those drinks were to die for!!! the watermelon cooler was so so good and I could have drank that all night! We then decided to share a few things for small plates. We ordered the brisket biscut which just melted in your mouth and was packed with flavor! We then had the crab dip which was absolutely delicious and creamy and the bread was toasted to perfection. Then our absolute favorite was the duck confit meatballs. These were thee best meatballs ever! Crispy on the outside soft on the inside and there was a serious explosion of flavors that I cannot even describe!

It was so good we went for brunch the next day and let me tell you that was amazing as well. Do yourself a favor and treat your palate at the House Brasserie!"}
{"text":"Was blown away by everything. The food was was incredible, service was excellent, the decor was very plush, and the atmosphere was energetic. Highly recommend for a date spot. Can not go wrong. Everything on the menu I and my girlfriend tried was really, really good. We eat out a lot where ever my job travels me too and this is a have to if you are in the Phoenix Area."}
{"text":"I recently had my wife's birthday party at The House.   We had 30 people dining with us.  The setting was beautiful.  I was worried the night might be a little chilly to dine outside as it was in the 40's, but the tents combined with heaters kept the temperature very comfortable.  We had the heaters running well below full blast as it was getting too warm. Sitting out on the patio with the fireplace going made the event feel even more festive.
How did it all go? First, the good:  Sonia, the events manager was very responsive and helpful.  She delivered exactly what was promised.  The food was very good.  I had skirt steak which was well seasoned and had delicious accoutrements.  My wife's swordfish was also excellent.  Cocktails were delicious and wine was fairly priced.  Next the better: the service.  It was just about perfect.  The servers were very friendly.  We were well attended with respect to drinks and orders and the food came out efficiently around the table.  I had a cake delivered earlier in the day which they kept and plated for a nominal fee.  The bad: I can't think of a thing.  The House really knocked it out of the park.  My wife had an amazing time.  I wouldn't hesitate to have an event there again in the future."}
{"text":"Perfect!  Great food, great ambiance, great drinks. My only complaint is that people seem to be catching on and it is getting busy."}
{"text":"A very nice find slightly off the beaten path in old town Scottsdale.  In a town overrun by big name steakhouses or wanna be trendsetters, this is an effective demonstration of vintage cuisine.  

Sure, I had the ribeye, but our party of 16 sampled most of what is on the menu.  The foie gras app is excellent (tough to mess that up, I know).  

Next time, I promise to order an entree that is more French!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had two different experiences. 

The first was five star. The waiter told us the history of the restaurant and the inspiration behind their food. He made great recommendations on food and wine pairings. The lobster gnocchi appetizer melts in your mouth, the gnocchi are like soft pillows and the sweet lobster balances perfectly with the truffle. 

The second visit was on New Years Eve. While I will visit this restaurant again I will never be back on New Years Eve. We did have a party of 8 which I know can be difficult. The full menu was offered which was nice but it made the evening very slow. We were often forgotten about, waiting for food with empty drinks. Appetizers came out staggered with one completely forgotten. We waited an hour for appetizers and our dinner order had yet to be taken. After ordering dinner it took 75 minutes to arrive. At 45 minutes our waitress said it was just getting plated, at 60 minutes she came back and said the EXACT same thing. I mentioned she had said that before and she admitted she knew it was taking a long time and apologized. A bottle of wine was comped but overall the service was unacceptable. 

The food was excellent when it arrived. The tartare had the perfect amount of acid, gnocchi was as great as I remembered, the fries were salty and crispy, lamb bolognese was tender, someone said their filet was one of the best ones they've had in awhile and the pork chops were  massive but looked delicious and raved about. 

While New Years was disappointing, I get it. If they were to offer a set menu I think the timing would have been better/easier for the kitchen and staff. I'll keep this place on the list for date nights and intimate dinners with friends."}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was so spot-on. Every single person on staff was friendly, warm, and helpful. The food was perfection: creative, tasty, unpretentious. Both the indoor and outdoor seating is gorgeous and heavy on the ambiance (in a good way). 
We started with the lamb&foie gras meatballs (oh, how far I've fallen from meatless diet) and the brisket + biscuit (I'm a sucker for a good rhyme). Both were incredible, and turned out to be a fair indication of what was to follow. Collectively, we ordered the streak, the lamb pasta, and the scallops. SCALLOPS FTW. Everything was beautiful and tasty, but the scallops really took it home. 
As for drinks, don't leave here without trying their house made cinnamon whiskey. My parents loved it so much that they're still drunk as I type this. Additionally, I ordered a Pimms Mule and my mom had a Cosmo, both of which were expertly crafted and delicious. 
If you're in Scottsdale and looking for an intimate setting with exquisite food, don't hesitate to make a reservation here (but seriously, make a reservation because this place is always poppin')."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner in their very nice outdoor patio/garden.  Food was good and our server Richie was fantastic; had great suggestions for food and drinks and elevated the whole experience.  Definitely will be coming back and requesting Richie's section!"}
{"text":"A perfect experience!...

I helped organize a corporate dinner at The House Brasserie last night, and our entire experience could not have been any better! Every attendee--many who were from outside the US--had extremely positive remarks about the evening's experience. In other words: SUCCESS! The ambiance was beautiful, the food was extraordinary, and the service likewise outstanding.

Our group of 40+ was seated in the large, brick-paved patio area out front. The tables were arranged with thoughtful intentionality so as to make our group as comfortable as possible in the beautiful space. The lights, house music, table decor, and gorgeous weather all added to the delightful environment. 

When our group arrived we were greeted by servers ready with fresh drinks, hot appetizers, and smiling faces. And as the next three courses were delivered one-after-the-other with precision timing throughout the evening (props to the kitchen staff!), our taste buds danced with each exquisite plate as we anxiously awaited the next round of mouth-watering goodness. 

And as awesome as the ambiance and food were, the overall service completely tied it all together. The management staff were present, hands-on, and willing to bend over backward to ensure everything was perfect for us. The servers were warm and authentically friendly all night long. The bussers were helpful, timely, and unobtrusive. You could tell that the team had been well trained due to the high standard of professionalism from everyone there.  

From an event planner's perspective, I can't wait for the next time I will have the privilege to work with the team at The House again. While we were originally planning to hold our event at a different nearby restaurant, I'm so happy we changed our plans to spend the evening at The House. Sonia, Brian, Jimmy, Chef Matt, Sarah, and ALL of the staff were amazing to work with. They were personable and professional. They said YES more than no. They sought to accommodate us in every feasible way. And those things matter to me as a customer. From the first site visit I did with Sonia months before our event, it was clear that she and the team are top-notch professionals who endeavor to deliver the best possible experience for their patrons. Two thumbs, three cheers, and five stars for The House Brasserie!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I was there for a work dinner and the atmosphere, staff, and food were incredible! The owner was right outside and asked what we though as we left and it was definitely worth every penny!! Perfect date night spot also. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch, was blown away by the beautiful patio!! Duck chilechiles were awesome and half price bottles of wine is never a bad thing!!"}
{"text":"Every part of The House Brasserie is exceptional!  The food, drinks, service and atmosphere are truly a cut above the rest!  Whether you are going for date night, drinks with the girls or needing to impress someone in your professional life this is the place!  I highly recommend the crab and Gouda fondue to start!  For dinner you must try the Lamb Bolognese (order the bread and butter though to soak up the extra sauce) and don't pass up a side of lobster fried rice for the table to share!  My friend ordered the country rib dish and again just delicious!  When it's time for dessert you can't go wrong with any of them but I must say the caramel apple upside cake is was SO yummy!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love it as I love Mission. The ambiance is beautiful & loved that the owner came up to the table to see how we were doing.  The food was good.  They obviously are still working out the kinks, but I have to say that the service needs to be better.  There were four of us at the table & we were doing a sort of tapas evening - ordering several items & sharing so we asked our waiter several times if one order of each appetizer was good for four (duck meatballs, shrimp, brisket biscuits) - since we all wanted to try each one - imagine our dismay when they all came out with three pieces each, so I never got to taste some of them.  We would have ordered more if we had known - the wait staff should be instructed to advise people as to how many pieces come in each dish so the customers can make informed decisions.  Many restaurants I go to back home, in NYC, will advise you as to how many pieces are in a dish & will offer to add to the original amount for a little extra - we have no problem paying for additional pieces so it would be to the restaurant's advantage to just let people know.  We all left there still hungry.  I'd go back & give it another try based on how much I love Mission and how beautiful the place itself is."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner here.  This restaurant made my night so special and memorable.  Not only was the food amazing (SERIOUSLY AMAZING), the staff was beyond attentive, helpful, and funny!  I can't speak highly enough about this place... although I might be a little biased since I had such an amazing night here with my boyfriend."}
{"text":"I had the Creekstone fillet with the brussels. As I like my steaks cooked Pittsburgh with a cold rare center, it's not easy for most restaurants to make me happy, but the chef did an excellent job. The waitress was friendly and the overall noise was not overwhelming .I would definitely go back.

p.s. Definitely try the bread and butter appetizer. I don't know how they could do such a good job of making great bread."}
{"text":"One of the best new restaurants I've been to in a while. A converted 1940s-ish Scottsdale home, this place has the Best ambiance--especially the outdoor patio. The brisket appetizer is amazing. I had the scallops for the entree and it was fantastic. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"After trying to get a reservation for a month or so we finally got one!!  6 of us sat outside and celebrated my mom's birthday. The atmosphere was excellent. The hostess was delightful. The bartender was very nice. Our waiter was nice, but a bit over the top. He used several of his \"lines\" on all the tables around us. The chef sent out a little complimentary appetizer that was to die for. We ordered the chicken meatballs, brisket, steak, chicken, pork chop, potatoes and more. Every single dish was delish but sadly, not hot enough. We were all slightly disappointed that the food was not hotter.  We had to ask for dessert menus (after waiting awhile) and the desserts were not nearly as good as the dinner. Stick with appetizers, forget about dessert!"}
{"text":"Great food, and perfectly portioned. Good atmosphere (especially out front), good music, good people. It is a bit of a mix of modern and traditional, hard to explain, but my parents and I really liked it. The service was a little too slow at times, but everything else was great."}
