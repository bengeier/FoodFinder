{"text":"Walked in on a cold winter day for lunch. I was fascinated by the quality of the food, service and ambiance. I had the dragon rolls, it was so good, I had to order some more.  Highly recommended, if you are a fan of Japan cuisine."}
{"text":"I took some friends who are visiting from overseas here for dinner last night and it was delicious.  This is by far the best priced Japanese restaurant in Yorkville.  I have walked past it many times because I assumed it would be overpriced like the others.  Wrong!  The menu is large and has very good variety.  My friends all ordered different Bento boxes and I ordered the Vegetarian Dinner.  We shared warm sake tea and ordered an additional spicy salmon roll.    The service is wonderful and the wait staff are extremely friendly.  The food was fresh and my overseas friends said it was one of the best Japanese places they have been taken to when they come to Toronto.  I will most definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Not a good lunch place to go to, won't be coming back.   I did a pick up today Tempura Bento and it was a really Bento box when I opened it up. The shrimp was limp, they actually tempered a quarter of a onion skin...so sad.   I guess this place is on cut backs, granted there were only two tables occupied in there.   Meal with tax was $11 in change."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Today I went in with three others at lunch time. There was one free table that needed clearing. We stood by the door awkwardly waiting and waiting. All the sushi chefs and waitresses saw us. No one made any effort to greet us or clear the table. The waitress went to the back. Really unimpressed - we left and went to Sushi Inn. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area and have tried pretty much every sushi joint in Yorkville and the Bay/Yonge/Bloor corridors. Shogun is by far the best in terms of quality and ingredients. The maki rolls, nigiri and sashimi are excellent, the best raw fish I've had in the GTA, the miso soup is also beautifully flavoured. The trend is simplicity with the freshest ingredients and the perfect balance of seasoning. If you're one for very fancy volcano-like rolls and the latest gimmicks, Shogun is not for you. I also admit that the bento boxes were just average, not bad and many people do order them, but nothing special in my opinion and not the main reason to come here. I disagree that the service is slow. The chefs work very fast and the servers are truly lovely. If you come at a very busy time of course you'll have to wait longer. Sit back, sip your green tea and enjoy the moment. It's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! Went for the dinner boat and no regrets! Good price."}
{"text":"Great service and food for a great price :) I ordered the chirashi bowl which tasted fresh and the portion was very generous. For its location in Yorkville, the price is not bad at all. Very affordable quality sushi."}
{"text":"It is a nice small Japanese restaurant. The prices are reasonable. The quality of the food is above average. I might come back again if I am in the area to give it another try."}
{"text":"Shogun is top of the line in terms of sushi. It's across from the Cumberland Theatre, upstairs.  It's not much on the eyes. Seats about 50 with a long bar, but as far as sushi goes, this is the cleanest joint in the neighborhood, definitely worth the money. Did I mention it's also not the cheapest?   Lots of stars eat at Shogun when they're in town filming and it's a fav among U2. They have photos and signed papers pinned to the walls to prove it."}
{"text":"A very nice little Japanese restaurant....not too big...simple...and they have dish not commonly listed like other restaurants.... Try the Tartare dished and the best green tea cheesecake I ever tried..... And CHEAP...$200 for 6 people...."}
{"text":"Price is a little higher than your run-of-the-mill Japanese place, but it is very reasonable for a meal in the high-end Yorkville area. One item dishes start at around $10 though (udon or dons), and they are well-portioned, and higher quality than other run-of-the-mill places, so you can still have a nice meal for under 15 dollars, tax and tip included.   All ingredients are fresh, and whoever makes the food does so with care, for every item on the menu.  Very quiet, and service is very slow; I do not think this is because the waitress is lazy or unattentive, I think she is just giving the patrons the time they need to talk and eat at a relaxed pace, and in peace. She was very nice, so I do not think it is a big deal that she cannot read my mind and know exactly when I am ready to order.   However, I would not come here if I was in a hurry, because the food does take a while to be prepared (but I take that as a good sign!)."}
{"text":"After reading some questionable reviews from know it all nit wits, I would like to say that my sister and I have been loyal patrons of Shogun for many years. You will not find better sushi in Toronto, that is a fact. The prices are very reasonable considering the level of freshness, quality and culinary skill. While I can see that the servers sometimes might not be what Toronto foodies may be used to, keep in mind that the waitresses actually prepare and put together a lot of the appetizers, soups and much more themselves. They are also very friendly and very accommodating. I have yet to find a restaurant that has served me with the consistent perfection that shogun has shown over the years."}
{"text":"Had the box 20/20. The flavour is not the best I've had. Tempura was a bit soggy and sauce for tempura was not very good. Chicken teriyaki was decent though. Would not go back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Small cozy place . Great prices, really good service. Fresh fish,, Parking is expensive underground. But would definitely return. Also in a nice area, so parking cost is expected.. Inside could look nicer, perhaps too bright, could use some decorative enhancements to add more emphasis on culture...not a place to go for fancy night out.  Would return for the effective solid pricing. ,, service. And the quality of the fish itself."}
{"text":"It's our first visit to Shogun, and I daresay we'll be back.  Reasonably priced good food, coupled with friendly attentive service.  We ordered tempura udon (yummy delicious noodles & broth), the friday fish special (meh, not bad but will not order again) and the katsudon (generous portion, loved the sauce. Actually the best katsudon I've had in TO so far).  Complimentary miso soup, salad, tea and orange for dessert.  Will be back to try their sushi & maki.  And have another katsudon =)"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here a few days ago, the food was wonderful :)  The place is pretty classically Japanese, which is a nice touch on a street full of restaurants trying to be more trendy than good, and the walls are lined with celeb customer autographs. A nice touch.  We ordered a la carte, and had some of the more eccentric rolls that aren't available elsewhere (lobster?). All of the sushi was as good as I've ever had anywhere else, and the price was right too. Total came up to about $35-40 a person, which isn't too bad given the quality of the food and the prices for far inferior fish elsewhere in Toronto.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Shogun is a cute little Japanese restaurant in Yorkville; my SO brought me here on date night last week before our Hot Doc film.  When we walked in, we were asked to grab a seat at any empty table we wanted.  The waitress unfortunately did not notice we were new patrons to the restaurant.  After she noticed us, the service level picked up and we were able to place our order.  We got light bento boxes to start then followed up several maki rolls.  The bento boxes were great but the maki rolls were on the smallish size.  They were flavourful but it left you wanting more.  As desert, we got complimentary orange slices to finish off the meal.  Overall, despite the average service, Shogun is a descent sushi place in the Yorkville area.  I will be back if I am ever in the area.  They have some reasonably priced lunches as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch - nice, small restaurant. Had the sushi lunch A and it was great. Perfect size (I was pretty hungry) and very fresh. Always happy to find new Yorkville spots."}
{"text":"First let me express my surprise with the otherwise glowing reviews of this Yorkville disappointment.  I have to disagree, but first some disclaimers.  1) My review is based on my first and only time eating here. 2) I only had a light meal and was in a bit of a rush. 3) I spent a couple of years in Japan, and may have 'unrealistic' expectations for this type of cuisine...  Disclaimers aside, the restaurant was woefully understaffed on a Wednesday evening just after 8 p.m. You would think two waitresses would be enough for this smallish room, but my girlfriend waited five minutes at the door to even get seated, and we both waited longer to get a drink order in.  The waitress was smiley, and her kimono was cute enough, but maybe it was what was slowing her down? She also brought one tea, when two were ordered, and I had to call her back on behalf of a neighbouring table who were having no luck doing it themselves.  Poor service can almost always be overcome by good eats, but alas, it was not to be. The sushi combo \"B\" was a tray with six california rolls and about six or seven nigiri. The rolls were poorly made -- actually the worst I've seen in a restaurant. The maki were loose, and the rice seemed dry, which made them crumble in my chopsticks. They were also sliced sloppily, with long odds and ends of avocado and cucumber sticking out.  The nigiri were a mixed bag. The hamachi was buttery and tasty, but the hokkigai (surf-clam) was rubbery and the salmon was listless. This was also the first time I have been given a clump of rice with an entire piece of faux-crab on it as a nigiri. I didn't even eat that one.  Perhaps worse than the sushi was the \"fried tofu\" which I took to be an attempt at agedashi tofu. Maybe I shouldn't compare it to that dish, since the name was different, but it looked similar. Well, similar enough. The small triangular tofu pieces were swimming in a soupy sauce -- way more than you would normally get in agedashi. And when I tucked in I found the soup to be very sour, almost just like vinegar. The tofu itself also had a slightly sour taste.  Miso soup was nothing special, but OK. The little run-of-the-mill salad that came with the sushi set might have been the best part of the meal, as it had a half-decent ginger dressing.  After all that the price was a shocker too. For one person The bill was nearly $30, including one bottle of Sapporo. Ouchie.  True, there were signed photos of stars like Richard Gere, Lucy Liu and Michael Ignatieff (does he qualify?). But after eating here, I think this restaurant trades much more on it's location than it does on the quality of the dining experience.  Cheap but acceptable sushi is kind of a Toronto staple these days. Unfortunately, on the night I ate here, Shogun had neither."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago with my girlfriend, deciding to try something new. In this case, terrible idea. We were one of the only two groups of patrons in the restaurant.  I had the Chirashi and my girlfriend had the shioyaki salmon. We were given the traditional miso soup and salad -- nothing special, completely ordinary.   The Chirashi came first with fish that looked as if it had been hacked off sloppily. It looked nothing like what the picture on the menu indicated it to be. Surf clam was rubbery, salmon tastless, butterfish felt like it was frozen, and the tamago was mushy and sort of oozed around in my mouth. Got about 8 or 9 pieces of fish for $16.95.  Girlfriend's shioyaki salmon was dry and fried, not very tasty. The dumplings that came with the salmon were soaked in sauce and were soggy rather than crispy. Portion was small.  WE were given sliced oranges to finish off our meal. No way to go wrong there, right? Except no, I picked up the orange and discovered that they had arbitrarily decided to cut a hole out from the bottom, meaning that orange juice could freely drip onto my clothes if I wasn't careful. How do you screw up cutting up an orange?  For a full review, visit my blog located on my profile. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A random walk in the Yorkville park brought me and 4 friends to Shogun.  Off the bat - I loved the traditional japanese doors that greeted us at the entrance.  Sure it took us a while to figure out how to open them... but left us with good laughs before we even took a seat.  The place wasn't very busy on this rainy Monday night, so we got the big table for 5 where one of the many visiting celebs might have sat... from Antonia Banderas to Nic Cage to Bono!  Now let's get to the important stuff.  The menu is pretty comprehensive and no different than your typical japanese menu.  The wait staff were friendly and dressed up in cute kimono's that I kind of wished I could put on while eating my meal.  Our meals consisted of 2 x Chirashi, an order of a few rolls, and a Katsu Don.  The presentation was appealing to the eye & the sushi tasted pretty good and was soft at the bite - no rubbery sushi here!  Our after meal oranges was a great way to end an enjoyable meal with great friends.  Half an hour later, however,.... I was kind of hungry again.  I'm not sure if this means that the servings were small or if this is common for sushi meals that aren't all-you-can-eat.  Nonetheless, I'd definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"After months of bi-weekly buddy dates suggesting, \"let's try something new, um... ethiopian?\", \"... the italian place in the basement of manulife?\", or \"i feel like... burgers\", and \"wanna just get appetizers and drinks somewhere?\"  I finally confessed, \"I really don't like Sushi Inn, there's so many better places in the annex... up north... uh... everywhere.\"  Sometimes it's just better to come out and say what you mean, because we ended up at Shogun.  HELLO!?! I always thought that people rammed Sushi Inn b/c it was the only affordable sushi place in Yorkville. Yet, Shogun is only a block away, around the same price, quiet, quaint, and best of all: THE SUSHI IS GOOD!  it's not worth 5-stars, but mos def ranks way up there... especially for it's location and the dearth of options in that 'hood."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Been going for years, and i think the best sushi spot in toronto, when taking in consideration the service, quality of the food and the super reasonable price. Just went back last night and it delivered again! The staff is always so kind.I often split the love 20/20 boat, which has a bit of everything for 45$. The rice is perfect, light sweet sesame flavour. The white tuna was amazing. Just love the traditional simple decor,  a total locals spot and its the way i like it!"}
{"text":"Shogun is definitely past its glory days if the signed celebrity photos adorning its walls are any indication.  There were autographs from the 80s, 90s... with maybe 2 in the 21st century.  The Japanese style sliding 2nd door leading to this second floor restaurant gave the place a certain mystique when you enter - what could possibly be on the other side?  The answer - a decent Japanese restaurant with incredibly slow service and average sushi.  The lunch specials are a great deal in this tony neighbourhood, at under $15 per set box.  I had the 20/20 bento that came with three california rolls, teriyaki chicken with rice, tempura, salad and miso soup.  The rolls weren't very well-made with rice bits hanging everywhere.  The chicken was great.  Hubby had the sashimi and sushi box which didn't look that yummy... but he said he quite enjoyed it.  He also had high praises for the wasabi served here."}
{"text":"Nice little place with fresh food but SLOW service. My friend and I stopped by for lunch and there was only one lady running the entire place. Will come back but it's not an ideal place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for making this recommendation for Sush in Toronto...  I am from Vancouver, and the sushi there is the besssttt.  So I am always out to find good sushi joints and I totally relied on Yelp to find yet another goodie on my list.    Cute cute little place with waitresses in kimonos, great chill environment, often filled with celebs...  I had the daily dinner special SUKIYAKI BEEF BOWL, which was deee-licious.  Normally 16.50, special is 13.50 and they give you a sizable portion.  The flavors were sweet, savoury, and stewed just right.  Came with a pre-meal salad and the dressing was fresh and delightful.  My friends had the BENTO BOX specials and the food was freshly made and tasted great and the portions were sizable still!  We tried the GREEN DRAGON ROLL and it was nicely displayed and tasted fresh (no raw fish there though).  TIP:  able to substitute anything white rice with BROWN RICE for $1."}
{"text":"This place was decent but the decor is getting a little long in the tooth. It needs an update. Food was decent but stick to their fish. Hot meal didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back. Went here out of hunger and convenience. Overall 2.5/5  Service 2/5: there was only one other table there when we arrived. The waitress insisted we sit at the table by the door even though the ENTIRE restaurant was empty and the table next to the door was not cleaned (dishes from previous guest still on the table). We waived it off because it may have been because we had a stroller with us. But the basic service was lacking such as after she cleared the table she only set up 2 place settings for 4 people so we had to steal chopsticks from another table.  We had to ask her every time we wanted our tea refilled when she could clearly see it was empty. I would have definitely looked past this if it wasn't that at the busiest point there were 3 tables with guests. And rightfully so.   Food 3/5: the food wasn't awful but it's the same quality you would get at a cheap sushi restaurants minus the price. Since we came here for dinner we didn't get the lunch prices which seem to be more appropriate pricing for the sloppy put together rolls. It definitely was not worth $15. See pictures included."}
{"text":"was good.... enough..... i dont know how ppl are giving five stars..  not the most attentive service, my sashimi was frozen, not the cleanest..  nothing really appealed to me.."}
{"text":"super friendly staff. super tiny washroom but that's besides the point. the lunch menu is lacking. i got the salmon teriyaki bento box. it was well presented and tasted great. this restaurant was clean, including the washroom.  i randomly selected this restaurant because i was in the area and had time to waste and was hungry. i made a good choice. i'd visit again and recommend."}
{"text":"I came here solo for a Friday lunch since my lunch date couldn't make it last minute.  Not that I mind eating lunch in restaurant by myself anyway, but the quiet environment here definitely made it a lot more enjoyable than otherwise. On my way out, I noticed 3 to 4 other solo diners here too.   I ordered the sashimi and sushi lunch combo ($12.95).  Freshness of sashimi was average, miso soup was good for someone who doesn't usually like it, sushi rice was better than expected, salad was fresh with good amount of dressing. A bit stingy on the number of sashimi though (4 pieces only).    I gave this a 4-star as opposed to 3-star for their fast, courteous service, and quiet environment. The quality of the food is comparable to sushi inn on the same street. Pricing is affordable considering it is Yorkville."}
{"text":"Got take out from here - chirashi, udon tempura, sunomono salad, and a salmon avocado roll. The only semi-good thing was the salmon avocado roll and the miso soup. Everything else was pretty difficult to eat. The chirashi tasted sour, the udon was so bland we couldn't eat it....  The couple who owns this restaurant seem really sweet, but I think that's about all it has going for it unfortunately."}
{"text":"Wandered in here solo after a fun Yelp happy hour event in the neighbourhood.  Opted for the salmon teriayki meal which included miso soup, salad, and rice as well.  Soup was good, salad was refreshing, and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  Would love to come back and try some salmon/sashimi."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere The main waitress is overworked and forgets orders Frequent this place for lunch"}
{"text":"I am new to Toronto, and my cousin took me to Shogun for dinner.  It has stairs and is not accessible.  Most of their menu involves fish, so vegans, unless you're just going to eat avocado and cucumber rolls, it may not be the place for you.  They also have a liquor license and serve beer and sake.    My cousin and I ended up sharing a delicious sushi boat.  It was around $24, came with soup, and filled us both up.  The rolls were nicely rolled and the fish tasted as fresh as you're going to get in Toronto.  If I'm in the area and want sushi, this is a great place to visit!"}
{"text":"I don't believe in perfection (5 stars) but this place is one of the few that wowed me.   This place is amazing! The server is cheerful and the food tastes delicious! Even when they're busy, you won't feel abandoned - especially during lunch hours. The prices are very reasonable considering where it's located.   I went there twice so far, and I enjoyed my experience there. During my first visit, I had Yakiniku Lunch (pan fried marinated thinly sliced beef). It came with soup, rice, salad and 2pcs of cucumber sushi for $8.50. Yum!   As for my second visit, I had 20/20 Lunch Box ($8.95). It has rice, chicken teriyaki, 3pcs of California roll, 1pc of shrimp tempura, 3pcs of vegetable tempura (broccoli and sweet potato). The tempura was so crispy and light. It also came with soup and salad. Oh boy everything was delicious and perfectly prepared.   I would recommend Shogun Udon as well, the soup is to die for! It's light but super sweet and delicious.   I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went to Shogun for the first time recently and my friend will verify that when I put my chopsticks down after eating my last piece of nigiri I proclaimed: \"That was the best sushi I have ever had.\"  I had a combination of maki and nigiri rolls and every variety seemed to melt in my mouth. It was so fresh and bursting with flavour. I even tried barbecue eel for the first time and was no disappointed. Even the simple soup and salad that came with my meal was very tasty. And because it was late at night and mid-week there weren't many people there so the food came extremely quick. Our waitress (in a Japanese ensemble) was very attentive and sweet as well. The total vibe was calm and relaxing. I almost felt like I was in some sort of zen garden.  With this place being in Yorkville it seems to have caught the eye of some celebrities. We sat next to an autograph of Bono from U2. Other celebs who grace the walls include Michael J. Fox, Lucy Liu, Pierce Brosnan and, my personal favourite, John Candy from 1985 who also happened to mention that Shogun \"is the best.\""}
{"text":"After exploring the restaurant options with a group of co-workers, we decided on Shogun for our lunchtime meal on Friday.  I was impressed with the amount of photos framed on the walls of celebrities that have dined at the restaurant over the years.  From Pierce Brosnan to Antonio Banderas, it seems like Shogun is a popular destination for the movie stars that visit Toronto during Toronto International Film Festival.  The restaurant itself is not very large, but has a great cozy and relaxing vibe that makes dining in a comfortable experience even if you are with a large group.  We walked around the Yorkville area looking for somewhere to eat, and most places were already full or didn't have room for everyone in our group.  It is worth noting that his place was the only restaurant in the area that was able to accommodate our large group of ten for lunch.  I ordered the steak teriyaki bento box, and was quite satisfied with the quality of food.  The service was also very good, and I thought they did a great job serving our table.  The bento box came with sirloin steak, rice, soup, salad, and gyoza.  I felt like the portions were a bit on the smaller side, and I do consider myself to have a small appetite.  I did however notice on the menu afterwards that it was under the \"Light Course\" section, something I didn't initially notice when placing my order.  Perhaps next time I will order a dinner meal or something in addition to the bento box.   Overall, I think this place is a great spot to grab a bite to eat with a medium sized group and I would definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi junkie and generally I'm disappointed by Toronto sushi.  And when I say sushi I'm really talking about high quality raw fish and rice - I can't comment on tempura or the other things.  I love Shogun.  The sushi here is fresh and delicious, and it is offered in traditional and creative options.  And more than that, it is very reasonably priced and served by attentive and smart servers (they remember you and your preferences).  The decor is dated and has signed pictures from celebs from years ago.  This doesn't bother me, but if you need slick, modern interiors, then this is not for you.  I go far out of my way to eat at Shogun, and enjoy that dinner time is generally pretty quiet and I never wait for a table."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place. Very traditional and the food was incredible! I have been to many sushi places and this one is by far one of my favorites. No all you can eat but the meals are much better in quality rather than quantity. The service was very fast and incredibly attentive. Highly recommend this place. I enjoyed my meal so much that I forgot to take a picture of the Sakura Bento Box!"}
{"text":"Very quiet, traditional Japanese sushi bar.  The sushi is fresh, the service fast and friendly, but the price is a little bit excessive."}
{"text":"Super impressed. Staying at the Park Hyatt, I badly wanted a sushi fix, but it was 10.15pm and a holiday, and the concierge was fairly sure all the sushi joints closed at 10pm. Walking the streets in search of any sort of decent food, I stumbled on Shogun, saw it was open, and went for it, with no expectations!  As it was 45 minutes before closing and it was quiet, the service I received was impeccable, and the food was fantastic. I had tuna & salmon sashimi, avokyau and dragon rolls, miso, and gyoza. The sashimi was beautifully fresh, particularly the tuna, and all the rolls were light, delicate, and full of flavor - the dragon roll particularly blew me away with the tempura prawn perfectly warm and moist at the point or serving.  Service was also super friendly, but as I mentioned, it was quiet. Will check it again when it's busier for a fairer assessment."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience at Shogun today. Got the 20/20 sushi special. For $8.95 it comes with 1 piece of shrimp tempura and 3 pieces of vegetable tempura, 3 pieces of California roll, small portion of chicken teriyaki and rice, served in a bento box. It comes with soup and salad. The meal was filling and quality was decent for price range. My companions had the tempura udon and the salmon teriyaki and both also enjoyed their meals.  Service was friendly and staff was attentive. Great option in the neighbourhood for a budget lunch"}
{"text":"Great spot, not too pricey for Yorkville. Don't be fooled if it's quiet inside. The fish is fresh and the atmosphere is peaceful."}
{"text":"To describe Shogun in one word: average. I love Japanese cuisine, but I really won't be coming back.   On a Friday night at dinnertime, there were literally no customers inside. It's a pretty roomy restaurant with the normal 'Japanese restaurant' decor- some posters of beer, that one menu table mat you see at literally every basic Japanese restaurant, a waitress dressed up in a kimono. I overheard the chefs and waitress speaking in Korean, so it's not an authentic Japanese restaurant really.   The food came up pretty quickly, but the rolls were made haphazardly with the rice falling off, and the tempura batter was more chewy than crispy. The waitress mostly stayed behind the door, and on the way to the washroom my friend found her watching her k-drama. The chefs also disappeared after a while.   Nothing new, nothing special, but nothing bad happened either. I wouldn't recommend this place- there are better casual Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time recently. It was clear that this place has a collection of loyal regulars and for good reason. The focus on the quality and freshness of the ingredients was excellent. No over the top dishes covered in spicy mayo and tempura bits - just simple, classic dishes made well."}
{"text":"I ate at Shogun for lunch today for the first time.  With so many sushi joints in Yorkville to choose from, I thought I'd take a chance on this one.  Service was friendly, and prompt.  I was dining for one, and the servers made it feel less lonely.  Within a few minutes of ordering, my food was on the table.  It was perhaps, a little too fast.  The sashimi looked like it had been cut and plated hours before my arrival.  I got the 20/20 Bento box as well.  It came with the smallest portion of steamed rice I have ever received in a bento.  The California rolls were poorly shaped and falling apart, 3 pieces squished into a space so tightly together that it took significant work to separate them, and left bald spots in the exterior rice.  The veggie tempura was decent, but the broccoli piece was not fried long enough.  The batter on the interior was still raw and the broccoli was too firm.  The pieces were stuck to the cocktail napkin they lined the bento with.  The tempura sauce seemed either watered down or flavourless (and for a normally subtly flavoured sauce, that is saying something).  By far, the worst part, was the chicken teriyaki.  Maybe 6 small chunks of fatty chicken, drowning in sauce.  Upon my first bite, I found that what I had thought was a chunk of chicken was mostly fat, and a big chunk of bone.  In fact, about half the chunks were fat, and the other half were fat covered bone.  I've never had chicken prepared this way.  Ever.  For the 20/20 lunch bento and a 3pc salmon sashimi it came to $17 and change.  The meal wasn't worth $6.  Toronto needs higher standards for sushi."}
{"text":"The first time I went I got the seafood soup. It was amazing and loved the service. I went solo for lunch on a weekday as they are opposite where I work. I raved about them on Twitter because the food was very good and the service was very good.  The second time I went to get sushi for takeout, they sat me at a table and completely forgot about me for 10 minutes!! I was fuming but starving so didn't want to leave. One of the girls apologized and said that they were busy but that is no excuse. There were only two servers and the restaurant was 90% packed. You don't seat someone who comes for takeout and completely forget about them. One of the servers passed me by 3 times and didn't even bother to talk to me.  So that said I don't think I will be going back. I know Sushi Inn is just a few doors down. Yes Sushi Inn is bigger, busier and NOT authentic BUT they have more servers and I have never been ignored there."}
{"text":"There are way better sushi elsewhere but this is close by work and cheaper alternative to other lunch places in Yorkville. They have lunch specials ard $9-$15 and different daily specials that are couple dollars than the regular menu. The california roll here however is quite good.  This bento box was $11. The tempera was good."}
{"text":"There are not many places in Yorkville you can get a proper lunch for $10, but Shogun is one of them.   Food is always good but service can be a bit agonizingly slow especially over lunch time. There is not a lot of seating and it's often full at lunch if you try to visit around 12:30pm.   Fish is excellent; much fresher than most places in the city. Both the rainbow and green dragon rolls here are good choices. Seafood salad, ikayaki and the baked eggplant appetizer are all nice.  Dinner runs at $20-$30, lunches around $10 and they have some late afternoon specials too.  Overall, not bad, but I prefer GINZA closeby, which has a more inventive menu and SPEEDY service."}
{"text":"Whoa, looks like other Yelpers didn't have good experiences. Ours from today, was fine.    Came here for lunch with family.  We ordered Tempura, soup, sushi and the Beef Teriyaki lunch ($9.95).    ~~~ yay: -complimentary green tea (I think today's had genmai (roasted brown rice) in it as well); -friendly service, even though she wasn't Japanese and got minor things about our order wrong; -cool to see that celebs have been here too; -cheap/reasonably priced lunches; -family had no complaints about the sushi being \"frozen\" - said the food was good, actually; -soup was good/fine, made possible from scratch, not MSG-ish in taste; -clean environment, nice decor, convenient location.  hey: -we had some doubts about the quality of the cut of steak used for the beef teriyaki -- the fat was visible; -we left full, but then were again a bit hungry in another 30 min. it seems (maybe we just had larger-than-average appetites?)  Would I come again? At some point, sure.  It's not the kind of place I'd get a particular craving for, but I'd be happy in going to it again if the mood struck, and the resto was conveniently there."}
