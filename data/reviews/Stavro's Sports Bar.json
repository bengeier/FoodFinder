{"text":"Food was wonderful, but the service was AWFUL.  Place had only 2 or 3 other tables of customers. She took forever to come take our drink order, took forever to bring us our drinks (while we watched her stand around drinking and chatting with all the other staff) then finally asked if we wanted menus. Kept coming right next to us to serve the people there, but ignored us when we'd try to get her attention. Finally took our order. Then awhile later came and took the order of the people sitting next to us. Brought their order very quickly (which was exactly the same as ours- pizza and wings) and we waited another 45 minutes for our meal. She had no idea what the game special was, told us of the days special after we had decided what we wanted, didn't tell any of us the drink special, and was totally rude. Not pleased with this service whatsoever.  If you're ordering to go, great. The food is awesome!"}
{"text":"We've come back multiple times just for the service alone! Love the wing night. Always get a good portion of flavourful wings. Can't beat the drink specials. Clean establishment. Clean bathrooms (which you wouldn't expect, but they surprised me!) Love Stavros!"}
{"text":"I came to Stavros with positive thoughts... I wanted to have a great experience based on the reviews I read.  Actually, everything went well, until I had paid the bill. Yes, paid... I had to get cash from the waitress AFTER I complained.  Be very careful about what you get charged for. I was charged for an extra beer at full price even though what I was drinking (CDN) was on special for the whole night. Based on the waitress's reaction, she knew that I caught her... I should have reversed the entire  credit card charge and cancelled the generous tip. In the end, it was awkward and I accepted the cash for the bogus beer I was charged for. I was also charged for clamato on the side for my beer and wasn't advised of this charge as well.  If you visit this place, triple-check your bill, especially if you pay by credit card.  This garbage should not occur!"}
{"text":"It was good was there for lunch. A little more expensive then I thought it would be. Spaghetti and pizza were the bomb!! Liked the bar atmosphere. Very welcoming."}
{"text":"I have just moved here from Scotland and I don't stay far from Stavros so I would call it my local. The foods good! They have awesome hot wings. The staff are really friendly. The screens for sports are everywhere so if that's your thing it's perfect. I have met some good folk in Stavros and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"You could not pay me to set foot in this place again.   Grunge setting for trivia folks and mostly bar flies on that scene. If I could give it a zero, I would. See James C's review.  Says it all."}
{"text":"This Stavro's has pretty good Greek-style pizza. I used to live within walking distance, and would go down most Wednesday nights because it was 1/2 price.  Burgers are great, too."}
{"text":"1 - I can guarantee you that a price was not quoted to my fianc√© at the time of order.  2 - I looked for your menu online and was unable to find it. I did find a Stavros but was for a different location. I did note that their prices were much more reasonable. Mind posting your menu here? 3 - I never demanded that the driver pick up the pizza for a refund. I called to check on the prices after being astonished at the high price for the small amount delivered. I had one foot out the door to bring them back to you myself as you are literally a 2 minute walk from my home. Unfortunately my moving help was extremely hungry and convinced me that waiting for another delivery would take too long. 4- I have had your pizza and I have had 2 of the others I listed. I have also had pizza from dozens of places in town not to mention some of the best from other cities around North America. Yours is good but don't kid yourself, for the price point it is not the top of the heap. 5- your employee took down my name and number and said she would have a manager call me. That was never done. You seem more concerned to troll the internet and spin your public image than to deal with the customer issue at hand. This seems rather evident in that you edited your response 5 times after your initial writing and yet have not bothered to even call me.  6- when a customer contacts you with a complaint they are giving you the opportunity to make it right. Your complete disregard has just lost you a customer for life and all of the negative lip service I can muster."}
{"text":"Dont go here if you expect good food and service. The owners suck . My wife and I have gone there for at least tbe last 5 years. Saturday 2 weeks ago we went in at 12 noon. My wife ordered a breakfast of 2 eggs over easy , bacob .hashbrowns and toast . It wasn't busy as maybe 10 people all drinking . 35 minutes later out comes here food after many requests from \"Shelby the server\" One egg ruunny one egg hard , toast and bacon cold . My wife refused to pay and server agreed. Said no problem and another table that orederd food also complained.  Now we go in tonite and were informed we were not to be served any longer. Due to my wife returning the food.  So if you want to pay for crappy food and get treated this way ...by all means go in."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Best I found for classic pizza. If I am taking out pizza it is the ONLY place I will go. Great 3 topping take out deal real pizza , so good"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Calgary. I'm originally from Montreal and was hoping I could find great pizza here as well. Stavros delivered on this wish, absolutely delicious! I always ask for extra sauce and a thin crust."}
{"text":"Once I found out Stavros got NTN trivia-- I had to go there with with my friends and see what it is like. Prices are a little high-- but everything I have had there has tasted amazing. Lasagna is good for the Thursday special. Half price pizza Wednesday is always good for my friend and I to enjoy. We get the Stavros special-- has everything on it- for just $7.50 each. And the 4 slices make me stuffed. Shawna is terrific during the day for service. Stephanie, Nicole and the others at night are so beautiful and nice servers. Always call us by name and are on the ball. Getting into the NHL playoffs soon, and certainly will stop by any chance I get. Other trivia players there are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I do not think this restaurant deserves even one star. I ordered a chicken breast sandwich and fries. What I got was the smallest piece of chicken on a huge bun, and next to no mayo. The chicken breast was not seasoned, the char marks from the grill were actually burn marks, which made the sandwich taste awful. The fries were the skinny type and were actually burned dark brown. They tasted horrible. My husband ordered a beef dip with cesar salad. The beef dip was dry, and the cesar dressing was apparently homemade, with an incredibly fishy taste...way too much anchovy. The upside to this over priced $45.00 meal was the gravy. It disguised the taste of the burned fries and the charred chicken breast. Never again will order from here."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. We ordered pizza, and it was obviously a frozen pizza because the pineapple we requested added was added AFTER it was cooked and was loose on the top. Also, there was a chunk of cardboard underneath one of the pieces. Ultimately, the pizza came out the bottom end of me, the way it went into the top of me. Like crap."}
{"text":"I was totally surprised by this place.  I wasn't expecting anything more than a local watering hole but it turned out to be a great place to hang out. Lots of televisions here, so if you're looking for a quiet place to have a conversation, look elsewhere.   Staff are friendly and darn cute. They're attentive without being a nuisance, and my glass never emptied. The food is surprisingly good. I've had the steak sandwich, various pizzas, nachos and of course a cheeseburger. The pizza is by far my favourite, and tastes just as good the next day as it did when it arrived at my table.   I suggest going Wednesdays as pizzas are 1/2 price on anything size except a small. I'm a baseball fan and am looking at spending many a Saturday afternoon here watching my teams.   The wash rooms are large and clean, wifi available (it's password protected but just ask at the bar) and free parking, both lot and street.  This is the quintessential neighbourhood sports bar and I hope it never changes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is on my way home from work, and since trying their house dill ranch (hey, I'm a condiment girl) I've been a hopeful fool for Stavros. No more though. I've ordered from them via skip the dishes for both pick up and delivery 4 times in the last month and a half, and not ONE SINGLE TIME has my order been 100% correct. At first it was minor things like forgetting extra orders of sauce. The second to last time there was bacon on my salad after I'd asked for it and my potato skins without it. This evening, there was bacon/ham on both salad and potato skins after again asking for them, in written form, without. It's okay, Stavros. You're right. Meat is much better, I don't know what I was thinking. And I'm sure your empty dining room anxiously preoccupied you to such an extent that the thought that I may be asking for vegetarian food for a reason was just forgotten.   Not willing to brave either the roads or -25 degree temperatures again, I just threw them in the trash and had KD. On the plus side, the can of coke that I ordered was delicious.   I still have a SERIOUS passion for that house ranch Stavros, but I think our relationship has run its course. It's not me, it's you."}
