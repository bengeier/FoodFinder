{"text":"Breakfast burritos, carne asada burritos, horchata, anything... Is the best here! Yummy Yummy"}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos & chicken tacos (crispy n delicioso!) We will be returning for the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Gave them another chance after not having real Mexican food in months and they made up for last time."}
{"text":"Skip all the -berto's, skip Juan's, if you are looking for a consistently delicious Mexican taco/burrito shop, go to Regio's.  When I first moved here two years ago it was called Antonio's, somewhere along the line they changed the name to Regio's and I was afraid my delicious secret was gone, but the menu remained unchanged.  LIke the others, the food is so cheap I periodically try to run the numbers to see how they could possibly be profitable (to reassure myself it is not a drug front), and while I haven't cracked that equation, I also don't equate them with crack.  See what I did there?   Standing favorites are: all of the breakfast burritos, Shrimp Burrito or Tacos, Carnitas or Adobada Burrito, and Ceviche Tostada.  My only real word of advice is if you order a standard meat burrito, tell them to go easy meat and load you up on the salsa, guacamole and diced onions and cilantro.  My first few burritos were so thickly stuffed with meat...(insert inappropriate meat-stuffing joke here).  The only things really preventing Regio's from five-star status are that they are not 24 hours, and I have an unconfirmed suspicion that one visit may have given me food poisoning.  I am still searching for the real killers."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Burritos! They give you three eggs and lots of their tasty sausage and cheese."}
{"text":"Not sure if I just have ordered the wrong things, but every experience I've had here is terrible. I work nearby and there's not really any other options for lunch so I've come here numerous times and ordered a bean and cheese burrito or a plain quesadilla. Every burrito I've had is overflowing with their beans, making it extremely difficult to even eat without spilling it all over the place. The quesadillas (which, by the way, are pictured on the menu with guac and sour cream, which it does not actually come with) are always just haphazardly thrown into a styrofoam box so it can soak in its own grease and become inedible. I will never make the mistake of eating here again."}
{"text":"Food...I have never had a bad meal here. It's not the best Mexican around but it's pretty good and when you consider the price you cant complain.  Ambiance....lacking. Bathroom is down a dark hall..had to walk my son down it he was so scared.  Staff....very friendly and accommodating.  Verdict...if you're in the neighborhood and looking for good cheap eats this  makes for an excellent option.."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican eatery, mom and pop shop. Most things written in Spanish, but they serve in English if needed. Probably the best chicken burrito I have ever eaten. Clean place. Fast service. Place for children to play, with candy machines. The TV in the background can be a little loud. Will eat here again when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best place around. i really wish they were 24 hrs, but that is my SINGLE complaint. give lots of hot sauce too (my girlfriend loves it). i agree with Khi, i dont think they are doing illegal things (HA HA Khi,), but there prices are so low its hard to figure out the numbers. who cares, the food is great. the carnitas is off the chain, lemme tell you. they also have menudo on saturdays (possibly sundays?) AWESOME. right on the corner of the 51 freeway and indian school rd."}
{"text":"This isn't a fancy place, but the food I had was delish!!  I had fish tacos because that is my favorite Mexican food to try at new eateries; I was not disappointed.  The prices are reasonable and the place was clean."}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious. The corn tortillas and refried beans were homemade and tasty. The suelas plate was seasoned perfectly and the meat tender."}
{"text":"We used to live in Prescott Valley and we had a favorite breakfast burrito place that we frequented almost weekly. We moved to Denver 4 years ago, and have been forever in search of a place that makes breakfast burritos as good as our beloved place, and have yet to find it. We are in Phoenix for the week visiting family, and considered actually driving 2 hours up to PV just for one of their burritos, but instead went on Yelp to find a good local place. Well, Regio's is it! Fat, full of chorizo, cheese and potatoes, with homemade sauces to pour on top. Delicious! Too bad we had to travel 800 miles to find it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here real briefly to get some food to before I dropped off my rental car at the airport.....I snagged a delicious, humongous burrito for like $5 that kept me satisfied my entire red-eye flight back to the east coast. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent little inexpensive neighborhood Mexican food.  Found it by accident, but we loved it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Omg, how did I not find this place sooner.  Stopped by for a breakfast burrito- chorizo. It was delicious. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great horchata and the servings were big. A great deal for your money. The shredded beef in my burro was so good and also had onions, peppers, cheese and tomato. The tortilla was so soft and... just perfect. My enchilada w/ red sauce was delicious. Definitely will be back. Everything was hot and stayed hot the entire time. It's just an all-around solid authentic Mexican food place."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Try the menudo on the weekends. Taste just like mom makes it. I love that the menu has everything! From simple tacos to caldo de res (beef stew). Big parking lot with easy parking and the drive thru is fast."}
{"text":"It's a good place.  I had the breakfast burrito and it was above average.  I'll need to try some of the house specialties next time."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast burritos for under $4! Great horchata too. That's all I had, but I'm giving them 5 stars for these 2 items."}
{"text":"Coming from TX, I've been looking for a good breakfast burrito in PHX since I moved here - I may have just finally found it! We got the potato, egg and cheese option and had them add the pork green chili (inside, not smothered). Would have liked a bit more spice but the flavor was great. The chorizo, egg and cheese was the other choice, also with the green chili - really good. They're generous with the chorizo, large chunks of meat. Tortilla is obviously fresh made. Each was close to $7 with the green chili which I thought was a little high - until they handed me a burrito that could feed me for 3 days. Quick and friendly service, being able to speak Spanish here is a plus (I definitely don't though and I was fine). Definitely worth the stop (especially if you like a good salsa bar)!!"}
{"text":"Ummmm I was craving fish tacos... Like seriously craving them!! I yelped this place, it had 4 stars and it's only about 4 mins from my house.   The fish tacos taste good ... They were flavored well. However, they were huge, couldn't stay closed huge so I took a peak inside and noticed that the fish tacos were nothing more than a piece of heavily, HEAVILY breaded fish, chopped up. Picture this: while looking through or picking through your taco you'll see huge pieces of fish breading, very little pieces of actual fish!!! Such a disappointment. Oh... They also put ranch on their fish tacos. I got mine without. Ranch on fish tacos?? Who does that?!!  I have this place 4 stars because the rice and beans were sooooo damn good and in the maybe 20 mins I was there about 4 or 5 people came in to order food. That means I should try it again, maybe chicken fajitas or something next time!!"}
{"text":"Great place for tacos. Carne asada and chili verde are great. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place small restaurant , But the food is amazing been coming here since I was young I recommend it to everyone to try ! REAL MEXICAN FOOD !"}
{"text":"You are missing out on some of the greatest Mexican food if your driving by without stopping in.  This is superior to anything you'll get at an X-berto's taco shop in taste, portion size, and price.  The burritos are enormous, and filled with meat & stuff!  ...and the refried beans are to for for...  My wife had 5 rolled tacos with Guac & Sour Cream and they actually had tons of meat in each one!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great inside or driving through the pick-up window. I have been grabbing chow here for years and complement them on their over-sized breakfast burros. My favorite is the Potato, Egg and Cheese with Crispy Bacon added on.  Great service, friendly English speaking staff and Mexican treats like Hot Chocolate.  The breakfast burritos are huge so bring a friend."}
{"text":"We love this place! Huge breakfast burrito! Delicious green salsa! We keep coming back! Drive thru is so convenient!"}
{"text":"On vacation from California, I can be picky with Mexican food and I normally hate breakfast burritos. On the first morning in AZ my family got us breakfast burritos, I was not very excited till I tried it. We have been here for 2 weeks and have had their breakfast burritos 3 times I can't get enough so good! And what great prices like 28 bucks too feed the whole family! Amazing"}
{"text":"For being a small hole in the wall restaurant it was phenomenal! My husband and I are from San Diego and we have been missing and craving our California Burritos, and they had the best California burritos in Arizona! We were very much pleasantly surprised and they are now our go to for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Prices have went up on all items.  It is starting to get out of price range for the product.  On top of that it is mandatory that I take a star away for serving me an old fish taco.  You knew damn well that taco had sat out before serving it to me.  If it EVER happens again, I will take my business elsewhere, remove another star, and no longer recommend this place.    Get it together Regio.  You can't expect to charge more if you lower the product at the same time.  There are about 2 thousands other places to get a taco in this town."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and they deserve a review, very few times have I been dissatisfied.. I love the carne asada and the breakfast burritos always delicious"}
{"text":"Regio's, wonderful Regio's. I really love this place.   The bacon breakfast burritos will keep you full for about a whole day. Also, the salsas are great! I'd love to see this place get more business. It is usually the same staff working every time I go in so it seems like they are working their tails off!  Tortas, nachos, breakfast burritos: all fantastic. Enchiladas are just okay."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Staff is all family and very warm and inviting. There is one employee and she has a poor attitude but is hardly there. Great place to get real Mexican food fast and at reasonable prices. I usually get the carnitas plate and the tacos are so delicious. Try the choco flan! Breakfast burritos will always make you smile also. Open early and closes late so any time is a good time."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!!! I was craving a breakfast burrito and this showed up in my yelp and Im so happy I found this place! Everything was so hot and fresh, just so delicious! And you're getting the biggest burrito you've seen for a very fair price!  Don't even think twice about going to filibertos! This is the place to go! I will be coming here for all my quick Mexican food cravings"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Been going here for years and they never disappoint. When I want Mexican fast food, this is my spot."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this Mexican food place on accident one evening a year or so ago. Starving on my way home from work, I thought Mexican food would hit the \"comfort food\" nook in my stomach whose needs I definitely had to accommodate. I was pleasantly surprised when my drive-thru order was ready lickety-split, and yet the food tasted fresh out of the oven upon return to my house 20 minutes later. My favorite part of this restaurant besides the insanely delicious authentic selection and fantastic prices? The \"God Bless America\" sign on the drive-thru window."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! I started coming here in 2010 and they have the best food , if you eat inside your meal comes with a couple of chips. Best bean and cheese burritos"}
{"text":"I never leave yelp reviews, by the way. But this was ridiculous! It's hard to find a really good bean & cheese burrito. SO GET ONE!"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, fresh, great flavor and super close to home! This is a perfect neighborhood place.  Decor sucks, menu on wall and handed out is only a fraction of what's available, based on all the hand written signs for other items they have. We have better luck getting the order to-go from the counter instead of the drive-thru.  That way, we can pack our own salsas from the variety avaialbe - or risk getting none in the bag if we're too lazy to leave our car. So far, I've been stuck on the carnitas and pollo asado mini tacos - I really want to explore more of the menu - but can't get away from the YUM I know! Did share the roommate's quesadilla once - GREAT tortilla!   So happy to have it close and open late!"}
{"text":"This place had one of the best burritos I have tried. Chile Relleno Burrito with Asada and Adobada! Bomb"}
{"text":"I've passed by Regio's plenty of times and I wish I had tried them sooner! Tucked right next to the 51 on Indian School, Regio's is far from an optimum location, but I can agree with most of the other reviews so far and say that the food is poppin'! I got a gordita plate from them on New Year's Day, and I was way surprised! It was delicious, and it helped settle my stomach after a night of properly ringing in 2011...  I want to go back as I write this to try their sopes! If their carne asada and their al pastor gorditas are any indicator, I will sure be in for a delicious treat! If you live in Central Phoenix and fancy some good, cheap Mexican food from a local joint, get your buns over to Regio's. I personally think I found my new regular spot for some Mexican chow."}
{"text":"Great burritos. Good price. I usually go here for lunch but that is not to say the breakfast burritos aren't delicious. Added bonus: they have those little machines you put a quarter in and get a piece of jewelry. Now I have an awesome double heart ring that turns my finger green!"}
{"text":"Two words......breakfast burritos!!!!  When all a girl wants is an authentic breakfast burrito mediocrity just won't cut it. They make one of the best breakfast burritos in town!  They are fast and friendly.   If you're an horchata fan don't miss out!  You can tell they make it from scratch!   Nom nom nom is all that really needs to be said."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the county Chicken is soooo good  Wish the tv was in English If it was in English i would give 5 stars Burritos are really good too."}
{"text":"Not Impressed. Located in a sketchy strip mall next to the expressway adjacent to a \"we buy gold store\" and a smoke shop. Ordered a Carne Asada Burrito which was way too salty and a tad on the small side. The building is a little run down and dirty, there was also a peculiar smell which  I could not pinpoint. Their menu is very confusing and has way too many choices. The prices seem a bit high for lunch, maybe not for dinner. The bathroom is disgusting. Two stars, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"All these 5 star food reviews confuse me...   Hubs and I both thought the food bland and the staff lacked any customer service skills. I would prefer any of the \"berto's\" over regio's... Which isn't really a compliment know matter how you look at it."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the area 3 months ago and haven't found our go-to delicious Mexican food... until now. We honestly went back twice yesterday (the first day trying Regio's). We love Caminero's in Peoria and this is the exact same deal. DELICIOUS food!! Well priced, authentic. We'll be back regularly for sure."}
{"text":"Regio's is a fantastic spot to get your Mexican staples. I am a regular for the carne asada plate and am never disappointed. If you are looking for delicious breakfast burros as well, Regio's is outstanding!"}
{"text":"The best $5.00 breakfast burrito in Phoenix. The concept is similar to any of the 'Bertos drive thru resturants, but the quality is so much better. Large portion, the bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito I ordered was bigger than a brick. Couldn't come close to finishing it.  Generous portions of bacon, fully cooked and crisp. Not fatty and undercooked like a lot of other places. Just the right amount of cheese that was evenly distributed throughout. I will definitely come again. The price and taste can't be beat"}
{"text":"Excellent example of good hole-in-the-wall Arizona mexican food. Tacos, tortas, burritos, you name it, all very good. And Horchata to boot!"}
{"text":"I absolutely agree with the post before me! It's a random tiny plaza off Indian School and the 51 on the SW corner Hands down, best fast, cheap Mexican I've tried in the central phoenix-ish area!! My all-time fave is a bean and cheese burrito with onions inside, enchilada style.  I also LOVE their quesadillas, which come with pico de gallo and guacamole and sour cream (which I never get at any of the \"other\" places- always have to order it seperately)! I seriously love this place!"}
{"text":"Regio's is the best. I spent a long time looking for \"cheap\" Mexican food in the area and all of the 'Bertos just didn't cut it because the quality was ehhhhh.   I've been going to Regio's for about 7 years and I still crave their rolled tacos plate, bean and cheese burrito, and breakfast burritos (served all day!) Their menudo is also really yummy! The food quality has stayed great throughout the years and I know that every time I go, I won't be disappointed.   Regio's is family owned and from what I've seen, they treat all their customers with respect. Love this place. Love."}
{"text":"I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.   Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy."}
{"text":"I don't know why his place has so many stars The guy behind the counter was polite and service was quick.  However the machaca is not really machaca that I'm used to from Tijuana. I think it was just regular ground beef mixed with egg & onions. It didn't taste bad, it just wasn't what I ordered. It tasted more like a breakfast burrito. The cheese enchilada was disappointing. The carnitas taco was bland."}
{"text":"If you want great ambience and Mariachis, keep driving.  But, if you're looking for delicious homemade Mexican food STOP here.  This small hole in the wall restaurant is amazing.  We had the chicken taco plate and the gordito.  Both were made with chicken breast (pechuga), rice and beans. The homemade tortillas melt in your mouth.  The location is convenient to AZ51 and I10.  We'll be back the next time we're passing through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Have no doubt - the worst enchilada's I've ever tried to taste.  $11 of food all in the trash.  The beef tasted spoiled and the cheese had about a cup of salt mixed in.  Wow.  Not just bad, possibly poisonous."}
{"text":"decent regular menu, awesome breakfast, but i got a torta yesterday that was awful. random cheap slice of american cheese, one little spot of beans, pressed so much that it was falling apart."}
{"text":"Is Regio's \"authentic\" Mexican food? I don't know. I don't care.   This is my favorite place to get Mexican food. It's close to mi casa (that's Spanish for my casa) and its consistently good. I could ride a bicycle here if I actually rode a bicycle, but I don't because I'm a grown ass man with a car... and I'm lazy.   I actually find myself craving Regio's on a regular basis. I want it right now, but it's 2 am and they're closed. This is my life."}
{"text":"Ok, it's one of the few places around here that are actually open super late, That is why I stopped, however that definitely does not make up for the fact that this place serves run of the mill, mediocre Mexican food right up there with all of the late night Berto's type places. I had a tamale, enchilada, rice and beans. Everything was lukewarm, pretty bland, the pork was gamey tasting. Just pretty unmemorable. I would recommend saving your money til' the next day and go to Los Dos Molino's, La Condesa, Carolina's or one of the many other amazing Mexican places that the valley has to offer instead."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritos. They're huge and have the perfect combination in each bite. We loved how you could pick from multiple hot sauce flavors. My burrito was the bacon, egg, cheese and potato. It's usually my go to choice which gives me a standard in which I use to rate which is best. I ate half and saved the other half for dinner which was the perfect amount."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic, tasty, customizable & cheap breakfast burritos.  $4 for an eggless one w/all the veggies they have - super tasty.  Great house-made fresh salsas too - the green is the spiciest of the 3 choices and they're all very good."}
{"text":"Dive Mexican that's delicious when sober. Plus you get authenticity points for going to a place not ending in -berto's.  The chicken is cooked in the sauce. I cannot over-emphasize this point. It is thus properly flavored chicken because it is cooked in the sauce.  Also super-cheap: $7 with drink."}
{"text":"Love the Bacon egg and Cheese Burrito. Reasonably priced and great size can never eat it by myself.  The Buenolas(spelling) are good sweet snack during the day.  Salsa bar offers great selections for your taste!!"}
{"text":"It's everything you can hope for: cheap, fast, and really good. A rather hearty taco was under $2. After the simply OK La Nopalito near my hotel, this was a very welcome surprise. Phoenix doesn't seem to have any specialty besides Mexican or \"Southwestern\" (read: Americanized Mexican). So, I am happy to have had some good Mexican while in town."}
{"text":"Best Huevos Ranchero I have ever had.  Super friendly staff, my food was ready quick, was hot and delicious and well priced for the quality and amount of food.  This will be a favorite of mine once I move to AZ officially."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food! I had the quesadilla & carne asada taco. Both were very tasty. The staff was very friendly as well. I hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab to-go breakfast burritos & enjoyed at a brewery down the road (Wren House). Perfect way to start the day & portions are more than generous. Self-serve condiments bar with fresh cilantro, lemons & salsa."}
{"text":"Had breakfast delish salsicha burrito fresh avo on the side and good hot coffee.  Cant wait to try shrimp ceviche and mojarra.   Free wifi too."}
{"text":"This place is always clean, friendly and prompt. Good people and good food. The thing that makes it stand out is that it is well ran and did I mention clean? It doesn't make you feel they rushed and missed a step just to pump out sloppy orders. They take the time and care. Thanks for the consistency Regio's!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my last trip to Phoenix to try the breakfast burritos. They were pretty awesome - just what I've missed from my childhood in Phoenix. Looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast burrito. I will get it again, simply because it was decent, and this place is on my way to work. Typical Mexican restaurant burrito: eggs, potatoes, bacon, wrapped in a tortilla. It was hot off the grill when I got it, and satisfied my caloric needs for an entire day. $6 well spent."}
{"text":"Very excellent service. Food is delicious, fresh, and finished in a timely manner. Will definitely be returning and letting all of our friends know about this place."}
{"text":"I am a huge supporter of local cuisine that aren't chain restaurants, so I was really craving some Mexican food one day and did NOT want to go to somewhere like Chipotle.   Couple things:  I have a very sensitive stomach.  I don't like spice at all.  I don't speak Spanish at ALL.   So going into Regio's, a very CLEARLY authentic Mexican restaurant (the TV inside is turned to Spanish channels and everyone inside is speaking Spanish), I was a little overwhelmed but curious.   Their menu options are COPIOUS, like, fifty options, and a lot of it I didn't understand. But the man at the counter is incredibly nice, understanding, and explanatory, and he helped me choose some vegetarian options. Let me just say that I got a vegetarian burrito \"wet\" (enchilada style), and not only was it fantastic-tasting, but it lasted me for legitimately three days. HUGE portions, delicious, authentic food and salsa from their salsa bar, I've had no stomach issues and everything seems to be really fresh and high quality.   So if you're looking for something AUTHENTIC, inexpensive, delicious, fresh and with a variety of options and spice levels, I highly recommend. I'll never go to Chipotle again if Regio's is an available option.   **The horchata was a little strange-tasting to me. Not bad, just very cinnamon-y and probably the only thing I felt was \"manufactured/not fresh\" in the whole place.   **Don't try to order from their drive-through; they can't hear you and it's just quicker to go inside. Maybe this is different if you speak Spanish, but he was very confused when I was trying to order haha! But I got to come inside and enjoy the nice decorations and ambiance, so I consider it a good thing."}
{"text":"Food was great very authentic they were a lil stingy on the cheese for the nachos but overall everything was cheap and really good. Also the portions are pewter big well the nachos were huge you can definitely share"}
{"text":"The best breakfast burrito I've ever had (egg, white cheese, and sausage). Worked a different shift for a few weeks, went here for breakfast almost every morning, lol.   Good people, good food, and good price."}
{"text":"Tasty, filing food that leaves a smile on your face and your wallet."}
{"text":"Hate to be negative about a Mexican restaurant. And perhaps I ordered wrong. So I'll just recommend staying away from the chicken unless you prefer dark unidentifiable chunks. Other things not so fresh either. Hey we tried!"}
{"text":"Was just searching for a simple place to eat this placed had alot of good reviews. I just ordered a chorizo and egg burrito and was like dang if this is that good I wonder how great their other food is I will definitely stop again when in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Last week I was craving a breakfast burrito and this came up in my Yelp search within my neighborhood. I've never been to Regio's probably because it's right by the freeway exit so you don't really have a moment to glimpse it.   I probably had one of the biggest breakfast burritos I have ever seen! It was one hot greasy mess--but in a good way. The restaurant was very very generous with the amount of chorizo in my egg, cheese and chorizo burrito. I had enough to split it into two meals. And the burrito only cost a little over $6! I look forward to coming back and trying items like the pozole."}
{"text":"I've lived within a mile of this place for years before checking it out and I wish I had sooner. Best California burrito I've had in my life. My boyfriend gets the breakfast chorizo burrito which is also to die for. They are super friendly and fast- definitely made this a go-to when it comes to fast authentic Mexican food with good service."}
{"text":"If you gave this place anything other than one star you must have been so incredibly drunk and high while you were eating here. This was SIGNIFICANTLY worse than any Filiberto's I have ever been too and that says a lot considering that Filiberto's is only good when you are incredibly drunk and high.  I have a feeling my toilet and I are going to have a great bonding session after eating lunch here. STAY AWAY!"}
