{"text":"This business has gone so far downhill I don't even recognize it.  I used to frequent this bar and it used to be allot of fun.  Stoped by with a friend cuz it's been awhile and we looked at each other and said what a nightmare. There were several customers over-served and  acting somewhat hostile.  Some random old man well into his retirement years walking around telling everyone he was going to sleep with the green hair girl whose ass was hanging out.  I guess North Royalton is well on its way to being the next Detroit."}
{"text":"This is a good low key spot. Not really too crowded, the music isn't too loud (or terrible) and their food is pretty good. Also if youre on a budget this place is a great idea. I'm passed my party days, I just like to relax, with a few friends and beers. All the bartenders have been pretty cool as well."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in Cleveland, hands down. And you can't beat the price on the weekends when they are on special. The service is great and the regulars are friendly. One of our favorite places to go - always a good experience."}
{"text":"Can't beat the wings or steak night. This was my cheers for a long time. Good people, no fights, nice jukebox, pool tables and fair drink prices. There's always people there from the 3rd shifters to the late night crowd."}
{"text":"I love it here- very nice people that make you feel welcome. Love the Keno and the jukebox. The food is great and very reasonable! I also loved the fact it smelled clean. Me and my husband came here twice."}
{"text":"$2.50 steaks on Tuesday & Thursday ! Great deal :) have Jacey make the steaks... Perfection!!"}
{"text":"Very Dive atmosphere, home of a very strong long island ice tea. The food is greasier than I prefer, the atmosphere makes up for it. Bar, booths and pool tables and outdoor area as well. Warm inside during the winter!"}
{"text":"Heck yes. Three and a half years later and this place STILL rocks. Try something from their special Lent menu....I had the cabbage and noodles. WOW! A huge portion of perfectly cooked cabbage, buttery noodles, served with a half order of pierogies and a side of sour cream. Perfect!!!!"}
{"text":"Yikes! Literally, this was like entering the twightlight zone or a time machine. It looks, feels, and smells exactly like someone's basement, but not saying that's a bad thing."}
{"text":"Good food great drinks can't beat the food specials staff is good place can use an update looks like 1970 inside lol"}
