{"text":"This is THE BEST pizza I have EVER HAD!!! Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference. Favourite pizzas are the spicy chicken pizza, the bbq chicken pizza ( with bacon on top) as well as the everything one. The owner does not skip on his toppings and gives generous amounts of everything. Definitely the ONLY place in Markham to get your pizza!!"}
{"text":"Diners beware!  Extremely poor service here.  We placed an order through JustEats but it did not go through.  The kid behind the counter refused to check my order number and simply said they never received it.  He finally called JustEats and said he rejected my order because we tried to abuse the coupon code the past few days.  It was our first time there and only discovered the code today, so it couldn't of been us.  He refused to compare my phone number to the number he claimed made the previous orders.  Anyways, it was a terrible customer service experience and I left empty handed after 20 long minutes at the restaurant.  The kid was rude and unhelpful, and honestly think he made up the excuse because he wanted to close up shop.  It's the last time I'm stepping foot in the restaurant until the service improves, they've got to realize there are TONS of other pizza options around the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"S/W corner of 9th Line / 14th Avenue, this pizza restaurant is hidden in the plaza, away from the main street. It's not a franchise.   I got the large sized Meats Lovers pizza for $12.99 + tax. It was average. I went because I heard they have a good butter chicken pizza but they don't make it anymore."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop restaurant, good service, and decent prices."}
{"text":"It used to be decent before the change in ownership. Dough is pre-made, not a lot of choices in terms of toppings. (no bacon, sausage) I think they only have pepperoni, salami, bbq chicken and ground beef for their meat. The place needs a lot of work. No menu signs just a list of toppings written on a piece of paper plastered on the wall."}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop shop. The pizzas are very good and the pasta is ok (lots of 'make your own' options). Service is friendly and efficient. There are a couple of small tables but it's mostly a take out or delivery joint. Good addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The quality here has gone down significantly after the new owners took over. For $7 you get some penne tossed together with some bottled alfredo sauce and questionable pieces of chicken...well atleast I think it was chicken. They even replaced Coke products with Pepsi...who does that?! I have never tried the pizza but stay away from the pasta. It used to be delicious. Damn shame what they did to that recipe :("}
