{"text":"Service, service, service! Thank you! It could not have been easy to wait on a table of 20, but our Server pulled it off with some help of Jory who was fabulous! 

My Hubs and some of the boys had the chicken and waffles which many of them felt the portion size was not enough. I had one bite of my Hubs meal and then dreamt about it for days after! I had the steak and it was cooked to perfection!

My girlfriend had a martini that tasted \"off\" and sent it back to be replaced, it was probably because the bartender used the shaker for something different before her drink but then she had to wait ALL night for ONE drink. This was not my experience with the wine as I managed to get a few in ;-) 

The decor is beautiful and they have a great vibe going on. Parking is non- existent (as it always is downtown) so be prepared for that. 

The prices are ok, $150 including an 18% automatic gratuity for 2 people with a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"Entered at 1030 pm for the bar downstairs.  The DJ was decent, playing hip hop, trap, and some mainstream EDM.  The crowd was friendly, good looking, late 20s to early 30s, and employed.  

It was busy enough, and I could get around - I like that.  The dance floor is the right size for this kind of place - not too big, and people were using it.  My only complaint is that the music is really loud even when you were at the back bar and tables. 

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure why this place was completely dead on a Friday night, but getting here at 11 pm to a completely empty dance floor downstairs (There were probably 10 other people) was insanely disappointing. 

The upside was I came in a group of around 30 people so we were like \"hey, let's just make the best of it.\" So we did indeed dance a little regardless of being the only ones on the empty dance floor...

The DJ was playing good music but did not know how to transition at all. As someone who goes out primarily to dance, this was a bummer. Not to mention we were there to celebrate so when the bass didn't drop well, feelings of disappointment rushed through my spine. It really is shame that the place was dead-empty because the jams were really good, had the transitions been better and the place been packed it may have been a good night except-

One of the bartenders drugged a friend's shot. 

I have no experience with the food or restaurant service of this place but this is NOT  a place I would come to party again. 

Bouncer was nice though."}
{"text":"I've become somewhat of a regular for Wine Wednesdays, and must acknowledge the great customer service.  Once, they brought a cheese plate that was straight out of a 1970's woman's weekly.  We were starving and so reluctantly accepted it.  The manager came over a few minutes later, aghast at the presentation and got us a new one for free. On another occasion, the poutine came out cold.  We mentioned it to the server when she came to check on things, and she apologetically whisked it away for a replacement that was fresh AND oven-warmed.  The servers are obviously given discretion here to make things right, and the managers focused on customer experience, which is sorely lacking in many restaurants these days. And, they've changed the live entertainment on Wednesdays from a passable duo to a good soulful guy."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation at 5:30pm.  When I went to the restaurant, they acknowledged that I had made the reservation but they told me they did not have a table available.  The fact that this restaurant does not understand the concept of a reservation is mind blowing.  I had to wait around at the bar, and was pretty much ignored by all staff until they finally had a table for me over an hour later.  
I figured once I was seated at the table, the abysmal service would improve but I had to wait for almost 30 minutes before the waitress who did not seem to care about her job came to take our order.  I ordered the vegetarian burger and when it finally did come out, it was the mushiest most bland burger I have ever tasted.

Based on the absolutely sub standard service and the extremely low quality food, I would not recommend this place to anyone.  There are far better restaurants that serve the same type of food with better service for far less money."}
{"text":"Only option for Vegans is salad and fries. Yawn! Beet salad without the cheese. Interesting as the beets are served warm. Tasty and interesting. Fries are nothing spectacular. Trying this place once was enough. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst attempt at a club ever. Literally kicked people out of a booth because of reservations and had a bouncer guard it for bottle service and remains empty. Weird no one jumping on $500 a bottle. 
Empty Empty Empty and yet have a faux line.
I remember West pulling this shit. And then they closed. No wonder some of the staff are from there!
Buddy had no line no cover for his bday here til 1030 and at 10 they had a line and charged cover for the guests when it was DEAD. 
Save your money and go to a real club. 
Only people that think this is cool look to be 18 an eventually they will learn."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people who wouldn't set foot in this establishment but unfortunately i had to experience it for myself.  The service was beyond horrendous, the food avg at best, and let me not even speak of the 'nightly entertainment.'  After night this place turns into a meat market but despite that it seemed this particular evening there was more bouncers there than actual patrons.  I have nothing good to say about this joke of an establishment and I'm bewildered that it's still operating."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a post flight lunch. Ended up grabbing the roasted vegetable flatbread and the ahi tuna focaccia for my dining partner. 

The service is fairly good considering they were just opening so they were slow to start. The food was a definite hit very filling. Couldn't even finish the full flatbread and the tuna was very rich due to the aioli drizzled over. Would go there again if I could afford it on a student budget =\"}
{"text":"Came here for a mid week lunch, around 12:30. The service was a little slow pre-ordering but after that was crazy fast - I was impressed at how fast our burgers came out after ordering - and everything was cooked to perfection. I had the cowtown burger with onion rings (because when you are going to eat a burger, go full  fat-out, right?). Both were great and I found the portions to be good...substantial but not so huge that I couldn't finish or felt gross after. Its a great downtown lunch spot for sure. Prices seemed a smidge high but the quality was certainly there.

I'm glad I checked it out and will probably be back."}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday night for a chilled out dinner with a friend and the place was pretty quiet so we were able to grab one of the booth tables. I really liked the layout and design of the place, and it was great to be somewhere more upmarket but casual where you can easily have a conversation. The main let downs for me were the service and the food. None of it was bad, but just not great and as a burger lover, I'd probably venture elsewhere for my next gourmet burger in Calgary. 

The server took quite a while (5-10 minutes) to come over for a drink order - not a long time in the scheme of things but given how quiet it was there was no real reason for it to take that long. She also took quite a while to bring us the drinks, never brought cutlery or napkins (we stole them from another table) and only asked how the food was right when we were almost finished.

Being a big bacon and blue cheese lover I chose the 'bacon and blue' burger, which had bacon and blue cheese in the patty. Disappointingly I couldn't taste the blue cheese and the only bacon taste was from the bacon on the burger. I really wanted the blue cheese to smack me in the face! Having said that, the burger meat was obviously good quality and still a good burger overall, but I'm not sure it was worth $18. I also asked for a jalape√±o popper to be added to mine which was forgotten, but the server was nowhere to be seen until I had two bites left.

I liked that the burgers came with a choice of sides, which from memory were onion rings, soup, fries and parmesan and truffle fries. I tried the Parmesan and truffle fries and my friend tried the soup. The fries were good in theory but seemed to have too much truffle oil in comparison to the amount of Parmesan. Can there be too much truffle oil you ask? Well, turns out there can be. Plus the ketchup that came with the fries had a skin on the top that required me to remove half of the 'sauce' to reach the liquid sauce and dip my fries in. The soup (some kind of coconut chowder) didn't go down that well either and my friend left about half of it.

They had a good range of food on the menu if you aren't a burger lover, and we opted for their house red ($7 glass/$30 bottle) which was pretty good. They also has a $3 slider special on the blackboard outside, with a minimum of three sliders. Turns out this is their 'Burger Flight' option on the menu, which is normally $14 for three sliders. You can also choose from the three burger types included if you want more of one of them."}
{"text":"I've been to Black Betty before and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food (the sliders are delicious) and the drinks. The service was fairly slow, but since my visit was during the first two weeks of them opening, I gave it a pass. 

However, I recently went back, hoping to have another great meal with drinks, but instead I was left completely aggravated with the service, so much so that I actually got up and walked out. Our server was so terribly slow and uninterested in being there, that after an hour and a half of sitting down I had only had one drink because the server never bothered to check up on our table. It seems Black Betty has not improved on its quality of service, mainly its quality of servers.

As well, I was hoping to order a glass of the wine I had last time, however the server explained they were out of it. So, I decided on a different glass of wine and what I got was something that tasted like grape juice. I've never been so disappointed in a glass of wine. For a place to label themselves a winebar, and to have such a small wine menu, you'd think they could keep on top of their stock and at the same time make sure they've got quality wine on it too."}
{"text":"After attending a friend's birthday party on a Friday night at Black Betty, I was excited to give the restaurant a try during daylight hours. It's a cool venue with an edgy pinup girl theme. I made a lunch reservation for a friend & I, and she told me the food at the restaurant was excellent. I was so excited to eat here, it's a shame it turned out to be one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Things started out fine: we were seated and greeted by our server, who took our order in a timely manner... and then disappeared never to be seen again. After 25 minutes we needed water refills and were curious where our food was, so I stopped another server walking by and asked if she could check on it. She came back and said it was coming out \"right away\". It didn't. After 15 more minutes I stopped a third server and asked if she could check because at this point both my friend and I wanted to walk out, but we were so upset we wanted to let the staff know how deadly incompetent they are before we left. 5 minutes later a manager came to the table with our order... which we had to ask her put immediately into to-go boxes as waiting for our meal took our ENTIRE LUNCH BREAK. My friend and I had just spent the past 50 minutes sitting in Black Betty with empty glasses waiting for food. What even is that? How does that happen? Was our waitress kidnapped mid-shift??? Our food was comp'd but after more than an hour of waiting for it that was hardly any consolation. I took my burger back to my office and bit into it at 1:30 pm only to find the bun untoasted and the burger itself unimpressive. My friend immediately texted me to say hers was RAW. What the hell, Black Betty? How can you have \"Burger\" in your restaurant name and do this so poorly?! Needless to say, I'm never coming back here and you should skip it as well. There's a McDonald's on Stephen Avenue that will give you a better tasting burger (cooked through!) and within minutes."}
{"text":"I'm really not shocked to read negative reviews about the service at this place.  I've been here twice now; once for dinner and another time on a Saturday night for drinks and dancing.  The food was decent our first time here but our hostess couldn't have cared less when she seated us.  Our drinks were slow to arrive and the service mediocre.  We went back to check out what the late-night scene was all about this past Saturday.  A group of us sat down at a table upstairs and received no attention from anyone.  I decided to go up to the bar.  The two girls behind the bar were the absolute WORST bartenders I've ever encountered!  One completely ignored me as I stood there for 10mins waiting to place my order, preferring to serve others who came up after me or not serving at all.  When I finally placed my order with the other server, it took another 15mins to get my drink!  My husband went up shortly after and received the exact same level of service.  He finally gave up, went downstairs and came back 2mins later with his drinks.  I couldn't believe how terribly we were treated!  We hit the dance floor shortly after and the music was okay, but overall I'm not so impressed with Black Betty and will be spending my cash elsewhere."}
{"text":"Want to make a water engineer angry (my buddy)? Don't tell them you charge for tap water upfront, charge them after the fact and explain to them that you have the great filtration system (Q Filtering). Its not that fact that Calgary has exceptional water which the Q Filtering does nothing to enhance (according to him) but more that this charge was not explained up front. We were there for lunch and the food was very good and the service was fine but it was overshadowed by this non-sense."}
{"text":"I've been to Black Betty a couple times now and I always enjoy the atmosphere.  The staff is great.  Love the decor and colours of the place.

We recently went there with a group of 11 of us for my birthday dinner and drinks.  The first thing the hostess said to me was \"You look like you fit right in at this place.\" This was a huge compliment to me... all dolled up in a red pin up dress and super high heels.  That just earned you another star!

The service was good.  It was slow that night as the weather sucked so everything was served pretty quickly.  Drinks were flowing.  Dinner was good.  I was very sad to learn that they'd removed their Mac n Cheese.  I had my heart set on it.  Instead I settled for the fettuccine carbonara which was really good too.  It wasn't the mac n cheese I really wanted, but yummy just the same.  In fact all the food looked delicious. I almost wished I'd went with a burger and soup.  Almost.

One minor complaint was that some of our food was on the not so warm side.  It was a big group and to get all the food out at the same time I suppose there was a risk for this. 

One huge kudos to them was there was no gratuity fee on the check.  We were over 8 or 10 people which is when I typically see the 18% gratuity fee added in.  There was none.  This gave us control and encouraged us to tip above and beyond.  

I will happily go back in the future.  It was a great setting for a group our size and they were great with booking and confirming the reservation."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, restaurants. If you're going to charge me extra for dip that you squeeze out of a bottle (not one you make from scratch), because I'm allergic to the one you provide and MUST ask you for an alternate, I'm auto-docking 2 stars. Shady shade.

While I'm grateful that you do provide a hot sauce that isn't Frank's Red Hot (barf), I'm immediately judgmental of you for this flagrant excuse to sell something with 1000% markup. Especially, when the waitress does not notify me right away that this is going to be an extra charge, and I get surprised with it on the bill at the end of my visit.

Like Loungeburger, Black Betty's veggie burger is a Portobello Mushroom Cap, which is fine by me, as this eliminates the concern for what exactly went in to the patty. Their yam fries are pretty good too, and they took care to make sure the other person at the table with a dairy allergy was well cared for.

Service was friendly and prompt, bathrooms are clean, and the music is kept low enough that I can conversate with my friends. If they got rid of their stupid dip charge, I'd be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is permanently closed.  Don't waste your time looking for it like I did."}
{"text":"I tried this place for a friends going away party when it first opened. My first impression was terrible. They put us in a dark corner in the basement, they didn't have half the menu available, my food was burnt, the only thing that was good was the service. 

I had the opportunity to go again, this time for a friends stagette. It was wonderful. Again, our server Natasha was awesome, took great care of us. Our food was delicious and were able to accommodate a late comer so she could eat with us. And end of the night our bill was very reasonable. I'm glad I was able to try it again and I will be back."}
{"text":"Went there for a work function and wasn't really impressed with the bar tenders.  They were slow to take drink orders, even though they weren't busy at all, and on top of it somewhat obnoxious and disrespectful.    

I would not recommend this place and have no desire to ever go there again."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here today! Made even better by the fact that they're on open table!

I was sad to be Sociale go, but Black Betty is a good replacement. I had the lobster grilled cheese - yum! Why didn't anyone think of this sooner?!? Good menu, fast service.

My only comments for improvement: #1: Tidy up your waitresses, and more importantly #2: You need a better selection of craft beers and less plain old bottled domestics."}
{"text":"A great place to be seen...a combination of contemporary yet gothic in some way...

I'd come again for the food, but here for the drinks, good bar.

downstairs also available too.

Located right in DT."}
{"text":"Kind of a weird place for dinner. This establishment seems to be having an identity crisis -- it's an odd mix of bar/music venue/lounge and the restaurant portion of things seems to be almost an afterthought, which would be fine if the prices were cheaper. 

Considering that the specialty here is a burger, and there are numerous different types on the menu, the burger was really not that good. The server didn't ask how I wanted the burger cooked, which was sort of odd but I didn't realize it till I was already biting into my overcooked burger. The onion rings on the side were the best part of the meal. The burger itself was overseasoned and expensive. The place was relatively empty at 7:30 pm on a weeknight which gave off a weird, creepy vibe. Service was friendly but lacked attention to detail -- one of the diners in our party received his meal 25 minutes after everyone else.

I would not plan to eat here again if in Calgary -- there are better options downtown."}
{"text":"I've been here over 3 times and each time, the service has been average at best.

Come on guys. Get with the program. 

Service is quite slow and trying to flag down someone during lunch hour is like trying to find a taxi during the Stampede.

The burger is all right. It's more of a business lunch spot and even then, not sure why we keep coming here."}
{"text":"Black Betty has a great atmosphere with a dark, red and black interior. 
Chic cheetah print and leather chairs make for a location that both women and men will love.

I visited BB for lunch and was very happy with my meal.

I ordered the New Classic Grilled Cheese and was impressed with the flavourful rye bread that it was served on and the delicious house salad that accompanied it. 
My friend ordered the Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese and it was equally as great! 

We subsituted his side for poutine, which we asked for to come out first. It didn't make it out until after our food was served. However, to our surprise, we were told we were not charged for the poutine becasue it didn't come out when it was suppsed to!

THAT was a great surprise. Along with the exceptional service, fantastic food and sexy atmosphere, I give Black Betty 5 stars. 

I will be returning for the malt shakes and caesars!"}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good.  The servers are nice and attentive, atmosphere was OK.  It's a great place to bring people from out of town, instead of the usual pub.  Or, it's a good place to bring clients."}
{"text":"Great wine.... Delicious onion rings and very good burgers... The wine was great as well and the service very friendly!! The ambience is also very cool if you go with a group of friends... I think I would go back there! I had a great time!"}
