{"text":"I love their mazapan drink & their chorizo with queso fondido I love this place & I live right down the street! Great place"}
{"text":"The salsa was the only thing worth raving about. We sat outside and it took an hour to get our food (when there were only two other tables) and the server walked away before we could even ask for silverware and napkins. The service was very, very poor. The server told us we didn't get our food as fast bc we sat outside. Had we known service would be so poor we would have sat inside. If your server has to tell you three times your food should be coming out soon, that's a sign that your service will be impacted. I was patient, but by our 2nd round of chips I was over it. Either way you can go to La Santisima or Cafe Barrio for better service, prices and food."}
{"text":"What a cute and cozy place !! Decor and style of restaurant is great . The waitress was really nice and friendly:)  Michelada's on point ! The food very delicious and good size portions, I will definitely come back and try more of the menu"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and staff is very nice. The need to brew fresh tea and not use tea from the soda machine. Ask about the pineapple salsa. It is on the bar but is hard to identify as pineapple, it is brownish and pur√©ed."}
{"text":"My sons and I had the distinct pleasure of dining at Casa Corazon tonight. From the warm greeting upon arrival, choice of patio or elegant and classy inside seating, distinctly non-typical Mexican cuisine and sparkling clean open kitchen, all indications were that we found a new Phoenix gem.  We were greeted with warm (freshly made) tortilla chips and visited the salsa bar featuring  many choices and unique tastes.   For the main attraction we enjoyed the Coachanita Pibil, Stuffed Poblano and a wonderful Flat Iron Mexican Style Steak. All are served elegantly on a banana leaf and served with a wonderful side of black beans and rice. All were simply fantastic!   The owner (Javier), his brother and Lorena (our server) exuded genuine friendliness, making us feel at home despite our arrival 30 minutes before closing.  To top it all off, they even accommodated Buddy our furry friend, as we sat outside on the patio. Since I forgot Buddy's leash. We almost passed on the Casa. In the end, Javier, who himself was enjoying dinner on the patio, produced a leash so we could all relax and enjoy the night.  For many reasons. I can't wait to visit the Casa again. Give it a try. I think you'll become a fan as well."}
{"text":"Lovely ambience; wonderfully restored historical building, mixing old with modern. Great salsa bar; amazing variety with great flavors.   Many of the dishes are rather unique & interesting. Not your traditional Sonoran dishes; much more unique. Foot items appear to be of high quality. Our two dishes Again had unique sauces, but a bit heavy in taste.   They have only been open 10 days & the grand opening is Sunday. They are fine tuning things & I think they will with the menu too.   We definitely will return and see what it will be like in the weeks & months to come.   Wishing the owners & employees the best of luck!!"}
{"text":"Thank you, very nice, food excellent , peole were nice! Great music. Enjoable afternoon."}
{"text":"Drove by yesterday and decided to give it a try. Very happy we did. Great service. Great food. Great salsa bar and the presentation was exceptional.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"We needed a place to stop on the way to the airport, and we wanted something that was more restaurant than taqueria but good, authentic Mexican food. Yelp steered us to Casa Corazon, and it did not disappoint! An open kitchen and an extensive salsa bar greet you when you enter, and the staff was welcoming and helpful. The food was fantastic, we had the cochinita pibil, ceviche, and guacamole, and all were excellent. Ceviche and guacamole were fresh, perfectly seasoned, and delicious. The pork was hands down the best I've had of that dish. Sadly we don't live in Phoenix, or I'd be here weekly! We'll be back next time we visit, though. This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Have been passing this new establishment for more than a month now and finally came here for a happy hour! Plenty of parking, lovely spacious decor. The place was very clean! We were greeted by a pleasant waitress and were seated immediately. We just had drinks and their ceviche. I look forward to returning here for dinner!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how cute the interior of this place is. We loved the salsa bar (the pineapple one was my favorite). My husband got street tacos and I got chicken tinga. We were both pleased with our meals, and with the polite and personal service staff. We'll be back."}
{"text":"By far the best burrito I've had. Great salsa bar as well. Casual dining. Little house converted to a restaurant. Parking in the back. We went at 2pm not packed but full of people. Good service. We would make the extra effort to go again ( it's not close to our home)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, friendly staff, spacious dining area. The house margaritas are the best. I know where I'm talking my live on a date"}
{"text":"Whoa!! Super cute  amazing new restaurant,customer service is  amazing! cocktails are phenomenal! food super delicious! if  you're looking for Mexican food and craving it this is the spot!  Great for date night too!"}
{"text":"Wow - this place is amazing!  We made a reservation for dinner last Friday night and had a great experience.  I enjoyed a Jamaica agua fresca, shared the delicious (and very large) queso fundido and the cheese enchiladas with red sauce for my entree.  I love that they have a salsa bar, so you can select the level of heat that works for you...and try a few different things to see what tastes best to you.    The service was very professional and friendly and the restaurant is nicely decorated - classy and comfortable all at the same time!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I found a great restaurant near me! The place is very nice. The food was delicious! Service was great! They have a nice bar which also opens up to the outside patio. Great food great drinks! Congratulations to the owner for a fantastic experience I had t"}
{"text":"Came to try this place during the lunch hour around 12:10pm and waited for our food for little over an hour. There were only three tables when we arrived and around 12:40 the first table of the three was served.  By 1pm we asked our waitress how much longer did we have to wait and she went to check with the kitchen. Meanwhile, another worker came out, not sure if he was the manager but said that our food would be ready in five minutes. We asked for the order to go and didn't get our order until 1:20. I was really looking forward to trying this new spot but i was very disappointed with the experience. Will not be going back. Here is picture of what i waited for a little over an hour. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried Casa Corazon during Arizona Restaurant Week...and this place is now one of my top 5 places in Phoenix. The service, atmosphere, and food was amazing. We started with chips and our choice of salsas. My favorite was the Salsa Verde. We steered off the AZ Restaurant Week menu and got queso fundido with chorizo - delicious with the homemade tortillas - main coarse - I got steak enchiladas with the beet and chili sauce. Husband got the steak... then we ended with churros!"}
{"text":"This my new go to restaurant.  The food is fantastic and the service splendid.  The salsa bar is incredible as are the house made chips and tortillas."}
{"text":"What a great experience! We went for AZ Restaurant Week and could not have been taken care of better. The atmosphere is charming, the salsa bar offers variety, the drinks are on point, and the food was divine. Wow! To say the least. When we entered it was empty but quickly filled up with lots of other patrons. Many wishes for much continued success to Casa Corazon. You deserve it!"}
{"text":"Tonight visited this new spot and it did not disappoint. The food was delicious. Plus I love the salsa bar. The decor is very traditional to Mexican culture and I love that they place Mexican pop music. The only thing that wasn't to my liking was the guacamole, I believe they put cranberries which makes it sweet and it did not have enough salt, I just prefer the traditional style guacamole. But other than that everything was great. I wish this business good fortune."}
{"text":"Really great service and delicious food. Went for restaurant week and it was a good deal. So close to home, we will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick escape out of the country this place has your number. Open only a few weeks Casa Corazon makes you feel like your near a beach somewhere in Mexico or Cuba. Live Spanish music every Friday night. Songs from Cuba, Columbia, Mexico and beyond played on the patio. The food is great by the way too. The beef Flautas here were ridiculously flavorful! The Pollo Quesadilla hit the spot. My Margarita was on point with a generous pour of top self tequila. Love everything about this place from the family staff to the cute little salsa bar! Consider me a Friday night regular if things stay this good!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Interior mimics the old world feel with exposed bricks and cracking white plaster. Artistic wood paneling on the ceiling. All in all gives the place a trendy/urban feel. Has about twenty tables inside and a small patio.  Food: While the lunch menu was on the short side (currently only enchiladas, burritos, flautas, and goriditas) it was dam good! I went with the chicken flautas and they were really good. The tortilla was deep fried perfectly and the green Chile sauce hit the spot. Others in my party said the enchiladas were some of the best they've had in a while. The chips and salsa bar were especially good! Lot's of different sauces to choose from including one with pineapple.  Service/Price: Very attentive service. No lines to speak of. Price is on the higher side but to be expected in a trendy spot such as this.  Summary: Definitely recommend this spot and hope to see their lunch menu expanded."}
{"text":"The food and service was fantastic! Very fresh and quality ingredients. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was delicious! The fresh salsa bar, freshly made tortilla chips that were still warm and house margarita with unique flavors were all delicious! The staff was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere of the restaurant was unique very tastefully done. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks! We had the enchiladas and Chile releno Christmas style. Both were off the charts! The red sauce was cream based and soooo good. The space, previously a house, has beautiful exposed brick and immaculate kitchen. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't rate the food because we left.  Very cute place, and the hostess was friendly, but $18.00 for a lunch plate of enchiladas is WAY too much!!  They need to re-evaluate their menu.  It's very confusing, and seemed limited.  They might be better suited for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I visited Casa Corazon for the first time last night. First of all, fell in love with the decor. Super cute. Great music as well and not playing loud which I appreciate when having dinner. I ordered the Mole Poblano and it was delicious! Great service as well. Will definitely be back to try other things and hopefully dessert!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend live five minutes from here and finally made it out tonight. I got the steak with nopal and she ordered the beef enchiladas with the Corazon Beet yes BEET chili sauce and it was as good as it was unique. Definitely coming back! And great warm intimate environment!"}
{"text":"Ended up finding this great spot tonight while on a business trip.  Absolutely hands down one of the better Mexican food restaurants I've been to lately. Great food, decor, amazing staff, and the salsa bar, mm!    The enchiladas were outstanding, and I have to say, try all three sauces(red, green, and beet)!  I highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Yes, the salsa bar and home-made chips are excellent...unfortunately that's all we experienced after a 20 min wait.  We'll try again once they have a full staff.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Fist time here, I believe this place hasn't been open too long and I highly recommended it! They have a salsa bar (self serve) very good selection, we order the queso fundido and it was delicious, I ordered the veggie sopes and they were really good also just a bit salty but nothing that I couldn't eat and my friend ordered the Chile en nogada and he was very happy with it! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously great from the service to the food. Went here today for the first time and everyone was so welcoming. Henry was our server and explained everything to the T. Loved it, we will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great service. Clean and comfortable.  My new favorite Mexican resturant"}
{"text":"Received a notification from Yelp telling me there was a new restaurant in my area. Well i must say it was really good. The decor is fantastic the atmosphere is great and the best part the food is delicious and huge amounts of it!   I had the enchiladas Christmas style which were delicious. One beef and two chicken (yummy). Also had the flautas which there are two of them (huge). Yummy!  I ordered a margarita (straying pour! Which makes it even better.   The restaurant is modern.   I would/will comeback."}
{"text":"We got back into Phoenix from Utah around 1pm on a Saturday. We originally planned to eat at little miss bbq, but omg the line was so long we did not have time to wait. Next up, Casa Corazon! About a 10 min drive from the bbq place.   Very hard to miss. They stand out with the color of their building, I think pink. They have their own parking lot (always a plus!) and the entrance was a bit odd because we thought we walked into the kitchen lol. They directed us to the next room and told us any table. They interior is not something I was expecting, not that I was expecting anything.   The waitress greeted us immediate and provided water a few mins after. A few mins later she provided a bowl/tray of fresh chips for salsa. They have a salsa bar with a variety of sauces (another plus!).  We ordered the ceviche (really good) which can be shared cause it's pretty big for one person unless you have an appetite. I ordered the steak burrito (steak was very well marinated and delicious), my friends ordered gorditas and flautas. They enjoyed their order as well.   What caught us by surprise was that they had only been open for 12 days!!! I'm glad their off to a good start with the delicious food they provided! Everything seemed to be made from scratch too. Would come back here."}
{"text":"The food, service and ambiance is off the chart at Casa Corazon. The salsa bar is amazing! The pineapple and jalapeno salsa's were delicious and I had to stop myself from wanting to drink it with a straw!!  I had the the Chile Relleno's which came with 3 stuffed poblano peppers. I got the red and green sauce and both were delicious. The homemade corn tortillas are the best I have ever had.   Going to be in town for a few more days and I can definitely see having dinner here everyday in my future!!"}
{"text":"$10 for all this food!!! It was delicious, homemade tortillas!! I'm in love, the salsa bar was amazing so many flavors. I never visit a new place within the first month of opening since they are working out the kinks but food was great. Service a bit slow as they are new but I'm certain it will get better. I will be back for their Sunday grand opening. I couldn't stay as they have a salsa band playing tonight so wish I would have known."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent huge margaritas, and good fast service. Great little restaurant with a salsa bar can sit in or outside. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Cute place with delicious food. Had the chile relleno and a traditional margarita. The chips and salsa bar were a tasty treat, enjoyed the variety of salsas, especially the creamy jalape√±o. The service was friendly and attentive. I am looking forward to returning to try the street corn."}
{"text":"We unfortunately just had one of the worst restaurant experiences we've had in a long time. The first of which started with our server taking over 15 minutes to even greet our table. If they were busy this would've been understandable, but they weren't even at half capacity. He took our order, or so we thought, and things got worse. 30 minutes afterwards, he approached our table and asked \"what did you order again?\", and disappeared again. We began noticing that tables that were seated 30-45 minutes after us were getting their food. The server obviously forgot to put our order in. Mistakes happen and it's understandable, but the fact that he couldn't even own up to his mistake and just tell us that he forgot about our order instead of asking what we ordered again is so disrespectful. An hour and fifteen minutes after we ordered passed and there was still no sign of our food or any acknowledgment or apologies about what was going on. We asked for our check for the drinks and left. Unfortunately the only apology we received was as we were leaving. I'm sure the food is wonderful and that everyone working there are as well.  I hope that they can get it together as they would be a great addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped for quick lunch. Really great chips with excellent salsa bar. The creamy jalapeno was really good.  Marlin tacos were amazing! Making this part of my regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"Service was great. Fast and responsive. Made my Spivey margarita perfectly and off menu. Food was amazing.  Steak was cooked perfectly. The corn tortillas rocked !   First time here, but I will be coming back.  Great food. Superb tastes and easy prices."}
{"text":"Loved the Gorditas! Excellent salsa bar.  Great atmosphere and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Oh dear.  Heard great things about this place.  The good:  cute place, nice service.  The bad:  my $15 chile relleno plate  consisted of two very skinny hatch chiles, some black beans and some white rice.  The waiter showed me the size of the chiles with his hands and it turned out he overestimated by 50 percent!  The rellenos were not dipped in anything or fried. More like an appitizer than a meal for that much money.  My friends had a bowl of soup, which she liked, and a taco platter which was also good.  I would recommend reducing the price of the chilies or changing the preparation and size; Im still hungry!"}
{"text":"Totally loved this place .. beautiful old building with a limited but full of flavor menu..   On my recent visit we enjoyed the shrimp ceviche appetizer.. lots of flavor, diced cucumber, tomato, red onion.. lots of citrus (lemon/lime/both?) very good.. and definitely big enough to share .. comes with three tostadas made in house ..($12)  I had the steak fajitas with no sides because I ate so many chips with the ceviche.. it does come with rice & beans and three homemade corn tortillas.. the steak was not all sliced the same size but that didn't take away from how tender the meat was, the grilled veggies were nicely caramelized (bell peppers & onion). ($10.50/ lunch menu)  The salsa bar had a nice variety of mild and hot salsa.. pico de Gallo and this tasty mango salsa.. all made fresh daily.. there were 8 options on today's visit. Chips were also homemade and delish!!   We were also treated with agua de mazapan (like the Mexican candy) but in a cup, similar to horchata but different .. this is going on the menu soon.. I'd totally have this with rum for a refreshing summer drink!!  Jazel was our waitress and even though it was her first day she was great.. she took excellent care of us.. we will see you next time for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food not tex-mex style. the cochinita pibil is a must. Service was great. Must try"}
{"text":"You've got to try this wonderful place. Great Ambiance, excellent service, Gourmet Mexican.  It's classy, shiny clean, terrific food.   This is not your ordinary Mexican food.  It is extraordinary. You will not be disappointed, this is the Mexican food I've been looking for since I first returned to this part of the country 8 years ago."}
{"text":"Chips were good and salsa bar was satisfactory.   Margarita was just ok. Rice was really good and so was heir quesadilla.  Gordita was good but a lil salty.  The posole was also good and a good portion size."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing and if you like enchiladas make sure you try the enchiladas corazon! They have beet (yes you read that right) in the sauce which gives it a pink color. It's truly the best enchiladas ever!"}
{"text":"Our experience was bad.Wife and I visited on sunday morning for breakfast.To begin with the menu has only seven items and NO PRICES.WHaaat! The menu had crapes.This is a restaurant that trys too hard to be avant gard,No way! Also the napkins were bandanas.yup bandanas.The kind workers use to wipe off sweat.The tables were dirty and the water offered tasted like tap water.We ordered coffee and received something akin to tepid water..nasty..I commented to waitress that the menu was incomplete and the offerings didnt even have sides that came with the entrees and she started to tell us what came with them.NO prices.Bandanas.bad water.Dirty tables.No way no how.Get down to earth and make it a real mexican restaurant.Stop being pretencious.It has potential.Sorry just being honest."}
{"text":"This place is amazing great service awsome food and its gorgeous inside w exposed brick... we had the camarone de ranchero and the steak mexicano both were amazing..also the jamica comes w fruit in it and the agua de mazapan is like nothing uve ever had... all around great will deff go back"}
{"text":"Our first time here and gotta say it was pretty good. A little on the pricey side compare to other Mexican restaurants but the food is delicious. You can taste the freshness in the food. They make their own home made tortillas as well. I recommend their ceviche as well as their mazap√°n water both are delicious"}
{"text":"Food is great! SERVICE is HORRIBLE! Takes forever for drinks. Bring your own water if you want more than one glass. Atmosphere is enjoyable"}
{"text":"The Agua Mazapan is like drinking a Snickers! Tacos and gorditas with handmade tortillas.. agua de Jamaica that looks like a fancy daquiri but tastes better. Amazing salsa bar. Not cheap but you get what you pay for. Beans and rice were tender and had a good flavor balance. Great service, beautiful dining area."}
{"text":"I've had the enchiladas and the ceviche and I am not disappointed.  Very tasty and unique flavor.  I also enjoyed a few drinks I must say the michelada was my favorite, Maybe a bit pricey but totally worth it.  The place is clean and service is not bad at all."}
{"text":"This is an EXCEPTIONAL restaurant. I had the chicken enchiladas with red sauce and my wife had the chile rellenos. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. And OMG the fresh salsa bar! Don't miss this dining experience!"}
{"text":"We tried out this place since it has opened a couple of times. Great service but they are still getting setup so they need some streamlining to do with pacing. I am not a big fan of their salsa bar options but they make up for it on other things.  Positives: Ceviche is quality chicken flautas with green sauce, although I wish the tortilla was thinner chorizo and potatoes are the best I have had anywhere chili relleno has the best sauce on it and the best I have had in memory wait staff  negatives: salsa( im warming up to the serrano and chipotle but still) tacos lack toppings so they come off plain gorditas are thin, though my wife loved them food seems to come out slow, this could be growing pains though, they just opened  I think I will get the green enchiladas with chicken next time since the sauce they use on the flautas is tasty.  (update) They were ok, I always am on a search for the greatest green chicken enchiladas but I will keep searching. They do however make a good burrito though.  I didnt get to try their unique beet sauce enchiladas but I will some day."}
{"text":"Ok not impressed with the uncle bens rice and the black beans from a can. Beer was warm service not so great and the food I give it a c+ won't go back I want my money back I could have got better food from a taco truck."}
{"text":"I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars after a first visit, even if the experience was great. 5 stars usually merits a 2nd or 3rd visit. However, my first visit at Casa Corazon was truly exceptional. I know what you might be thinking - yet another Mexican restaurant on 16th street. There is one about every 15 feet and competition is fierce. Casa Corazon offers something a little different. It has a classy-casual atmosphere that is perfect for just popping in or for a special occasion. The decor is clean, bright, & welcoming.. We had the shrimp ceviche and the flautas, which come with complimentary tortilla chips and salsa. I tried about 5 of the salsas at the salsa bar and they were all great - especially the pineapple, which I am not usually a fan of. There were about 15 salsas to choose from as you please throughout your meal. Our server, Henry, was fantastic. He was so friendly and attentive that I'm pretty sure my mom will want to come back just to see him! The ceviche was delicious. It has a nice clean taste to it with a little something special (celery salt?). I love the jicama in there as well. The flautas are large and hearty with more of a chimichanga texture (possibly made with flour vs corn). The green sauce that accompanied them was so flavorful and I used it on just about everything. It came with black beans and rice - also delicious. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff! P.S. The house marg was also a winner!!"}
