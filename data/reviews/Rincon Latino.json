{"text":"First time trying pupusas from Rincon Latino. It's a little local El Salvadorian shop; nothing fancy and limited seating. Food took a while to arrive, however, the pupusas were well worth the wait. We got queso y loroco and it was awesome. 

Pupusas are $2.50 each.

I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Tried this little restaurant and Salvadorian food the first time. The price is reasonable and is authentic central american. Will come back again. Yes, it was my first time to try pupusas, and it's worth the wait to have the food prepared from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Easily my fav Pupusas in Toronto! Even their curtido is amazing. HOWEVER, half the time I go there, it's closed and the outside parking lot is always littered with trash. It's such a shame because their food is so great."}
