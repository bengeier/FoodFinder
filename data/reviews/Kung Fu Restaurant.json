{"text":"We were the only table being served at the time and the wrong appetizer was brought to the table. By the time the appetizer was brought out the entrees were ready and had been sitting for a while and were almost cold. All of the dishes we ordered were bland and overcooked. Very overpriced for the quality of the food. We will not be returning a second time."}
{"text":"Bad customer service - I ordered my food by phone with the girl that answered and she said my order would be ready in 20 minutes. When I arrived and gave my phone the girl ( who took my order on the phone) says she doesn't have that number. I told her I had talked to her 20 -25 minutes before and she took it. She then says \"are you sure it was this restaurant\" \"yes I know I called King Fu from my home phone\" she then proceeded to list off all the numbers she had by mine wasn't one if them..... Basically calling me a liar. I said its there somewhere and gave her my list again but she wasn't listening as she said again  I didn't order anything there. Well I told them when they do find it, I am not coming to pick it up. Her \"we don't have it\" never again will I order there.  To prove a point my husband hit redial on the phone and it rang at Kung Fu! So not 5 minutes after I left Kung Fu called. They said they found my order if I'd like to pick it up. \"No\" was our response. If you call me a liar why would I ever want bad customer service from you again."}
{"text":"This is the best ginger beef ever. We ordered a dinner for two and it came out hot and fast. The service was extremely friendly and the restaurant is very clean. I didn't want to write a review at first because I didn't want everyone going . However being the nice person I am if you are in the south it's worth the stop. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple times for pickup and delivery. I live close and had my delivery in 20 minutes. This is western Chinese food, no illusions about that, if you want authenticity u might go somewhere else. But the food is fine. You don't go to McDonald's and expect top sirloin steak. I am reviewing based on what the store IS and what I got.

I got exacly what I expected. I would give a 5 star, but I was not blown away, though the customer service is exceptional, staff are friendly and upbeat.
 
Give this place some time to find its footing, lots can change in a year. The other reviewers seemed a bit harsh in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place for Chinese!! We have ordered many times and both Silverado and 130 location are amazing !! There fast, there food is so good and flavourful and I Highly recommend!! Not to mention you live close they will give you free delivery!! I don't know of any other restaurant who offers this"}
{"text":"We thought we would give this place a shot, as a new Chinese joint opening up in the area was exciting for us since the only other option off the top of our head was Chilli Island across the street.  Previous experience there was terrible, so how could we repeat that here?  Spoiler alert:  We think they are owned by the same company.....

We ordered four dishes which cost us about $51.  We thought we were getting a deal as we know Chinese food, and were also hungry and excited.  When the food came we were let down almost immediately.  This is \"western chinese\" which is cooked/saucy/large in portion.  But the taste was not there.  Colour might have been different and varied but everything was bland, and tasted similar.  Sigh.  Another let down here.  

We ended up fridge-ing the leftovers to \"jazz\" up ourselves on our next meal.

The delivery man was a sweet guy though, reminded me of my uncle, tipped 10% extra to him, Merry Christmas....."}
{"text":"Favourite Chinese food in south Calgary. Price is great, food is delicious, and it's always ready super fast! Love this place. 10% off pickup is a great perk when you live a few blocks away for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here tonight and got delivery! They said it would take 45 minutes but it arrived in 30 minutes which I was happy about. However, this restaurant is only getting 1 star because: 
- the wonton soup was not good 
- they use styrofoam containers which not only leak everywhere but are also really bad for the environment
- bad chicken fried rice
- price change for replacing items in the dinners
We ordered the dinner for two which included: 2 spring rolls, sweet and sour pork, ginger beef, chicken fried rice, and mixed vegetables. I don't eat pork and wanted to exchange the sweet and sour pork for just the small wonton soup which is cheaper than the sweet and sour pork but they said they charge a $2 fee for changes to the dinner. Not that I am complaining over $2, I just think it is silly that they have that fee there in the first place. I understand if the item would have been more expensive but it wasn't. 
The wonton soup when we did end up getting it in addition, was bland and the chicken fried rice (which is usually the best part of any meal) besides the ginger beef- tasted old, tasteless and dry. 
However, they get one star because the ginger beef was really good!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and was quite disappointed. First off the menu they give you is a paper take out menu. There were dirty dishes on at least 5 tables that looked like they had been there for awhile. When I was there they only had two other tables full so no excuse for dirty dishes to be left behind. The server was young and new and highly untrained. She was asking people what they ordered a few times and still mixed up the orders in the end. Super slow service I sat there for 45 mind waiting for two spring rolls and two bowls of soup. When I did get the soup ( hot and sour) all I could taste was pepper and not much else. They had tons of button mushrooms in it which I never see in hot and sour soup and I used to work in a Chinese restaurant. Also large chunks of tofu and little of anything else. My son got Wor Wonton soup that had three small shrimp in it that looked very undercooked/borderline raw and lots of celery and zucchini and large chunks of baby corn that looked like it had mutated. I had higher hopes for this place but if the main seating area of the restaurant is sirty I can only imagine what the Kitchen looks like yuck! Plus taste of the food was nothing like I am used to or get anywhere else. There are better places in the area that at least have trained staff who are competent at their job."}
{"text":"We've been satisfying our ginger beef craving with Kung Fu since they first sent out flyers in the mail. Apparently, sometimes junk mail pays off. The dinner for two is usually what we order and or $2 you can make it a double order of ginger beer instead of what the other dish is. You can order easily on the phone and pick up or get it delivered. Quality has been consistent each time that we order, out of the places in the immediate vicinity it's our top pick for Chinese."}
{"text":"Placed a take-out order one night. The order process was quick and easy. They also give you a hefty discount for picking up your order instead of getting delivery.

The quality and price is competitive with the other Chinese places in the area. The one thing that stood out for me about this place though was that the ginger beef is better than other places I've ordered from. It was still crispy when I got home and not soggy sitting a bunch of sauce. I also found the sauce to be a little thicker and not so runny.

Other than that this is pretty standard."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice and have to say I wasn't overly impressed. Although the service was great and fast the food left nothing to be desired. I ordered a dinner for four which came with sweet and sour pork,fried rice, ginger beef and mixed veggies the fried rice was very salty and tasted freezer burnt. The pros and ginger beef also were way over cooked and tasted freezer burnt. It was not fresh at all. I would not recommend this place for dinner but rather a lunch."}
{"text":"Went in and had to walk up to the bar to ask for a table.   Was told we could sit anywhere we wanted.   Were presented with paper take out menus and the waitress took our drink orders.   Waited about tens minutes and looked around at a few dirty tables and thought about leaving.   Looked around some more and saw thing like price tags/stickers still on the lamps.   After a few more minutes it didn't look like our drinks were coming so we went up to the bar and said never mind    we are leaving.  Empty Restaurant with zero atmosphere  and zero service.   Not good for a grand opening"}
{"text":"The secret here is that traditional Chinese dishes are available here but you can't see them on the menu because they're renamed random English names. If you know your stuff, walk in and order off the menu with the owner. You'll love your meal. It took them a while to get settled in but I think they're gonna be around for a while."}
{"text":"Food seemed fine. I'm giving them 3 stars because they put my takeout in styrofoam containers and they all leaked everywhere making a complete mess in the bag and I had to pretty much wash everything off before we could eat. You don't order take out because you want to do a million dishes before you eat. Other than that, the portions were generous and it tasted like normal Chinese food."}
{"text":"I recently went there for the first time and I can honestly say everything was absolutely delicious. It was a little pricy in my opinion however they're very generous with the portions. Only complaint I have was the spring rolls. They were still frozen on the inside! Other than that, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. The ginger beef is crispy  and good.  The honey garlic spare ribs is good.  It's crispy but a bit on the bony side."}
{"text":"They are very generous with portions and food is pretty good. It's always quick and hot. They give a discount for delivery but be advised that you need to know how much you're supposed to pay. The receipt is in Chinese and they often charge the wrong amount."}
{"text":"Below average Chinese food. The salt and pepper squid was SOO SALTY it was inedible and tasted like a kidney stone ready to happen. I would have demanded for a refund but I ordered off skip the dishes. I also ordered the sweet and sour pork which is sweeter than other places definitely needed more vinegar for a bit more tartness. The ginger chicken was also below average amongst the others I've tried. The decent thing I could only eat was the noodles. I wouldn't order from here again."}
