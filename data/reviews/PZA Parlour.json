{"text":"With all the extremely mixed reviews we've read we thought we would give PZA a try and find out for ourselves.   Interior is white and bright and appears clean. Our server (Tyler) was extremely pleasant as was the server working at the table behind us. Food quality was extremely good.  We had Johnny G pizza, kids cheese pizza and Caesar salad. All were very good. I'm particular with Caesar salads and I'd definitely reorder it.  My husband and kids all loved the pizza. The crust was excellent ( light and airy) and toppings plentiful.    When we are in the mood for pizza and don't want takeout this will be our spot."}
{"text":"I come from a city that is known for making great pizza, so when I moved to Alberta I started looking for a great pie. My search has been going on for apx 3 years and I never found anything great till now! PZA makes a great tasting pizza, my wife and I both loved the pie and the appatizer (house made sausage with caramalized onions) was great. This is the first great pizza we have found in Alberta ( from Ft Mac to Calgary and everywhere between). We will be eating here again, and highly recomend it."}
{"text":"Want a great patio and delicious food and drinks (specifically the spritzers)? It's a good gem with a great location.  Pizza feeds 4-5 'big kids' perfectly. Salads are great too if you aren't concerned about making friends.  The decor makes you feel like you are outside which on a rainy day helps with the blues (but drinks do that too).  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant because it was related to the old Stromboli's and Villa Firenze which I love.  The Caprino salad and calamari was tasty to start.  My daughter and I shared the Alfredo spinach pasta which was good too.  My son ordered a pizza and was not impressed.  He said it tasted like a frozen Dr Oetker pizza and especially the sauce.  My daughter tasted the pizza as well and she agreed.  For a place that specializes in pizza, homemade sauces and everything is fresh, they need to do something to improve on the pizza.  We talked to the manager and told her what we thought of the pizza.  The manager offered to take it off the bill but we had already paid.  She didn't say that she would mention our complaint to the chef or even offer us a gift card to come and try the restaurant again.  We weren't impressed with that and won't be back."}
{"text":"We tried out PZA after hearing good things from family and friends. It did not disappoint, in fact, it exceeded our expectations! Service was prompt and friendly. The restaurant is clean, bright and has a nice ambiance. We ordered calamari (delicious!), two kinds of pizza and the Nutella donuts for dessert. The Smoky Mango pizza is very unique and tasty. It's a bit on the greasy side because of the meat but definitely worth a try! The pizzas have a great, light crust. The dessert was absolutely heavenly, you simply must try the donuts (sorry, I can't remember the proper name on the menu). We will be headed back soon to try some more dishes, the pastas look very tempting!"}
{"text":"Decent for sure. Pizza was nice, calamari was well done albeit a tad on the salty side.  Great beer selection. Great addition on South Macleod trail. I'll be back (in terminator voice)."}
{"text":"Had dinner here today with my family. The service was good and the greeters were friendly. The pizza crust was airy and good tasting. The toppings were plentiful and tasty. My wife's lasagna was good but was only luke warm.  Beer was cold.  One really negative about this restaurant are the chairs. These are the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever sat on. They are metal with no cushioning and they are designed in a way that the sides of the backs dig into your hips. Unless you are anorexic or 12 years old, you will not fit into these chairs. I really think they bought these without sitting in them. I rushed my meal so I could finally stand up.  I'm sure this pizza restaurant will get better and have a following but the prices are high and the chairs make you want to leave sooner than you want too."}
{"text":"Vegans beware, the pizza crust has LARD in it. Prior to the first time I went, I asked PZA Parlour via their Facebook page if the crust was vegan and they said yes. I asked the server too, just to be sure, and she said it was vegan, so I ate it. I went for a second time tonight, and was told by both the server and a chef that there is in fact lard (animal fat) in the crust. It's really disappointing when you can't get basic information about what you're eating. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We had 7 adults and 2 and service was fast and efficient. .the 3 large pizzas were hot and delicious with still enough to take some home...the only disappointment was the minestrone soup..the broth was great but thats pretty well all it was was broth...a few sad veggies floating around in it...my minestrone soup is closer to stew...beans, veggies sometimes pasta...surprised to see the soup fail in a super place..."}
{"text":"The pizzas have a from frozen look. No flavour in the dough and toppings are just thrown on top. Beer is good but so is it in other places. Service was just cookie cutter service. The ambiance just feels cold."}
{"text":"It is what my Italian friend calls \"mungiacake Italian\", or mock Italian.  So, if you are looking for a true Italian experience look elsewhere.  Now, let's start with the decor.  The space is nicely decorated, and has a nice patio and bar.  The staff were fine, but rather uninspired.    On the plus side, PZA did have Moretti - a nice Italian beer.  The pizza was solid, but not exceptional.  It was closer to Domino's than true Italian pizza.  Better pie is nearby at Il Centro.    My wife has the veal parmigiana and did not care for it.  She is not a picky eater, and the dish did not look that appealing.    So all in all, a nice setting but the food is so so.  PZA is relatively new, so it has the opportunity to improve and may well do so."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a drive by as was rush hour and better having dinner then on road.  Nice atmosphere and staff menu is what they promote: pizza and pasta.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  I had the veal parmigiana which was a disappointment (description was better than meal) wife had the cannelloni and enjoyed it.  Overall average.  Highlight was the house Sangiovese great value and good!"}
{"text":"Food took too long to make lineups are too long service was slow and poor quality but the place looks amazing and very new"}
{"text":"Tried this pizza restaurant on the weekend. The atmosphere is very Italian, with some interesting decor going on. My wife and I ordered an appetizer of bruschetta. It was excellent!!! We each ordered a single pizza, my wife ordered the \"DUO\" (ham, pineapple, tomato sauce and mozzarella ) and I had the \"PEI Wedding\" (lobster, potato, charred corn, caramelized onions, beschemel, mozzarella and truffle oil). Both were the small (10\") and were also excellent. They have some other pizzas with some very interesting combinations. We highly recommend this restaurant and will return in the future!!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood!   The space is beautiful, the service was great and (most importantly) the food was delicious and interesting.   Highly recommend: 1. Bruschetta pizza -  Really flavorful while still light and summery 2. Spinaci salad -  Great mix of textures and flavors. It's a salad that's actually worth ordering 3. Gio pizza - Pear and gorgonzola... lots of gorgonzola. Blue cheese lovers rejoice! Blue cheese haters beware.   I want to recommend the Ciambelle doughnuts but if you're like me and have zero willpower around hot, fresh delicious doughnuts then you'll probably eat the whole order yourself and have to live with the regret (ugh.. too delicious to resist)."}
{"text":"So the lady and I decided to do something spontaneous and drive to look for somewhere to eat, no plans, no expectations, just one mission, food.  We drove down Mcleod trail to see the new PZA lit sign and said, hey we'll give it a shot!    Upon entry, we found the place to be clean, modern, and have the feel of eating outside in a beautiful picnic setting, all INDOORS.  The details of the environment were vast, and I was happy to take it all in.    The server greeted us, and was soft and eloquent, I felt she was sincere and happy to take our order.  Have to admit it's been a while since I had top notch customer service.  Funny how great service can make or break a place (or review), she was amazing with checkin on us, making polite conversation, and being knowledgeable.    The food, here's the important part.  We ordered the Portobello appetizer, which was grilled to perfection and in a butter cream sauce that really woke up my palette.  We ordered the Johnny G pizza I believe, and on first glance you can't really judge a pizza since they all look relatively the same.  I was underwhelmed when it came to my table as the small was 9 inches, and I can eat that in my sleep (I thought), and maybe I was hoping the pizza was going to look different, in my head I was thinking \"meh\".    We had our first bite, and well, at this point my lady and I actually made eye contact and had a moment of selfishness, where we were contemplating who can eat faster and get more of it since it was incredibly good.  The ingredients tasted fresh, the sauce was the perfect amount, and this \"dry\" crust that I've read in other reviews, well, I had no issues.    We saved a bit of room for dessert as we have a sweet tooth, and while I can ALWAYS finish my dessert, we ordered the LOVE cake and it defeated us.  It should't be called the LOVE cake, it should be called the BATTLE cake if you're sharing because like the pizza, we were politely but rigorously alternating forkfuls into our mouths.    I remembered to write this review today because I literally just finished my leftovers of that same 9 inch that fed us last night and relived the glory.    This place is a family eatery by day and a modern young professional's meeting place for drinks and good light food by night.  I will definitely be back this week to continue to stress test the establishment by trying other menu items.  I have a feeling they will not disappoint on subsequent visits and am enthused to watch the neighbourhood jump on the PZA bandwagon.    Well done PZA, you've scored a top spot in my fave places to eat at.  Whether you remain there will be up to you when I come next! :)"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing and the service is always great. Be careful ordering the large it is HUGE. Also it would be nice if they had more deluxe options ... most are pretty plain but the Zepp is really good. The beer is also wicked expensive. But all in all very good place."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! I kept my first order from there simple... pretty much just a pepperoni pizza... but it was delicious! We ordered home delivery and it came super fast and was nice and hot and fresh! And we had ordered the large size pizza and it easily fed 3 hungry adults with lots of left overs!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the tre... it was tre bien! Perfect amount of pep on the pizza..I could taste and see the melting cheese...the crust was super light yet crunchy. So far the best pizza in Calgary. If anyone has a better recommendation plz let me know. I sat at the bar, bartender was super friendly and on point...  NOT annoying.. I was the only person at the bar btw so it's not hard to spot any needs I had. Overall this is my goto for a pizza fix. Thanks, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars.  First off greeted by a server who had no idea what the specials were who was also training a new girl how to apparently shit the bed at work.  We were told the food is good here by the server but they hadn't tried anything on the menu yet.  We decided to grab a Gio PZA.  This pizza was 60% dry crust with a splash of cheese in the middle.  Obviously disappointed In our $17 pizza we complained to the server politely.  We were dismissed in our complaint because the server was too afraid to talk to the chef.  So we took matters into our own hands and my 90 lb girlfriend talked to the chef.  (She wasn't afraid lol)  He dismissed our complaint saying he just received another complaint that they're were too many toppings on their pizzas... Umm I'm sorry what!?  Who says \"what this pizza needs is more dry crust\" cmon!After all this BS we asked for the bill and nothing had been taken care of.  We asked to see the manager and she explained that's just how their pizzas come out.  Well guys if you love dough this is the place for you.  Heaven forbid anything goes wrong with your meal because nobody gives a shit about your experience here.  For a brand new place I'm appalled at the lack of customer care and product knowledge this hell hole offers.  Steer clear!  Pizza Hut is pathetically a better option."}
{"text":"Came here after work to celebrate a work colleague's retirement. I had the not-so-vegan pizza, and while I really enjoyed the variety of veggies (hello yummy olives!!), the tasty crust was a bit thicker than my preference.  I got over it because the toppings were fantastic. We were in the private room and it actually was very loud, with music from the restaurant filtering in and overpowering any speeches. Service was great and staff were very attentive. If I was in the area again, I would consider returning to try other options and giving this place more chances to impress."}
{"text":"This place has great potential! I love the interior and feel of the place. But it needs improvement in several areas, the biggest one being the pizza.  I came here with my family. We all ordered our own pizza. I got the \"Not so Vegan\". I was very impressed with the variety of pizza there was to choose from. I love a pizza that looks like it came straight out of a vegetable garden, which the NsV did.   Unfortunately the pizza itself was missing something. The crust seemed to taste as though it was previously frozen. And the sauce was really bland. Like most of these modern Italian pizza restaurants, they only have chili oil. I would have loved some sriracha or even tabasco to add some flavour which it desperately needed.  One thing that was a bit strange to me is that it costs the same to add any extra toppings to your pizza. So adding spinach is the same as adding shrimp. That doesn't really add up. It would be awesome to see them lower the price for adding veggie toppings.  Service was just OK. I get that it's a new place so it's understandable. Server seemed like she was new to the industry. She didn't know the specials and was very unaware of us. It was a struggle to get the bill.  The chairs were fairly uncomfortable. And with the high tables there's no where to put your bags. I had mine hanging on my knee for dinner. Not a huge issue, but it would be awesome if they installed some bag hooks on the table.  In short, the biggest improvement PZA needs to make is adding flavour or \"pizzazz\" to their pizza. Or at least get some hot sauce, it might not be \"that kind of restaurant\" to do so, but who cares. If it makes customers happy why wouldn't you?"}
{"text":"Better than average 'Za but nowt amazing. Very nice decor inside. Could do better. How long do these reviews have to be?"}
{"text":"First you lure me in with a restaurant name that contains letters used in pizza. Then you trick me into drinking a tasty Italian beer meant to appeal to my love of pizza again. Peroni beer? Peroooni. Pepperoni? I'll have 10!  The pizza was tasty, but the chili oil really topped it off. Great addition to the 'pie'. Service was good, location is good. The decor was sleek modern, which doesn't tickle my fancy, but it was clean."}
{"text":"Well here goes.   The service here IS in fact, not top notch. It's a laid back environment and I kind of dig it.  We got two pizzas that turned out really good. Subtle flavour and nicely balanced. It's not Pizza Hut so the idiots in the previous reviews should refrain from voicing their half assed opinions.   Everything was well cooked, balanced and fresh. The beer on tap was also great. No dirty lines here.  Worthy of note is that the 'barista' here needs a crash course on the difference between a latte and a cappuccino. I can be discerning at the best of times, but when a waitress tries to tell me 'that's how we do it here\", it's very difficult for me not to lose my shit and start hulk smashing structural walls.   As luck would have it after sending back my bubble bath latte, the manager discretely rolled up his sleeve and made a proper beverage. A good flogging occurred of the bartender that made the original disaster, and all agreed a training session and 10 hail Mary's were in order.   Nice save.   All in all I would return. They have a good sense of humour and the good is good from what I've seen. The Nutella doughnuts will blow your fucking mind.   Enjoy your coffee."}
{"text":"This place has never looked better! Love all the changes they've made, its bright, modern and trendy inside. Staff is friendly and it's a great spot for groups."}
{"text":"Beautiful new restaurant in the South just off Macleod Trail that screams modern but offers hints of nostalgia everywhere. The word PZA is a fun and creative play on the word pizza, parlour plays homage to the owners childhood spent with his Nonna and her passion for pizza.  Since we were in the south (around the corner) for an appointment, we stopped in for lunch. Wanted to check it out and try the pizza. Always looking for new pizza places to love.  They offer a large selection of pizzas available in two sizes. Plus salads, entrees and other bites if pizza is not your thing. They tell me everything is house made including Ciambelle (deep fried doughnuts) which were super delicious - get the doughnuts!!  An espresso machine allows you to finish your meal with an espresso, latte or cappuccino if you so desire. We enjoyed our experience, the service was great and we will definitely be stopping by again in the near future."}
{"text":"I've been to PZA twice and both times I've found the pizza to be delicious. They serve more of a New York style pizza - a little thinner crust with a moderate amount of toppings but quality ones. We drizzled a little of the house made chili oil over it which pushed it right over the top. The smaller size is meant to be a personal size but we felt it could have served two at lunch unless you have a really big appetite - at dinner we'd add a salad. We also tried the Ciambelle doughnuts - amazing!  I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu items. This is a little pricier than some places but I think the quality warrants it. Will definitely be visiting often. A new favourite in Calgary south for pizza."}
{"text":"This place is great. Lots of gluten free options. Pizza is delicious only complaint this place is a little pricey for the quality.  Been here a couple of times and had a great time each visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I split a small pizza and a pasta and had food to take home! Both were extremely good despite not sounding like we'd totally love it from the menu descriptions.  We happened to come on a day where the special was half off pasta (I think it was a Tuesday or Wednesday) and the Alfredo with  spinach pasta was one of the more amazing pastas we have ever tried. It's not too heavy and since coming here this first time, I've come back and ordered the Alfredo just for myself, no sharing this time! The pizza we had was the 'Sei' it had ham, sausage and salami. They DO NOT skimp on the toppings! I actually had to pull some off because there was just so much meat.  The focaccia bread is very good but I say skip that and save room for your regular food.  My only reason for knocking off a star was because the wait staff leaves you alone, and I mean really really leaves you alone. At times it was hard to get the bill, or a box for our food. They were still very nice but it would be better to not have to sit around and hope you see your waiter around.  Definitely going back, and definitely not sharing"}
{"text":"Had pizza for take out. My husband asked the difference between a small and large pizza and was told the difference was 2 slices more in the large. With that in mind we went with two smalls to feed three adults and a toddler because the price difference between the two sizes is almost $10. Needless to say, the small was more of a personal size and it's a good thing we made a salad to go with them because there wouldn't have been enough. The price is high, so I doubt we will be having it for takeout again. Also, the sauce was pretty bland. There are other pizza places I would travel to if I'm going to eat out."}
{"text":"Poor service while the restaurant was clearly slow and it took over 2 hours from start to finish. Food was ok, definitely won't be back!"}
