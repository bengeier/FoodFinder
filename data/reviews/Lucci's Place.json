{"text":"It's so good! New York style pizza to die for. Nice staff, nice atmosphere. I dig it."}
{"text":"Called in about 9:00 , order was eagerly taken ...half hour later driver shows up with piping hot pizza .A friendly no nonsense chap , and when i asked, claimed to have also made the pie. I liked his Sun Tzu approach and tipped him heartily , rounding my six and some coin up to an even ten. 

I was baching it for the night , and looking forward to being alone with my new friend . He turned out to be a tasty companion indeed. Gooey melty cheese and an unexpectedly sophisticated red sauce , topped with a well balanced application of pepperonis the likes of which reminded me of a delicate handmade style, somewhere from Abruzzo . And , the little circular slices were on top of the cheese ... where they should be ! 

Thank you Lucci !"}
{"text":"The real deal!!!! It's freaking delicious!!!! Very authentic and really New York style pizza!!!! I'm a fan and will be back. Pretty damn cheap too for a great pie."}
{"text":"Lucci's pizza is absolutely the best pizza in Kent.  The thin crust and flavorful sauce is what makes this such a great pizza.  I have ordered pizza here at least a dozen times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned this is the BEST pizza place in Kent! My boyfriend had tried a piece at a friend's house and said we should try it. We stopped by tonight for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised. I haven't really heard anything about the place so there weren't any expectations. They greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, everyone was very pleasant and helpful, most places are but they really seemed genuine. The wait was probably less than 15 minutes even though they seemed pretty busy. Those things were nice but even if they had been less nice and the wait had been longer I could have forgiven it because the pizza was SO good. I guess I understand the sauce complaints others had, they're probably not familiar with New York style pizza but it's definitely there and delicious. And the crust! It was perfect, I would prefer their crust to a flavored crust any day. My boyfriend had the pepperoni and loved it, I got mushroom (fresh mushrooms too). We have a new go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The individual slices are the size of 2 large pieces slices in one. $2 for a slice of pizza and $0.75 for a can of pop. This is the best pizza you will find in kent, and they have the best ingridients too! All the workers are super nice. You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Owner was cool to talk to when I came in. The pizza was really good(chewy, thin crust & sauce had a nice bite), ready early, & a great price. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Open till 3 on weekends? Nah not really. Showed up at 2:40 and the place was closed. Go to guys instead, at least they're honest with their hours."}
{"text":"I'm from Kent, and have been to NYC several times.  Lucci's offers some true NY style pizza.  Lucci's offers the best pizza in Kent, and some of the best I've ever had.  Each component of the pizza comes together to create perfection- the crispy/doughy/foldable crust, the perfect amount of cheese, and a light tomato sauce with true tomato taste.  The prices are also very fair.  We had a large 18\" plain cheese pizza (always my favorite), and a 14\" pizza with artichoke hearts, roasted garlic, spinach, and fresh mozzarella made IN HOUSE (you can watch them make it if you stop in).  I also heard their menu may be expanding soon.  Bottom line- you won't be disappointed if you try Lucci's!"}
{"text":"Best new York style pizza I've had in Ohio fresh ingredients good prices I love this place!"}
{"text":"2nd time getting pizza from here.
This time it gets 5 stars from me.
Pepperoni, mushroom & extra cheese probably the best I've had in awhile.
Great greasy thin crust just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Kent, hands-down. Old school New York style -- large, thin slices, served up hot and ready to fold in half and consume. If you could sit down at a table and get a pitcher, it'd be a straight-up 5-star spot. Best of breed around here -- go there!"}
{"text":"As a transplanted New Yorker I have the hardest time finding anything close to true NY style pizza, and have tried 100's of pizza places in Akron area, being disappointed every time! NOT ANYMORE! Lucci's is not only true NY style, but also just really delicious pizza for those that don't care about whether it's NY style or not. They offer slices, and great service and prices! Try them, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hands down best thin crust pizza in Kent or Akron area. Plus it's super cheap. I normally get a large cheese or a white with spinach as a topping. The pepperoni rolls are also amazing. 

You won't regret it. I get it at least once a week."}
{"text":"Had heard good things about Lucci's and drove from Stow to pick up a pie.  The pizza was great, fresh ingredients, the homemade sauce and sausages were delicious. The real star here though is the crust, light flaky and really compliments the toppings.  I will be making the trip more often."}
{"text":"Love this place, just like new York city pizza you have to fold to eat, fresh ingredients always love ordering from here, best around, must try"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pizza last evening from Lucci's. Everyone raved about the roasted garlic and spinach pizza. I ordered online and the pizzas were delivered right on time and hot. The delivery person was super polite, our new favorite pizza place! Highly recommend to those pizza eaters near Kent Ohio. Fresh ingredients and the best thin crust, New York style pizza in our area."}
{"text":"I got a couple by the slice pizzas and was really good for how cheap it is. The dude working there was really chill also. It's open really late every night and is definitely a place in gonna swing by next time I'm out finishing up party hopping on college, uni, main etc..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Lucci's Place! If you like New York style pizza with real cheese, fresh ingredients, and prepared in an immaculately clean kitchen, go no where else! I spoke with Peter, the owner, and he was friendly, courteous and very professional. I will be a loyal customer for as long as Lucci's Place is in business!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I've encountered issues with the large pizza (sogginess, mostly), but overall, we're huge fans of Lucci's. 

Their pepperoni and Italian sausage are some of the best I've had, and others have already raved about the quality of the crust and fresh mozzarella cheese.  

I highly recommend Lucci's for anyone looking for a good, homemade thin crust pizza in the Kent area."}
{"text":"Lucci's is crafting the finest pies around! I only wish we had pizza like this when I was in school. I'm a KSU grad and live in Brooklyn,NY now (so I know my pies) and this is hands down my favorite slice. Not to mention the owner and staff were super friendly and made you feel like family when you come in."}
{"text":"Nice big New York slide type beat pizza. However very greasy and kinda soft. It's alright. Normal pizza isn't too bad but one time my friend accidentally ordered a white pizza and it just tasted like bread."}
{"text":"Absolutely the real deal when it comes to New York style pizza. My wife and I are both from New Jersey and this is the first pizza we found in the area that is truly New York style. If you want a thin crust delicious pie this is your pizza place. Great blend of cheese and sauce!If instead you're interested in the typical Midwest thick crust pizza with millions of toppings and little flavor stay away."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! If you're a fan of NY style pizza, you know how hard it is to find around here. These guys are doing it right. That crust is spot on perfect! Worth the 30 min drive for me."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Kent! We order delivery from here at least once a week and it's always delicious. The poor driver is always very nice about our dog who barks waaaay to much when the doorbell rings. The owners are a great Kent family and will do anything to make sure your experience is awesome."}
{"text":"Pizza is out of this world. I could eat my body weight in their pizza and still have room for more. 

I drive the 20 minutes to indulge in happiness and sunshine. Check this place out if you want some true NY style pizza in lame Ohio! It'll make your life better, I promise!"}
{"text":"I have liked Lucci's pizza since I first tried it, but lately I have asked them to make it 'well done' or just a bit browner, which they happily oblige.  That's just a personal taste thing, but I'll tell you, the last pizza I had there was an absolutely perfect pizza.  Just perfect!  I love NY style and this is the real thing.  I've had pizza in Italy and at famous \"Joe's\" in Santa Monica, CA, and this is absolutely the best I've had between those two places!  They're nice folks too."}
{"text":"Lucci is a little cheaper than Gucci, but then Gucci doesn't sell pizza, so it's a weird comparison.

Lucci has good slices of pizza. It's not Buffalo, NYC or Chicago good, but it's tasty and it'll do the trick when in Kent. I can't quite give them 5 stars because I have very high pizza standards, but it's good cheap pizza with wonderful service, and I'd definitely come back here for slices when in town."}
{"text":"Never tried this pizza place. It came recommended so I ordered a large pizza. Very disappointing. Although the crust was just okay everything on top of crust was very skimpy. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Great staff, great ingredients, great pizza! I would recommend Lucci's place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often, mainly because I don't like to be mean. Most places aren't awful, but very few fail to impress.

With that said, this is BY FAR THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD!

The employees (maybe the owner I forgot to ask) are awesome, everything is made fresh & the price is right.

With an Extra large cheese only costing $11, unfortunately (for my health) my weekly pizza night might now be a 2-4 night a week habit. The sausage is perfect too, very unique.

If you prefer $5 pizza that is hot & ready, this isn't the place, but I highly recommend you go try them out. Support local business so they can stay open. I can't solely keep them in business, but dang it I'm gonna try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Unfortunately, its takeout or delivery only. I like to post up at 101 Bottles across the lot, get a few beers in me, then hit up Lucci's and bring over some salty greasy goodness to savor with another beer. Best Pizza in town hands down."}
{"text":"Most amazing pizza we've had in a long time!  Crust is perfect thickness and flavor!!  Employees are so friendly and the owners father was so sweet!!!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. In. Town. Hands down. You get a great pizza made with quality ingredients for a fraction of the price, which is good for us college kids. Although the pizza itself is amazing, I can't wait for them to add garlic bread to the menu!"}
{"text":"Tried Lucci for the first time based on the Yelp reviews, as usual I was disappointed.
We got the 14\" with two toppings for $12.50 .  First off, they give you very few toppings, plus the pepperoni were very small. Second, the crust was extremely thin and chewy. The cheese was good but here again there was very little of it.  This reminded me of the old frozen pizzas
you used to buy. On the pro side, the guys who worked there very nice.
I guess we're back to the Pappa Johns and Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza has good flavor and the crust is perfectly chewy! The cheese pizza was a bit bland for our liking but we would definitely get again"}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza in kent. You can taste the quality of the dough/crust. Whatever cheese blend they're using leaves me craving for more, and I love the more savory sauce. If you're in Kent, please support this fantastic business. The employees and owners are extremely kind people."}
{"text":"Friends from NYC say it's the only pizza they've had since moving to Ohio that actually is real New York style. So good. And a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Loved their pizza. Best part is their cheese. Very high quality ingredients. Happy that tried it. Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've had in Kent. Staff is very personable and friendly. Good prices.  Great pizza. Nothing more, nothing less. 

The establishment very authentic and reminded me of a little spot in the Lower East Side on the ground floor of a friend's building, in both the pizza and environment."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza made simply and with high quality ingredients. Hand tossed pizzas with top shelf ingredients like homemade sausage and high quality cheese."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest for \"New York style\" pizza, in this area for many years. Well, this is it folks! The crust, the cheese, and sauce all done right. And the crispy old world pepperoni is fantastic. No mass produced corporate chain plastic pizza here. This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Had a large pizza tonight. As someone who is very familiar with true NY pizza through NY family, I
will say - this is authentic. It's is awesome to have a place here in NE Ohio that has delicious real NY style 'za."}
{"text":"New York style pizza done perfect. A+++++++ and great prices as well. Can't do any better. If you're in the area make sure to try and if you are and haven't treat yourself ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Have worked in the Kent area for over a decade and never heard of this place until someone recommended it to me.  We ordered two large pizzas, one cheese, and one pepperoni.  We visit New York often and this is as close to a New York style pizza that I have ever had in Ohio. Some places claim to have New York style just because they have large slices, but Lucci's is legit.  The crust, the amount of sauce and cheese was on point!  I stay in Kent two to three nights a week for work and I know where all my pizza delivery orders will be going to!  Oh, and they take credit card at time of delivery. Very very pleased!"}
{"text":"Tasteful food always made fresh, great location that is walking distance from campus and downtown, and inexpensive prices for high quality NY style pizza. The best part is that they sell by the slice everyday! Highly recommend their salads where even the small is a huge portion loaded with veggies. Seating is not an option inside but there is a bench outside if you aren't ordering to go."}
{"text":"We ordered a delivery NY style pizza last night. The service was quick and friendly. We really enjoyed our vegetarian pizza - fresh spinach and well spiced pizza. We would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Kent. Full pies are fantastic and they also offer pizza by the slice at the shop. The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza!   I used to live near NYC and really missed the awesome pizza.   Lucci's is just what I have been missing.  It's the best in the area.   Fresh ingredients and great pie makers."}
{"text":"I went to Lombardi's in NYC, the oldest pizzeria in American, it was good pizza, Lucci's is better! We are lucky to have this establishment in Kent!"}
{"text":"Upgrading to 5 stars, after a second delicious delivery experience.  The Lucci's staff were pleasant and efficient on this freezing night, and our pizza was again super tasty.  Definitely one of the best pizza experiences in the region, produced by a hardworking local business.  This will easily become our regular weekend treat.  Thanks, Lucci's!"}
