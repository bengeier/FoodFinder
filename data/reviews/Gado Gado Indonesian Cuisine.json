{"text":"Chicken dumplings were good. Gado gado salad was ok. Out of the main meals the braised beef was the best. The fish and shrimps were so-so - no real punch of flavors. Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of Indonesian cuisine in general, I've had it many times and it never really impresses."}
{"text":"As an Indonesian, i love this place so much. It's the closest to home feel I can get. Try the beef rendang(beef stew in coconut milk), gado-gado (salad with peanut sauce) and sate ayam(chicken satay). My favourite is pempek (fishcake). Nomz! :D"}
{"text":"Having visited south east Asia many times and Bali being one of my favorite destinations ever l was craving some Indonesian food. While they didn't have nasi goreng, they had plenty of other delicious dishes including a braised beef dish that was to die for!  Definitely going on my fave list for MTL.   Add to that the hauntingly beautiful balinese music that I love, it's such a relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Really terrific Indonesian cuisine. The beef rendang and satay was absolutely delicious. The laksa lacked a little something-I can't quite put my finger on what."}
{"text":"Family-run, home style cooking. A bit bland but sometimes its nice to have a cleansing meal - I had a lamb soup/stew with rice. Large portions although I could only count the number of vegetables on not even half a hand (which is a more complicated way of saying that there basically were no veg or anything to brighten up the dish) - great if you like lots of meat. My friend enjoyed the laksa.  Its so family run that there's some kids playing cards or something on a table in the corner, and a kid refilled our water! Service was quick and friendly. Guava candies at the end solidified my approval."}
{"text":"I took my family here last night. What a treat the food was great. For those that are worried that it might be to spicy it was not. My wife actually wanted extra chilly sauce for her dish.the owner was very attentive and the restaurant was spotless. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The foods good, specially seared duck breast sambal matah . The only thing they don't have server, only two men working in the kitchen and doing everything else include serving to clients. The service was very slow. We requested water and took so long. The foods was spicy, we felt burning our mouths without water for drinking."}
{"text":"First time trying Indonesian food! Based on the online reviews, we had the pork bun appetisers which were absolutely delicious - soft steamed buns, melt-in-your-mouth slow-cooked pork belly, and a slice of crunchy cucumber. I could have eaten ten! (Unfortunately they only gave two.)   For the main course, we tried the fried noodles, grilled lamb, grilled chicken with peanut sauce, and pan-seared duck. Oh my goodness. It felt like every dish had been prepared with care, every element was delicious. Even the rice was topped with little sprinkles of fried shallots - so tasty!   Would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"love this joint got to try the pork bun sandwich it is so good"}
{"text":"We have had better Malaysian/Singaporean/Indonesian cuisine in Vancouver (Banana Leaf). We ordered duck breast (very chewy but good flavour), steamed bun (nice), laksa (broth doesn't seem the right flavour/spice), rendang beef (good flavour but a bit dry), fried noodles (very nice). Friendly service and it's in a nice row house."}
{"text":"I have never felt compelled to write a yelp review until after dinner a couple of weeks ago at Gado Gado  We were in town just for a weekend, and we wanted to make every meal count. After striking out for reservations at Au Pied du Cochin, I spent 15 min cross referencing yelp reviews with opentable availability (was traveling with my father-in-law so any place without reservations or potentially a long wait was not an option).   Gado Gado came up as the best option, and it WAY more than exceeded expectations. The lamb satay was tender and juicy and came with a side of curry that was delicious in its own right. The laksa was flavorful without being greasy at all. The star dish though was the short rib beef rendang - it was outrageously delicious and a total steal at $15. Lots of people make this dish and use less tender cuts, but these guys do it right and the dish is an absolute standout.  Try this place - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was good but just warm. The service was bad, we waited 30 min. for soup. The two people got their food the others had to wait another 15 min. Only one server for a Sat. Night. And only 4 tables used.No Hello, welcome, is everything ok, nothing, so he got a 8% tip."}
{"text":"I have no idea why there are so many high reviews in yelp . Won't come here again: ( satay brother is even better"}
{"text":"The service as slow. When we arrived at the restaurant we had to wait 10 min. before someone came and took our order. The food does not correlate with the description on the menu.  Pros: Halal."}
{"text":"***************CLOSED...so sad ************************** This, to me, is the best Indonesian in the city and a great overall value.  The owner/often host and waiter is sweet and gives fantastic service. The ingredients are fresh and expertly prepared.  My favorites (I've tried about 80% of what the menu has to offer over the years I've been going there) are the following: Entr√©es: Papaya salad, Laksa (soup), Dengdeng (dried beef), pangsit goreng (chicken dumplings) and the soto ayam (Javanese soup). Main courses: Gulai Kambing (lamb curry, rendang daging (braised beef) and brengkes udang (shrimp and mango) The coconut rice is also good as well as the little pancakes. I ike the ambiance of this type of old Montreal bourgeois building that is suited for business lunches as well as a romantic night out. Prices are more than reasonable, specially at lunch time. Just a great experience overall. It is one of a few go to places for me in this city as I usually prefer trying out new places."}
{"text":"Amazing Indonesian food . Wonderful service  I'm definitely coming back . Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, you'll LOVE Indonesian food from Gado Gado! It's a true hidden gem in Montreal! The Beef Rendang is a must-try and is authentic. It is so tender, flavourful, and falls off the bone. The house made hot sauce that comes on the side is sooo good. The decor is clean and modest. The food is authentic and top notch while prices are completely reasonable."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal and the price was more than fair. Definitely recommend the papaya salad and the noodle dish.My boyfriend & I were practically fighting over the last Bakpao Gapit (Steamed buns + braised pork belly)- a must order!"}
{"text":"We had Bakpao Gapit (steamed buns with pork belly), Bakmi Goreng (Fried noodles), Beef Rendang, and Sate Ayam (Chicken skewers with peanut sauce).  I will start by saying as an Indonesian, all of the dishes tasted like how I would expect it and more, which is a compliment of its authenticity. Not westernized much, except for the spicy-heat level which had to be tuned down, it'd be spicier traditionally, which makes sense or else they won't be able to sell!  Rendang: Probably the best beef rendang I've ever had! (I was born and grew up in Indonesia). It's not your usual rendang which is USUALLY a bit tough, this was slow cooked till veryyy tender, I was quite surprised. For a $15 you get a huge portion of tender beef in coconut milk sauce that comes with vegetables and rice (which you can substitute for an extra $1.5 for Nasi Uduk or Nasi Kuning, both are coconut milk based rice basically, personally I would strongly recommend you to do it). Well worth it, a must have. The taste reminded me of home.  Bakmi goreng, fried noodles comes with chicken and shrimp. It's a simple good-old noodles with sweet soy sauce. For those who likes something simpler. Again, big portion and delicious !  Sate Ayam, chicken skewers w/ peanut sauce comes with vegetables and rice. I didn't try this one but my friend said it's the best dish she'd ever had (mind you she comes from the country of culinary, France). Good enough for me!  Bakpao Gapit, steamed bun, again I didnt try it but they said it was very good.  For desserts, Lapis Surabaya: traditional layered Indonesian cake with a bit of jam in between and Kue Pepek: rice cake pudding with coconut milk. Both are good !!!  I think it's owned by him/the waiter too, an Indonesian so I had a bit of chat with him, nice guy. also speaks French and English so no need to worry !  Oh and do check on their specials too.  WILL DEFINITELY come back !"}
{"text":"I liked the food a lot! The pork belly steamed bun is comparable to the ones at Satay brothers and that means really good. I ordered the beef jerky for starter; probably the most tender jerky I've ever eaten and surprisingly really tasty. I opted for the stewed lamb curry and wow. Nothing like a hearty food. Tender chunks of lamb although I would've loved a little spiciness on broth."}
{"text":"I had lots of hype when I discover this Indonesian Restaurant. (even watched a few video on Indonesian food LOL)  We looked at the Menu, so many options and traditional dishes :D  With the help of the waiter, we ordered the Bebek Sambal Matah (Duck slices),  Sate Ayam (skewered with sauce) + additional change for COCONUT rice, Pempek (Fried fish and egg), Bakmie (indonesian noodle).  The duck was charged additional $2 (because BIGGER DUCK). When the duck slice arrived, I was very sad LOL, compare to the picture from other people. Our duck was really small and sad, and we paid extra because it was supposed to be bigger :O. Nevertheless, it was really tasty ~~ (Thumbs up for the seasoning) The Sate Ayam was like a combo meal which comes with rice and salads. The meat was damn well cooked and the sauce on top was fabulous. I really liked the coconut rice.  The Pempek was really small and sad LOL. I was expecting something bigger for the price paid. It tasted fine. Nothing too crazy.  The Bakmie (fried noodle) tasted okay. Nothing too crazy too. It came with spicy sauce you could mix in. The crispy fried crab was a nice addition.   Nice ambiance and the water cup are sexy fancy.  Overall, I'd come back to try the laksa (spicy noodle) or eat more skewered.  I had too much expectations."}
{"text":"Still an amazing resto. I highly recommend. Excellent dishes, not expensive, yet strangely quiet. Where is everyone?!"}
{"text":"Read so many good reviews I went in with high expectations.  Alas, service was very slow, and the food was really nothing spectacular,  Not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"This place deserves five stars for the incredibly lemongrassy chicken dumplings and the best beef rendang ever. My fellow young diners loved the satay, but they ate it all, so I can't offer my expert opinion. Some of the other dishes -- noodles, laksa -- were just average, but I would definitely be a repeat customer for the highlights. Friendly service and very fresh."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here before going to a Habs game at the Bell Centre earlier this week.  The service and food were excellent!  We had the fried chicken dumplings to start, which came with an excellent home made hot chili paste for dipping.  We had chicken skewers and a yellow lamb curry for dinner.  Both of which were excellent (though the curry was by far and away the best dish of the night.)  We would highly recommend this restaurant and hope to return."}
{"text":"A trip to aroma land! The food here is just that - aromatic, delicious and just about right on the palette.    Must try Gado Gado, Pangsit Goreng for appetizers.  Loved the Pangsit Goreng (Fried Chicken wantons - Indo style) with sambal (spicy sauce)  Ayam Bakar Kecap with Coconut rice was a nice touch for the main dish.  Deco is warm and friendly service. Accepts all major credit cards.  Average price is $10 CAD per main dish and $6 CAD for appetizers   Am going there again - heard the braised beef is very good"}
{"text":"I have had Indonesian food probably 8-10 times in my life (and in various cities). This was easily the best.  Outstanding... the pork belly buns were outrageous melt in your mouth. We had a noodle dish with shrimp plus a chicken red curry.  Crazy good.  Going back on the way out of town to get carryout for the long drive home from Montreal."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious meal !! Everything was good very happy with this restaurant ! You must try the fish cake entry."}
{"text":"Excellent meal with the exception of slow service. Maybe the kitchen was overwhelmed. Okay, the dessert really wasn't my kind of thing, but the meal itself was nice and flavourful."}
{"text":"Delicious satay chicken and good green tea ice cream. Reasonably priced and fast lunch, calm and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"great informal restaurant with fantastic flavors. Very friendly couple run the place - and spend the evening running out with great dishes. Spicy is indeed spicy. good veggies."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try indonesian food for a while now and when my friend suggested gado gado i jump on the occasion.  First impression : the place is new and is quite minimalistic i find it lack a tiny bit of authenticity in terms of decor, but that's just me. As for the food, I find it excellent we ordered the beef   skewers and the lamb, and both did not disappoint. Also, really good service, the waiter was at first a bit reserved but he end up being really nice and helpful. Overall I will highly suggest everyone to try this unique cuisine and also give some visibility to this well deserved restaurant. Indonesian cuisine is something that needs to gain some visibility."}
{"text":"This place was meh. We came for dinner since we were staying at a hotel down the street and read the yelp reviews. When we walked in, we were the only ones there (although a family with some very loud children came in towards the end of our meal). The decor is polished, and there was one man who seemed to be the server and cook when we arrived. We ordered the lychee martini, fried tofu and seitan, lamb curry, red curry grilled chicken, and yellow curry soup. The tofu was okay, but the seitan was bitter and completely inedible (I normally love seitan!), and the dipping sauces were wayyy too salty. My family really didn't like the lamb curry, although the lychee martini wasn't bad, and I didn't mind my soup. Overall, the meal was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"As far as the South-East Asian cuisine scene goes, its definitely lacking in Montreal. However, Gado Gado manages to make up for this.   Their Chicken Satay is excellent, much better than Satay Brothers. Their tempeh is also quite good. The Pandan ice cream was a really great way to end the meal!   My friend had the Laksa, and seemed to find it adequate, but she is Malay so she knows best what it should taste like. To me, it looked super super coconut-ty.   Overall though, the employees were super nice and friendly, and the meal was really tasty. I would definitely love to return here when I need to satisfy my craving for SEA cuisine."}
{"text":"What an excellent restaurant. I'm really pleased I came here and it is all freshly made, delicious, belly-filling eats. I'm definitely coming back. I took the sate ayam (chicken brochettes, basically) and it was everything i thought it would be.  It's just in the middle of nowhere (or so it seems) so it is never as packed as it should be which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Over the last month, I had been to Gado Gado twice. Luckily both times I was very pleased with my experience, from the food, to the service to the prices. Everything was simply great! Not being quite familiar with the food, our very kind and professional waiter was educating us along the way. Simply and only teaching us about the food. Not once was he pushy in making decisions for us. We asked, he answered politely, end of story.  Their food is loaded with spices and flavour! Don't enjoy spicy food? That's OK! They will custom make each and every dish you order to your taste of spiciness.  My meal of coconut milk braised short ribs, with spices(Not spicy!) along with perfectly fluffy and tender sticky rice was outstanding. Not once did I need to utilize my knife. So tender and silky as well. Full of flavour! The pork belly steamed buns, are very good as well. Simmered & tender pork belly meat, into a soft and delicious rice flour steamed bun. Along with a fresh cucumber slice to add a touch of freshness. Again.. Perfect!  The building outside is a beautiful old building, but very well kept inside. Clean, tidy, and organized. The service is quick and the food is arrives warm. One more bonus point.. Their food is not salty, which sadly, a lot of restaurants have an extra heavy hand on the salt. Gado Gado, does not.   Overall the prices are good as well. No, they are not at the level of China Town, but Gago Gado offers quality over quantity without you leaving hungry. Well you may leave craving the food again and again. As I did.   Bottom line, I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Gado Gado is a pretty good place ! We went for lunch on a Saturday.I had Gado Gado salad as an appetizer and Lamb Sate.Fellow traveler had Green Papaya Salad and the Rendang Daging( Sumatra Braised Beef).The Green Papaya Salad was really good.It was an excellent balance of lime against the fish sauce.The food could have been a little hotter temperature wise.The  waiter was a real nice guy and very informative.My wife had a Mojito - surprisingly it was pretty good.I liked the music - I never say that- it was played at a reasonable volume and I enjoy Gamelan music , now and again.Though one piece was powerfully soporific.Prices are reasonable , food is good and it's a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Tasty, authentic Indonesian food! I am a huge fan of Indonesian food and really satisfied with their dish. Good detailed explanation by Indonesian server(not only about menu but also language and culture), delicious and beautiful plates, various menus, relaxing atmosphere with Balinese music. Restaurant was almost empty but how lucky we were, to be served very quickly. Definitely going back there soon!"}
{"text":"Fabulous all the way around. Ordered several small plates - everything was perfect. I travel constantly, and appreciate when I can eat authentic cuisine that includes a heavy portion of love in the preparation..."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars- amazing food, great prices and the guy aerving our food was so calm and helpful.  Food is bursting with flavors and so very fresh! I'm making it a regular now!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for people who like Asian food. It's authentic, not spicy (although they have amazing hot sauce which I asked for). Really well prepared and not greasy or \"fast food like\" at all. Had the pork belly steamed buns which I could have eaten 20 of, chicken satay, braised beef and a noodle dish. The home made shrimp chips were the best I have ever had. This is a family run restaurant, which I always like to support when it's good. This place is not just good, it's GREAT!"}
{"text":"I would rate their food average at best. We ordered the asam soup, papaya salad and gado gado for starters. They tasted bland, like missing umami. For the entr√©e - lamb skewers, rendang beef, laksa, and shrimp in banana leaves - none blew our hair back, somewhat lacking in seasoning. It will take a while for us to go back. Not worth it for the price. Service was good, however."}
{"text":"Great food, very attentive staff.  Amazing prices.  The Fried Chicken Dumpling appetizer was so good we ordered a second helping.  I had the grilled chicken with a red curry sauce. It was the moistest chicken I have ever eaten. My husband kept sneaking bites, he was blown away by how perfect the chicken was cooked. We also had mojito's that were way better than the fancy places we had eaten in Old Montreal"}
{"text":"Gado gado is far from your typical Asian cuisine. If you've never had Indonesian cuisine before, you need to stop reading this and get over there and try it.  Eating gado gado for the first time will change your life in much the same way as the first time you had sex. Or sort of defined a new level of pleasure, didn't it?  Gado gado defines a new level of delicious.  Honestly, the chef really knows what he's doing, and you can tell because Indonesians eat here too. The flavors are balanced, delicately seasoned, not too salty, everything tastes just right.  I will not only return, but I vow to try everything on the menu, one bite at a time."}
{"text":"Real Indonesian food run by real Indonesians.   Go at lunch time 11 - 2:30, for the lunch special. For around $11 you'll get a soup, main, and some green tea ice cream for dessert. The options include the braised beef which is veryyy good.   As well the place is brand new so it's very clean and the decor is nice."}
{"text":"What a great find and a wonderful experience. The chicken soup was exceptional. The skewers were delicious. Shrimps were fantastic. Even the dessert zucchini cake was great. Highly recommended. Service was quite prompt a the quality you get for the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food.  The only place I know that serves jackfruit curry.  Are you kidding me?!?!  This is an epic find.  The place is super casual but the food is outstanding.  Also they have the best beef rendang i have ever had.  Fragrant, fall in your mouth morsels of beef entombed in rich gravy.  I can eat this every day.  This is a must try and I get excited just thinking about how awesome the food is in this place!"}
{"text":"Soto Ayam was the best I've had.  The broth, which is typically very mild in most Sotos, was flavorful and aromatic, with a strong kick of citrus ginger from the galangal.    Beef Rendang was equally flavorful and rich, with a pleasantly spicy dollop of chili sambal on the side (could have eaten a whole bowl of it)."}
{"text":"Delicious food, the beef marinaded in coconut was the best and I don't even like coconut.  Big portions could only finish 1/2 of it."}
{"text":"Tr√®s belle exp√©rience √† ce restaurant.  Le service tr√®s courtois.  L'entr√©e de pain vapeur au porc est excellente.  Mon plat principal √©tait un carry aux crevettes qui √©tait acceptable.  Une autre visite s'impose!"}
{"text":"L'endroit est facilement accessible (√† 2mn √† pied du m√©tro Guy Concordia) et situ√© √† l'√©tage (√ßa porte √† confusion car son affiche est en bas et il y a un resto en bas aussi). L'endroit n'est pas le plus chaleureux ou d√©cor√© de Montr√©al, mais le service est tr√®s bon et la bouffe aussi et surtout!! Nous avons pris le Laksa et le Goreng et les deux √©taient d√©licieux. Le Laksa vient avec la sauce rouge √©pic√©e qui se m√©lange avec la soupe; je recommande de l'enlever d√®s le d√©but ou de lui demander de la mettre √† cot√© si vous ne voulez pas une soupe trop √©pic√©e. Aussi je recommande de faire attention en mangeant car c'est le genre de soupe qui vous √©clabousse quand vous la mangez hehe Les bouteilles de vin sont propos√©es √† des prix raisonnables (30$). Bref, un bon ptit resto au centre ville, pas trop cher et qui vous fera voyager en Indon√©sie! A essayer!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, tr√®s bon rapport qualit√©/prix. les deux plats v√©g√©tariens que j'ai go√ªt√© sont tout simplement excellent. Subtiles m√©lange de saveurs, l√©gumes frais, et si vous demandez piquant, vous ne serez pas d√©√ßu ! Seul b√©mol, la carte des vins est assez limit√©e. Je recommande fortement."}
{"text":"The best Indonesian cuisine in Montreal. Tried last year and now I'm back. Ayam rujak is so delicious, you can cut the chicken with side of your pork, very very soft. Also tried gulai kambing, I'm travelling alone so I wish I can share food to try more dishes. I would ask for more chilli if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"Our dishwasher broke the day before Thanksgiving.  Needless to say this resulted in many a restaurant dinner but despite that (thanks to Thanksgiving) an ever accumulating pile of dishes we now call \"Mount Doom\".  So even when the heavens poured their miserable buckets of fall water on us we dragged our butts outside to enjoy food at its finest: the kind with no dishes.   This is how we ended up here, Gado Gado, a small, simple but clean, Indonesian restaurant...that was entirely empty (and it stayed that way).   A slightly confused waiter came up to our table, handed us menus, and took our drink order: Extra spicy Caesar (as per usual) por favor!   I ended up ordering Bakpao and Laksa, while the husband unit decided on fried chicken skin and Sate.  We also got side orders of sambal, krupuk and nasi kuning (why do I have to pay for a miserable little bowl of sambal and two pieces of krupuk?...sigh). The Bakpao was awesome, loved every bite of it, even kept one for the moping hubby across the table who didn't enjoy his chicken skin (it was fine, not great however) and he loved it as well. My Laksa was good but not extraordinary, I ate most but got bored with it after a while. Meanwhile the husband was poking at his food and making little soy figures on his plate, I asked him what was up and he responded something along the lines off \"I don't like this, it doesn't taste like Sate at all, I can't find any peanut flavour\", so I guess he didn't  enjoy his meal.  I must say it did look rather sad, meat sticks, no Sate sauce, a tiny spoon of veggies and some steamed rice. At one point slightly confused waiter man shows his face again, and I order another Caesar, this resulted in more confusion and me having to confirm it as if he never had a second drink order before, poor guy, the Caesar is pretty good too so what is all the confusion about? *shrug*  And that was the end of our Gado Gado adventure. The prices weren't bad, despite having to pay for the sambal and krupuk, so that's a plus. I would come here again, but for lunch and only for the Bakpao (oh fine, and probably a Caesar, but just one), the rest was just not good enough to warrant a second visit.  Too bad, but 3 stars it is (for now)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, had no idea I'd get the delicious food I did.  There were 4 items on the lunch special menu; I got the first--filet mignon medallions grilled on wood skewers with a peanut sauce.  Sounds simple, but the seasoning, cook, and sauce were all perfect.  The meal came with a \"chicken soup\" that was not American chicken soup, but rather a very tasty broth with thin rice noodles, vegetables, and pieces of thinly sliced chicken.  Hit the spot on a cold, rainy day--much more flavorful, with much better texture than any American chicken soup I've had.  To finish it off, had a multi-layer cooked pudding for dessert.  It came with a bit of vanilla / chocolate sauce; together, they were very nice.  The pudding portion was a bit large, as it was pretty dense, but I enjoyed the textures and flavors a lot!  The service was very attentive and friendly!  Overall, a very nice experience; I would definitely go back! (4 stars)"}
{"text":"Enjoyable Indonesian in Montreal's down town area.  The interior is very relaxing and nicely done.  We ordered the lunch special.  Started with the soup of the day which was a chicken, lemongrass and clear noodle soup that was nice.  Tried the western Sumatra braised beef and it was very good and the beef was very tender.  Rounded it all off with a refreshing scoop of green tea ice cream.  Service was a bit cold and huffy but we were served fairly quick.  Prices aren't bad either.  I would come back next time I'm in Montreal.  The food is very good."}
{"text":"I sampled some of Gado Gado's dishes when I was at the Yelpoween2015 event, and to my surprise, I used to work with the owners from a different restaurant back in my college days. We've chatted for a bit and I've made a promise to come try their restaurant. Fast forward a few months, I've fulfilled my promise and went with my little sister.  Good : The food. Is. Amazing. The service was quick and friendly, the prices are really affordable and the dishes are incredibly filling. It was my first time trying Indonesian food so we asked the waiter what he recommended, finally we went with the braised beef. It's so tender and perfectly cooked, my exact words were '[blasphemous word], this is amazing.\"  Bad : The decor is a bit plain, but at least it's a spacious dining room.  Bottom line: If you are in the downtown area, try their food. It will not disappoint. I am definitely returning. I just got hungry writing this review."}
{"text":"Meeting with my downtown-working partner for supper, we thought we'd try something close and \"exotic\", so here we walked in. I was in a can't-be-bothered-to-choose mood so we went for the rijstafel which allowed us to sample bits of different dishes. First, make sure you haven't eaten in a a few days in order to get everything in otherwise you'll be full by the time the main courses arrive. Second, get everything in. Everything was delicious and tasteful from the soup to the dessert. Some things familiar, others very strange for my tastebuds but all was enjoyable. So, yes, I did think it was a bit expensive for this but now that I have sampled, next time I will just dive in for the dishes I like and nothing else."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious, fresh Indonesian food. We had a great time. All that we ordered came out quickly and offered outstanding flavors and notes.  I would certainly recommend and for sure will go back during one my next stays in Montreal"}
{"text":"Great food!  The beef dish with steamed rice called Rendang Daging was succulent and very delicious. The lamb skewers and lamb curry dish with steamed rice, Sate Kambing was pretty good too. The portions were huge and we had no room for dessert.  Some negatives of the restaurant include its slow service and subpar appetizers. The chicken dumplings we had for appetizer were not that great. They were bite sized and there were only four in one plate."}
{"text":"Went again on Monday night - both dishes were amazing once again.  The consistency will keep me returning!"}
{"text":"The most authentic Indonesian restaurant my wife and I have been to in North America (the other 3 being in NYC, Berkeley, and Philadelphia). Actually the one in Philly was pretty authentic, but wasn't nearly as good.   We had a tempeh dish with a sambal that pretty much matched what my wife's family makes. The otak-otak was also a highlight. I had never had it before, but thought it was delicious (wife concurred).   Overall no complaints. Definiteily recommend if you're wanting Indonesian food."}
{"text":"Great tasty food and good service. What else can I ask for. Highly recommend. My wife is Indonesian and she also thought place was authentic and great."}
{"text":"Mes amis et moi avions lu de bonnes critiques sur Yelp et avons d√©cid√© d'essayer le Gado Gado. Nous avons √©t√© tr√®s impressionn√©s par la beaut√© et la qualit√© des plats. Nous pouvions difficilement comprendre comment c'√©tait possible que la nourriture y soit si bon march√©. J'y suis retourn√©e une bonne dizaine de fois depuis, avec mon copain, ma famille et mes amis et nous avons toujours √©t√© tr√®s satisfaits par la nourriture, la propret√© des lieux et le service. Le serveur nous reconna√Æt et se rappelle m√™me de mes petites intol√©rances alimentaires (certains plats, bien que non certifi√©s comme tels, son offerts sans gluten; je prends tout le temps le poulet au cari rouge). C'est un de mes restaurants favoris √† Montr√©al!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I must say that the food here is amazing! If you're looking to excite your palate and explore new cuisines, this is the place to go!  The atmosphere is very subdued and quiet. The waiter is always willing to take the time to explain any item on the menu. The hot sauce is so good, I had to splurge and take some home with me! I know I will be going back once I run out of their hot sauce at home!  Do yourself a favor and visit Gado Gado!"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed by Gado - especially in light of the high reviews. When I arrived at just after 6:30, it was rather deserted, though it seemed that they also served the food at the pub downstairs. The ambiance was \"A-OK\" as the 3-stars on Yelp is labeled, and the food was quite meh too.   The curry was watery and the lamb was slightly tough for my dish, without much to distinguish it for its price. My friend had a salad which was quite odd, and seemed to be a smorgasborg of all different things topped with a heavy peanut sauce. To be honest, the name eludes me, but I guess avoid the salads in general"}
{"text":"The food had a ton of lemongrass in it which the rest of my party disliked but I loved the flavours! We had the following: -Laksa: good serving, a lot of \"stuff\" in it (noodles, vegetables, etc.) A lot of lemongrass and not very spicy. Great on a cold day!! -Bakmi goreng: delicious! Yummy with a bit of hot sauce.  -Beef rendang: very strong beef flavours which were overall very delicious. COuld have used more rice.  -Bakpao Gapit: we ordered the pork ones and they were AMAZING. Would go back just for ten of these.   The music was very repetitive and gave everyone a bit of a headache. The waitstaff were kind of helpful with the orders but pushed the sate too much."}
{"text":"The food is ok. A nice room, decent service and reasonable prices. I had a lamb stet hat was ok...would not order again. The apps are good and the soup was very good. Will go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent Food. Decent ambiance. Poor (no) air conditioning but hey, we're not in US anymore   We had steamed pork belly buns which were out of this world, seared duck and braised beef which were excellent, and laksa (a curry soup with chicken, egg, tofu, sprouts etc...) which was interesting but not quite my cup of tea. The owners were courteous and the service efficient. Definitely worth visiting.   P.S. My French vocabulary consists of 3-4 words and I was not immediately demoted to a second class customer. That in and of itself earns this restaurant an extra star"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars from me. Super nice, waiter, HALAL, authentic indonesian food in Montreal, and it's not a hole in the wall! I like the decor here, and it'sa  clean restaurant. I like their presentation and decor too. We got the lamb skewers and beef jerky for appetizer. Highliy recommend; lamb was super tender, and I've never had jerky like this before. Right amount of spice.  I ordered the rendang for main dish and tried the indonesian rice pudding for dessert. The rendang was very flavorful and beef tender. I liked everythign we tried!! Would def go back if i'm ever in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"I was at a meeting in the area and had time for lunch, pulled out the app and followed it to the local #1 lunch spot, hello Gado Gado! There is no sign outside so you do need to be looking for the address or at least know that it's above N Bar, which in itself is a pretty tucked away spot so good luck! Both the bar downstairs and the Indonesian haven above are wildly worth your adventuring though, so go for it.   The lunch special is super affordable, if you work or study near Concordia check this out: for $12 I got 2 fresh perfect little spring rolls, and a lovely plate of beef rendang (rice, salad, and a soft, slow cooked, spiced beef) and green tea ice cream. Totally delicious and left me feeling healthy and happy.   The room is lovely, calm and chill, and the service was friendly, thoughtful and prompt. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"taste ok, rice noodle was a bit over cooked, skewers were great but price a little high for what you get. Been here twice, not sure if I would come back for a third time though."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't rated this place yet, I've been here at least 10 times.  I always end up ordering the same things the soto ayam soup and fried chicken dumplings for starters and beef rendang with the seared mackerel for entrees. I always bring a friend to share everything with.   The beef rendang is melt in your mouth delicious, you can taste the hint of cocount mixed with the spices. I never get tired of it. Everything tastes fresh and homemade.   It's also close to the metro which is very useful during those cold winter months when you don't feel like walking for a long time.  Only drawback is I find they reduced the portions over time but then again it's pretty cheap so I can't complain."}
{"text":"A rather tame,plain and unsubstantial venue for under seasoned and innocuous versions of Malay cuisine.   The signature dish Gado Gado was a bitter disappointment in it's unsuccessful attempt to even slightly replicate the simplest version found on the streets of KL....  No layering of flavor or heat was apparent.  Papaya salad was tart with a lime base did not realize any other base flavors until we asked  for some fish and chili sauces to actually  season it as it should have been seasoned from the kitchen.  Beef Rendang while maintaining the correct texture and umami to a degree was never the less disappointing as the flavors never had enough time to marry or bloom.  The Laksa was tragic in it's feeble attempt to mirror anything even resembling a traditional assam Laksa.     This is not a Malaysian restaurant but rather a pale and unsatisfying shadow of what a Malay restaurant should be..... I'll give it  6 months before it turns into another Thai take out shop front slinging gummy  Pad Thai to inebriated tourist and broke McGill students who happened to stray from the ghetto.....  Skip it......"}
{"text":"Tasty food - but be forewarned - the style of food is from Palembang - so if you are expecting the sweet and super spicy flavors of Jakarta - you will be disappointed. Still definitely worth eating here!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to an Indonesian resto and it won't be our last. Our server was helpful with describing the cuisine and making recommendations. We started with the beef and grilled fish cakes. Then on to shrimp and fish for our entrees. So yummy! We were even privileged to have the Indonesian ambassador dining there the same evening. When we return to Montreal, we'll eat there again."}
{"text":"Pros: The owner and ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel Mr. Sudaman - he is patient and explains the spectacular Indonesian menu with a friendly demeanor and does not sound pushy or short. I asked him over 10 questions and he helped me select the right dish. The food. We had a few dishes over 2 dinners (Gulai Kambing, Rendang Daging, Bakpao Gapit) with Cendol.  Cons: None. This one is a winner. (I am super frugal in handing out 5 stars).   I was very impressed with the hardworking Mr. Sudaman (I think he prefers Aman) who runs the whole restaurant and who explained a lot of new dishes to us. We were in Montreal for 4 nights, and expected to gorge on French classics, but were so blown away by the Gulai Kambing (with the most tender lamb I've ever eaten) that we had to come back for an encore. I wish there were more top notch Indonesian restaurants in New York and San Francisco that truly recognize the subtle and strong flavors of the archipelago."}
{"text":"Every dish we tried was cooked to perfection with such a complex and subtle flavouring. It's flavours that you can't even imagine until they're dancing along your palette.    The service is fantastic and quick. The restaurant is warm the Indonesian music is absolute a treat to the dining experience.   If you haven't been here then you're missing out on an incredible culinary step in your foodie life!"}
{"text":"There are very few Indonesian restaurant in Montreal so I was very excited to try this one out. The place is a bit hidden on mackay street, and the decor is very simple and relax. The service was nice but nothing exceptional.  We had the tamarind soup to start with and the pork buns. The soup was tasty but nothing out of the world and the pork buns were fat. If you want good pork buns, I would rather suggest to go to Satay brothers or restaurant Ha. Then came the mains: shrimp and mango wrapped in a banana leaf and the braised beef. The shrimps were tasty but overcooked in my opinion. The braised beef was my favourite out of all dishes. For everything, the bill came out to 55$ tax and tips included, which I found a bit overpriced given that I was still hungry at the end (ok, I do have a big appetite :p)."}
{"text":"I ordered Tempe penyet, gulai kambing and sayur asam, all tasty and authentic. For the dessert, I had kue lapis, love it! Will come here again next time visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Tr√®s belle exp√©rience! Local propre et d√©cor√© avec go√ªt. Un soupe chaud au lait de coco a fait vraiment du bien √† ce moment de l'ann√©e! Servi par monsieur propri√©taire tr√®s gentil qui m'a montr√© tous les ingr√©dients dans ma soupe que je ne connaissais pas: jacquier jeune, chayote etc. Un repas juste assez rempli qui ne donnerai pas l'insomnie de l'indigestion toute la nuit! J'y retournerai s√ªrement pour go√ªter les autres plats!"}
{"text":"Went to check this place out yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. The decor was fresh and clean, with a small bar. I loved the cozy ambiance and friendly vibe. Overall the food was was delicious, and maybe a tad bit bland. But delicious regardless. On service It was polite and I only didnt understand the pace of serving the items having given them one by one :S A bit unsual but not much to complain there. Overall a good restaurant that is promising in its menu."}
{"text":"Tr√®s bon, poulet sauce soya sucr√©e, brochette de crevettes dans peau de banane et nouilles frites au poulet, les entr√©es de canard, dumpling et soupe aussi. Tout est bon, frais, go√ªteux ! Abordable. Tr√®s bon service"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that if I were a student at one of these colleges nearby, I would drag my frinds here once a week or so. The food is delish, tastes homemade, and a really good deal for a set lunch or tasting menu.  Usually I roll my eyes when a lesser known Asian ethnic cuisine restaurant gets hyped up, but Gado Gado really delivered to my expectations! Great place for a fun lunch during a visit to the museum of fine arts."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with two other friends, we decided to order few things off the menu and share. The food overall was good, the restaurant is pretty basic. While I enjoyed the food, I am not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"You know how you check Yelp for the hidden gems in a new city? This is one such gem. The food was fantastic, flavourful, and well priced. It was not as crowded as some of the restaurants on the main drag, but don't let that deter you. Well worthwhile."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to trying this restaurant, since my mom is Singaporean and I'm very familiar with many of these dishes (that are also popular in Singapore). Gado Gado is a nice and quiet space, understated with subtle southeast Asian accents and decor. The food is mouthwateringly delicious and packs a punch in flavour. The server (owner?) was friendly and efficient. We ordered classic dishes and started off with a single chicken satay skewer. It was nicely grilled with a tasty peanut sauce, although the sauce was almost too sweet. My main dish was the Laksa soup with noodles, chicken, and boiled egg; my husband ordered the beef rendang. Both had complex flavours with lots of spices, and we barely said a word to each other [except \"this is SO good\"] before finishing our plates. The soup was light yet filling, the beef was fall-off-the-bone tender that came with a delightfully refreshing salad. Unfortunately, we were too full to order dessert, but based on our experience, we'll be back again to try many other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't write many Yelp reviews, but I think Gado Gado deserves more press. We started with the otak-otak ikan (fish cakes), the signature Gado Gado salad, and the chicken dumplings. The fish cakes weren't up my alley, but my wife enjoyed them. The salad and dumplings were divine.  For the main course we had no regrets about the ayam bakar kecap (chicken in sweet soy sauce). I've rarely had chicken so perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Came with six friends for dinner. Place just opened and smells new. Kitchen staff still a little slow, but the food is great and I think they'll pick it up.   Everything was prepared with care - really, every dish was quite delicious and interesting and they will bring you extra hot sauces if you need it.   Had various rolls, spicy marinated beef, a pork bun sandwich and a delightfully prepared whole tilapia that was exquisite! I will definitely be going back and heartily recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service. Have had a number of menu items and all are delicious! The waiter was attentive and helpful. The sponge cake dessert is yummy!"}
{"text":"Honestly, not a bad choice for dining. The food is pretty standard, and presented well. One of the appetizers was a bit off on the taste, but it was not offensive. The portions are on the smaller side, and the service a bit slow as well. It's a quaint location, but the ambiance is quite plain."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing! We went for dinner, ordering the pork belly as an appetizer, which was so delicious and juicy.  Then we ordered the West Sumatra braised beef, which was very tender and full of flavor, and the mango shrimp, which had lots of shrimp.  The food presentation is lovely, with vegetables stacked artistically by the rice.  The portion sizes are enough to keep you full, but not likely to have leftovers.  Their lunch menu is also a great deal-- $11 for soup, entree, and a dessert.    Its true that the service is a little slow, but as they are a newly opened restaurant, there doesn't seem to be a need to additional wait staff yet.  However, the one waiter that is there is very courteous and attentive, and able to explain all the items on the menu to you."}
{"text":"No photos! All foods ordered were inhaled quickly! Everything that we ordered were the best Indonesian food we've ever tasted amongst all the indo restaurants that we've gone to all over California. Can't believe you guys are so far away from our home!!!  We ordered: empek2, sayur asem, bakmi goreng, otak2, the best sate daging ever!! And Soto Ayam to go.  Great food, great service. We will go back again whenever we are in Montreal for sure! I'm jealous with those people who live and work near your restaurant!"}
{"text":"Nice staff.....starters were totally tasteless.....main courses were pretty bland and not spicey at all....not the worst Indonesian food I've ever eaten but not good enough to eat there again."}
