{"text":"Three strikes and you're out!  I work close by so always looking for good lunch places.  First time in I asked for just a slice.  He heated a piece and added some extras since the selection they had was small.  The pizza was ok, not great, but he ran the transaction as a meal when I only asked for a slice.  I was not happy but I'll give the benefit of a second try.  Took a couple of friends for a second lunch and we all got a Calzone to go.  All of them were so undercooked that we could only eat the outer edge and the sauce they gave us tasted like stewed tomatoes straight from a can, horrible.  Strike three came last night when I was balancing my checkbook.  The transaction for the first lunch was run for $4 more than the tab.  Sorry but I don't tip when I order at the counter so the guy gave himself a nice tip."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome.  The crust is perfectly cooked and the sauce is amazing.  We ordered 3 larges and they couldn't have been any better.  The cornmeal in the crust is the key.  Did I mention the sauce was great?  Great Great pizza.  The best I have had.   The boneless wings were great along with the cheese sticks.  I can't wait to try the bufaloos.    The owner, Todd is very nice.   I talked to him about his new business and he knows his pizza.  Everybody should try this joint out.  It is GREAT!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is even open anymore. They've constantly put signs out front and even on the corner advertising deals practically giving their pizza away. I gave this place a try when it first opened around the corner, but one try was more than enough. When you're trying to grab a quick bite to eat on the way home from work, this isn't the place to go. Even for a cold pizza and calzone, I waited 30 minutes... that's plain ridiculous. The owner talked my ear off, not that that's a bad thing, but look dude, I wanted to be nice and support a local business, but once I left your shop and unfortunately tried your \"food\"(??) I was done."}
