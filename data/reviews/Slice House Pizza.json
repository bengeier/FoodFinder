{"text":"Had the caprese slice yesterday and loved it! Best part was it was loaded with peppers, tomatoes and cheese on a very generous crispy slice! We ended up bringing home a large cheese pie and enjoyed it just as much. We definitely will be regulars to this establishment."}
{"text":"So good! We've frequented all the local pizza joints and this one is by far our fav! Lots of options by the slice - certainly something for everyone. 

Can't wait until they get their beer and wine license."}
{"text":"Awesome new place in Huntersville! Quick casual fresh tasting pizza! The selection is great and the prices are cheap! Too bad they are closed on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, I love the sauce. They have about a dozen different style pies for pizza by the slice. Large menu with pastas and sandwiches. They even have a kids menu, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We found A great new place with Slice!  Servers were friendly and helpful. I had the eggplant parm came with salad and pasta and warm crusty bread!!!  Portion was generous but the flavor was thru the roof! I was a member of the CPC for sure.  Clean Plate Club.  If I had to find a tiny flaw it was the balsamic vinegrette.  A tad heavy on the live oil. Or maybe light on the balsamic. Any way we're going back for sure."}
{"text":"Tried it last night and it was good. To me the crust was a little thicker than what I would consider NY style."}
{"text":"First of all, never trust a pizza review from someone from Denver, CO (they just don't get it).   I'm a NY/NJ native and this is really good pizza.   I consider myself a pizza 'snob' and I will be frequenting the Slice House for sure.   Legit NY Pizza.   Crust is homemade and delicious (could be best around) and cheese is fabulous and sourced from Hackensack, NJ.   Nice atmosphere (well needed change from Lupies) and courteous staff make for a nice dining out experience.   Add local beers on tap and you have a real winner!!!!!   Looking forward to many years (and many slices) from the Slice House.   Good luck Giovanni and family!!!!"}
{"text":"Well today I was in the mood for pizza so on my way home from work I drove out of my way to come here to get a cheese pizza to bring home. This place was recommended to me by friends so I decided to try it out. When I arrived the place was filled with a large amount of screaming children, so I just wanted my pie and to be able to get out of the chaos. I ordered at 6:17 and day and waited in the Chuck E. Cheese romper room patiently. So after paying giving my name and being told they would call me when it was ready I started to get impatient. I knew they were busy and expected to wait a little longer but 45 minutes had passed to I asked the girl to check on my pizza which was ready and sitting on top of the oven for who knows how long. My mistake for not checking it before leaving the store but I came home with a cold pizza. soooo not happy. It might have been good if it was hot  but big disappointed after s long work day."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good pizza. 4 drinks, 12 garlic knots and a large pepperoni for $30!? Good deal if you ask me, especially when everything is yummy!"}
{"text":"Fun little pizza spot new to the downtown Huntersville area. I need To go back again before I can give 4 stars. There are new pizza spots popping up all over so I'm pretty critical with my pizza favorites. Enjoyed the inside which is very clean and open, with faux wooden tables that make a great background for picture taking! The soda machine wasn't working when we were in. What I love is that you can get pizza by the slice, which can be tough to find. It makes for a great opportunity to try numerous toppings. Go for The square Grandmas pizza, it's absolutely delicious! I also went with the chicken parm pizza, with some lightly fried chicken. The pieces are large and good sized. Fun spot to go for lunch. I wish they had an outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Slice House did a great job renovating the space which was home to Lupie's for years. A nice needed change for the downtown strip. I will preface my review by stating this is mainly about our experience dining in. We have yet to order to-go. 

Pizza by the slice is overpriced. The quality is decent enough but not for nearly $4 a slice. We aren't talking NY size slices. Flavors are decent and ingredients seem to be quality, but our pizza was served sort of lukewarm after supposedly running through the oven for reheating. Salad was delicious and the balsamic dressing was great. However, for 4 slices of pizza, two side salads, and two drinks I felt robbed for paying close to $30. The pricing is heavily skewed toward buying a whole pizza...which makes sense from a business perspective given how expensive the seating space rent probably runs. Service was good, but execution of reheating slices could be better. 

I would just recommend that if you're going with anyone other than yourself you just buy a whole pie so you pay less and and product is fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"Great New York pizza by the slice.  The slices are huge.  Got two on my first time in and took one home for dinner.  The buffalo chicken is a great mix of a lot of chicken, buffalo sauce and just the right amount of blue cheese to make it interesting.  The meat lovers is also good.  Sauce is flavorful.  I could stand a little more spice. Next time in I plan to try the chicken parmigiana pizza.  Knots were okay but save room for the pizza.  Staff and owners are wonderful.  Glad to have this place in the heart of downtown Huntersville.  I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"Pizzas range between $3.00 and $3.75/slice. They have a nice variety and the pizzas are very tasty. The inside is quite comfy considering they have metal and wooden seating. The only thing is I wish the prices per slice were a little cheaper. Would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to try this new establishment based on how dingy and dirty the previous restaurant here was. Clearly, the pizzeria did a total overhaul of the property. It's nice!  

Most of our take out order for 6 people were very happy with the food. Here is the overall breakdown:

5 stars for the margarita pizza
3 calzone
1 parking
5 service 
3 price 

I can see popping in for a slice but will not likely order for the whole family on our monthly pizza night....was difficult to park and very expensive pizza. Will be a occasional treat."}
{"text":"This place was so good! It's nice to have a place around here that serves by the slice.
I do have to say that the girl behind the counter was really rude and didn't say hello or smile at all. She was rolling her eyes at other employees.
Other than that it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta. I would expect nothing less from the owner. Baked penne was excellent and the bread to go along with it was fresh and warm. Ordered a plain cheese pie and it was delicious. Huntersville needed a local pizza place and this fits the bill!"}
{"text":"Stopped there a few weeks back. I had 2 slices it was great. I just had a whole pie and fried ravioli. Ravioli was good. Pizza sauce tasted like uncooked can sauce.! Will not be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Really good quality and as close to a real NY pizza as you can get in NC. You will be pleasantly surprised and no doubt come back again ,as I will, to this hidden treasure.

{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect from a pizza by the slice place given the location in Old Downtown Huntersville but the pizza was pretty good. We had a few different types of pizza by the slice and the winners are the fresh ingredients and veggies and the crisp bottomed flavorful crust. 

It's not expensive and I'd have to imagine the full pizza made to order tastes even better than the pre-made. We also had the house salad and the garlic knots. The house salad is great and the knots weren't the best I've had but were good. We'll be back and it's NEVER a bad thing to have more pizza options. Would be cool to see them get creative with their pizza ingredients and flavors, maybe a pizza of the week?"}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome, only heard others say the other items are average.   Pricing is good and again the Pizza is just short amazing, work this place in for your Friday/Sat night Pizza plan."}
{"text":"Great place to get some of the best pizza around. Some of the other pizza places in the area may have pizza by the slice for lunch but Slice House might be the only to to have it by the slice for lunch and dinner. They have a very wide range of choices and serve a lot more than just pizza, they even have a kids menu. I live a couple blocks away from them and glad to have them in the neighborhood. I'll be there very often."}
{"text":"Great family run Resturant. 

It's NY Style and as the name suggests- can order by the slice. 

We tried a few different styles - and the special of the day was the best. Anytime you name a slice after your grandmother- it must be good."}
{"text":"Glad to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood. Especially when they have pizza by the slice you can order quickly. 
I called in an order for a Medium Meat Lovers pizza and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I got to the restaurant in about 10 minutes and after paying my pizza was ready, the pizza being ready in less than the quoted time is a plus for me. 
The owner was really nice and came to the register to help apply the Yelp Check-In discount! Its always nice when you get a Yelp discount.
The medium pizza was pretty big and had to be put in a large pizza box and it easily fed my party of 3. The pizza was cut in big slices which only allowed me to eat 1 slice. The pizza was overloaded with meats and cheese. It was a true meat lovers pizza, I kind of felt like it was weighed down but we all really enjoyed the pizza. It really is NY style pizza and the crust is not thick. 
Cant wait to come back and try the other pizzas like the buffalo chicken and pepperoni."}
{"text":"Every slice I've tried here so far has been delicious!! My favorites are the chicken parm and Hawaiian!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. Slices of pizza or order a whole pie, New York style, salads , Stromboli, baked pasta, wraps,Hero sandwiches and other items are available. Wife had chicken Greek salad, it was huge and very good, I had a pepperoni pizza, very good.  Seating is sparse but that's good for business. Outside seating as well. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage/pepperoni pizza and steak/cheese hero.  To be blunt, steak and cheese was terrible.  There was plenty of room for more steak in that below average hero roll.
The pepperoni and sausage on the pizza was good, but unfortunately most of the crust was burnt.  The few bites that were not burnt were good...nice and chewy.  We will try the pizza again and hope for a better result.  As for the hero sandwiches, one and done."}
{"text":"Have been going since they opened and they are great. I love the pizza by the slice and the owner Cindy is great and always greets me by name. I don't have a big appetite so I love that I can just order a small slice and have a meal for less than $5.  They have come a long way adding TVs dessert and beer and I see they even have some Italian food on menu but I haven't tried it. Would be killer if they started delivering."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price!  Loved the pizza and spaghetti with meatballs was unbelievable!   Italian ice to finish was the perfect touch!"}
{"text":"Large fresh veggies and meat on great pizza is the way to my heart. We had the supreme slice, caprese and cheese. You can taste the difference in their mozzarella and sauce. We also had the shrimp Alfredo and added mushrooms which was outstanding. Seating was our only problem. It's small but when the weather is better we can grab slices and take it out on the green space. Glad to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that I'm from New York City and this is not New York style pizza by any means. I ordered a grandma pie and it was super soggy with an excessive amount of mozzarella cheese no parm what so ever!!  Once I picked up a piece everything fell of the crust. The garlic knots had a fake garlic taste, it was almost like a canned soap after taste which I've never tasted on the various garlic knots I've had in NYC. I really didn't want to write a bad review but the soggienes and all that mozzarella on a grandma pie is blasphemy!!"}
{"text":"Cute sleek interior, but small, maybe 7 booths and 7 tables. We only had pizza and it was enjoyable.  They do whole pizzas and as the name implies, pizza by the slice. 

Wife and I had Greek salads, we both enjoyed them. All the food that went by (chicken parm, meatball parm, etc.) looked delicious. Have to try them next time!"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch for our staff of 12 and they did a GREAT job. The pizza was excellent as well as the individual salads they provided. Highly recommend!

{"text":"This place really surprised me!!! We the pizza was delicious and the salads were so fresh and full of veggies!!! Definitely will add this place to our rotation!"}
{"text":"We opted for pizza for dinner last night and had high hopes for SHP. We ordered take out: a Sicilian pizza and a Supreme pizza. The pizza was fresh and hot but lacked flavor. The crust was dense and the cheese way too thick. My child commented that her jaw hurt from chewing and my husband quickly agreed. The sauce on the Sicilian didn't have much flavor, it just tasted like plain tomato sauce. I understand they're new, so I'm willing to give them another shot but I would come in for a slice and try something different. My advice to owners: you could save quite a bit of money if you scaled back on the cheese and offered those who like extra, extra cheese the option to pay for it."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has so many stars. I am from the north and this pizza has no flavor. They don't season the sauce or any of the toppings. Potential but needs some real help."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in a 30 mile radius.  Friendly service, reasonable prices and FINALLY somewhere that serves slices all day with a variety.   The owners are fantastic and are committed to an exceptional experience for all of their guests.   The make you feel like family.  SHP is definitely on my permanent rotation of places to eat.   I highly recommend the chicken parm pizza - it's superb."}
{"text":"Guessing New York style pizzeria means stand in line for fifteen minutes or so and wait until you get to the cashier to figure out what's on the menu (doesn't help when people call in wanting the menu read to them either.)
Came in to grab two slices and knots and get on my way. National Pizza day is probably the wrong day for \"quick\" because this place is packed and looking to stay that way for a while. Pizza is good, thin crust cooked all the way through lightly crisped and holds a fold without sagging (after nibbling off the tip.) Buffalo pizza is spicy but not ridiculously so with just enough cheesey blueness to keep your mouth happy! Garlic knots are knotty and garlicky and buttery on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. This is pizza of which to be proud!!"}
{"text":"The good: Pizza by the slice. Good pizza too, right up there with the other New York style pizza joints in the area. A good variety of styles. We tried the meat-lovers, buffalo chicken, white, and cheese pizzas, and all were good.
Needs some improvement: For a place named \"Slice House\" that featured Pizza by the slice, it would be good to have the price for a slice of pizza either on the menu board or displayed next to the pizza slices themselves. The system for ordering was a bit chaotic, but that's probably just growing pains.
Overall I recommend trying it out. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"For starters, thank goodness there is a new restaurant in this location. I think no matter what you wanted to end up there, at least there is something there!  Slice House is definitely competing against a lot of other pizza places, but I don't think any of them sell pizza by the slice and Slice House exceeds your choices with a large variety of many different pizzas. The renovations look great and everything is bright and clean. The owner was very friendly and busy. The girl up front (not the owner's wife) could use a reality check, yes I know they just opened but she was lost, anytime someone asked a question she didn't know and would have to chase the already busy owner down looking for her answer. The food was amazing! Pizza has awesome, garlic knots were great, and meatballs were great. Definitely check these guys out"}
{"text":"I ate here two days in a row.  On the first day I had a pepperoni and mushroom slice and on the second day I had a chicken parmasian dinner.  The pizza was good and I even enjoyed eating the crust, which I seldom do.  The chicken parm dinner was very large with two slices of cheese and sauce covered chicken, a very nice salad, large piece of bread and a side of spaghetti.  I liked all the items very much.  I took half of my meal home for lunch tomorrow.  (I personally much prefer angel hair pasta, but few restaurants offer it.)  I had no complaints about the food and even though the staff was nearly overwhelmed with the flow of customers, they were friendly and attentive to the seated customers.  My only minor and very personal complaint would be the hard seats.  I lack much padding in that area and the seats had none at all, but this seems common with many restaurants lately.  I expect to return many times to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"A much needed bit of newness inside a dilapidated building in downtown Huntersville. It's across the street from Discovery Place Kids which means you don't have to put the kids back in the car just to take them back out to eat.

The spot is comfy, they reused the booths from Lupie's, new tables and all new finishes. They have a dozen or more pies ready to heat up for you. They were still training staff so when we ordered the kids meal it came out 10 minutes after our pizza slices did. They need to work on the timing there.

The pizza was really good. My wife had pepperoni and mushroom and a slice of something else, but she could only do just a slice. I had the buffalo chicken and pepperoni + sausage slice. Both were really good. The kids split a tenders and fries meal. We got out of there for under $25 which for a family of four was great.

It wasn't the most amazing slice, but far from the worst. I think the value, location, experience will make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"I'm going to give Slice House another try because the pizza was good... just not great! The staff was super friendly and the owner seems great, but my slices were both served mildly warm (not a good move for reheated pizza) and the organization of the entire setup seems a bit off. I'll try again as I'm sure kinks continue to work themselves out here!"}
{"text":"Keeping it at 4 because it's a pizza place. I tried their Italian food tonight (chicken parm with spaghetti, salad, and bread). Breakdown:

Chicken Parm: Average
Spaghetti: Not recommended
Bread: Good
Salad: Small but decent 

Go with the pizza."}
{"text":"Eh. Was just ok. Big slices but tasted about the same as cheaper by the slice places go. Like the decor and the atmosphere, pleasantly surprised by the fact that they serve Italian ice. The only real thing that differed from other by the slice places is the gluten free and veggie options. My vegan friend loved this place because of how many choices she had. I think it's just ok. Especially for the price."}
{"text":"Our family of five had a great first time experience at SHP!  The food is really good and the environment was modern and fun. This is the perfect fast, fresh and delicious place for a quick family meal. The owners are doing a great job! Also a great location with free parking all around."}
{"text":"So bummed a good location is taken up by another pizza joint with no alcohol options. We ordered takeout on National Pizza Day. The woman didn't know how to work the POS system and made it very clear. She asked for our order about 10 times. That's fine new place. My husband went in to pick up the order at 2:45 with one other table in the restaurant. For a brand new location, you would think the staff would be excited for the opening and especially on National Pizza Day. Instead there was another woman in front who was asking for her slice. It was a standard cheese slice and the same woman at the register couldn't even remember. The owner came up and again didn't greet anyone just quickly threw a slice from another pizza together. No wow factor at all. When asked for parm to go they have no options. We get home pizza looks good. We both eat a slice saving the pizza for dinner and we both ended up with stomach aches. We gave it the benefit of doubt and went for another slice hours later- same result. We threw the rest away. We want to like it but it was basic and not worth the tummy ache."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday about 730. Not too busy. Food was quick and mostly good (Alfredo was really good!) with one major exception - ordered a Greek salad with no olives due to a major allergy. Got the salad with olives! Sent it back and got a 'new' salad which had...olives but not as obvious or visible. Since all the other food had arrived thought maybe setting it on the edge of the table not touched would draw attention of the employees standing 4 feet away but deciding what to put on the tv was more important. Oh well. Will likely try again but stick to things as they're on the menu"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza you will find in Huntersville! It's actually northern style, being from The north I know good pizza. Parking is a little difficult but def worth it. Tried a cheese and pepperoni slice. Staff friendly even on a busy night. Have had to go to Charlotte for good pizza but now we just have to go around the corner! Also a little strange to be closed on sundays when most games are on sundays when we usually get pizza. Owners should consider being open on sundays and it would be perfect. Delivery would be nice too, not sure if that's offered. Will def be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Boom to Slice House for the many variety of slices to choose from on our first dine-in visit and another boom for the delicious beef, pepperoni and onion pie we ordered to go a couple weeks later.

Slice House occupies the former. Lupie's location at the corner of Gilead and Old Statesville in downtown Huntersville and are an excellent addition to the LKN casual dining scene.  On the first visit we tried slices of White Pizza with spinach, Grandma's and Meat Lovers.  Every one of them were both big for the price and tasty.  For the Meat Lovers, they need to put it in all CAPS on the menu cause that is the meatiest version of one I've ever had.  I was imagining a whole pie of the ML weighing like 20 pounds!

Based on the quality of the pizza, (they also have pasta dishes, sandwiches...) how busy they were both on the dine-in visit and when I went to pick up the to go order, this place is going to do really well!"}
{"text":"The best pizza restaurant in Huntersville. I come here weekly and I've never had a bad experience. This is the best pizza I've had since I moved back from up North. They have beer here too but the pizza is so good you really don't need anything else with it."}
{"text":"Really great pizza! The cannolis were delicious. Interior was simple but beautiful. Staff was very friendly. Will definitely be returning!"}
