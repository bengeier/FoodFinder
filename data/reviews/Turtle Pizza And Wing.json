{"text":"Turtle Pizza has wide variety of options available.. and they are budget friendly tooo. The new Pan Pizza with 3 toppings is worth trying. The service is slow but pizza is nice...If u plan to go to Turtle Pizza go with sufficient time.."}
{"text":"Delivery was really fast, came in less than 30 mins. The pizza I got had ground beef, banana peppers and onion on it. It wasn't the best thing ever but it was okay. The wings I got were honey BBQ and they weren't very good at all. Felt like they just bought some store made sauce and dipped them in."}
{"text":"Good pizza and great wings!  Usually about 20 minutes.  Clean and tidy and reasonable prices.  Panzerotti's are huge but could be more generous with toppings.  The Ultimate bbq sauce is great for the wings, kinda smoky!  Staff is friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. I ordered a combo that included 2 3 topping medium pizzas, 2 700 ml bottles of pop, two dipping sauces, 2 pieces of garlic bread, fries and 10 wings for $22 plus tax and a delivery fee. I think I paid $30 all in. All food was delivered hot but I'd hope so as I live around the corner. Food was good quality in my opinion not the best pizza I've had but still very good can't beat the deal. The garlic bread was the store bought Texas toast garlic bread but again can't complain as I like that garlic bread. Fries where some of the best I've had. Wings where good way better then you would get from any of the chain pizza stores. This is going to be my new regular Price pizza joint."}
{"text":"Would get 0 stars but must give 1. Order 2 medium pizzas and 10 wings. This establishment is only a 12 minute drive from my place but took 2 hours to get to me from the time I ordered; and on top of that they only gave me 8 wings when I paid for 10!!! I will never again order from Turtle pizza. Their name says it all!!"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with the customer service that is provided by Turtle Pizza. I called for delivery at 9:30PM and by 50 minutes, I called back to check why my order was taking so long. They never answered my phone calls for another half an hour until I called with a different number. Thats when they revealed to me that they misplaced my order and that it was never made. The manager didn't really care to speak with me and offered a $3 discount through the employee over the phone. After waiting for over 1.5 hours and being a returning customer, I have to say that I feel mistreated by this establishment."}
