{"text":"Chicken pita had a very strange \"tang\" to it (and I know what tzatziki sauce is), burnt the bejesus out of the fried mushrooms (couldn't eat) and undercooked the 8 French fries that came with the pita. 

Maybe this is one of those places where only the wings and fish are edible?? I won't find out, because I don't like throwing away money."}
{"text":"Tasty food made fresh.  If I watched sports, I would get them to cater the wings from here.  Fried okra is good, not sure about the onion rings.  Big portions, small prices."}
{"text":"We liked the food, but they are currently closed.  There's a sign on the door that says they are closed for a family emergency from April 8th to April 15th.  It's now almost May but they are still closed.

We've had the wings, tenders and cheese sticks which were all good.  The fries weren't good, though."}
