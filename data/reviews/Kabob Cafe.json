{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today as I recently learned this place was open (it's in an old Taco Bell building). I never went to that Taco Bell, but when I saw this place looks like it might have good drive through Mediterranean style options- I was looking forward to it.  For starters, the outside of the building and drive-through area look a little bit grimey. They didn't spend any money redoing that. There are some vegetarian options on the menu and I asked which ones were vegan. I decided to order the veggie wrap with hummus. It was only six dollars and I thought that was pretty reasonably priced. It didn't take too long to get my order.  The pita bread was a little bit hard and not very good In terms of flavor.  The hummus was mediocre at best, certainly nowhere near any of the great hummus's I have had in my lifetime.  One plus about the sandwich was that there were hearty cuts of Persian pickles, red onion, tomato and lettuce -and the produce tasted fresh.  There was a weird dressing that I'm not sure was actually vegan, it was kind of runny and leaked out of my wrap quite a bit.  I don't think I would order this wrap again, the pita bread alone is enough to keep me away, like I said it tasted stale and was not flavorful.  I actually was craving rice -but they told me they put a little butter in their rice.  Not really sure if I would come here again to give something else a try. Service was OK.  So if I were to factor in that the location itself isn't very clean or nice, the menu isn't exciting, and I am not sure if I actually got a vegan item...I'm not sold as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"First time here and I just ordered 2 chicken wraps and I literally took one bite and threw my food away. They gave me dry chicken that seemed old from days ago DO NOT COME HERE. The only thing that was good was the fries honestly."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken plate.  Chicken seasoned well but dry.  This plate included rice, salad, humus and pita bread.  Hummus is tasty and fresh.  Baklava is not good.  Tasted like it was fried.  It was walnut filled but not layered."}
{"text":"Not impressed... wrap was stale, they forgot the sauce on my gyro took forever for what tasted like micowaved precooked food.  Wife loved her chicken salad.. looks fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"A new lunch spot near my work so I wanted to give it a try. I wound up going a few days to taste different items and it is a decent place for lunch. Beef Kabobs- Two beef Kabobs and I got the over a salad. They were nicely seasoned and of decent size.  Gyro Meat- I also had this over salad. I had to order extra meat as the original order didn't yield much. The flavor was mediocre, nothing to write home about. Better Gyro meat at some closer places, wouldn't order again. Staff was very friendly and the place was clean. Just a middle of the road experience both times for me."}
{"text":"The one star is just because the staff is friendly and helpful,otherwise I had food poisoning from this place ,not recommended !"}
{"text":"Lamb and beef dish were delicious."}
