{"text":"i have no idea why so many other reviews are knocking this place. i love it here.

- the coffee is delicious: the espresso is thick and strong and syrup-y the way it should be. i even saw someone in front order an \"almond milk latte\" with a swirly design on it - it looked and sounded very good.

-the home-made sweets are to die for: muffins and cookies and scones etc. are also all pretty large in portion (a definite plus compared to some places).

-the location right off of 17th ave is ideal

-there are plenty of windows making it a very well lit and comfortable place on a sunny day

-there are even benches outside (no tables, though).

granted, the place is usually busy, and there are definitely enough hipsters and alternative folk there. but there are also the neighborhood wack jobs that come sit outside on the benches, keeping you entertained. also, being forced to sometimes rub elbows or share a table with someone is a great way to, well, hit on girls.

overall it's everything i could ask for in a cafe. if they had more room inside, maybe a few couches or armchairs would be nice.

don't discriminate against this place because hipsters frequent it. there's a reason they come here. it's damn good."}
{"text":"I live about a block away but strangely don't go here too often, I think it's the giant crowd that's always outside - I'd rather go somewhere a bit less busy.

But the coffee is great! Their London Fog in particular completely won me over, the steamed milk is to die for! I don't know if they use whole milk or why on earth it tastes so much different then a regular coffee shop but it is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Beano Cafe is a hip and happenin' place just off 17th Ave that serves up kickass coffee, baked goods, and sandwiches in a fun relaxed atmosphere.  The vibe and the friendly service make this place a favourite of hipsters young and old alike.  

Pretty much any day of the week you'll find a lineup out the door and patrons idling on the benches out front, sipping their coffees and taking in the sights.  And when you have one of their locally roasted coffees, you'll know why. 
 
You can choose to sit inside at one of their many booth tables, or take your coffee to go, as I did.  Perfect for your morning stroll along 17th Ave."}
{"text":"Great local Calgary business. I quite miss it, but it is insanely hectic and busy - makes it stand out in Calgary like the coffee shops here in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Easily the best coffee in the city. I live near Phil & Sebastian's. This is better coffee. ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is packed because it has no geographical competition with the same vibe.

Cramped room where a gusting wind during winter will have you regret your stay and second guess your luck at finding that table. The coffee is mediocre and the attitudes are marred with over-worked staff.

Saving grace, their Vietnamese Coffee. Absolutely unbelievable."}
{"text":"Im a fan of sitting outside Beano on the bench on a summer night (open till midnight) with a Vietnamese coffee (half sweet). It keeps you buzzed for hours. Other than asian restaurants, its hard to find this drink in your average coffee joint. 
All types of characters are found at Beano. Regulars are typically greetedenthusiastically by the staff upon entrance ( I am not one of them). I like the cozy feeling of the cafe, and how they support local efforts around the city, such as Sidewalk Citizen's products and some girl's name I forget...they have her granola bars. Also picked up my copy of the Underground Film Fest schedule (excite!)
Its not somewhere to study, as its so busy, but again, back to the outside benches. Its a spot where random converstations with strangers begin. Suffice to say, I find it a great form of entertainment. On the way to a party, we stopped at Beano for a cold drink. I decided to wait outside, as I had a gigantic Tupperware full of homemade Sangria for a party we were headed to down the street, and I ended up staying for half an hour just chatting to the folks on the bench..the Tupperware of Sangria being the ice breaker for our converstations. 
Anyway, back to the drinks....not the cheapest around, but Id like to think I pay for the atmosphere that comes with buying a tea or cookie. 
A bonus is that they try to recycle as much as possible!"}
{"text":"How come no one ever told me about Chocolate Ginger Milk !?!?!    AND that it is at Caffe Beano?  

I am a die hard coffee drinker... rarely do I ever order a steamed milk.  It is like a \"Huh? What is that....\" moment.  

The other night I was out late and wanted a warm drink - too late to have any caffeine, so my friend recommended the Chocolate Ginger Milk.  It was super yummy.   I have been to Caffe Beano many times before.  I should have reviewed them then, as their coffee and sweets are really good.   But this latest drink that I had puts them in a different category."}
{"text":"I love Beano. The first day I went to Beano and ordered my \"Grande Americano Misto\", two things happened:

1. I was very politely told that Grande is a Starbucks thing, we only have small and large.
2. I was only charged $3 for the large misto!!!

The staff in Beano are friendly, the coffee is great, and the price is right. The baked goods are delicious, and I keep meaning to try the sandwiches, but I am never getting coffee at lunch time :( 

If you want to splurge, try the espresso chocolate milkshake. TO DIE FOR"}
{"text":"This is my favourite independent coffee place!  I didn't think I would love this location as much as I did as it didn't really look like anything special - but the coffee/lattes/teas were excellent, and the seating was really comfortable!  One thing that made me love this location so much more would be the latte foam art!  It's makes my cup of latte when I get a something pretty with my caffeine!"}
{"text":"I lived outside Caffe Beano for a good 8 months, Been there Once and never looked back.

From the outside - Not really the crowd I'd wanna be dealing with. Lots of Homeless people smoking all the time. I question whether or not they are actually patrons of this establishment. But nobody ever seemed to want to do anything about it. 

My question is - Why Caffe Beano when there is a Tim Hortons a block away?

I got a Cafe Mocha after waiting about 10 minutes in line, and a Bagel.

Service was Crap.
Coffee was Bland.
The Cream Cheese was gross.

I never looked back. 
This place is wildly popular, and I just don't understand the appeal."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in here for a coffee with 2 friends after walking by on 17th Avenue probably hundreds of times.  Not really sure why I've never stopped in, but it has finally happened.

The 2 friends mentioned were there for the espresso chocolate milkshake and since I am lactose intolerant, I had to find something else.  I was glad to see that Beano offers almond milk as an option, so I ordered a latte with that, but it does add up as they charge extra for the almond milk.  I also had a bagel with cream cheese, which was pretty standard.  My friends really seemed to enjoy the milkshake, so it might be worth a try for you non-lactose challenged individuals. 

As someone else mentioned, the staff were ok.  I wouldn't say stellar, but maybe they're just pretty busy all the time so they don't go out of their way for the best service.  Either way, it wasn't a horrible experience and I would probably stop by here again if others wanted to go.  The benches outside are great for people watching, which is a bonus... if you can get a seat."}
{"text":"Caffe Beano tends to attract the strangest crowd. You'll always be able to spot a hipster or three, a dog outside, a vintage road bike, a wannabe vintage cruiser bike and a a strange old man with a beard. I don't go to Beano often, but when I do every second Sunday, I usually receive mediocre service from a seemingly apathetic barista.

The lattes are good, but the iced teas are way over priced. I bought one the other day and it was so not worth it. I basically got pre-made iced tea in a dixie cup.

To be honest, it's not my favourite but I'll come back only because a) it's on my way to a friend's house, and b) I like their lattes - they serve up a good strong espresso. Also next time, can you smile at me when I smile at you?"}
{"text":"Coffee is sterling. The baked goods are great too. Service, while generally polite, can be a little on the slowish side. Happily it's worth the wait. One of the best poured lattes in Calgary.

Definitely keen on Cafe Beano."}
{"text":"A coffee shop is more than just the cofee. An eclectic crowd, a menu that has a variety of coffee and some non-coffee drinks as well as quick bites and sandwiches; Beano has it all. There's a changing list of coffee beans for sale as well. Very friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Americano of your dreams is made here. Atmosphere is normal coffee shop feel, but seriously, americano is uhhhmazing!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been a few times to Beano.

I'd rate the quality of the coffee ok, wouldn't say it is great. I've definitely had better lattes and capuccinos in other coffee shops in the area (i.e. 17th Avenue). The service is typically uninterested, which is reflected in the quality of their coffees as well.

I have never tried their baked goods, although their descriptions sound vegan-friendly and their sizes are quite large. Maybe a bit too large to entice me to try them. 

The shop is always busy and the ambiance inside is very hipster and quite noisy - not great for a study session or to do work on your laptop. In summer and not-so-cold winter days, it is not rare to have all sorts of characters (i.e. hipsters, bikers, yogies, regular joes, etc - you name it)  hanging out on the sidewalk outside. 

I wouldn't make Beano my go-to coffee shop but I'd consider paying a couple of visits a year in virtue of its convenient location."}
{"text":"Weird groovy spot where I get my coffee on.  Don't know why maybe it's the brown sugar or the weirdos serving the black juice but there is nothing like a cup of coffee from beano.   

Lines can be rough and watch out for that Alan guy out front.... 

For those not looking for a laptop crowd but a conversation coffee this is the place."}
{"text":"I LOVED Caffee Beano. I've only been there once and my coffee was fan-tas-tic. What a great vibe with a diverse group of people. Plenty of hipsters who make their hair look effortlessly messy. 

I love their massive windows with their views of mature trees and an urban environment. It's such a great place to go and people watch. Delightful!!"}
{"text":"Perfect coffee with a cool eclectic crowd and great tunes. A great place to chill out. 

I hear great things about their espresso milkshake so I'll be dropping by some hot summer day soon."}
{"text":"Soy lattes & nonfat lattes are absolutely delicious! Best I've had in Calgary. Tends to get crowded..but that's just a sign for good coffee. Love this little cafe!"}
{"text":"The place is great if you like waiting is long lines for mediocre coffee and exceptionally expensive food. Not really worth your time but it is where the cool kids hang out so if you are wandering around in the AM and want to go to the place to be seen (or scene) or looking for a pretty good place to people watch then Café Beano might be the place."}
{"text":"I like Beano's. They make a decent latte and it's a nice establishment. I especially like the outdoor seating which makes for a communal atmosphere on a warm weekend afternoon. 

I do find it takes a little longer than average to get my coffee made here, but that's probably because it's always so busy.  Nice place.

Will try the Vietnamese coffee next time."}
{"text":"The chocolate espresso milkshake is one of the most amazing things I've tasted in the entire city, but their lack of accepting credit card is a pain in the butt. I know credit is much more expensive for businesses to accept than debit, but it's super inconvenient. Maybe I'm just being difficult, but it's how I pay for everything."}
{"text":"I am a super big coffee drinker and they've never let me down on the coffee end of things, however i find myself often getting the hot chocolate here, it's to die for!! good location love going here on the weekends"}
{"text":"For Calgary this is 5 star venue for quality of coffee. The staff is very quick, friendly, and responsive. Compared to other cities this doesn't stack up, but I'm upgrading it since it's the best you'll find in the city. 

Had many coffee related beverages, gotten a few types of beans to go as well."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very trendy, artsy type of baristas brewing creativity into your drinks. Very cool, trendy place you'll want to be having you Java fix at. Definitely smooth espressos and perfectly frothed milk. Totally my kind of place"}
{"text":"Nice place friendly staff ! They make great coffee. Its always crowded! Already popular in Calgary I love this place!"}
{"text":"There are a handful of places within the city that provide true, fine coffee. Beano is certainly one of them.

Ive read some reviews about bad service on here. The staff are wonderful and if I think back to my last visit to TIm Hortons, they didn't exactly smile and give me a foot rub.

Atmosphere and food are great on top of that.

If you feel like people watching, meeting good folks, need a break and an excellent espresso. Do it.

If youre looking for a double double and wanna be in and out in 2 minutes well...You know what you need to do."}
{"text":"The quality of the coffee and unique menu items are consistently great. The Beano muffins and cookies are to-die-for.. For a serious caffeine hit a Beano Buzz does the trick! It is as busy, long established hangout for a variety of types including; hipsters, artists, wealthy locals as well as down and out looking characters. This place has personality. It is usually busy and downtown parking is sparse so if you drive, then go on a Sunday when parking is free and delicious morning muffins are fresh. I don't think they have wifi. I usually take to go.."}
{"text":"If you want a really good Americano, you go to Giuseppes' or Murcato even Kawa.
 
Beano on the other hand is passé to the extreme. What used to be a place where one could sit and listen to the Mount Royal College a capella singers warm up in the morning, classical music and Bernard Callibeaut in your scones, a place where artists could actually discuss art because you could hear yourself over the loudspeakers, has become since the loss of its wonderful owner and manager, Rhonda (and now it's a conglomeration of investors running the operation), this echoing cave of poorly supervised dilettantes who stand around chatting making mediocre drinks with mediocre products, while the line up grows and grows, and is roundly ignored. 
 
But what has happened to Beanos is the same that happened to the Roasterie and Planet coffee shops. It has been taken over by intrusive smokers on the outside seats and intrusive music on the inside. Regulars living on AISH with no place to go during the day, have encamped with their anxious and hostile disease symptoms, lashing out at the slightest provocation or assertion. Eastern Europeans of no obvious source of income have taken over the outside all day and evening yelling at each other in some home dialect and smoke in huge volumes. Sometimes a fight breaks out. What used to be a liberal place friendly to the arts has become this conservative money machine where even the bathrooms have keys. Conservatives love to control things in their anxiety, especially, who does their defecating and where.... So basically you go through this cordon of intrusive street people smokers, to stand in a line up where you are ignored by the staff, to be served a mediocre bitter Americano, prepared laboriously one at a time while 3 staff chat and watch one person work on a machine that can do 4 at once....to try to find a seat where someone is likely to join you to scream over the music to his friends at the next table because he has a divine right as a regular to sit at your table and be intrusive, because he needed your table in his sociopathic manner and surely you won't mind. 
 
That's most of the day. In the morning it is quieter, when the uber-yuppi ultra-conservatives from Mount Royal come down the hill for their coffee and crossword, to one up each other about their retirement and investment plans, which seem to mostly consist of unimaginatively (no surprise there) of sitting in a coffee shop and doing a crossword wondering what they did with their lives. 
 
There are some holdovers from the former management, like a great meat loaf sandwich, and the occasional 500 or so calorie muffin that isn't raw in the middle, but the warmth and friendliness is gone, literally. The place is freezing in the winter time like an adult child of an alcoholics home, lending a sense of the familiar I suppose to the rampant cigarette addicts, who you know, like to breathe on you and cuddle up real close, and listen in on your private conversation while you drink your mediocre coffee that you waited a very long time for while the staff cranks the tunes, in an apparently self defeating effort to force people to leave to free up some seats, as a solution to the line up and cash flow problems. One could only guess. More likely, the staff just wants to listen to loud music and not work very hard and get tipped for the abuse they heap upon the public, a strategy that passes for service in a place over run by greaser hippies using the premises as a halfway house for the mentally ill. 
 
Enjoy your coffee. (it's not that good)."}
{"text":"I finally made it over to Caffe Beano, and I honestly can't see what all the hype is about.

I mean, yeah, the location is great, it's right on 17th Ave., but the minute you step inside, it's overwhelming. It's always packed, and inside it kinda looks like a cafeteria meets a prison kitchen. I know, that's harsh. But it's tiny, it's packed, and it's VERY plain. It's not the kind of place I would want to sit, relax, and spend hours on end.

The crowd is very 'Kensington-ish'. Lots of the 'alternative'/'hippy' type. 

The drinks are the standard and the prices are the same.

Overall, not a place that I'd spend my time. I've been once, and that's enough for me."}
{"text":"This place took me back to 2008. Back when being \"hipster\" was all the rage. I guess it still is? At least for some. If urban outfitters were to be a cafe this is IT! This is literally a mecca for those kind of people. I was hungry so I chose a drink and a meatloaf sandwich that costed me 7.25... it was okay but for the price it was kind of a reach. Before coming, i learned this place didn't have wifi which i was apprehensive about. Part of the reason I tried this place was to find if this was true. Alas it was. Definitely not my vibe or kind of cafe. Maybe it is but i don't understand the \"hipster appeal.\" I feel it's so tired and outdated."}
{"text":"It had been 12 hours since I ate, between working all morning and then flying to Calgary eating had sort of taken the back burner. So I was entirely famished by the time  I stumbled into this cute cafe. I was immediately walking back out the door when I saw they specialized in crepes. I have not had a single good crepe experience, ever. I walked down the street hoping for better and realized there was nothin else to grab, so humbled I returned. 

The vanilla bean latte over ice was a great little pick me up. Delicious and not overly sweet. While I think their specialty was tea, I am a full fledged coffee whore, so this was the pick for me. I followed the caffeine fix with a dreaded crepe of the tuna variety. What a delightful little tuna bouquet they served me, I was enchanted with the wrapping and immediately dove in. While the concept and presentation were ingenious, it was a bitch to eat. There is no starchy goodness to hold up the sides, so I was constantly chasing a stray piece of lettuce or escaping tuna bite. I also noticed that the crepe itself was a little too sweet with the tuna. But would probably be fantastic with their many dessert crepe selections. 

Bottom line...while I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, my stomach is full and I'm not completely covered in tuna, so an \"A-ok\" from me."}
{"text":"I love Caffe Beano. 

- It was the first nice coffee shop I was brought to by family friends when I first landed in Calgary three years ago. It was warm summer nights, the coffee was amazing and 17th Ave was poppin'.

- It was the only public spot I had dared to hang up a YYC Burger Week poster earlier this year. When I had asked the staff meekly if I could, they casually said \"sure, just find a spot and put up anything ya want\". And I had. It was THRILLING! Oh, AND it had gotten noticed by cool people who later on wanted to dress up in costumes and become mascots of YYC Burger Week. NBD.. 

- It is also the spot where I had spotted the two most darling Japanese Chin puppies outside. I've admired those dogs for so long, and there they were.. Not one, but TWO of the most precious little things ever! LOVE!!!!

I'm sorry if you dont see the relevance of these things to my review. Point is, this place is awesome. They make the most delicious caffeinated beverages, and almost every time I go, something awesome happens. 

5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"The last time I was at Caffe Beano, I had a brewed coffee, it was good, I would have recommended it to a friend. And because of these reasons I decided to come back.

This time I had a Vietnamese coffee and it blew my mind. I can still taste this coffee, and it has been a week. It caused me to coffeegasm, it was remarkable, mostly why I am remarking on it now. It was so smooth a creamy and had good strong coffee flavour and it looked pretty and it just left me feeling so warm and fuzzy inside. I considered having two that day but I didn't want to be violently shaking on the train ride home. 

And as previously mentioned, the atmosphere is really nice, lots of wide open windows and seating, on a sunny day the place just glows. I found it very easy to sit with my computer and work away.

Go to Caffe Beano, drink their drinks, they are really good."}
{"text":"convenient because it's almost always open when you need it. 

Never been impressed with the coffee and it's a coffee shop, so that gets major minuses. Maybe they're a 4 and not a 3 star place, but i just can't bring myself to give them a 4."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time in ages, and I have to say, it was a far cry from my previous experiences here. Friendly, smiling staff, for one! On a late Sunday afternoon, it was quiet inside, easy to find a seat by the window, and my Almond Milk London Fog was served to me in a cup the size of a cereal bowl. Delicious! Reasonably priced, too. 

I'll try to come back more often now :)."}
{"text":"They have amazing shakes. The chia is my favourite but it is only available in summer which is quite disappointing. The environment is cozy and they always have nice music playing. The seating area isn't always kept very clean and the tables are wobbly. It's a nice coffee hang out for people who want to meet new friends or read a novel."}
{"text":"Visited this spot to grab coffee with a friend, and to be honest, what has taken me so long to try it out is because it does not have wifi. This is a place where you go to disconnect from social media and visit with a friend or write in a journal. This is not the place to bring your laptop to and work. 

I ordered a latte, and it was excellent. I also appreciated the foam art and the fact that it's served in a bowl versus a cup. If you want to catch up with an old friend and have uninterrupted quality time, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout with friends, the music is always great and the coffee is served in a huge bowl! A good value ahah. Everything there seems to be made fresh and it always has wonderful employees, I will be back to get a latte and breakfast again soon. The coffee wasn't super hot that's the only reason it's 4 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee place to read, meet friends, study, and you guessed it, drink coffee. Good \"first-date\" spot also :)"}
{"text":"Caffe Beano is 17th Ave's most hip coffee shop. This place is character central, from hippies to hipsters to shirtless daydreamers. The crowd is laid back so security is not an issue. But I wouldn't study or work here because it always seemed to be busy.

The coffee is great, their sugar/cream station has real brown sugar in a jar, I would always prefer not to use sugar packets, not because I'm environmentally friendly, but because my lazy fat thumbs don't want to go through all the trouble of tearing those pesky things up. They have a consistently delicious meatloaf sandwich that I always order, it's served with tomato, hot mustard, and what I believe is a unique ingredient- bread.

The people behind the counter were always friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"It's been my favourite coffee shop for years. Can get a little busy in the mornings, but that just means it's good! Somehow the bagels with cream cheese and tomato they make are the best ever!"}
{"text":"Caffe Beano is one of those Calgary gems that I love but seldom manage to visit. With an excellent selection of snacks and beverages - including the delicious teas, my personal favorite - and hours that make us night owls happy, it's the go-to location for an active, do-nothing evening. I always 'find myself' at Caffe Beano - it's close, it's open and it's inviting. Full of character and never disappointing, I'm going to make a point to go there more often. Deliberately."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago after a ballet class and enjoyed the fact that it is open late. I ordered a milkshake and was taken back by the price being so high yet it coming in a small plastic disposable cup. I guess it is a coffee shop but a little more effort could be made here. Well once I tried it the cup no longer mattered, it was delicious. I will be going back tonite in fact for that reason alone."}
{"text":"I love Caffe Beano! Best coffee shop in Calgary for sure. I almost feel like I shouldn't write this review so less people will know about it but then I feel like it's almost a sin to not share such a lovely place with others. It's also quite difficult to hide a place like this when it's right off of 17th ave. 

Everything I've had at Caffe Beano has been good. I get the americano regularly but we've also had the milkshake, ginger hot chocolate and tea mistos - all which were awesome. Their baked goods are also good, I love their cookies.

The staff is always friendly and very quick - even though the line for your drink may be long, I find that they are always very fast at making your drink, without sacrificing quality! I wish I lived close by so I could get a drink every other day :)"}
{"text":"Coffee anyway you want it.

I'm a huge fan of coffee in all its forms, and this is one of the best places to get it. Having only visited this location once, I was very impressed and can't wait to go back. The benches were very busy on a Saturday night as well as the interior of the shop. I ordered an iced americano to cool off and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll be back to try the half sweet Vietnamese coffee that Mia T. talks about in her review.

Want a coffee? On 17th? You won't find a better place."}
{"text":"This place has the best coffee in town.... their vietnamese coffee is an addiction. This place is often packed, and will give you a old neighborhood coffee house feeling (unlike the fancy chains)"}
{"text":"A-OK for me. It was busy when dropped by. Service was good but not fantastic.  Coffee was good but not fabulous. Decor was good but traffic flow at the door is congested.

Would I return? Yes
Would I recommend?  If you'rer in the area this is an option."}
{"text":"Still my go to for a coffee in the Beltline after all these years. The location being right around the corner from a newsstand is perfect.  I could pick up my NewYorker and chill with a good coffee and a cookie.  Their regular drip is a good blend and their espresso is strong but not bitter.  The cookies and other nibbles are well priced and delicious.  Inside is multi level and well laid out with lots of window seats.  There are benches outside for a casual place to sit and always water bowls for the pups. I get decent wifi so it's been a good place to work as well."}
{"text":"After 5:30 AM Barre class I needed a coffee stat, there wasn't a line up when I arrived but there were people sitting enjoying their coffee and morning paper. I grabbed a latte and a bran muffin to go. Warm and cozy vibe, decent menu and baked good selection. Tucked around the corner just off 17th they are worth stopping in at if you need to get your coffee fix."}
{"text":"Caffe Beano is a great location to head for coffee. It can get quite busy and sometimes I wish it had more seating (and less awkward, as in the benches facing the kitchen where people walk by to get to the back of the cafe) but it does well with the space allotted. 

I've had the espresso chocolate milkshake, which was excellent, as well as double americano and the \"cold remedy.\" Everything was very good. The staff is friendly. 

And, it's open late - until 11. Which is great, as most coffee places in the area close down at 9 or 10."}
{"text":"Can you rate zero stars?

Ever since the original owner bought the place back from Rhonda this place has fallen off my map and I am proud to say has been on my personal 'embargo list' since I was shooshed away by one the co-owners when she opened the doors one morning to collect the newspapers some two years ago.

Keep walking past this place - over-rated.

Strap your shoes on and head to the core to Artigianno on 6th Ave + 3rd Street SW"}
{"text":"I have only been to Caffe Beano a handful of times and I am not sure how great this review is going to be because of this but I went there a few weeks ago and it was probably the best service I had ever received.

I am usually not that big of a coffee drinker so I am not that familiar with what coffee is which and things of that nature. I asked for some clarification on the coffee menu and the lady working there seemed more than happy to help me out. She explained to me what the different coffees were like and help me make a decision in ordering probably one of the best coffees I have ever had.

I have been here I believe two other occasions and the service was okay but nothing to write home about so I was a little hesitate to go back because of this. The last time I was in here was such a fabulous experience it actually made not only my day but probably my entire week.

I believe that Caffe Beano is a nice little coffee shop on 17th ave with good coffee, good service and the prices seem to be fair and based on my experience a few weeks ago I have no problem going back and recommending them."}
{"text":"Visited beano for the first time and fell in love! I had the beano buzz and by far one of the most amazing espressos I had. Will definitely visit again when I come to Calgary next time."}
{"text":"A local institution. Apparently the busiest independant coffee shop west of Toronto.

The coffee is good, the staff are usually polite (if always, always, always busy) and the sandwhiches and baked goods hit the spot. And the milkshakes are to die for.

If there's one thing I don't like, it's that Beano is always packed. With everyone from Mount Royal yuppies to musicans and artists to a gang of Russians constantly smoking on the sidewalk.

That isn't to say I don't often enjoy running into people there, I do.

Just that for a quiet, solo coffee, or intimate conversation with a friend, you're best off grabbing your drink to go.

Finally, whether you stay there or not, you're supporting a local Calgary business versus something like Starbucks."}
{"text":"Are those soup bowls they serve their coffees in? Huge! Good stuff =)"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Cafe Beano for almost a year I reckon.  I loved it then and I happily remembered how much as I reminisced to hubs about the yummy taste of the coffee when we stopped in after dinner last evening.

I love everything about this little cafe...from their previous alliance with partner Janice Beaton (I was told last night she has it sold again) to their commitment to local and organic products where ever possible, support of community and recycling.  I've only ever tried the baking & the coffee and loved every minute of it.

Unfortunately I do not get down to the red mile very often...but when I do Cafe Beano is on my hit list."}
{"text":"At the counter I made a joke and told the barista that the tip jar was looking very attractive today.  Her manager beside her said \"actually we had a break-in the other day, the front window was smashed in and all that was taken was the tip jar.  Stereo equipment and even ipods on tables remained untouched.\"  

How curious, well that tip jar must have been as full as it was today, because the baristas here are very nice.  I returned to the table with a heart jolting late and my honey had a delicious chai. 

Many other yelpers say this place is pretentious, but I like it, the neighbourhood elite do congregate here, but people from the neighbourhood will naturally go to see and be seen at the local hang out. Caffe Beano does attract folks; not only for eye candy but for what I think is pretty delicious coffee.

You can even watch staff making cookies, stirring cookie batter and plunking them in large chunks on waxed cookie trays.

And the cliental sure is interesting here too, artists, designers, architects, and families from the mount royal area.  I think i counted 10 scarfs being worn by clients one day, is that the new \"I am an artist signature? I wonder\".

So I am up for a Caffe Beano coffee any day."}
{"text":"Located in a trendy area of Calgary, Caffe Beano offers coffee and quick meals for mostly a younger audience. The coffee was fresh and had good flavor. You should note that the mugs are over-sized, so bring a thirst. Sandwiches were OK, but I agree with other reviewers that the bread seems to be either too crusty or too chewy for the style of sandwich. Ambiance feels a bit rushed and/or chaotic. 

Enjoy Calgary!"}
{"text":"Tip: They have great milkshakes.

I am not sure how to describe this place, but it's definitely not your usual hipster cafe in 17th Ave. It has its own character, with a different kind of clientele. Beano has the feeling of an older establishment that has been around for quite some time.
I have always enjoyed my visit and time spent there."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee at cheaper then Starbucks price. Very worth it!"}
{"text":"Beano Rats. You know them. They wear earth tones. Read tattered second hand copies of \"To Kill A Mockingbird\". Only work on Mac Books. Beano Rats are wealthy hipsters who drive VW's. The hipsters who's photograph's are actually selling and are successfully graphic designing. They are old hipsters and young hipsters and they are lined up there morning, noon and night. 

I was almost a Beano Rat for a while - mostly because it was a few blocks from my house. I would go there two or three mornings a week, get a drip coffee (fancy that!) and a bagel with cream cheese and tomato. But now that I've moved, it's too much trouble to go there. So in a nutshell - it's good but not that good. 

When you go to Beano - you're paying for atmosphere. The coffee is most certainly palatable and the food is just fine and dandy. What you're paying for are things like the Community Bulletin Board is only for local artists and events, they have a displaced person (homeless) who sweeps the side walk in exchange for coffee and dogs are welcome to be tied up right outside. You're paying to walk around with your disposable Beano coffee cup (with a lid made from corn) so everyone can see you go to Beano."}
{"text":"If you actually care about espresso quality, microfoam and overal adherence to Third Wave Coffee traditions then when you're in the 17th Ave area don't bother with Caffe Beano and just head over to Chiasso instead.  However if it's a funky college coffee shop vibe and a London Fog is more of your drink of choice then Beano is the right spot for you. Based on my star rating you can probably tell which of the two are more important to me.

I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area so I'm spoiled by having ridiculously incredible coffee like Blue Bottle, Ritual, Barefoot etc so when I visit the in-laws here in Calgary I'm always on the hunt for good coffee. 

I ordered a \"cappuccino\"  which other than the name bares almost no resemblance to the drink. It was served in an enormous drinking cup with no handles. The volume was so great that it wouldn't even pass as a latte. There wasn't even an attempt at microfoam. If the main function for the spoon that is served with your drink is to scoop up thick foam as opposed to stirring the drink then it's pretty clear that the cafe has no clue about the virtues of microfoam. 

I won't bother drilling down into the technical details because I think you get the idea already."}
{"text":"This area of town has so many amazing coffee shops and Caffe Beano is no exception! This place is pretty busy - that just shows how great this place is! The staff are friendly and the drinks are delicious. This is a must go when it's sunny because the freshly squeezed lemonade is to die for! Caffe Beano uses local and organic products wherever possible which makes it so much more fantastic! I'll definitely be at this place more this summer!"}
{"text":"I'm enjoying the menu at Caffe Beano. I've stopped in for coffee a couple of times already, and today I enjoyed myself an espresso chocolate milkshake and a muffin. Service has been quick and friendly.

When it's busy, the lineup area isn't exactly the most efficient. The doorway gets crowded and it's hard to fit more than a few people at a time. Watch your step near the cashier, there's a step up that also makes the flow from cashier to drink pickup feel a little off.

Overall, though, I'm enjoying the space. Especially now that I've discovered their milkshakes. That's something you won't find in other coffee shops."}
{"text":"Five years on since Beano's third-wave rebirth and that last review. I don't go to Beano often since the lineups are daunting, but so were they at Analog today, so I stopped in Beano for a macchiato. Now be warned that a \"macchiato\" at Beano is what you should order if you want a traditional 5 oz cappuccino- what they call a \"traditional cappuccino\" is 8 oz if I'm eyeballing the porcelain correctly. So I asked the barista to only go about 2/3 the way up to get a proper 4 oz macchiato... anyway the \"macchiaccino\" is only $3.50, great price. And it was superb, chocolatey with perfectly microfoamed milk and just lovely, exactly what I was hoping for. 

Coffee geeks note that the Slayer I referenced in my 2011 review is now a La Marzocco Strada. Gorgeous machine."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see a low score for good ol' Beano...

There are only two reasons why I might venture out to a coffee shop for my favourite drink, instead of making a perfectly decent cup at home.
(Aside from the obvious of having plans to meet at a shop, working from a shop, or being nowhere near home and needing a trusty americano half way through the day...) Those reasons are:

1) A relationship with the brand, or it's employee's.  I don't mean 'dating' the barista, but if I like the vibe of the place, and of course the coffee itself - then i'll go out of my way to visit the shop and support the business.

**I don't visit enough to know the staff or owners, but I like the place, and I've never had a problem with rude or pretentious employees.

2) People Watching!  I'm often flying solo when I'm experiencing a coffee shop, but regardless of this fact I prefer places with a variety of guests.  Downtown generally tends to have more interesting people per square foot...

**Beano attracts a colourful crowd, of all ages.  Whether it's outside on the benches near the east entrance (always packed if it's even remotely pleasant weather), tucked inside at a cozy booth, with a view to watch the world go by, or just enjoying the atmosphere indoors - Beano never fails with a friendly concoction of neat weirdos.
(Weirdos is not negative or derogatory.... I like weirdos. I am a weirdo)

Don't pass this place by; bringing dual meaning to the term \"Original Joe\", since 1990.

{"text":"I really like Caffe Beano. For years I was too intimidated to go in, as I have always been much more knowledgeable in the field of tea than coffee. However, I am glad I got over myself because I was missing out. 
I usually like to hit up Beano with one of my coffee inclined friends, because we grab delicious coffee and then usually go for a stroll up to the book store. It makes me feel very sophisticated. 
It is very elbow-bumping crowded in Caffe Beano, to the point where I have oft witnessed coffee-spilling and trickery. I do quite enjoy their drip coffee where I don't often enjoy such things at most places, and their espresso is lovely. Occasionally I have said espresso as a latte with soy milk. 
I have yet to try any of their other drinks on the menu but I generally stay clear of things that are tea-ish at places known for their coffee because I have so much tea snobbery happening in my pantry. 
All in all, I like this place and always get in the mood to go to Caffe Beano when it rains especially.Probably some of the best coffee that I have had in the city."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for an informal meeting, on the suggestion of a colleague. I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and a chocolate puffed wheat square. It's been some time since I have seen Vietnamese coffee on the menu! It was creamy and delicious, served in a huge cup to stay. My square was gooey and hit the spot nicely. 

I brought cash with me since other reviewers mentioned that cash is best there. I don't have a problem with this if I'm prepared. It's part of the culture there and I don't mind a bit. I thought the prices were good, given the quality of the coffee and square, and the portions were big.

Definitely a \"Kensington\" kind of vibe, with lots of hipster types. I didn't feel out of place or judged going in with my corporate-wear on. The staff were really friendly to me and it was busy enough, but not packed or crazy in there (around 5pm on a weekday). I found a place to sit without a problem and didn't wait long for my order.

Highlights:
*It was neat to watch the staff bake cookies. 
*Products and service were delightful
*Finally a place that have tables for ONE person if you aren't meeting someone.
*People know the servers by name. Cool. We could use a little sense of community like that in Calgary more often.

I went in with an open mind, braced to be disenchanted with the experience but everything was flawless. I will definitely be back to try their other bevvies...and to enjoy people watching!"}
{"text":"Pros: Good drip coffee and decent espresso. Open late. Lots of space.

Cons: Every goddam hipster in the city seems to gravitate towards this space. Ah, who cares. They also don't take credit cards. Sometimes I find that the fancier type drinks are a tad bit mediocre. You watch them make you, say... a London Fog, and you realize that you could do the same with a blender, vanilla syrup, and some cheap tea."}
{"text":"They make great coffees and their pastries (brought in from where else) are pretty good as well.  It's always really busy when I go there but the wait is never more than 10-15min.  If you're in a rush though you may want to try Waves across the street.

A few times they've gotten my drink incorrect.  I always ask for no room in my Americano but they've left room.  Not a big deal when they're busy but once they missed it when there weren't that many in line.

Also, I asked for water once and they rudely pointed to a corner where there was self serve water.  If it wasn't for the vicinity I would be going elsewhere for my coffee."}
{"text":"I think being a cafe downtown adds a lot of pressure to a coffee business since there are so many in the area and I think Caffe Beano is a tip top coffee shop. 

They have a wide selection of food and goodies, which I found surprising. Their drink menu has a great variety and from what I have tried the few times I've been here, they make their drinks to a great standard. It looks small on the outside but surprisingly there are a lot of seats inside. The staff is friendly and that's important for any cafe. They are a little pricey however, and that's one downside for me. But if you've never been here before it's definitely worth a try. I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"The other reviews aren't kidding -- Caffe Beano is constantly busy!

I was lucky to go in when there was a very short line.  I ordered a latte, and was immediately impressed with the fact that when you stay there, you get a large for the price of a small.

It didn't take long for me to get my drink, which was fairly good in a nice latte bowl.  The milk was microfoamed and sweet -- perfect.  The espresso was good, although there were quite a few grinds in the bottom of the drink.

I wasn't wearing skinny jeans, so I kind of stood out as \"not belonging\" a bit.

To this point, I would have rated Beano 4 stars.  However, when I brought my empty mug to the counter, I put it down and asked if that was a good place to put it.  He looked at me, didn't say anything, then went back to what he was doing.

Ummm, what?  Chelsea K. is right -- unfriendly.

As I went to leave, I wanted to use the washroom but it needed a key from the cashier.  There were now six people in line, so I left.

I'm now at about 2.5 stars.  Although someone listed that they accept credit cards, they definitely do not.  Cash and debit only.  This is lazy and disappointing for a store in a big city, so we're down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Busy coffee shop with lots of tables and seating inside and outside. Mocha was ok, tasted a little gritty related to the chocolate. The caprese sandwich was ok - bread was too crusty and would have preferred a softer mozzarella. Otherwise, cool spot to hangout on a Saturday afternoon."}
