{"text":"H O L Y    C H U C K. Seriously.  They need to E X P A N D their booger-sized estate. The space is tiny compared to the ever so large patrons...both in size and quantity. I mean really \"our business is burgers\" (I don't know anyone that would disagree with that statement) they didn't think they're customers were mostly going to be chuck e cheese goers, did they? As a burger establishment that sells the city's GREASIEST, YUMMIEST, FATTIEST, BURGERS...they should've foreseen the inevitably obvious future of their not so pint-sized fans. Just READ THE MENU, people who've just completed a marathon, smoked a fat blunt, or truly enjoy good food without a conscience would patronize this burger joint. Grilled cheese buns, layers of grease and bacon, patty after patty, no veggies, cheese slices every layer, caramelized onions, fries, etc. is what their burgers consist of.  There's no need for chewing these burgers, the second you get it, the first thing you'll realize is the DRIPPING GREASE. EVERY DROP COUNTS, DON'T LET IT DRIP, SHIT IS UNBELIEVABLE. That grease is what LUBRICATES the esophagus, allowing the (chewed or unchewed) food to kind of just slide or drizzle down the tube to your stomach. It's softer, lighter, and airier than cotton candy. Someone wanted burger/ meat/ bacon/ cheese flavoured cotton candy? Oh, no bigs, Holy Chucks gotchu. It's so airy, even if it went down the wrong tube into the trachea, you wouldn't choke. The only other issue I might have to go along with their booger-sized estate is maybe their BOOGER-SIZED BURGERS! EXPAND THAT TOO. (Though maybe it's for the better and sparing the arteries and heart attacks of the general population)  ** FOR THE MONSTER WHO KILLED THE HOLY CHUCK CHALLENGE IN 2:40. DAMN BRO. You have my respect sir."}
{"text":"Fantastic Burger, amazing menu, friendly staff, quick service, I can't say more, I love this place it's a great burger, and they will do a Salt free paddy and fries if you ask.. which I love..I would recommend this place if your craving a delicious juicy burger.. it's worth the drive from any part of the city just to have one.."}
{"text":"A word of advice on how to cook any kind of meat:  Let your meat rest after it comes off the grill!!! They cook their burgers to medium rare (which IMO is not high enough for minced meat) and then they immediately drop it on a soft bun. What you're left with is a soggy wet mess since all the juices have left the meat and have absorbed fully into the bun.  It's not a well composed meal and it's also too expensive compared to what you can get elsewhere."}
{"text":"The regular Holy Chuck (signature) burger - double beef patty with cheese, bacon, carmelized onion - was just ok. The meat was moist but underseasoned and the bun was soggy and had no taste or texture. If I go back, I would order something more unique, since that seems to their thing. For the money, you might do better going to proper restaurant like a bar and grill or gastro bistro.  Decor is similar to pizza pizza with seating, self serve coke fountain drinks (great for tasting an assortment of drinks)."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth burger and tasty milkshakes. Quick friendly staff. If you're a burger aficionado you have to try this place."}
{"text":"This place was jokes. I really should do the challenge. I ate 1/3 of their GO CHUCK YOURSELF in 20sec and record is 1:59min. So you do the math! Hahaha... I ate another burger within 4mins. Gaha... I will come back and crush this record and you should too!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Holy Chuck burger  Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 3 / 5 Cooking speed: 3 / 5 Food Quality: 5 / 5 Food Quantity: 5 / 5 Price: 3 / 5 (Burger + Fries + Drink combo is nearly $20 including tax) Cleanness: / 5  Repeat: Yes  I tried Holy Chuck on multiple occasions, there is always a long lineup. the worst lineup was during the burger week, I think I waited over 45 minutes before ordering, and I arrive before noon!  Because of the burger week lineup, I actually get to see how they prepare the burger meat. They blend the meat twice, and roll them into little balls, then weight them with a scale for consistency!  The burger is awesome, I would recommend to get the fries to fill you up. They make small batches of fries frequently, so it's usually fresh. Fortunately I never have to wait for the fries when my burger is ready.  In comparison, the size is bigger than Burger Priest's burger. About on par with P&L burger.  I tried the milkshake once, it's not thick enough for me.....I miss the good old day of McDonald milkshake (before 2000), it's so thick you need the straw to scoop up the milkshake sticking to the side of the cup."}
{"text":"I'm on a burger kick right now, and I added this place to my hit list. Honestly, just thinking about the burger makes my heart hurt a little. I actually went to lunch today at a diff place and opted to NOT have the burger, due to the memory of this burger. BUT I digress.  I was a little dismayed to see that most burgers were double patties, but it was okay. I ordered their classic chuck burger, with cheese and bacon. I also made it a combo (and extra $4.50!) For two of us, it came to $33.00! The burger was actually smaller than I expected, but filling. The beef was obviously fresh, but that was about it. It didn't have much of a taste and was suuuuuper greasy. I am not expecting health food when I order a burger like that, but it really was quite greasy. The fries were really skinny, but I liked that they added parsley to it, and that they weren't generic. My bf had sweet potato chip fries, and expressed disappointment that they weren't warm.  To sum it up, it's not worth the price and not tasty enough. It wasn't horrible, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Too expensive for no reason.  Confusing menu.  Not a big deal place.  Interesting at grand opening but it fizzled out."}

{"text":"Toronto has been besieged with an abundance of new burger joints in the past few years, and Holy Chuck has established itself as one of the finest places to chow down on a gourmet burger in the entire GTA.   I've been to Holy Chuck on several occasions and have had the pleasure of tasting a variety of burgers from their expansive menu, all of which have been excellent. To ensure freshness, they grind their meat in-house daily and never freeze it. This means that you have to wait a bit longer than you might be accustomed to waiting for a burger, but you won't have to sacrifice on taste.  First, the signature Holy Chuck burger ($10): a bacon double cheeseburger topped with caramelized onions. No other toppings are needed on this delicious burger. In fact, Holy Chuck posts signs asking patrons to refrain from adding anything else to their masterpiece. Why mess with perfection, right? Why indeed: this is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten, and it should be the first thing you order when visiting Holy Chuck.  Other favourites include:  The Cowlorie ($12), a bacon double cheeseburger, topped with caramelized onions, all contained between two grilled cheese sandwiches. For those times when you crave both a grilled cheese sandwich and a burger, but can't make up your mind on what to eat.  The Grind N' Shine ($11), for only a dollar more than the signature Holy Chuck burger, you could add a fried egg and crispy fries to your burger!   The Greek Bahahastard ($10), an excellent lamb burger (albeit one that left me wanting more) with two lamb patties, caramelized onions and a mint & garlic aioli.  The Raging Bull ($13), a SPICY delicacy featuring two double cheeseburgers, double bacon, layered with fresh saut√©ed hot peppers and fried in a home-made chipotle sauce.   You Fat Pig ($12), featuring two all-bacon patties, triple cheese, crispy bacon, and topped with home-made creamy bacon dressing. That's right - an all-bacon burger topped with bacon and bacon-flavoured dressing.   I usually abstain from ordering a side dish, as the burgers themselves are quite filling, but they do offer a variety of sides, including fries, onion rings, poutine (including fois gras poutine!), and truffle mayo, to name a few. They also offer desserts, including deep-fried twinkies, nutella lollipops, and funnel cake.   Holy Chuck also caters to gluten-sensitive types (gluten free buns are available for a nominal cost of $.99) and vegetarians (their 'Animal Feed' panko crusted portobello mushroom burger is very good).  I would be remiss if I failed to mention how unbelievable their milkshakes taste. Some people claim Holy Chuck's shakes are the best in the city, and they might be right. With such creative flavours as Peanut Butter & Jelly, Bacon Fudge & Sea Salt, or Madagascar Bourbon vanilla bean, your taste buds will surely thank you (they also have regular chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes).  Obviously, if you're conscious about eating healthy, this place isn't for you. But for the rest of us, I can't think of a better place to eat a mouthwatering, savoury burger anywhere in the city (sorry Burger's Priest fans). This place is tops."}
{"text":"This place has got a lot better than when it first opened. I love it.  I think their initial problem was quality control but that doesn't seem to be an issue anymore. In fact, I think i'm going to go there now."}
{"text":"Had the double chuck, fries and nutella milkshake. The juciest most decadent burger i had in my life. Milkshake was great too."}
{"text":"Sooooo finallyyy came back to this place and tried The Greek Bahahastard and simple put..it was amazing! The lamb patties were tender and juicey (got them Well-done) and the sauce complimented them very well. I would highly recommend this place for the burgers! Couple friends got The Farmers Threesome (lamb, beef, and bacon) and they enjoy it as well. Overall, great food, great service, and great environment!"}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood I wanted to try \"the best burger in TO\".  If you are not healthy as an ox you should not even consider stepping in. The feeling of eating something that fatty was so predominant that I could not focus on the taste.   Poutine? The fries with the gravy were a solid piece altogether.   Service was slow with the manager on top of everybody checking in a bad way what is going on all the time.  Appearance of burgers was not good either but would not matter if I had enjoyed what I had.  Price, definitely not worth what you get.  I like burgers but trying it once here was more than enough for me."}
{"text":"Solid burger.  3.5 stars.  No long lines.  Clean, bright, cheerful.    I had the Animal Feed, fries, pop.  Burger itself was well fried.  Not greasy.  Crispy.  Cheese inside was creamy.  I guess that's to be expected from feta.  I prefer the gooey stringy cheese found inside the mushroom of a Priest burger.  Fries were crispy.  Nice tough of thyme made them stand out a bit from regular fries.  Another friend had the threesome and found the bacon patty salty.  Another friend found their beef patty a bit dry.  I found their chips a bit soft and bland.  Even their sweet potato chips were a bit soft.    I prefer a Priest burger over this place.  It's about the same price.  However, there is a lot more seating here so it's convenient for a casual sit down or for larger group meals.    Would go again if in the area.  Wouldn't go out of my way for it.  I'll give them the benefit of 4 stars though I think they are really 3.5 worthy."}
{"text":"We got in before the dinner rush. The service was good. I got the lamb burger and poutine. The burger plate could have been presented better, there was no sides at all to compliment the main. The burger itself was juicy and fresh. Overall, it lacked a punch. The poutine on the other hand, was excellent, there was a nice amount of gravy and cheese curds (yummy)."}
{"text":"2nd time, and still the best burger in the city!!!  Stuck with the Holy Chuck (bacon caramelized onions and two patties), no extra toppings as suggested, fries, coke in a bottle and a salted caramel and Nutella milkshake for desert.  I would eat here once a week if I lived close enough. They are the dreamiest."}
{"text":"Burgers are just ok. They have some cool menu options though like Nutella fries... Yum!"}
{"text":"This burger was AMAZING! I haven't tasted meat this good before. The fries aren't really worth it, but I had the holy chuck and was astounded. Super nice staff too."}
{"text":"I heard about this place so I went and I got the farmers threesome with 1 beef, lamb and bacon patty with caramelized onions and bacon. I added a fried egg. As soon as you bite into it the fresh amazing juices of the natural fresh meat surfs through your mouth. And the egg was cooked to perfection very runny not like some other places where the fucking Yoke is fully cooked. The only critique I have is that the bacon patty was a little bit over powering, maybe that's cause I'm not used to it or it really is too much bacon. But other than that it was great, great place with tons of different delicious burger combinations. You should start with the holy chuck."}
{"text":"Always delicious. I love their raging bull items. They have the perfect level of spice.  Their meat mixture is perfect and the beef is always cooked to perfection.  I also recommend the raging bull fries.  This has to be my favourite burger joint in the gta. I wish there was one closer to my home.  FYI the St.  Claim location is better than the Vaughan location."}
{"text":"Over rated, over priced, mediocre sloppy burgers and the meat is nothing special (pretty good fries).    The menu reads like a manual on how to induce a heart attack and there are only really a few real \"normal\" (you know, like two patties and cheese with some lettuce, tomatoes, etc.) burgers on the menu and they generally come slathered with home-made mayo. The choices are overwhelming and appear as though a suicidal compulsive eater pulled it together. Many of the choices make no sense and almost all are swathed in some form of bacon, pork, mayo, which makes it difficult for those who might not like those products, especially since the staff gets ornery if you try and sub. / change. The standalone list of toppings is rather short and \"they\" advise against basic toppings... right after creating monstrous coronary disease specials with a million toppings... a bit confused.  The meat is cryptically sourced from a \"federally inspected plant\", whatever that means. One would imagine it's the same as the meat one would find in a Taco Bell or in prison. The --too greasy--burgers were undercooked, with extraordinarily thin patties almost tasted boiled then grilled; i.e. bereft of flavour (with a mystery meat greyish colour) which is subsequently added through the myriad of sauces and toppings offered. We were told the burgers would be cooked medium, but they were more like medium to medium rare... great for good steak, not for mystery, likely GMO meat.   I went there twice to give it shot again (as I live close by) and even took my better half the second time. She was in agreement with the views expressed above. The two of us had two burgers, one fairly simple burger with jalapenos (which the server seemed reticent to add) and a lamb burger (very, very gamey and I am a big lamb fan), fries and one fountain drink and our total came to a hair under $32. Absolutely ridiculous... our amazing Dim Sum brunch at Crown Princess where we stuffed ourselves came to $37 with awesome jasmine tea and a pop that afternoon. One can walk into Big Smoke Burger, Five Guys or even Hero Burger, amongst the innumerable gourmet burger chains infesting our city, (I will say the \"Gourmet Burger\" chain is overrated too) and get organic and / or antibiotic free meat that tastes better, on better buns, with more menu flexibility for less.  The fries where the one saving grace, although not enough to save this joint for me and the missus. Oh and by the way, who places a sign of a cow urinating by a kitchen (pointing to the washrooms) in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Have been here twice since my last review. Will not return on account of the decline in quality. On both occasions, they were out of Parmesan cheese. I was keen on ordering the Moogats burger (which comes with shaved parmesan) and I was told that there would be no compensation in consideration of the lack of parmesan. The burger was awful and fell apart in my hands, along with the bun. It took me a while to figure out why there were so many 'strings' in my burger- turns out they failed to remove the casing from the soppressata. Disappointing as I used to really like this place!"}
{"text":"The first time I went, I ordered The Animal Feed which is their veggie burger and it really wasn't good at all. The panko crusted portobello was soaking in oil and the bread ended up being a thin soggy mush. I gave it another chance and tried the Grind N Shine instead which is the one with the egg in it. This was alot better than the first burger I had but still just mediocre (I'm not a super picky eater btw). To be honest, for the price, I personally think there are better places out there."}
{"text":"SO FRIGGIN GOOD, only problem is that they don't let you add or subtract ANYTHING. Other than that, it was so delicious.   BUT! If you're going to get the truffle fries, I would highly recommend you staying away from them. they taste more like PEPERCORN... \"Truffle fries\" shouldn't taste like peppercorn!"}
{"text":"A busy tiring day and a sign \"Come in to see why we are the best burgers in Toronto'\" prompted hubbee and I  to check it out.   He ordered the 'HOLY CHUCK' :  double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions (and followed instructions to not include any toppings) Not being a fan of bacon, I opted for the 'THE BIG BAD WOLF:  two patties fried in ball park mustard (whatever that is), topped with caramelized onions, cheese and caramelized crispy mustard.  The crispy mustard - it was just too odd to pass! Oh and we order an order of fries to share.  Consensus:  First, the fries : The most important thing for me at a burger place.  It was excellent!! Fresh, crispy , non greasy and tossed with herbs! Just the right size to share too. The burgers themselves were juicy and flavourful  I liked the crispy mustard (designed to look like the straw house of from the three little pigs story?!??), hubbee didnt.  Our only complaint was that we wish they used better buns! These looked and tasted like they were the grocery store bought burger buns variety.  Switching the buns may  bring it out of the 'fast food'  category ;)  I would be curious to try the nutella milkshake next time...once I've shaken off my lactose intolerance for good! ha ha! shaken!  Not bad"}
{"text":"Tried the Holy Chuck signature burger. It was dripping with grease... About 3-4 ounces fell on to the serving tray as I took the first bite. I also had the fries which were tasty. I decided to try this restaurant after hearing it had the best burger in Toronto. If this is the best Toronto has to offer, I may switch to other cuisine for a while. I guess it all depends on what you are looking for when it comes to excellence in a hamburger, soaked in grease doesn't come close to what I'd expect."}
{"text":"I love burgers.   I like to try all the burger places at least once or twice and i think I'm a pretty good judge of a good burger.   I used to go to the priest in my neighbourhood because I thought they had a good burger, ok fries (but plentiful), and solid shakes.   Now I drive extra 15 minutes to Holy  Chuck,  this place has some crazy nice burgers.  The fries are bang on, and the shakes are not too bad.  They have some amazing eats like nutella fries and ice crm.   Great place after a session with Dr Four twenty.  Quick, fast, super hot tasty burgers.  Its worth the drive trust me.  If you are cheap and are expecting 5 dollar burgers stay home."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my burger as I like my meat well done and mine was still pink in the middle. My boyfriend loved it, he likes his burgers undercooked. I would go back to try it again sometime when I get over how grossed out I was."}
{"text":"It's kinda of fatty for me but still tastes good. Besides, you can order some shakes except for pops."}
{"text":"One of my favourites! The burgers are always super juicy, so you know it's fresh and not some freezer burnt patty that they're serving. I had mine with an egg inside, and the runny yolk was the highlight. I've never been much of a \"burgers for dinner\" type person, but this place had me converted.   Their milkshakes are to die for. I was a bit skeptical at the idea of an apple pie milkshake, but holy smokes I was blown away. It was pretty much liquidfied apple pie with vanilla ice cream. Best milkshake I've ever had."}
{"text":"Burger was good, the patties are so juicy but a bit overpriced tho. Tried the raging bull and the farmer's threesome. I personally think it was a little too salty but the burger was still bomb! The prep / cooking time was fast, but the service was (sorry) horrible, I couldn't enjoy my time eating there. The cashier was very rude and unprofessional.   Firstly, she was really rude when she took our orders. Then, when our burgers were ready we weren't called loud enough so that we could hear so we weren't aware that our burgers were ready. Then, the rude cashier approached us and showed the receipt and asked \"is this you?\" And when we said yes she just walked away and then handed us our orders with a very rude manner. Not to mention she was flirting the whole time we were there.  I would honestly give a much higher rating if the service wasn't that bad because the food is good."}
{"text":"YUMMY BURGER!!! okay poutine (more on the salty side) and oooh lala cheesecake shake!"}
{"text":"Burgers are exactly what you want in a burger..  Always juicy and perfectly cooked!! And you can have it medium .. There is no other way to eat a burger!! Sides like poutine are huge, so best to share"}
{"text":"This spot (formerly retro burger) Is on it's third concept since I started working in the hood.   Menu features burgers/sandwiches from $5.99 - $20.00. Options look like \"best of the CNE\" when it comes to heart attack specials... (see my pic of the menus board) 6 patty bacon cheeseburger - check, double bacon burger served between a grilled cheese sandwich - check. Where is the Crispy Creme Donut Burger?!?!?   Service - painfully slow. 8 peeps behind the counter. Guys just standing around... one woman at cash - who seems to have one speed (and it's dangerously close to stop). Debit cards were very confusing to this individual and halts the order taking for literally minutes while the transaction was processed. She was also forgetting to ask patrons if the order was to stay or go which cause the cooks to have to repack eat in orders as take out.   Orders:  My Buddy: Chuck Burger Fries and a Coke.  Me: Chuck Burger and Coke.   Burgers took about 10 minutes to be prepared - this was following the 10 minute wait in line due to \"slow or stop girl\". Once ready, our names were bellowed loudly through the restaurant and food was just left on the counter to pick up. Burgers had no toppings and the guys behind the counter genuinely seemed annoyed when I asked for lettuce, tomato, pickle, ketchup and mustard to be added.   IMO, When eating a big sloppy greasy burger two things are essential:   1. A good bun - a little crusty on the outside, yet soft in the middle to hold all the meaty goodness together   2. Napkins - Thick absorbent napkins - the kind that could mop up a small pipeline burst.   Unfortunately Chuck Burger lacked both.  The buns were your superstore variety white bun, stacked up by the hundreds to the left of the cash register. These geni-buns stand no chance against the meat cheese onslaught they will eventually house.   Napkins... Hey Chuck Burger Owners... who thought the cheapest, flimsy 1 ply napkins were a good idea?? And why did you cheap out and not put napkin holders on the tables? - your napkins are what they wrap around kids ice-cream cones... Not fantastic for trying to withhold a bacon, cheese, ground chuck grease tsunami. This is like trying to soak up Lake Ontario with a Kleenex... Both my buddy and I used like 25 napkins each. Insane.   Taste - Okay... Meat - Good. Cheese - Good. Bacon - Good... just the damn burger wouldn't stay together... frustrating to eat. Had a couple of my buddies fries. WHOA SALT... Good job they give free soda refills.   Basically it felt like Holy Chuck scoured the Internet for the most ridiculous burger type menu items, but forgot that this is only one part of a restaurant. Fast friendly service is a huge part that's missing. If you're a fan of the big greasy burgers, salty, salty fries and have some time (especially if you're paying debit) this place is for you. Just bring your own napkins... and potentially a back up bun!   I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had 2 Raging Bulls and poutine, to go. Sorry to say that both the burger and the poutine were incredibly salty. Beyond anything we have ever experienced, we had to throw most of it out. Considering that we paid more than 36 dollars for those 3 items, it was a costly error. I would have given zero stars, but the posting requires 1."}
{"text":"This place just replaced Retro Burgers, which was really good, so I decided to give it a try. First thing that struck me when I got into the place was the amount of rubbish piled on tables and near the garbage bins - they obviously had not cleared anything in hours. Secondly, the service was extremely slow and the staff appears to be comprised of a bunch of amateurs who don't know their job. Some people had been waiting for 20+ minutes for a milkshake... others had to wait over 10 minutes to get their fries after they got their burger, etc. A disaster.  I ordered a double cheeseburger, no fries, no drink. It was expensive ($9 with tax), took nearly 15 minutes to be made. It was small, the buns were soggy with grease and coming apart and the whole thing was dripping fat and extremely salty. The complement of lettuce and tomatoes was ridiculously small. One of the worst burgers I've ever had.  I'm very disappointed and most likely won't go back there. A lot of people from my office building, who also tried it, share my opinion."}
{"text":"actual score . . . 3 1/2 stars   Chuck B is in the mix with the other burger big boys . . . priest, big smoke, south st. burger, gourmet burger co. Juicy, sloppy, greasy . . . yummy.   Best yum yum item off the menu . . . poutine fries. Crispy, tender handcut fries, beefy, smokey flavoured gravy, ooey-gooey cheez.   Punchy-coloured interior design has a playful vibe. Noticed a mixed crowd. Girl's night-out, bromance amongst dudes kickin it together, young couples, families etc.   Having said all that, problably wouldn't go back in a hurry. Other places like 5 guys and fries offer pretty much the same burger and save a couple of bucks,  $10.00 - cheez burger + bacon + onions  IMO . . . over-priced"}
{"text":"Lately I have been on a mission to experience as many of the exquisite burger palaces in our fair city and Holy Chuck certainly should be counted as one of them. We went mid afternoon on a Friday so it was not busy at all, the staff were friendly and helpful in making the right choices. We had the famous Holy Chuck it was juicy and flavourful it was paired with Greek fries that were very good. Holy Chuck may not be number one but it is in the top 10 for smashed typed burgers."}
{"text":"What's the big deal there are so many others doing the same thing. Fries were too greasy and the burger bun seemed like it was a no frills bun, cheap and falls apart.  The burger itself was OK and juicy. But the whole thing has to work to make it right. Go to 5 guys burger and fries or The Works. Much better."}
{"text":"I had been craving a milkshake for sometime as I had not seen any cafes serve them in Toronto. A friend recommended Holy Chuck. I was impressed by the unique Canadian flavours available and decided to go with the bacon, fudge and sea salt milkshake. Yes, bacon in a milkshake!!! It was the perfect balance of sweet and salty. The little bacon chunks remained crispy even after leaving the second half of the drink in the fridge as I digested the first half.   I can't wait to go back to try the burgers, but I don't think I will be able to stomach both a burger and a shake."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Haven't tried one I didn't like. My favorite is def the village cow, which is outta this world. If you haven't tried it then you're missing out. The meat is fresh and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Juicy, mouthful, fatty, and delicious... sounds wrong but tastes so right. There's no way out of this, it sounds wrong no matter how I put it. Anyway, great burger. Still have to try more from here to determine which I prefer Burger's Priest or Holy Chuck. Again, I forgot which burger I had, all I remember is it was f-ing bomb."}
{"text":"In my dining experience, there are two kinds of restaurants one frequents only on special occasions: one, the calorie-laden extravaganza establishment, the other, pricy haute-cuisine. Holy Chuck somehow manages to fuse the two together...but boy is it worth it.   Now in fairness, this semi-fast food joint might not appropriately be labelled haute-cuisine, but when your bill surpasses $25 for one of the menu's basic burgers, some fries, and a shake, you know it's not  your standard burger shoppe.  Holy Chuck prides itself on bringing the freshest ingredients to your fast-food experience. No frozen meat, no filler in the patties, fresh buns, non-processed cheese, etc.   The burgers surely do not disappointed, and can be rated among the best in the city. The \"no-filler\" meat is grilled to perfection, oozing out juices as you pick the burger up to take a bite (note: have napkins handy). The caramelized onions, featured in many of the menus 20-25 burger variants were cut thinly enough so as to caramelize quickly without a burnt taste. The egg topped off on my \"Grind 'n Shine\" burger exploded with yolk. Yes, this was a fine burger indeed.  I was equally impressed with the \"Holy Chuck fries\": a sort of chili cheese fries-meets-poutine variation. The chili is not your run of the mill chili: fresh vegetables and beans are abundant, poured unsparingly over gooey cheese and succulent strips of bacon.   Be forewarned that if you, too, feel it necessary to take on a burger and fries, your stomach may not forgive should you also order one of their unique shakes ($15 foie gras and truffle oil, anyone?), though to be sure they are well worth the price.  Fresh, rich ingredients do make the difference, and Holy Chuck is well worth a visit for those looking for an ultra-premium burger joint experience."}
{"text":"Maybe not QUITE  as good as the St Clair location, but delicious nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Reasonably good burger and without needing to have a secret menu. The bun though is just ordinary across most of their burgers.    Very good shake!"}
{"text":"Finally checked out Holy Chuck's Burger downtown St. Clair Station. They sure make cows look cute. Went there on thursday after 4PM, and it was quiet, so that was good for us. Tried for Grind N' Shine: Double patty with bacon, caramelized onion, crispy homemade chips, and with fried egg. - This was pretty moist and juicy...Could tell with all the grease leaking out of the burger. Any burger with caramelized onion and bacon and egg is usually pretty tasty... Next up was the Farmer's threesome: One lamb patty, one beef patty, and one half-breed (beef and bacon), with triple cheese, bacon and onions. - This reminded me of eating the Baconator at Wendy's...Its good enough that i would eat it again... -Had crispy sweet potato chips on the side with a drink. Wished the chips were fresh and hot as some was soggy and cold...   Overall bill $30+ for one combo and a sandwich! Will maybe consider trying the sixxy cow (6 patty, cheese, triple bacon) or go for the ULTIMATE CHUCK YOURSELF contest in 6 minutes... Now there is 13 ppl that are successful..."}
{"text":"Burger smelled like it was made from a greasy stove, hard to explain I didn't like the smell of the meat. The place is over rated. End up tossing it after the 2nd bite.  Wasn't a fan of there customer service - cashier.  I recommend 5 guys"}
{"text":"The best burger in the world!!!! The Best! Check out my blog... http://bigasskid.com/holy-chuck-toronto/"}
{"text":"Got two different burgers with my girlfriend as well as poutine and three desserts. I honestly can not remember which burgers we got but one had two grilled cheese sandwiches as the bun and the other had the deep fried mushroom with cheese inside and a burger.   I personally found their menu huge and it seriously difficult for me to figure out what I wanted. They had the most unique types of milkshakes which I wish I could of indulged in but I was seriously stuffed with all the eating.   The desserts were seriously delicious - I would go back there just for the desserts! We has the Nutella lollipops, holy funnel cake and the deep fried Twinkie. HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG WITH A DEEP FRIED TWINKIE?! Their holy funnel cake has this delish pineapple sauce/jam on it which I should of asked for by the bucket!"}
{"text":"This place is nuts! I brought my burger aficionado friend here as a treat and the verdict was \"heavenly.\" The only thing I wish I had realized was that my burger \"the smokey cow\" didn't come with any sauce. The meat and toppings were perfect, I just wish I had a little something extra on top. The meat was cooked to medium, which was amazing!!  The sides were what made this place perfect though. I am super picky about my fries, and the fries here were perfection. Loved the variety of fountain drinks and desserts. We had the Nutella lollipops.   After watching a couple people go by with shakes, we decided to share a Nutella shake for the road...  People! Best milkshake I have ever had in my whole life! It was like angel tears and unicorn dust and magical. I would drive to Woodbridge just for this shake. Amazing.  The place is expensive, that is true. But I feel like if it were any cheaper they probably wouldn't be able to handle the volume of business they would get, and quality would go down, and what would the point of that be? Besides, everything here has like a million calories I'm sure, so making this an occasional splurge is probably for the best.  Anyways I can't wait to bring my Dad and my sister and my other friends here, and you should try it too!"}
{"text":"I have gone there a couple of times; when it was first opened and second because I got a voucher and both times my burgers were barely warm. It was the Holy Chuck signature burger and the Big Chuck burger. However it was nicely flavored. The fries were nice and crispy but didn't like the herb seasoning on it. It would have been great if my burger was hot instead of at room temp."}
{"text":"I had the holy chuck burger, it was good. I didnt add any toppings. First time coming here. Hubby had \"you fat pig\" he also liked his. Then we ordered the raging bull fries, we were warned they were hot, and they were definately hot lol so we had to order regular fries also. The regular fries were bery good. It wasnt busy and we got our food quickly! We will be back. I wanna do the chuck yourself challenge lol no female has completed it."}
{"text":"Burgers are messy , almost all options include cheese, nothing healthy about it and if someone has to wait more than 5 minutes at a cash register at a fast food burger joint then they need a lesson in customer service and running a business. Oh , and I mean I was at the front of the line at the cash register waiting for over 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and fries if you're willing to pay a premium for them. Burger, fries, and drink can run you more than $20. But if you don't mind the price, it's one of the best burgers in the city."}
{"text":"I was in the Yonge/St Clair area when I decided to grab a bite. I found Holy Chuck right here on Yelp. The menu is very extensive with about 30 different burgers to choose from. I ordered the signature Holy Chuck burger (double beef patty, cheese, bacon and carmelized onions, nothing else) with fries with a Coke. The burger was cooked to medium rare and was juicy and tasted great. The carmelized onions added just the right hint of flavour without overpowering the taste of the meat. The fries were shoestring style and perfectly seasoned. A very good meal overall. I will definitely come back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Burgers are tasty - perhaps a bit too greasy as I had indigestion later.  I wouldn't say this is the best burger place in the city - that would be a stretch."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite burger in town. Nothing tops their signature burger and it is definitively the best cure for a hang over.  I suggest tho to try their croissant burger at least once, it is to die for."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but they messed up our order a lot (nothing devastating, but definitely irritating).  I ordered the junior cheeseburger, but the meat was rare in the middle instead of medium as ordered.  The guy taking the orders charged me for a regular cheeseburger because he misheard my order, but fortunately I noticed and corrected him--I don't think I would have been able to handle a full-size burger!  I'm pretty sure he also misheard my friend's order--she and I had planned on sharing an order of plain fries, but when she picked up the order, they'd made the Holy Chuck fries for us.  Tasty, for sure, but not what we'd ordered.  That aside, the food was really, really good.  I was uncomfortably full for the rest of the evening because I ate so much of it--it was irresistible!  Had the Nutella/salted caramel milkshake, which was probably what put me over the edge, but it was incredible.  I wish they made a half-size version, because it's so rich a full one nearly did me in."}
{"text":"Unbelievably disgusting. They don't let the meat rest so you are left with a bun that is completely soaked in meat juice. Terrible and nauseating garbage."}
{"text":"If you don't enjoy a burger at Holy Chuck then you must not enjoy fresh ground beef, fresh buns, and great toppings. Yes, its pricey. But that's the cost of eating a burger in Deer park and having fresh organic meat ground every hour. This isn't just a burger joint, its also technically a butcher too. I had the holy chuck burger straight up and Vanilla Cherry Pipp pop. It was worth it. The washroom was well lit and clean, staff friendly, and the food delicious. A TV showing the world cup and clean dinning area. Holy Chuck is equal in rating to Burger Priest, Burger Shack, and The Grillway. If you like burgers, you'll like Holy Chuck."}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent , but this place needs to do something about the terrible tasting sweet buns. The buns is a deal breaker in this case , can't hold up the burgers intact and actually detract from the quality meat offered , and prices are too high for burgers . Literally most items on the menu is overpriced . At times the burgers taste too oily ."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try this place and thought it was great.   What my group had:   The Raging Bull 4 out of 5 Basically a double bacon cheeseburger with chipotle sauce sauteed hot peppers. The sauce and peppers is what made this great.   The Holy Duck 4 out of 5 A gigantic piece of foie gras on top of a beef patty with bacon. I think I could have done without the bacon, but each bite was delicious with full foie gras coverage. Needless to say I went to the gym afterwards.  Regular Poutine 3 out of 5 Nothing out of the ordinary for the price tag. The same kind of poutine you can get from New York Fries for half the price. The fries were a little different, but not amazing.   Chocolate Milkshake 4 out of 5 Had an awkward taste at first, but that might be because of all the artificial milkshakes I've had. All the natural flavors were well appreciated after the first few sips. Warning: Extremely thick."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best tasting burger I have tried in my life!  The only downside? Bad for my diet. But a treat here and there doesn't hurt. Their signature Holy Chuck burger literally makes you want to go \"holyF***\" it is THAT good. No other competitors come close.   I do agree with people saying the burgers are very greasy, but it is honestly what makes the burgers taste so good."}
{"text":"Essentially a rip off of Burger's Priest ('Holy' Chuck) with a more diverse menu. If you notice from behind the counter, they leave their balls of meat and bins of 'half cooked' bacon unrefrigerated to save cooking time. This is clearly a health code violation with regards to raw meat, and should not be overlooked. The typical Holy Chuck combo costs upwards of 20 dollars, a sloppy and disgustingly greasy barely 7 ounce burger with fries the size of toothpicks, up sold because of the sparse amount of herbs they put on them.  All in all, Holy Chuck is an overpriced and lacklustre dining experience.  Your time is better spent at the many other 'actual' upscale dining establishments in the Yonge and St. Clair area."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a burger that melts in your mouth?! Yeah, Holy Chuck does that.  What can I say, the meat is succulent, juicy, tender, with just the perfect hint of grease. It was everything I wanted when I walked on over one cool afternoon on st Claire.   BUT WAIT!  Can we please talk about the milkshakes!! I had the nutella salted caramel shake (yess) it was perfect. It actually tasted like a rush a expertly crafted flavor rushing into my mouth with each sip. Did it make me sick after inhaling my burger.....maybe.....but I pressed on because it was that good. (although I had to eventually throw out half because my stomach couldn't handle: disappointing).   I will definitely be back to holy chuck. Its in a nice neighborhood too. Do yourself a favor and check it out. Especially the milkshakes!"}
{"text":"The sign outside beckoned: \"Come and see why we were named the best burger in TO!\". I said to my brother & girlfriend \"We'll see about that\". I still have a couple other stops to make on my burger pilgrimage across the GTA, including The Burgers Priest which I've seen thrown in with Holy Chucks as the top burger in the city.  The restaurant is nice with full panel glass, a kind-of throw back diner decor and some cool features like an old school sit down Space Invaders machine and their wall of fame. If you can manage to cram down the Go Chuck Yourself and one of their milkshakes in under 6 minutes you'll get on the wall of fame. I'm not interested in uncomfortable forced coronaries so I steered clear of the challenge. I have to say that the atmosphere in Holy Chucks is far superior to both Apache & Woodys which are two of my favourite burger joints.  Our order went in. A Holy Chuck for me, their signature burger: double cheeseburger with bacon & caramelized onions. They don't want you putting any extra toppings on this, god forbid you spoil the deliciousness! My girlfriend (who can't eat pork and has a bit of a challenge with this menu as a result) opted for The Greek Bahahastard: two succulent lamb patties topped with caramelized onions and a roasted red pepper garlic feta aioli. My brother went with the Big Chuck which is very familiar for anyone that's ever been to the golden arches. We also all got one poutine to split and I picked up the Nutella & Salted Caramel milkshake.  The burgers (all medium rare) were decently sized, not too small or massive. The meat is absolutely spectacular, melting in your mouth with every bite. Out of all three burgers that I tried all of them were excellent but I would say that the Greek was my favourite. The combination of the incredible lamb patties with the aioli is perfection. The poutine was decent but nothing to write home about. The fries are ok, with some above average gravy and good cheese curds but I may be a little overly critical when it comes to my poutine. The milkshake was absolute heaven and I'm not lying when I say that the Nutella milkshake here crush every other milkshake I've ever had by a landslide. It was unbelievably thick and I thought I might slip into a sugar coma with every sip but it was worth it.  Holy Chucks definitely has some magic going on but I will have to wait to try out a few other joints before laying down my verdict on the best burgers in the city. Check these guys out if you haven't. I will be back again once my digestive track has significant recovery time."}
{"text":"Gluten-free warning!  They cook their burgers and warm their buns on a griddle that is cross-contaminated. My wife is a celiac and has tried the so-called gluten-free buns twice and has been violently ill afterwards both times."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time this evening to grab a burger. I decided to go for the Big Bad Wolf along with a side of rings.   Seems that we got in between waves of custies, so the wait wasn't too long at all. People seemed to pour in as we were finishing up and were seat hunting.  The burger was hot, super juice and pretty flavourful. Best when I got a bite of all the ingredients at once.  The rings didn't amaze, but the herbs were a nice touch and the batter wasn't overdone.   I also tried some of my friend's Big Chuck Fries. Really wasn't a fan of this type of fries.  Serving size was huge. Probably more fries than one person should eat.   I'd like to try another burger on the menu, but not too interested in the sides. I'd have the rings again if I was craving."}
{"text":"Fantastic fries and milkshakes. Their burgers taste great, but can be a little oily. Great place to go once in a while."}
{"text":"I love this place, take out or dine in. Obsessed with the Mad Cow burger. Burgers are good, sides are big enough to share with someone.  Prices are a little steep, but I'm not there everyday and having it once and a while doesn't really break the bank.  I ate in only once, liked the atmosphere and the lady at the counter was super nice."}
{"text":"Just left holy chuck and I felt it didn't live up to the hype. My fianc√© hated it I thought it would have been better without his negative attitude. I had the cowlerie burger it was tasty a bit too greasy and the cheese wasn't too flavourful. With our meals it came to almost 40$ and we didn't feel we got our moneys worth. I doubt we will go back"}
{"text":"I decided to try Holy Chuck after hearing raving reviews about the amazing burgers they have here.  If you're going to charge gourmet-burger prices (Avg. $10-$15 a burger with no side or drink included), you sure as hope you'd get a decent burger on a good bun.  The wait was long. We were asked if we were okay with our burgers being cooked medium, and said yes. The burgers were were given were well-done, waay over medium. The toppings were okay, but if you're going in expecting any healthier alternatives, I would suggest not going at all because none of the burger options have any kind of fresh vegetable as a topping (Not even on the build-your-own.)  I was mostly disappointed about the bun. You know the no-name cheapy brand buns you can pick up at Wal-Mart or No-Frills? That's the quality of the bun. And since the burgers and toppings are SO greasy, the bun was a soggy disgusting mess by the time I got halfway through the burger. I ended up removing the bun and tossing it out, and just finished the burger by eating the insides. A huge part of a good burger is having a good bun to go with it, and this was just beyond gross. Soggy bread is something I can NOT get past, it is just too unappetizing for me.  I will not be returning here in the future. Disgusting bun and over-priced."}
{"text":"I think I've discovered my new favourite burger in the city. It's called The Depressed Cow. Shaved onions pressed into two patties then fried crispy. Drowned in yellow mustard and juicy dill pickles.   This place has some pretty amazing burger concoctions. Coronary issues? Steer clear!  The dessert menu looks incredible but I never have room. Onion rings could use a reinvention. Nothing special.   I want to eat a burger here every week."}
{"text":"Always great burgers made fresh which keeps them busy and does make for a bit of a wait.  Worth it though as it has a large menu to accommodate any taste. Worth trying are the deserts. A meal can easily cost $20+ so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a quick bite.  Also parking can be difficult at times"}
{"text":"Dropped my burger on the floor and it took them an hour to remake it. They gave me some more fries tho I guess."}
{"text":"If you've never eaten at Holy Chuck, you've never had a burger! The burger was juicy and fresh. The fries were crisp and well done. The place is clean and the ambience is vibrant! The order was correct and quick.  Perfect for a Saturday lunch, or for any lunch, or any meal, or between meals even. Only tried their signature Holy Chuck so far but will definitely be returning for much, much, more!"}
{"text":"Yes, these burgers are greasy.  Let's get that out of the way.  But it doesn't resemble the type of industrial-synthetic grease you get from McD's or something, and let's remember that in most cases you're eating some kind of double cheeseburger with bacon and sauteed onions.  Grease is part of that meal, and I'd rather have it than eat a dry, cardboardy burger.  I had the Cowlorie (double cheeseburger with the aforementioned bacon and caramelized onions, with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches in place of the top and bottom bun).  I found the burger was actually quite large, which made me feel a little better about spending $11.99 on it, and the patties were flavourful and tender.  Everything managed to stay together quite well somehow, though one of the guys at our table resigned himself to knife-and-forking it.  I like the grilled cheese bun option, and I found Chuck's implementation to be better than Priest's.  I didn't think it was overly-salted as some comments mentioned, and I don't put much salt on anything these days.  I think the only taste I wasn't crazy about was the onions, which were OK, but not really clicking with the rest of the flavour from the patties, bacon, and grilled cheese.  I'd skip them next time.  The fries were good, and I think they had the potential to be better, but they might have been a little overseasoned for me.  At first I liked the extra flavour (not sure what it was) but by the end of my basket I was wishing for less of it.    Service was good, and very friendly.  The guy working the register (owner? manager? not sure) wandered around when there weren't new customers to ask people how everything was, and made a few recommendations when people were unsure what to order.  I'd definitely go back when I'm in need of a big, heavy burger meal and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little grease."}
{"text":"As a Canada visitor, I wanted to eat a good old fashioned burger. So I went to Holy Chuck. I had the Holy Chuck himself and onionsrings as side dish. The Holy Chuck is a double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions, and it was excellent. The ratio of beef/cheese/bacon was perfect and also the bread did. The onionrings completed my burger adventure as they were how onionrings should be. The only critic point I can give is that the Holy Chuck is a little bit too small, so I had a short but good Burger adventure. For all the people who are searching for an old fashioned greasy bacon cheese burger, which for me is a real burger, I can definately suggest the holy chuck burger."}
{"text":"Today I had the Big Chuck. It wasn't bad but it didn't meet my expectation of the Big Mac although my stomach surely prefers the Big Chuck version. The onions were good, a little too much salt for my liking but otherwise they had a great flavour and excellent crunch.   We had a coupon for a free dessert so I got The Butcher, The Baker, and The Ice Cream Maker. Raw cookie dough wrapped in bacon and deep fried with Nutella and vanilla ice cream. I would have liked more cookie dough for the amount of ice cream they give but the flavours were all there."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and only had a junior cheeseburger, but it was great! Amazing milkshakes! This corner has a Hero Burger and a Carl's Jr - skip and try this place instead!"}
{"text":"First visit, so I figured I'd ease in with \"The Holy Chuck,\" a basic double cheeseburger with bacon and onions.  Had it cooked to medium and it was great. The burger was greasy and soft like butter. I'm not a fan of my burgers being too red in the middle, but this was one of the rare occasions where I would have one like that.  No post-burger punishment from my stomach after eating it, too. Bonus!  The fries were solid.  For me, Holy Chuck is one of the top two or three burgers I've eaten in Toronto."}
{"text":"Staying true to its name, Holy Chuck is the Mecca of burgers (and probably diabetes) in Toronto. Me and my friends always make sure to make the pilgrimage to this place when we reunite during the holidays. The food is delicious and although I guarantee you will regret eating it and decreasing your life expectancy by 10% afterwards, the regret is only part of the experience, and totally worth it.   I recommend getting either the Holy Chuck or the Grind n Shine. Make sure you get them with fries too because the fries here are magical. The milkshake is also really good but thick as hell. If you feel like giving the middle finger to whatever god you believe in after he gave you one life to live, try the Challenge."}
{"text":"I've been here with my kids a few times because of their gluten free bun option, but otherwise it's quite pricey for a hamburger.  What's the point of adding all the fancy toppings if the last thing you add is disgusting processed cheese that dominates the flavour of the whole sandwich?    At our most recent visit, two of the orders had mistakes, one was missing bacon, an easy fix, but another was a completely wrong sandwich.  Luckily one of our diners is easy to please and  ate it anyway."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try.  I still can't get on board and I love burgers.  The buns seem cheap quality which doesn't match the burger.  The cheese also seems cheap.  Went with a few people and we all felt sick after eating.  I think I would choose hero burger or burgers priest over this restaurant."}
{"text":"$51.09 for 2 holy chuck burgers, a grind and shine, 2 regular fries, 2 fountain pops, and 2 bottled waters. It is pricey,  but the burgers are juicy - even cooked to well-done and the fries are well-seasoned.  This is our 2nd time here, in a week! Probably will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. That's really the only word that can sum up my experience at Holy Chuck. Had the Signature burger and some of the Raging Bull fries, while my girlfriend had the Village Bahahastard.   First, the fries. I absolutely adore spicy food; can't get enough of it, but this wasn't good spicy...it was vinegar+chilli overload. So much of it in fact, that it was all you could taste. Absolutely no other flavours. 1/5   The Holy Chuck Burger wasn't much better. On the plus side, the meat was cooked perfectly and was incredibly tender. On the down side: pretty much everything else. The bun was dreadful--it's like spending all of your money on a beautiful house, then decorating it with plastic furniture from the dollar store. If this is \"the best burger in Toronto\", god help us all. 2/5  Third, the Bahahastard was just boring. The cheese was overwhelmingly greasy, salty, and just way too much. One slice would've probably been alright, but having two just killed the burger. Part of the allure of eating a gourmet burger is in tasting the high quality of the meat--this absolutely destroyed that. Again, the only redeeming feature was the meat, what could be tasted anyway. A generous 2/5.  If these ratings seem a bit harsh, it's because you're holding yourself out as a gourmet burger place--one of the best in fact--in Toronto. Compared to a Burger King or McDonalds, this might be a 3.5, but for a gourmet joint, this was nowhere near good enough."}
{"text":"Holy greasy and holy pricey. $20 for a burger, fries and a soft drink - and I was still hungry afterwards.  I had the Smokey Cow, and it was probably the greasiest burger I have ever had. I used about 3 napkins wiping off all the oil from my hands, but eventually had to use the washroom to physically wash them. Even the bun was greasy. It was probably a good burger, but the only thing I got out of it was the oiliness.  The seasoned fries were excellent - light, crispy and fluffy on the inside - but for $20, my burger was about the size of a Quarter Pounder (I am NOT kidding) and my fries were about a McD's large size. I know you can't expect huge portions from a quality place, but this place did not meet either expectation."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the animal feed burger (veggie option), too much feta cheese. However, I've heard the meat burgers are amazing. The Holy Chuck Fries were amazing though, great concept! Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Wow, such garbage. Very greasy, extremely overpriced, subpar product. Asked for a medium burger, got a well done one. I'm not going to a fresh meat joint for the same quality meat I can get at McDonald's. The bun was a crappy little wonder bread bun. For a $10+ burger I'm expecting something much more then that. Combine the terrible burger with the long wait time and this is a one star place to avoid."}
{"text":"The roasted acorn visited Holy Chuck once again yesterday, craving for their juicy burger and crispy fries. & it definitely matched up with our memory of how good it was! he re-ordered the grind n' shine which is a double cheese burger featuring beacon and an egg. for eggs lover, this is a must. the patty was super juicy and their special sauce made it oh-so yummy. it also had a piece of potato chip in the burger that added an extra dimension to the burger!  I ordered the animal feed, wanting to compare it with \"the option\" from the burger priest . it is a deep-fried portobello mushroom stuffed with feta and cream cheese. i found it to be a little bit on the heavy side, a little too cheesy. but overall, it is very satisfying. & i like the animal feed better than the option from the prie from st because the one i had the priest was not fully cooked and slightly cold.  Holy Chuck offers the type of fries that i LOVE. other the fact that they are freshly made in-house with yukon potatoes everyday, it is not too crispy that it will scratches the top of your mouth but not too soggy that it feels bleh. therefore, I highly recommend their fries. a meal is never a meal when burger is not matched with fries anyways.  conclusion:  roasted!   definitely one of the best burger places in town! MUST TRY!  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/01/01/holy-chuck/ for pictures of all the awesome food i mentioned above ! :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joint in town!  Meat so fresh you can taste it, they ground the meat fresh in-house on the hour.  Their signature burger, Holy Chuck burger is a bacon double cheeseburger topped with caramelized onions.  Said no toppings please, but I like my veggie and took my chance, the lettuce, onion, and tomato made it even better!  You can taste the fresh herbs on the fries too!"}
{"text":"Fatty juicy burgers. Not an everyday meal as it can be greasy.  The big bad wolf is an amusing name to a burger. \"I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll..\" *slam* crush the deep fried onion house down.  Milkshakes are good here. No idea how people can finish their challenge."}
{"text":"Very dissapointing! I thought this place was close to being on par with burger priest,but not a chance! they do not cook the burgers enough as it is still visibly red inside. not even in the same league as burger priest!"}
{"text":"They don't have shakes like this in Indonesia . I really really like the original hamburger the holy chunk top on on the menu .my boyfriend tricked me into getting the raging bull fries with small red pepper on the menu to show that they are spicy and they were so not good that I found myself in a rage. They aren't visually appealing squirty brown sauce all over that burn my mouth and I'm use to the heat but this was pain and I didn't want to eat them anymore so I left them in the bowl because I wasn't able to eat the hbutger until my mouth cooled off from the bull fries. Take them off the menu please !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit to Holy Chuck and as usual I ordered the Grind N' Shine, a double cheeseburger with bacon, caramelized onions, topped with crispy homemade potato chips and a fried egg.   I also ordered a side of fries as I'm usually still hungry after eating their burger and I'm not willing to dish out another $13 for a second one. I was a little disappointed this time around as the potato chips were so soggy that you couldn't possibly call them \"crispy\" anymore. Also, my fried egg was overcooked and the yolk no longer oozed out of the burger the way I like it to. The patty itself was good but I still prefer the juicier and more flavourful patties at Burger Priest.   I just really like this place for their huge menu options, great shakes and decent seating. While there we also witnessed someone finish the Go Chuck Yourself burger challenge. It was pretty awesome and somewhat disgusting to watch at the same time...lol!"}
{"text":"Very similar in taste and presentation to the Burger Priest, of which I was not a fan.  We decided to try out Holy Chuck because it was highly recommended by a friend as one of the best burger joints.    We ordered 'The Big Chuck' (two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce and cheese), one strawberry milkshakes and one salted caramel Nutella milkshake.  The burger tasted like a big mac.  Unfortunately, for a place that heavily promotes the freshness of their meat, the fresh beef flavour was completed masked.  The milkshakes were terrible - too thick and too sweet.  The milkshakes were advertised as made from fresh ice cream but it sure did not taste like it.  The strawberry milkshake tasted just sugar and syrup.  If anyone had a milkshake made from fresh ice cream (eg. from Kawartha's Dairy), they would know the difference.  The salted caramel milkshake was so thick that I couldn't even drink it through the straw.    The owner of the restaurant seems very rude as well.  We had brought the milkshake back to the counter to ask for more milk.  This man who seems to be the owner since he just walks around watching everyone, took the cup without saying a word.  Suddenly, he just left the restaurant.  No one seemed to know what was happening."}
{"text":"This place is the superstar in its category. Decent burgers, high quality meat, juicy patties but not too greasy at all, perfect fries (go for big chuck fries) and even do not think about walking out of this place without trying the shakes. My favourite is the Nutella shake which I prefer to have it as dessert."}
{"text":"We ordered the holy chuck and the cowlerie with an order of onion rings and a chocolate shake. The holy chuck was more than enough. It was the definition of American food. I wish I got the jr all dressed because it's just so much meat and cheese you start feeling sick.  The pouring looked so much better than the onion rings. And e Shake was the best I have had. Definitely would come back. Just order a bit less. Also the service was really good. They were very friendly."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is that is is completely unashamed of the type of food it is, who it is targeting, and what it can deliver - that is, IT IS A BURGER JOINT. There is no pussy-footing about the fact that you are eating meat, cheese, carbs, grease. However, they do this brilliantly - patties are fresh, juicy, and tasty. Fries are also fresh, sprinkled with herbs, and lovely. Shakes are over the top and must be 1000 calories alone.  I usually go for \"The Holy Chuck\" and have not been disappointed. Some of the other items on the menu make me nervous - such as the burger between grilled cheese! In conclusion, Holy Chuck is nailing the gourmet burger concept!"}
{"text":"I really need to improve the average rating of this place so it's review time from a self proclaimed and accused burger snob.  I will admit that I was a bit hesitant going to this place after reading the previous reviews from this website.  But I did a little digging and found that most of these reviewers haven't even been to Burger's Priest which can claim fame to the best burger of the year (the vatican) in Toronto Life magazine (http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/from-the-print-edition-daily-dish/2011/10/25/burgers-priest-vatican-city/)  Of course, I'm not going to knock someone's review because they have different taste in burgers, but I would figure by now that the majority of people know what a good burger constitutes if they've proactively searched for it.  Let's start with the patty: Tender and fall apart goodness!  Very close to what I like from Burger's Priest.  The patty is a bit smaller but that's ok. Meat texture and consistency is amazing.  The kitchen is open concept so you can see them grinding the meats there.  What's more amazing about this place is that they offer lamb and pork burgers as well!  Bun and condiments: The bun was soft but not soft enough in my opinion.  Perhaps a bit more toasting would have done the job.  Oh and condiments? pshhh I don't do that but I did have the signature Chuck burger (double cheeseburger with bacon and fried onions) and the bacon was nice and thick!  Menu: The menu has many similar items to Burger's Priest! The Cowlerie is the same as the Vatican and many other items.  I spoke to the owner and he said he would be coming out with a new menu soon and it would include a Frois Gras burger!? wow.  Decor: I don't care much for the decor and simply appreciate the fact that there is ample sitting space for everyone.   Bottom Line: This is BS approved (burger snob)!  Prices are about right, meat is tasty but could be larger patties, variety of meats is appreciated, and location is great (st. clair and yonge).   EAT IT."}
{"text":"I cannot even express how excited I was to try a burger from Holy Chuck.  I work right at Yonge & St. Clair, and saw it open and had not gone until the other day.  After reading reviews in Toronto Life and seeing that it's like the #2 burger in the city... lets just say, I had high expectations.  Well that is gone...   First off, it's pricey.  It was $11 for a cheeseburger and coke.  But when getting a gourmet burger in Toronto, you're kind of used to it.  I brought it back to work (2 minute walk), opened it up and within the first couple of bites I noticed how raw the meat was.  Now, I like it a medium (steaks medium rare), but red, raw ground beef is really gross.  The bun was not a good bun...  McDonald's has a better bun.  And the patty was so incredibly greasy, that the bottom bun just sopped it up, and it made the bun inedible.  Then, the worse came....  a short, dark, curly hair right in the middle of the ground chuck.  I have blonde hair... there was no mistaking that this hair was mine.  I will never go there again.  I was so grossed out by this burger, that I don't think I can stomach it again.  Rude Boy on Ronces has my vote for best burger, and next time I'm craving a burger, I'll just go there."}
{"text":"Beyond delicious!! From the fresh ground chuck that they grind daily, or fresh cut fries that are cooked to perfection - crispy not greasy, Holy Chuck never takes a short cut when it comes to their quality of food.  If you haven't tried them then you're surely missing out! And once you do indulge in their one of a kind burgers you'll be sure to become a regulate! Thank you Holy Chuck for your amazing  and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"The burgers were decent, price was normal too; just that it wasnt very juicy, I like my burgers Oily an disturbing to the point i look like a slob :D but thats just me; other then that good place to eat."}
{"text":"I had their signature burger \"the Holy Chuck\". It looked really good, although small for the price.  I was very disappointed, for $10 I was expecting something much better.  The bacon was cold and rock hard, there was only a small amount of caramelized onions and not very tasty, it was also way too greasy (never thought I would say that).  I also can't believe they used process cheese and not actual cheddar.  The only positive was the bun was soft and tasty.  Will not be going there again  McDonald's Angus burger is far better."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, and I would go again, but it does not beat Burgers' Priest.   Great that there is lots of seating, and we didn't have to wait at all to place our order. The decor is nice too.   As for the important part, the burgers. I ordered the holy chuck which is recommended if it is your first time. Meat is good, everything is good. BUT it is missing some fresh crispiness, such as pickle, lettuce, tomato or a little bit of fresh onion. Personally I found the caramelized onion a little overpowering and wet, as it made my bun wet fast. I thought the whole thing was a tad too greasy, especially when I looked down on my plate and noticed that the grease pool had started congealing before I was even done eating.   The fries are excellent though, much better than Burgers' Priest. Thin and super crunchy. The poutine was awesome too, despite not being a fan of the parsley (or other green stuff) that they threw on top. Real cheese curds and good gravy on delicious fries.   I think they forgot our dessert order too since we waiting 20 minutes for them to throw the nutella pops in the fryer. They were good, but nothing to rave about.   All in all, it's a neat spot, but be ready to feel gross from the grease and don't expect it to be better than the best: Burgers' Priest."}
{"text":"Underwhelming and overpriced...  Today we had a pretty sad first experience with Holy Chuck. Walked in and place an order for pickup: one Grind 'n Shine burger with fries, one Frustrated Cow with onion rings. Upon receiving the take out bag, we thought it was incredibly small for a double order so we asked our server to double check.... he said \"I'm sure everything is in here\" without even opening the bag. So obviously when we got home, we realized they forgot the fries. The burgers were good, but really not worth the price. I'll even go as far as saying they weren't much better than a Baconator and more than double the price. We made sure to call the manager and tell him about the incident; he promptly blamed it on a new staff member and offered us a free appetizer \"the next time we go there\", which we declined, as clearly there won't be a next time.  We're pretty annoyed and still hungry right now. Holy Chuck sucks."}
{"text":"Overrated. And I was so excited for this one.  Soggy fries. Bland burger (I actually wanted to put salt on it.) Roasted red pepper and garlic feta aioli - not impressed! Whole wheat bun was the only thing that was sort of good.  Too disappointed to even try a shake. Not coming back - too many good burger places in the city!"}
{"text":"I've had the Big Chuck (Big Mac copycat) and Holy Chuck on several occasions and have to say its my favorite spot out of the Premium Burger places I've tried.  Poutine was decent 4/5 for that. Burgers are 5/5"}
{"text":"Ordered the cheddar cheese, bacon and egg burger. It was pretty good, wouldn't say out of the world though. I won't be ordering another one though it was quite expensive even for a single patty burger. If you order a single patty burger you save a dollar.... THAT'S IT! order wisely my friend."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday at noon. There was no line up, so service was quick. I ordered the raging bull burger with a poutine and a drink. My girlfriend ordered the big chuck. Total came to $35 which I thought was a little expensive.   I ordered my burger medium and it was cooked perfectly. The problem I had with the raging bull was the sauce. It was really salty and made my burger very oily. The poutine was good and they gave a lot of fries. The burger my girlfriend ordered was exactly like a big mac but bigger minus the middle bun. But she liks the big mac from mcdonalds better (the sauce is better).   I would come back and try out another burger but would never order the raging bull again."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant because we wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I had the Animal Feed burger. A cheeseburger with a panko crusted portobella mushroom. So so good. We also order their Holy Duck burger...a single patty with truffle oil, double smoked bacon, maple syrup and foie gras! Heavenly!  We also ordered a bacon, fudge and sea salt milkshake. Which was unbelievable.  We blogged about our experience:  http://tipsareincluded.blogspot.ca/2012/04/holy-chuck-burger.html  A great place for gourmet burgers."}
{"text":"Stay away! Unless you want to wait an hour till you eat!"}
{"text":"It was good, but too expensive for me. If it was the best burger I'd ever had my entire life that would be a different, but it was just \"good\". My friend and I each got a burger, a side and split a milkshake (also quite good!) but if I was to compare it to other burger places I've been to, it wouldn't be my #1. I haven't been back since, as I've found better places for the same price. There is, however, a challenge - if you eat the gigantic burger you get your meal free or something along those lines, if you're up for it, give it a go!  Notes: there is seating available, not a lot of parking in the area, and they accept credit/debit as well."}
{"text":"What is not to love about creative burgers made to order with a rich shake?! Clean and courteous, reliable and fresh. Don't be put off by the name ... check it out."}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I decided to try it. I originally came expecting to try the jerky cow because I love jerk seasoning and grilled pineapples, unfortunately, they did not have jerk sauce left. That left me disappointed already.  I ended up getting the original burger, which was a double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions. What threw me off was that they can do their burgers 'medium'. What worried me the whole time as I ate was what kind of beef they used because I thought ground beef couldn't be eaten rare. Anyways, I ended up getting medium well before thinking things through, which wasn't too bad, but having little bits of mushy raw beef in the middle was still sort of unappetizing to look at. The patty was very juicy and moist, however, considering the amount of oil that poured out, I don't think it could be dry.   Overall it was good for those days where you feel like indulging in something incredibly fat, But I would not say that it was amazing, especially since my bun was soaked in oil by the end, and I eat really fast. I can't imagine a slow eater attempting this!"}
{"text":"Ordered the smokey cow burger and was not what the menu described...where is the heavily smoked 3 year aged cheddar? ...all it got was 2 thin slices, when melted you could see through to the burger....waste of $15. (that's only for the burger)"}
{"text":"I had just moved to the young and st. Clair area so walked into Holy Chuck with my boyfriend to try out their famous burgers. Firstly the cashier who took the order was extremely unfriendly to the point of being rude. It felt as though she felt the customers are beneath her and she can treat them with disdain.  Assuming that she must've had an exhausting day, I ordered their signature burger which came runny with sauces mixed oil.  Couldn't really tell anything about the meat and since everything seemed to have melted together like a sloppy Joe there was no way of distinguishing the patty from the bun.  Me and my boyfriend decided to try it the second time a few weeks later and it was the same messy unsatisfying experience. In addition, ,after eating the burgers we both becames extremely lethergic and could not stay up so had to sleep off the food.  We both wondered what it could've been in the burgers to knock us out like that!  I wouldn't go back to this place ever!"}
{"text":"It took 50 minutes to get 2 burgers and fries. Fortunately we checked out bag before leaving and realized that our order was missing an order of fries. We approached the counter and I was asked to produce my receipt as proof. Fortunately the cashier vouched for me. Now to the chaos in the kitchen. It took another 20 minutes to get the missing fries and we were not the only ones who had this problem. We get home and realize our burgers don't have the requested toppings. What a disappointment for having paid $43. Burger Priest is by far superior."}
{"text":"Went Yesterday - had the \"Holy Chuck\" which is their version of a Big Mac, fries and gravy.   All and all I wont be back.   $4 for one size fries which is more medium than large is just too expensive.   The burger was so greasy it literally fell apart in my hands. You can make a fresh burger without this amount of grease. If I had to describe the burger, I would describe it as soggy.   Burger Priest is less greasy, still fresh and same problem with the fries.   I think If I had to, I'd go to burger priest or dare I say it; Wendy's or 5 guys, before this place again."}
{"text":"Best damn burger I have ever had !!! Can't wait to go back and try the Nutella and sea salt milk shake!  You will definitely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy Chuck Wasn't as good as I expected, burger and poutine was overly salty, overly rated, overly price and under size. Harvey's is 10 times better."}
{"text":"Cool ideas, but not a huge fan. 45$ for two people is a little pricey (shared a drink and a side). First thing i noticed, burger is greasy as hell. First bite and it squirts all over the place. Feta fries were good, but got soggy cause of how much dressing there was. Shake was arguably the best part. Overall not bad, but nothing special. Rather go to five guys."}
{"text":"I've had worse burgers, and I've had better burgers. Given all the talk about how amazing Holy Chuck Burgers was supposed to be, my expectations were quite high. They weren't quite met. While the burgers aren't bad, they also didn't blow my mind. That said, the service is friendly and attentive, and the space is quite pleasant, allowing both for contemplative people watching, or sharing food with friends.  The animal feed features a slightly waterlogged heavily breaded mushroom cap. The filling lacks the saltiness you'd expect from feta & cream cheese blend but  the lemon aioli (I didn't taste any herb) adds a nice acid top note that makes it palatable.  The smoky cow features some well executed bacon and the mozarella is a nice touch. The smoke on the sea salt is undetectable and made the eating experience a little too salty for my palate, given the existing salt in the bacon and smoked cheese. I wished for complexity and didn't quite get it. A little sugar (maybe on the bacon, or BBQ sauce) may help matters.  All the burgers come on soft white buns that remind me more of wonderbread than I'd like. For burgers this greasy, something with a higher protein content and more structure would be nice, as opposed to something that takes on the texture of sodden cotton batting after a few bites.  The fries are thin cut, crisp and very well salted. It's great if you're just ordering fries, but if you're adding a burger to them, be prepared for sodium overload. The veal cheek vino chili sounds promising, but like the smoky cow fails to deliver on the complexity you'd expect from it. It's not bad chili - the texture and viscosity is pleasant, but like everything else at Holy Chuck Burger, it failed to blow me away after promising to.  The milkshakes are pleasantly thick. The strawberry was pleasantly fruity, but the Bacon, Fudge Sea Salt version lacked the fudgy richness I'd have liked to see from it. There is however plenty of bacon.  Why they didn't get five stars: 1. Sodium overdose. It's rare for me to feel completely dehydrated after a meal, but after this, I felt like I'd been at a salt lick for much longer than I'd wanted. 2. Overpromise & under deliver - while this may be unfair, because I chose to believe the hype, and so more my fault than theirs, I wasn't blown away and I was told I would be."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 0 stars, I would. Sub par burgers and even crappier service. After having an absolutely horrific experience I sent an email to management...think I got any acknowledgement? Heck no.  So...the burger patty is small, not great and bland as all get out. Let me also mention that this burger is anything but cheap. I got the signature burger which they refuse to let you put condiments on...which if you have a good patty is fine, but if you have a soggy, mealy crappy patty you need some ketchup at the very least. The restaurant was quite full and after waiting nearly ten minutes for our milkshake that we ordered with our burger and watching about 5 other people go up and get shakes that had come in after us we finally went to the counter and asked...we were told it would be right up. Another five minutes...a shake appears...and is given to someone else. Another 5 minutes burgers and now the shake are up...  Burgers ordered medium rare  are raw and returned, placed back on the grill and then amazingly back on the original bun. Seriously? You want me to pay a shit ton of money and you're gonna give me the same soggy ass bun? This ended up going in the trash.  I went up to the counter to get a drink. The owner was there at the cash and was on the phone taking an order. No acknowledgement of me whatsoever. His partner leans over and asks what I want. I ask for a grape Boylans. I get a cream soda. I ask again for a grape Boylans and grudgingly I get given one...for $2.60.  Bottom line? For three burgers one fry, one shake, one water and one boylans we paid just over 50 dollars and got about 50 cents worth of service.  I have NO idea how people rave about this place or why the heck anyone would ever go back. Save the money, save the time and go to Burger's Priest or even Five Guys...shit, I've had a better burger at Harvey's."}
{"text":"Had to try this place after hearing great things about it and being  burger lovers that we are.  Mad Cow Burger: I've had a similar burger from The Priest Burger - the deep fried cheese-stuffed portobello is what drew me in.  I have to say though the burger was really yummy and flavourful, the feta & cream cheese was a bit too heavy.  I couldn't finish this one!  Clara got their signature burger, the Holy Chuck: DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER WITH BACON & CARAMELIZED ONIONS.  Without so many toppings to distract from the actual burger, you're able to really enjoy their high quality beef patties.  One of the best burgers we've had!   Our friend who came with us to the restaurant is a bacon fan.  It's no surprise that he got the You Fat Pig: TWO 100% ALL BACON PATTIES, TRIPLE CHEESE, CRISPY BACON & TOPPED WITH HOMEMADE CREAMY BACON DRESSING.  The bacon patties were tender but the burger as a whole was too heavy to eat.   We shared the Raging Bull Fries.  It comes with DOUBLE BACON, DOUBLE CHEESE & FRESH SAUT√âED HOT BANANA PEPPERS, SMOTHERED IN RAGING BULL GRAVY.  This was very spicy and our tongues were on fire! The fries were of good texture though.  We're going to have to come back to try all the other burgers and fries that we didn't get to try this time around."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Holy Chuck Burger Cuisine: Burgers Location: Midtown Address: 1450 Yonge St Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  *Half block from St.Clair subway station *Fresh Burgers (meat grinded in house and never frozen) *Specialty milkshakes  There are too many burger places in Toronto and I doubt I will ever get to visit them all. But hey, I am not complaining- I guess that means my journey to finding THE ultimate burger will continue on...forever.  Ever since my disappointing visit to the Burgers Priest which everyone seemed to love, I do admit I've become a little skeptical when it comes to preference of Burgers. I guess it is again,  a personal preference but maybe I just don't like the typical burgers other people like.  However, Holy Chuck burger was pretty active on Twitter and it seemed like it was becoming the next spot for burgers. And when I heard about the fudge, salt and bacon milkshake- I had to try it out. Afterall, I do love bacon!  Ordered: Holy Chuck Burger 3/5  *Their signature bacon double cheeseburher & caramelized onions for $9.99 *The price is just for the burger (you have to order fries on the side) *It is not a huge burger, so I found it to be a little expensive *The bun is soft (texture is like McDonalds Burger) which I like on some burgers *Meat is fresh and super juicy but also very greasy *I found grease just dripping from my hands as I was eating it *It later formed a little white fat puddle in my basket (ooh...calories) *Lots of caramelized onions which went well with the patty *Everything was really soft and mushy together, making the burger fall apart *Very distinct beef smell to the patty (some people really don't like this)  Ordered: Regular fries 4/5 and Specialty Milkshake 2/5   *Added to the burger and made it a combo for $7.99 *I love their fries, they are thin, crispy and big in portion *Only it wasn't served very hot (if it was served hot, I would have given it 5/5) *I would go back just for their fries *It's such a shame when burger place don't have good fries *Specialty Milkshake is made with 90% ice cream and 10% milk *Ordered the Bacon, Fudge and Sea salt and had high expectations *Small in size and served in a fountain drink cup *Would personally prefer a clear cup for milkshakes *It was very overall very rich to a point where it was hard to use a straw *I found it to be a little too much with the fudge and the bacon bits *Milkshake itself was really rich and sweet *Bacon bits added a nice saltiness to it but it was just overwhelming  Summary: Maybe I expected too much, but their burger did not impress me much. It was a good burger, but a little too greasy for me. I don't mind fatty food, but if I can see fat pool forming from the grease dripping from my food- it will turn me off.  It was the really strong beef scent that bugged me so I don't know if all their burgers are like that or just that day. If I am in the area, I will def drop by for their fries though!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and as a burger fanatic .. this is one of my fave places. I got the big chuck this time and it was amazing. TWO patties!!! The big chuck is the one with the special sauce and two patties. It's kind of like a Big Mac but BETTER!!If you like the Big Mac at mcdonalds then you'd enjoy this one! It was also bigger than the Big Mac and honestly I had to squish it down a bit because I couldn't fit it in my mouth!!!   Previously, I've had the cowlorie which is a burger but instead of the buns it uses two grilled cheese - I found this to be too dry as there was too much bread and it was just TOO MUCH for me. I've also had the holy chuck (classic) twice before and I've gotta say that is still my favourite!!! As for fries, I've only had the classic just fries and I've tried the raging bull fries before. The portion for the fries are definitely for sharing as it is HUGE!! Personally, I found the raging bull fries to be a bit too spicy for me because I don't really eat spicy... but at the same time it was a good amount of kick! The only thing I'd change about the fries is that I wish they were thick cut....  The patties they make are THE BEST and sooooooo fresh! Sometimes if you come at the right time you'd catch them grinding up the meat and making the patties FRESH!!   Came here for lunch and when I returned to work for the afternoon I didn't feel too greased out!! I will come back to try different items!"}
{"text":"A stand out burger joint in a city with plenty of competition. The meat is literally melt in your mouth good and the buns are always fresh.   Try the all bacon patty.... Next level"}
{"text":"I only come here a couple of times a year BUT they make the best burgers and milkshakes!! The double cheeseburgers are salty, juicy, gooey goodness with enough bun to carry the whole thing to your mouth hole. And my absolute favourite milkshake is the nutella and peanut butter shake -- it is amazing. I love this place. The staff are quick and very nice. Never close, Holy Chuck, I love you."}
{"text":"I went here based on all the hype. I ordered the Jr. Cheeseburger and the Crispy Fries.  I actually thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. The burger tasted very fresh and not too greasy. (I thought it was going to be dripping with grease after reading the other reviews). It actually wasn't very greasy at all. I think the double patties, bacon and cheese might make the burger more greasy.   The fries were not crispy, but they were good. I really liked the addition of the herbs on the fries.   I would definitely come here again, I'd like to try their other burgers and their milkshakes.  Update: I have ate here again a number of times and enjoyed my meal. The poutine is excellent! Huge portion so I recommend sharing or having it just as your meal. I find that the burgers which come with 2 patties can be a bit greasy. But everything is fresh and it's great to have this place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I got the holy duck burger. Everything blended so well! I'm not a typical burger lover, but I definitely love this one! Although it was $30 burger, worth it."}
{"text":"The food here isn't appetizing. I couldn't even finish my fries and my burger wasn't fully cooked. At least my drink was cold I guess. I hear good things about their shakes but it's going to be a long time before I ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Upon walking into the store, we (my boyfriend and I) first noticed the packed tables with hungry patrons. The restaurant itself had more of a food court type of environment where you could just seat yourself. Norm and I opted to get take out rather than waiting around for a seat.  The menu was quite large and had many different options. From the descriptions of the menu, I automatically knew what I wanted to try, The Animal Feed. As the menu describes, The Animal Feed is \"PANKO CRUSTED PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM STUFFED WITH FETA & CREAM CHEESE, DEEP FRIED THEN TOPPED WITH LETTUCE, TOMATO & LEMON HERB AIOLI\". Sounded delicious and something I really wanted to try. However, being a burger joint, I just had to give the meat patty a try as well. So I opted for The Mad Cow; The Animal Feed + Jr. Cheeseburger.  The built up expectation for this burger was grand, I had wanted to try this place for over a year and now I was finally able to sink my teeth into the holy burger. The first bite I was only able to get a taste of The Animal Feed and as I chewed, disappointment set in. The mushroom had caused the breading to get soggy and damp and the sweet cream cheese mixture with the salty feta didn't quite fit together for me. I gave the burger another bite so that I could try the meat, and lucky for them, it worked. The burger was nicely seasoned, cooked to a beautiful medium, and super juicy. The burger patty aside, I couldn't get over the strange combination of the cheeses on a soggy mushroom. This burger cost us $10.99 and was definitely not worth the price.   We also ordered the Panko onion rings for a costly price of $4.79. I love onion rings and Panko crusted onion rings seemed like a good pairing to my burger. It stated on the menu that this was not homemade but I still expected decent onion rings for $5. Apparently Holy Chuck's is unaware of what Panko actually is. I was served overly greasy battered rings that I could have bought at the grocery store for $2. It was definitely not Panko crusted and I was definitely disappointed.  Upon hearing about this place, I heard rave reviews about their famous milkshakes so of course, I had to try it. We ordered a Strawberry shake which came out to $4.99. The milkshake was amazing. I had never tasted such a rich creamy milkshake. It was nicely blended with small chucks of strawberry (which I assume was in the strawberry ice cream they used). The only downside was that it was a little difficult to get through because it was a tad too sweet. Don't get me wrong, I have a sweet tooth like no other but half way through, my tongue started to feel strange and I felt like I needed water to dilute the sweetness from my mouth.  Overall, we spent about $25 on the meal for one burger, onion rings, a milkshake, and a fountain drink. For that price, we could have gone elsewhere and gotten double the food. Value-wise, this place was a fail. For the mediocrity, it was not worth it.  Would I ever go back? Probably not unless I was getting the food for free. If that's the case, I'll take The Go Chuck Yourself (six patties, six cheese, triple bacon, onions and three grilled cheese sandwiches for the bread) and a milkshake please! ;)"}
{"text":"Only come here if you're ready to dish out $50 dollars for two people and that's sharing a plate of fries and drink.  I was sorely disappointed when I got my order (You Fat Pig) I expected greatness but all I got was something that definitely did not taste like bacon. It actually tasted, looked and felt like raw ground pig. Will definitely not order that again. My gf enjoyed her cheese burger, but everything is very expensive for a burger joint. They can fix this problem by giving side fries for every burger order but they will definitely not do that, you're better off going to Five Guys since it's just down the street."}
{"text":"This probably would have been more like a 2.5 star review.  For the fries I would have given it a 5 star, as they were similar to what you could expect in a very good restaurant-crispy, real, and sprinkled with dried parsley.  For $3.50, a nice portion was shared by two eaters.  In terms of the burger, I ordered the signature on whole wheat with an extra patty for $3.00 (making it, in theory, 12oz of meat-I have a fairly big appetite).  The bun was innocuous, I found. The company uses Western Bakery Buns.  It neither made the burger better nor worse than it would have been.  I found the meat to be fresh, a little on the fatty side, and a little salty, and crumbly.  Toppings were fine and also fresh and the bacon was good though a little ephemeral it seemed-not evident in every bite.  The processed cheese made the burger even greasier and I don't consider this real food.  Still, it did not destroy the burger, just didn't improve it.  Overall taste is perhaps what McDonald's should taste like, if it was real food. With a drink and tax this meal comes out to about $15.00 a person including a 500ml drink.  Based on offerings I have tried in Mid-town Toronto, the hamburger at The Rushton restaurant (10oz of pure meat, fairly lean meat, on a brioche bun, with fries, standard toppings, garlic aioli and a pickle) is the gold standard in burgers.  You leave full and stay full.  That plate is $18.00 a person without tax or tip.  Bottom line-if you're going to choose the dirty option, you might as well go for the best dirty option.  This is just okay, in a pinch, and depending on your appetite you may leave feeling hungry a few hours later (I did).  Though the staff is friendly and responsible, the service fairly quick, and the eating space and washrooms clean and pleasant enough, I am not planning my next trip."}
{"text":"Very Good!! The burger was delicious and well presented, I had the Cowlorie and we agreed that there was way too much cheese and therefore made the burger too salty.  The fries were a let down and the poutine didn't help. I would rate the poutine similar to McDonalds which is a good reason to either re-invent it or pull it from the menu.  But they've got the gourmet burger down packed which gives them a 4 star."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about Holy Chuck and finally had a chance to try out their burger this past weekend.  The Vaughan location is great for those who drive as there's plenty of parking spaces in the big lot they share with KFC/Taco Bell. Just like their neighbors, Holy Chuck offers late night drive thru for the lazy bums who'd like to stay inside their warm cars.   I must have stared at their extensive menu for at least ten minutes before being able to decide what I wanted to order. I ended up getting their specialty - Holy Chuck burger. I also ordered a Nutella & Salted Caramel milk shake and it is AMAZING! I'll be ordering this everytime now...  The burger bun was lightly toasted and fluffy - the aroma of the patty (I got medium rare) was intertwined within the bun. The first bite was deliciously greasy, I'm surprised the buns did not come out drenched in grease. The patty is very fresh - I can see one of the staff members grinding a fresh batch.   One item I would not order again is the Poutine. I found the fries too thin for my tastes and overly salted. The gravy was also pretty salty but they throw on a generous amount of cheese curds!   I can't see myself coming here often for artery-clogging meal but definitely will come back when I need a good ol' greasy burger!"}
{"text":"Holy Chuck ruined burgers for me!  I live in Winnipeg, MB, and I had to hit up Holy Chuck during my recent trip to Toronto. Now, I will never taste such a fresh, delicious, flavourful burger unless I travel to Toronto. My mouth is watering as I type this review.  I had the THE HOLY DUCK. Foie Gras and black truffle on a burger? The flavour combination is truly unreal. I didn't want this burger to end! Every bite was juicy and delicious. Worth every penny.  The burger came with a side of fries and I had a Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Bean shake to accompany the meal. The shake had the perfect consistency. Thick and creamy, but not so much that you had trouble sucking it out of the straw, and it didn't melt quickly (I might have drank it real quick too..haha)  Me and my friend even ordered a 2nd burger to share: The Grind N' Shine.  Put a sunny side up egg on anything and I'm happy. But the flavour still remained! Juicy, fresh patty with toppings that embrace each other and punch you in the tastebuds.  That's their burgers. I love burgers and I miss these burgers oh so much."}
{"text":"I had a junior hamburger (one patty, no cheese) and an order of fries. The hamburger was great. They ask you how you'd like it cooked so naturally I went with medium. It was juicy (a touch over medium, but I'll not complain since it was so juicy), well seasoned, with a great soft bun, and fresh and flavourful toppings. Note that if you request onions, they will give you sauteed onions and raw onions. I was only anticipating raw onions so I was a bit surprised, but the sauteed onions were pretty good.   The fries were a good texture, but unfortunately they were overly salty. That detracted from these pretty good spuds."}
{"text":"I've been having a lot of burgers lately. I like burgers. A lot. I'm such a run of the mill white man. I love burgers so much.  Holy chuck is the pinnacle of the fast food burger. I'd go as far as to call it the holy grail in the kingdom of burgelot.   I had some double cheese burger and poutine. This is one of the only places where they ask you how you want your burger cooked. Just to be safe I took it medium. It was so juicy and moist, and overflowing with flavor. It was delicious, and everything fresh. The poutine was fantastic also. I want more of it.   The space itself is decently laid out. There's a fair amount of space. You should be able to get a table with little problem. While the place is busy, they push the orders out efficiently, you won't be waiting forever. The service is friendly enough.  Great place to get fat! Go there and get fat with your loved ones (or not) today!."}
{"text":"Holy DUCK at Holy Chuck!.  I don't know what it is about a burger with fois, but I have a hard time resisting. Overpriced fat on fat..... two days worth of calories...is it worth it?  I pretended to contemplate which burger to order, they had a huge selection of toppings and reasonably priced burgers.  I knew I was going to order the Holy Duck, thier most expensive burger for $27.99. I couldn't help myself!  Single patty  + double smoked bacon  + seared fois gras  + truffles with truffle oil and maple syrup.  It comes with a side of fries.  It was one of the moistest burgers I've ever had.  The truffle oil and syrup made everything drippy and oh-so-good.  I wanted to savour my burger. I was starving.  I quickly devoured my $30 burger and I was still hungry!  If I spend $30 bucks on my burger, I don't want to be hungry. Add another patty.  I wanted dessert so bad. More bacon and deep fried cookie dough. I didn't.  But I might be back for a sundae and a less decadent burger."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Fresh and juicy! Friendly staff and not a very long wait considering your burgers are cooked to order!"}
{"text":"I'm a big burger fan and I wanted to check this place out since it open on Yonge Street. First Impressions the guy that served us was really pleasant and friendly, he recommended the signature burger , we both got one and since I was really hungry I also got the Big Chuck, we also got onion rings and fries. We got them to go. $52.00 .Unfortunately I was not Impressed, the patty had a filler which was easily detected, I have been to many Burger joints ,and you can tell when there is no filler in a burger patty, we both agreed that  the signatures were disappointing, The Big Chuck, which is their take in a Big Mac, I think I would have preferred the Big Mac, did not like their take on the sauce, fries where ehh...... I think the only thing we both enjoyed were the onion rings. When you spend $52.00 on burgers I was hoping to get a good burger at the very least. First and Last time I visit Holy Chucks, they say \" you get what you paid for\" In this case I got ripped off. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"So went with the family and blew $70 for three burgers,two loaded fries,onion rings, a fountain drink, milk shake and Nutella lollipops.  Restaurant was nice and open and very clean! Service was great! No attitude!  I had the frustrated cow burger! Yummy! Blue cheese,caramelized onions, and burger done medium...insert emoji of smiley-face drool here!  My husband had the the big chuck, not worth writing home about, he made the mistake of ordering it medium rare, so he was a bit worried afterwards  The kids shared a Jr cheeseburger (both were still hungry, didn't think they would like it) but devoured it  Shared the creamy feta fries, too oily with the dressing Shared the poutine fries, the gravy was way too salty Shared the onions and was finished off!nice and crispy!  Husband had the bacon,fudge,sea salt milkshake! Awesome! Shared the Nutella pops, they were ok but not worth it.  Not worth $70 but will be back for the frustrated cow and tasting the kinds different milk shakes and desserts!"}
{"text":"I love the idea behind Holy Chuck burgers but the implementation is just a bit off. I was excited to hear about Holy Chuck because I thought it was going to be like a closer Burger's Priest, but it didn't quite live up to that.  The burgers were good, but not $10+ dollars good. And compared to Burger's Priest,  the burger downright sucks. But the fries were decent and the milk shake was excellent.  I had the Mad Cow, which is a one patty cheese burger with a fried portobello mushroom on top ($10.99). The beef was tender and beefy but it was also a bit bland.  A lot of grease was dripping all over my hands and the tray, but it didn't taste greasy to me. The fried mushroom was just ok, but it was kind of weird with the cream cheese and feta.  The fries were the skinny type and were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I think this is the one area where Holy Chuck beat out Burger's Priest.  However, I ordered lemon aioli to go with the fries, and while the fries were tasty, the lemon aioli was not.  It had some flavour that was reminiscent of dessert - I think the best way to describe it is mayo mixed with lemon curd, like the kind you can buy in a can to bake lemon meringue pies.  I also had a bacon, fudge, and sea salt milk shake that was the highlight of my meal.  It had little chunks of salty bacon in it that were a nice contrast to the sweet fudge and ice cream. It was tasty in the same way salted caramel is tasty.  I also tasted some of my friend's chocolate milkshake and I definitely think the milk shakes are worth a trip to this place ($3.79 - $5.50).  The only thing is, three out of the four people I went with ordered milk shakes, and the same three of us didn't feel so great after the meal. Coincidence??  After I was done my meal, my wallet was $22 lighter, but my hands were nicely moisturized from all the grease I wiped off them.  I don't think I'd ever go back because it was just a bit too expensive for food that was just okay (except the milkshake...but it might have given me a stomach ache...)  If we had In-N-Out or Shake Shack here, Holy Chuck would be laughable in comparison."}
{"text":"Asked the hubby, \"Is Holy Chuck one word or two?\"  My reply was \"It's two words, separated by a cow.\"   In keeping with the honesty spirit of Yelp, it is in my opinion that this place is much more than just one cow apart from that other holy burgers place.  So much potential with the threateningly gut-splitting menu, somehow lost amongst a rather soggy patty without enough \"wok hei\" (the flavor imparted by the 'thermal radiation', technically of a wok, but I'm using the term here to apply to the grill) to get that awesomely satisfying toothsome feel. Such feels, such summertime sadness.   Milkshakes are pretty amazing though, the sole reason of which has bumped up my review an additional star. An extensive number of creative options, the salty-sweet combos work well - like dipping fries into your ice-cream - ranging from the tamer, wild flower honey and peanut butter with sea salt to the more adventurous bacon, fudge & sea salt (or for foie gras & truffle oil milkshake for the adventurous and deeper-pocketed). Not cheap at about $5.99 for most of the milkshakes, but reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"My kids and I went to Holy Chuck and Holy Chuck, we loved it! The milkshakes were thick and fabulous. We had the bacon and a peanut butter and jelly shake. The poutine was large, cheesy (uses real cheese curd) and full of tasty gravy. The burgers were juicy and flavourful. Glad to see they are opening one at Yonge and Wellesley."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced. $50 for burgers for 2, fries, & drinks? That's like 12 beers and McDonald's.  Had The Raging Bull and the bun was soggy from all the ingredients and didn't quite seem big enough for the size of the burger. And ventilation here doesn't seem that good because there was lingering grill smoke in the air. I came out of there smelling like I'd put in a shift there and I was there for 20 min. Will give it 1 more shot (maybe). Otherwise there are way too many other burger joints in the city to bother going back."}
{"text":"I will rate this place based on at least 3 visits. First, the bad. I think they're priced a little high for a burger joint. I know the quality of meat is great, and I don't mind paying more for a better product. But it's just a little too high. 2nd, the poutine I ordered came out a little cold. Tasted great but temperature should've been warmer. Now for the good. Best burger in town by far. They freshly grind their meat on site, and you can tell from first bite. So much flavour in these burgers. I had the Jerky cow burger which is a double burger marinated in jerk seasonings and a seared pineapple on top. Good spice to it, great flavours. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place highly enough! The meat is moist and delicious, and they offer a gluten free bun so that I don't have to struggle to keep all of that deliciousness contained in a flimsy lettuce wrap. The Frustrated Cow is excellent, but I keep going back to their signature burger The Holy Chuck, because sometimes you can't improve upon perfection. If you still have room, consider washing it all down with one of their amazing milk shakes. The Nutella and peanut butter shake is like having someone pour a liquid Reese peanut butter cup down your throat.  It's also worth a visit during Poutine Week every February because they always create something truly special, like their \"Love The Bone\" poutine with Brie and roasted bone marrow. I have trouble finding the words for how delicious that was."}
{"text":"I went here with my 2 friends yesterday and they had something for everyone. Let me first start off by saying this it's a very short and convenient walk from the St. Clear subway station. Just exit the south side, go to the corner of Younge and you can see it from the stop light.  When we got there, we looked at the menu on the left hand side while the young lady working the till greeted us. We took out time reading all the amazing options they had to offer. In that time the girl didn't become annoyed with us standing there for a good 5-8 minutes just deciding on what to get. When we did finally decide she was very polite and used great customer service skills. I got the burger with the grilled cheese for buns. The burgers were cooked to perfection (for me medium rare) and all the flavours were perfect. I ordered the poutine which I ended up sharing with my 2 friends. My one friend got a regular cheese burger which was perfect size for her as she doesn't eat large portions at a time. But what impressed me most was how accommodating it was for my friend who doesn't eat buns with her hamburger. The girl offered to have it wrapped in a leaf of lettuce in exchange for the classic bun. To me, this was excellent and my friend thought so as well. Over all we are extremely happy with holy chuck and will definitely be going back!! Keep up the amazing work :)"}
{"text":"When you go to the actual restaurant, do they make it fresh? Because I went to Front Street Market, and after I ordered it the guy turned around and took out a burger already in a styrofoam container from what looked to me like a cooler that wasn't plugged in. Uhmm... really?   The burger, as many have said, was pretty pink in some spots. This is the second time I've had a burger here in FSM. The first time was also undercooked so this seems to be an issue with them. At least then, I watched them cook it pink in front of me.   Big negative points for giving me a burger cooked who knows when. Plenty of worker guys standing around talking when I walked up, and there was no line. Not worth the $12."}
{"text":"I stopped by today for a quick lunch to see what all the fuss was about. The restaurant was quite busy, even though they had just opened.  Surveying the menu, I found it a bit overwhelming as it takes up an entire wall! After some deliberation, I eventually decided on a cheeseburger and fries. Although I really wanted a milkshake, it would have made for a very expensive (and calorie-laden) lunch so I left well enough alone and got a water.   The burger and fries arrived within five minutes and both were hot and fresh. I loved the burger from the first bite and couldn't get enough. My only criticism is the amount of juices that come out of the patties as you're eating - I had to put a napkin underneath to avoid ruining my fries.  Speaking of the fries, they were also pretty good, although I wasn't a fan of the rosemary they sprinkle on top - it seemed like an unnecessary addition and made them too sweet.   Overall, a tasty and satisfying lunch, even if the $14 price tag is a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"This is a friendly joint with speedy, helpful staff with an eye out to make sure you're being served with care. I went with a group with varied tastes (one of my friends is a vegetarian; three of us don't eat pork at all.)  I ordered the Depressed Cow (for more on the cute names and descriptions, check out their menu: http://holychuckburgers.com/HolyChuck_menu.pdf) while my husband and his friend ordered the Greek Bahahastard. My vegetarian friend ordered the Animal Feed.  My burger was OK. Not bad, not great, and not particularly memorable (I had to go back to the website to try and remember what the hell I ate...). It wasn't the biggest burger I'd ever eaten, and it certainly wasn't the most flavourful. To be honest, I felt like the burgers were most comparable to other chain 'gourmet burger' spots like South Street or 5 Guys.  The lamb in the Greek Bahahastard was really undercooked in one of our orders, and we actually ended up asking if it could be thrown back on the grill. It didn't improve the taste much, but it was nice that the staff obliged quickly and without any attitude.  The Animal Feed was a giant portobello mushroom which was good for a few bites, but started tasting strangely mildew-ey halfway in. My friend left it aside and snacked on the fries instead.  Strangely, what I would return here for is the sweet stuff. I ordered a basic chocolate milkshake, and it was really good. We also shared an order of the Nutella lollipops: another good decision!   Holy Chuck should probably just switch to making desserts and leave the burger-flipping elsewhere.  A little add-on to this review: most of the burgers here came with bacon or some sort of pork as a topping/ingredient. I don't eat pork - so it's possible that the layer of bacon on a particular burger hits it out of the park, but I'm a bit skeptical."}
{"text":"I ordered fires, the simplest fries. Then I got over cooked fries. It was all brown and bitter taste. I asked the person to get me a new batch. The guy told me it was normal. But they get me a new batch anyway. This time it was undercooked. It tasted like raw potato. I guess it has to do with the machine. To avoid overcooking, they had to cut the time to fry. I threw it to garbage and will not come again."}
{"text":"Really great burgers!   We had the Holy Chuck, Farmers Threesome and Onion Rings. On the Holy Chuck: patties tasted fresh, juicy and uniquely \"beefy\" - the caramelized onions were also perfect in taste and amount. The real standout was the Farmers Threesome which has a lamb, beef and bacon patty. Very unique burger that was a true standout. Onion rings were good too but not as stand-out worthy as the 2 burgers.   The not-so-good: long wait (there were only 3 orders in the pipeline) and we waited about 20 minutes - worth the wait but not what one would expect from an order at the front burger joint. Limited seating: its quite cramped and there are maybe only 8 tables or so towards the front of the restaurant.  Overall, GREAT BURGERS: will return but will probably call in/ pick up next time to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"They have taken bacon to the next level. If you want to eat a burger that is equal parts cow and pig that is 100% awesome then this is your stop. Great menu, lots of selection. Awesome milk shakes."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for unique food joints. I was originally going to Burrito Boyz next door and this place caught my eye because it was so packed! Went inside and was not disappointed. Everything on their menu caters to the taste of so many different preferences and I love how artsy the burgers come out looking!! My boyfriend's burger came with carmelized mustard and it looked too good to eat."}
{"text":"So this is how it went down. I entered Holy Chuck on a rainy day, I stared at the menu for forty minutes with my little brother. We got two burgers each. Raging Bull, the Greek farmer, the farmers three some, and mooogatz. The raging bull was hands down the number one greatest burger I've ever tasted in my life! I only wish I could eat one errday 4eva!!!! I drove to Toronto from California and I wish they would open a holy chuck there. The Greek farmer was a delicious burger, and great for the lamb lovers. The moogatz was the other astounding creation that totally dropped my jaw and then closed it nd then dropped again....it was so ....the only word for it is fascinating. It was very interesting and the tastes came together in a way I totally wasn't prepared for. Wow you guys if you are thinking of coming here, stop thinking. This is heaven on earth. Also got the holy Chuck fries. when I ate those I literally said oh my god between every bite until the plate was finished. The best chilli fries I ever ate. I would move to Toronto just for the privilege of eating at Holy Chuck."}
{"text":"Oh my Glob. This is THE burger of Toronto. It's delicious and juicy and fresh, the fries are great, the staff are friendly and don't try to upsell you. They just recommend the House Favourite, the basic \"Holy Chuck\" burger, because it is just DE-Lish. We went today for the boyfriends birthday, and he got the Holy Chuck. I wanted to try something new and got the misunderstood breed. While it was good and interesting, I still recommend the Holy Chuck more. The bacon patty overpowered the freshness of the beef patty so it wasn't as enjoyable."}
{"text":"Only bad experiences.   99% of the time I order from here, it's from UberEats, and 100% of the time my order is at least a little wrong. It's usually that they forget the drinks. Maybe it's just this location, but it also happened the one time I actually went in to the location.   The food is alright. The burgers are small and the prices are steep. The feta fries are good. The onion rings are limp and soggy. Saddest onion rings ever.   Long story short, every time I eat here I regret it and promise never to eat here again. Then I forget because it's so convenient and who can mess up a burger and fries, right?   Wrong. I never write reviews. I'm just mad they forgot my drink AGAIN. Sorry."}
{"text":"The burger, fries, poutine, truffle fries, and milkeshake - everything I've tried here has been beyond good!  The burger itself was really juicy, though the bun is just pretty average.  Unlike most burger places, the order of burgers does not automatically come with fries.  Fries or poutine will have to be purchased separately, and if you have the stomach for it, order the truffle fries!  Truffles can do no wrong, and it's absolutely amazing here.  The order of fries is quite big, so I would share it between two people."}
{"text":"Holy chuckin' hell, this place is awesome.  1. The burger quality is beautiful. It's perfectly moist and juicy and chewy and delicious and more delicious. Admittedly, waaaaay too greasy for my liking but I collected a pool of grease, soaked it up with napkins and kept going as I ate. Whatever, burger was delicious.   It was constructed well, something i sometimes have a problem with. And the bun held up too! Although I would have preferred whole wheat, while fantasizing about their menu later, I noticed it could be done for a dollar extra.   2. Milkshakes. These combinations would probably put a diabetic to tears. And they're good too, though they are about $6, but if you're a real milkshake lover (which I'm not, but was pleased with anyhow) then this would be a good place to go. It's like 95% ice cream and 5% milk, and I remember reading about where the dairy came from and was pleased to know it was nearby. Good stuff.   3. So the gals in front of me were talking about how they probably came up with the menu (it's like a bunch of drunk college boys got together and were fantasizing about these burgers) hahaha, I dunno, i thought it was funny. Lots of variety and the burgers are very creatively named. A little overwhelming for the first time, but its not too bad! There has to be something on here for you!!   4. Price - I paid $20.88 after tax for a shake and a burger. A bit pricey seeming, but all in all is worth it when you factor in quality I think.   5. Atmosphere- simple, old school black and white checkered diner kinda look w/ metal tables and a wooden bar sorta thing by the window. Nothing notable.   I would come back. Many times. With people I'm trying to impress (with the greasy awesomeness that is this place.)   Definitely worth it, check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworkers and all of us left pretty happy. They have A LOT of selections for burgers and few options for fries/poutine!   I tried their signature Holy Chuck Burger. They suggest that you don't add any toppings to this one, so I went with the suggestion and got it just as it is. They ask you how you want your patties cooked (I asked for medium rare and it came out just as how I wanted!). I was really happy with my burger, but I felt like it was kinda small ( for a $10-11 burger I expected a little bit bigger one).  I also got their poutine to share with one of my coworker. In my opinion, I think their poutine was better than the burger. The cheese curds were small enough that it melted a bit by the gravy, instead having huge chunks. The portion was also good.   My coworker also got their vanilla milkshake, and he said that it was the \"best milkshake he's ever had\". I didn't try it myself, but it seemed like he really liked it."}
{"text":"let's not kid ourselves. This place doesn't have the best burger in Toronto and the same goes with the burgers priest. A lot of reviews have HC edging out TBP and I say kudos to those reviews simply because they were written by people who aren't fawning over TBP which I continue to find to be an average burger. As far as burger patty and bun goes, HC = TBP.  what I do appreciate about HC is that they have more burger variations, more food options, better dining space, an awesome soda machine, and finally, being not pretentious. No need for a secret menu that at one point last year, I witnessed a crew member not letting a customer know about the items in the secret menu and more than a year later me finding out that this menu is now on their website and now posted on the wall of the store."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Burger's Priest so when Holy Chuck opened down the street from my apartment, I HAD to try it. I got The Mad Cow burger and the Holy Chuck fries and I'm actually a little disappointed by both. The burger was just a regular burger and I would not order the fries again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to get the Foie Gras burger but decided against it since I've tried it before and it would run me $29.99 plus tax. Settled for a Jr. Cheeseburger with the works and the mister got the Cowlorie.   Despite getting the Jr. Cheeseburger for $5.99, it still looked like a full size burger. The beef patty had lots of meat flavours and all the toppings made the burger that much better. I think the burger would taste even better if the buns were warmed.  The Cowlorie consist of two beef patties between two grilled cheese. It was so awesome that I almost locked my jaw trying to bite into that thing. First few bites were good but gets heavy afterwards. The cheese in the two grilled cheese wasn't melted enough ):  Still a solid place for burgers. We spend $18 here and walked out with a full tum tum"}
{"text":"After doing plenty of walking the past few weeks trying to catch Pokemon and hatching their eggs, I decided we treat myself and the wife to some comfort food. Although trying to decide what to order while reading the very wordy menu was somewhat uncomfortable.  A lot of the offerings were outrageous and gimmicky-sounding. I immediately felt like I hadn't walked into a restaurant but rather into a CNE attraction to see what kind of messed up fatty concoction I could stuff myself with. Not a good start. Combined with the hefty prices, I'm not so sure I want to be brave and \"try something new\". Most burgers are double-pattied so if you love meat then this is your spot.  I settled on the Big Bag Wolf (burnt mustard) and my wife got the staple Holy Chuck burger. We rounded out the meal with their Panko encrusted onion rings and a strawberry cheesecake.  Impressions: - way too salty. Way way too salty. - burger meat was excellent quality and cooked perfectly. - needs the classic lettuce and tomatoes toppings for some extra juice / crunch. - onion rings did not look like they were Panko encrusted, just appeared to be regular onion rings.  - rings were dusted with this very salty dry mix. - milkshake was EXCELLENT but we had to share since it was a crap-ton of sugar.  The staff are cool and friendly. The establishment is very spacious with lots of parking. And with the TD bank nearby you can still order that extra side if you run out of cash!  I doubt we'll ever go back, though."}
{"text":"theirs burgers are good and here you can get the patty cooked he way you want!  how can people buy fast food burgers when you can get these amazing burgers for the same price?????"}
{"text":"Come here! I came here after being referred by a family member. The burgers are delicious and their prices are great. I paid $5.96 for a Jr. Cheeseburger and it was a decent size. My husband tried the holy chuck burger and was very pleased, that was absolutely huge . You have to dislocate your jaw like a snake to eat it. It was just pure goodness. The kids had the poutine and onion rings, they were happy with that order. I will be back ."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes to order and 38 minutes for order to be ready Greasy tasty burger but not worth the wait A total 1 hour from walking in to leaving This is not a fine dining place Management should be warned they will lose business with this attitude towards service Kris i disagree with your view of the burger but defend your right to have your opinion Many diners that night expressed the same sentiments as me."}
{"text":"Greasy burger at its best. It will give you a coronary but you will die happy. Fries were cut a little too thin for my taste. We ordered 2 Holy Chucks, 1 order of fries, 1 pop, 1 vanilla shake for $35. A bit steep for a lunch, but we came out happy."}
{"text":"Just finished off a Grind and Shine Burger and Creamy Feta Fries while the co worker polished off The Farmers Threesome and a Real Salted Butter Milk Milkshake. We shared the fries and the milkshake. All I can say is everything was delicious. The bottom bun ended up being pretty greasy and soggy, but the burger itself was nice and juicy, and flavourful. I really enjoyed the fries, I only wish you could get a smaller size. For me the milkshake was too salty, but it definitely tasted exactly as it sounded.   It was about 2:30 pm on a Thursday so I called ahead to order for pick up in case they were busy, and they had no problem accommodating my request to have it ready in 15 minutes. I like the fact that they ask you how you want your burger. Medium?  Yes of course. :) I must compliment them on their very creative and adventurous menu. Yes it's expensive our order cost $41.00, but so are all the good burger joints these days (The Works, Big Smoke, The Burger's Priest) and that is also why these places are a treat."}
{"text":"Obviously this restaurant isn't meant for vegetarians. I ordered \"the holy vegan\" and it was not very tasty. The overpowering flavour was some sort of acidic citrus taste that dominated the veggie burger. The texture and consistency of the burger also wasn't solid. It was literally falling apart.  The fries were good. The milkshake was amazing (vanilla).  It would be interesting to try an actual burger, but I would not recommend this place to vegetarians.  It was also a bit too expensive for the food that was served."}
{"text":"I came here with my family. We got the fries and holy chuck. The burger was juicy. They cooked it medium. The beef was nicely grounded and put together. It wasn't loose when I bit into it. The fries were delicious. I like the hot chili they put on the fries. The place wasn't pack when I came. It was fairly empty."}
{"text":"Sign read, \"Come in and try Toronto's BEST burger\".  So I went in.  Nice decore, huge selection, friendly staff.  But best burger?  Nahhhhh  ordered \"the village cow\" with fries and also tried the onion rings.  Where should one start?   Hmmmmm... Onion ring, I have had better from the frozen food aisle of Metro.  The fries were so small and schnibbled up, that after a while, they become a drudgery to eat.  And at these prices that is just wrong.  The crowning jewel, or what should have been, was a burger as bland as Wendy's and the only taste coming from the Greek cheese, onions and olives.  Personal I would give Holy Chuck a pass on by, but you decide for yourself."}
{"text":"After visiting their temporary location at Front Street Foods, I've finally visited the restaurant.  They have tons of burger and fries selections on the wall and it was difficult for me to choose one. The gourmet burgers are all over $9.99. I decided to order the Grind N' Shine and decided to go for the \"combo\" which I chose onion rings and a fountain pop.   Basically a combo consists of your choices which are 1. the burger, 2. a side and 3. a drink at regular price but you get around $0.85 off if you order the additional two (side and drink) which wasn't much of savings. My total came up to be around $20.    After ordering and choosing my drink, my order was ready. The burger was the main highlight of my meal but I was not used to having an egg in my burger. It was an ok size for me. The onion rings were a huge letdown. Nothing special about them at all.   Overall, having a combo that is around $20 is pretty expensive for me. It was worth a try coming here but I'm not too sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"Juicy, fresh, unique and a variety of toppings.  From what I read it seems the low reviews are due to price and service.  I myself had excellent service when I went in and the price may not be rock bottom but remember, they are on Yonge street in Toronto. Rent ain't cheap my friends!  Now that the grills at my place are being shut down for the winter season whenever I need a GOOD quality dose of grilled cow on a cold day, I will be stopping by here.  I mean, what's more comforting than a hot beef patty with a unique spin on it in the wintertime?   If you don't like a burger that's super juicy, made with great ingredients and is something new and unique then you should just hit up McDonalds. But for the discerning carnivores out there looking for something special I highly recommend growing a pair and trying this place regardless of the mediocre reviews."}
{"text":"Alright folks, calm down, calm down. I know you're all a little miffed that you had to drop a $20 spot to score yourself a meal at Holy Chuck, and heck, I didn't LOVE the idea that a burger and drink came out to $15.09 either, BUT... this is NOT you typical McDonalds/BK/Harveys where you can get burger fries and a pop for under $10. No, these are GOURMET made to order burgers made with high quality ingredients, and you pay for it accordingly.  If you're truly concerned with the price point, McDicks is just up the road, so quit hating and just be THRILLED (as you should be) that a quality burger place has made it's way into Woodbridge to show these other jokers how it's done.   Now, what I will say about Holy Chucks IS, that if you want something, and I mean anything... even if you think it's gross and you're embarrassed to ask. They've got it.  Seriously. They have everything!! Like how about an order of Foie Gras pancakes? Yep, they've got those. Ummmm a burger covered in bacon and nutella? Absolutely. How about freshly harvested unicorn meat, sliced and diced, dipped in bacon grease and served in a mans hat? OK, maybe not \"everything\" but if Unicorns were f'realz, they'd probably have a burger for it. FACT!  More varieties of fries and poutine than you could imagine, ranging from plain all to the way up to ones covered in foie gras, bacon, nutella, etc. What about pop or milkshakes? Hellz ya, their soft drink machine has literally over 100 flavours of Coca Cola product, and they make more unique milkshake combos then I've even heard of.  But all that pales in comparison to the 4 menu boards filled with burger options. I decided on the Big Chuck (I'll give you a guess which burger joint this puppy resembles) and it actually tasted better than the original. It's bigger, saucier, meatier and is so tall that it falls over if you move your tray too fast. My only critique was that it fell apart so I had to eat it super fast - no complaints otherwise.  They have 3 burger options that are priced @ $29.99, the first is simply a duck based burger (pfffttt.... simply, HA!) while the other two are challenges that test your might in both speed and ability to handle heat.  1) GO CHUCK YOURSELF BURGER & ANY SPECIALTY MILKSHAKE OF YOUR CHOICE\" in 6 minutes and they will put your picture on our Holy Chuck \"Wall of Fame\", give you an exclusive contest t-shirt, plus huge bragging rights! If you can beat the BEST TIME, they will PAY FOR YOUR MEAL! Current fastest time for completion is 5 minutes 19 seconds.  2) HOLY GHOST BURGER CHALLENGE This is for all you chili heads! To complete this challenge you must eat The Holy Ghost in it's entirety within 10 minutes and you must remain seated at your table for an additional 5 minutes before you can be declared a winner. You can only drink a beverage after you've been declared a winner! Nothing is allowed to be consumed during the challenge other than the burger! THIS CHALLENGE IS NO JOKE! There are ingredients in here that exceed 7 million scoville units and can seriously harm you! Winner will receive $100 cash, plus your food cost and an exclusive shirt!  Can't say that I'm gonna attempt either of these in the foreseeable future but I'll be back to Holy Chucks for their Gourmet burger options every so often, despite the nay-sayers who are having trouble adjusting to paying more for quality!  GO CHUCK YOURSELF HOLY CHUCK - you make some good burgers!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been, best service and best eats. There was probably one time that I can remember it wasn't good - service wise.  Back at least once a month."}
{"text":"I ordered the Holy Chuck burger as the menu suggests it is a signature burger. I also tried the Holy Chuck fries. Neither satisfied me though... I wouldn't expect a healthy food from burger chains, but their food was way too greasy. I liked their meat, which was very juicy and thick. But still they are overpriced and their sauce tasted a bit weird (some kind of burnt taste). Also, the caramelized onions in the burger was way too sweet, while the sauce on fried was way too sour."}
{"text":"Omg Holy Chuck is holy smokes! Their burgers are super delicious, how can one say no to Holy Chuck burgers!  Although the burgers are amazing, I've only had it once because it's relatively expensive, especially if you also get a combo. As my first visit, I went straight for their specialty burger - The Grind n' Shine for $11.49. It's a double cheeseburger with bacon, caramelized onions, topped with crispy homemade potato chips and a fried egg. Everything fully loaded.  The wait wasn't too bad on a weekday for lunch. And maybe it was the restaurant owner who also manned the cashier, but when my burger came out, he took a look and sent it back to the kitchen. I found out after that the guy didn't put enough potato chips on my burger and haven't seasoned it nicely. Now, that's great service and attentiveness.  Every bite of my Grind n' Shine was juicy. Whether it's the fried egg made right or the potato chips flavoured alongside a juicy done-well patty. I totally recommend this burger and Holy Chuck. Just keep in mind it's still a burger joint so your seating ain't going to be too comfortable (but who cares)."}
{"text":"I had the Big Bad Wolf (a burger fried in mustard) and my husband had the signature Holy Chuck.  Both burgers were juicy and delicious!  We also had the deep fried pickles - very good, although somewhat poor value at $5.00 for a single pickle (or four spears).  The vanilla milkshake was one of the best we've ever had.  I'd go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always find the burgers a tad salty but still delicious! They use ground chuck rather than ground beef so the meat quality is excellent. Price is a bit on the expensive side but they have a huge menu with something for everyone and I've personally enjoyed every thing I've ever tried on the menu."}
{"text":"Holy Chuck has now landed as my favourite burger thus far in the GTA. The first bite I took from my Big Chuck (their interpretation of Big Mac) my eyes got wide and I started smiling in utter satisfaction!The burger was perfectly cooked with a little pink inside. It was crispy on the outer surface, but the inside of the burger patty was so juicy and tender that it just melted inside my mouth! The bun was also perfectly toasted and held up to the juices from both the patties and the fix ins. This size of the burger was also just right. Not too big where all the stuff inside starts to slip out, and not too small where I feel like I'm being ripped off for a $10+ burger.   Honestly, burger alone I would have given it a 5 star eaaasilly. I am holding back that final star due to the large wait times. One may argue that this is due to the burgers being made to order. But honestly there are a lot of burger joints that make their burgers to order so that's a bit of a flimsy excuse. Luckily though, Holy Chuck's burgers were well worth the wait and I will for sure return the next chance I get! (If my arteries allow it...) And when I feel like a ballin' adult in the future, that foie gras pancake will be MINE!  TIP: After your burger, St. Clair subway station is pretty much just across the street for you to go home in your food coma. Press yellow emergency strip if heart attack ensues ;)"}
{"text":"Best burger place around. The burgers are to die for. Feta fries are amazing. The strawberry cheesecake milkshake is blessed. Done."}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing, very juicy, fresh, with amazing toppings! However the real star here is the poutine! Simple but absolutely done right. You have done our city proud!! Took my boyfriend here for lunch and he loved it"}
{"text":"Have heard a lot about this place and was super stoked to give it a shot.  The menu is huge and with the way the lineup occurs it's hard to see everything on your way up to the cash without seriously leaning back.   We had the big chuck burger and the one that came with an egg and onion frizzles. Mine tasted like a big mac with a slightly better quality of meat, the other had a very small amount of soggy onion frizzles.  Ambiance in the place was lacking, white everything, not very comfortable.  The Feta fries were great.  My issues with this place are as follows,  1) The kitchen guys seem a bit short with some customers and screwed up the 2 orders in front of mine, which had to be returned and figured out. It wasn't so much the screw up that looked bad but more the nonchalant manner in which the kitchen staff handled the complaints. It almost came off rude as if the customer had done something wrong with their order versus just correcting to problem immediately to make everyone happy.  2) It was WAY TOO expensive for what you get. We did 2 burgers, nothing added to them, split 1 feta fries and even split a medium drink... Total bill?  $35!!!!! I'm the furthest thing from a cheap ass but 2 burgers, 1 fry and 1 drink should not cost almost $40, that's for sure.  I was not impressed with most of the food, turned off by the price and will certainly not be returning."}
{"text":"Tried the famous Holy Chuck burger, it tastes really great! Just like they say, DO NOT add any toppings to it! The beef/beacon/onion totally grab your month! Moreover, I tried something really unusual, Nutella on fries with ice cream. Hard to describe it, but it is special and so awesome! If you like burger, try this one out!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Holy Chucks, I really did. Friends raved about them and Im not afraid to pay up $$ for well prepared, REAL foods and im somewhat of a burger aficionado.   1st time I was quite impressed with the taste of the Moogatz burger although it was very salty and much too small for my liking, I actually liked the Raging Bull poutine more. Overall I was shocked that I had just spent 22$ and it was only their mid $$ level burger and I opted to not get a 6$ milkshake.   2nd time I had (forgot the name) the burger with the (deep fried shiitake mushroom and goat cheese chunk) as well as beef patty on it cause I love mushrooms and goat cheese.  While waiting I watched a man order for him and his 3 children and it came out to 55$!! He didn't seem to mind the price. Well this way wayy too much mushroom, even for me. It was mushroom overload (2 inches or more thick!) and the cheese that was gushing out was soooo incredibly salty it just overpowered the whole sandwich. The beef flavor was non-existant and the Lemon-Mayo Aioli sauce they pair it with was gross and I couldn't think of any food I would want it on. Seriously I had to force the rest of it down cause I wasn't going to throw it out being a 15$ burger on its own.   3rd time I decided that maybe I don't like shiitake mushrooms or the sauce just wasn't for me and I truly wanted to like the place cause the owner (Jimmy) was at the cash previously and he was very cool/friendly and even chatted with me for 5 mins while they cooked my (shiitake mushroom burger) about the quality of his meat and \"other\" burger places serving crap all across the GTA. I even followed him on Instagram for the time in between visits. I respected that he cared about the quality of the ingredients that he served.  I figured I should just get their claim to fame, staple burger, the Holy Chuck (double cheese with bacon and sauteed onions) and a plain fries. First bite I realized the bun was a soggy-spongy mess and the sauteed onions were just a pile of mush, seriously I thought they had been pureed/mashed. Not to mention the characterisic overload of salt. I not a big pop drinker but everytime there, I found myself downing it and having to refill at least once.   Now obviously id rather eat here then Wendy's or Burger King but his prices are just too obscene. My last visit was 20$ and I wasn't even satisfied when I left. I discovered Burgers Priest down the street offers virtually the same thing (although less salty) for a bit less money.   So that was it. 3 strikes and I'll never go back. Old school places like Golden-Star or Harrys Drive In cost me 10-15$ maximum and I always leave very happy, feeling good and well fed without the pretentious (getting ripped off feeling) of these new school burger joints."}
{"text":"Must write review before coma sets in...  Ok belt removed, Fat pants on and a hunger of an angry bear! I thought I was ready for the feat that was presented before me...  Met some great local Yelp friends for a burgerfest at Holy Chuck and Holy F@#% What options they have here! I would try to list them all but you should just go to the website and look at the menu for yourself, or better yet go down to Hwy 7, HUNGRY!  I ordered The Grazer Burger: Panko crusted portobello mushroom stuffed with feta and cream cheese, deep fried and topped with lettuce, tomato and lemon herb aioli between two grilled cheese sandwiches! Wow that was a mouth full. The only thing missing was the meat but I wanted to try something totally not normal of any kind of burger I have tried in the past. It was pretty good but next time I'll go for the hearty cow! But I loved the grilled cheese! Yum!  I was going to get a shake but when I heard about what our group was going to share I had to fall back a little and get a water so I could have room for the rest. Next time tho! Banana Split or Bacon, Fudge and Sea Salt Shake, or the Strawberry cheesecake shake sounds amazing!  Our group shared a variety of the gourmet fries:  - Traditional Poutine with real Qubec cheese curds - Creamy Feta Fries - Holy Chuck Fries (Bacon, double cheese, smothered in chili) - Raging Bull Fries (Double bacon, Double Cheese and fresh sauteed hot banana        peppers with raging bull gravy) SPICY!  - Fresh Black Truffle Fries (Aged Village Cheese from Northern Greece, French Truffle Oil, and shaved fresh black truffles from Italy. Served with Truffle Oil Mayo) Gourmet!!  Now remember there was about 11 ppl sharing these, but we still barely made a dent!   I remember now sighing from the feeling of being full now starting to settle in. So I mentally opened my dessert stomach and prepared for round Sweetness!  Foie Gras Pancakes!! OMG!! The Best Thing I Have Ever Put In My Mouth EVER! AND WE WERE WARNED! Ready??  8 buttermilk pancakes stacked high, topped with Foie Gras, fresh Italian white truffles, pure maple syrup truffle oil and a wild blueberry compote... Yes it's 34.99 but what do you expect!! It's to die for!!! Oh and some real whipped cream on the side with truffle shavings.   Now you think that's enough, we also were able to indulge in the next tastebud bursting funnel cake, topped with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and warm nutella sauce!  By now the table around me became distant, the voices became muffled and I could just hear the beating of my heart start pounding away to work at digesting this glorious \"last supper\".   I think all in all, the experience from start to finish was amazing, just go! But make sure you have someone to roll you out to your car after you are done."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while and my experience has always been ok.  Everybody has claimed one time or another bad service or encounter with the socially disabled owner.    First food, unless you are glutton - most burgers are disgustingly big and extra items make them impossible to eat.  Solution?  They offer everything on the menu as a JR option.  I always get the jr cheese burger and fries.  The burgers are fresh and very tasty.  Fries are terrible, oily and not very good on the flavour part.  The coke free machine is calibrated by someone who does not understand how fountain pop works.   Now to terrible service.    When they got my order wrong, it was apparently my responsibility to prove to them that they made the mistake.  Ok sure they added 3 strips of pickle while i despise pickle so i bring it up, the cook was confused and the owner rudely said just take it off, so he grabs my burger and pulls the pickle off and give me the tray.   I am shocked as places like mcdonalds and five guys even have the decency to fix their error.  I walk over to my table and i realize lettuce is also missing, i walk back and say my lettuce is missing and he tries to hand me the lettuce i just stare at him so he lifts my bun and puts it on.  For an establishment where toppings make or break your personal burger they sure don't understand the concept of \"getting it right\" or \"customer service\".  No attempt or apology was given except the irritation of me letting them know they failed at their primary job.   So there is the service for you 0/10.  Burger 7/10 fries 3/10 and coke free 2/10.    tl;dr?  Terrible service.  Burgers are decent.  If you are into thin oily fries then they have that.  Don't expect to be treated like a customer who is valued."}
{"text":"It is rather overpriced...and my review is only for the veggie burger and the feta fries. Both amazing, but the veggie burg itself was almost $15. Friendly service though!"}
{"text":"Grossly over- hyped. Don't waste your money, just get s burger from hero burger across the street. I had better burgers from the food truck in the streets. Unflattering buns, over salted pattys and mediocre at best on a good day.   They keep getting our order wrong and refused to add the toppings we want."}
{"text":"Eating dinner on the go. Decided to try this local burger joint that my friends declared was the greasiest burger on the planet.   The good: the burger is greasy but great. I had the holy church signature burger with onions. It is super greasy but has amazing mouth feel. Decided to pare with grandmas apple pie milkshake which is delicious!   The bad : the burger and the shake were $17! I'll be back next year...."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. I finally found myself in the neighborhood of Holy Chuck for another reason, haven't made a special trip just because the parking situation around Yonge and st. Clair is so atrocious, but since I was in the neighborhood it was the perfect opportunity to pop in.  I ordered \"the Depressed Cow\", which was also listed as Oklahoma Style, since I love onions and whenever I go to Burger's Priest I always get my burger \"jarge style\" with the grilled onions and mustard.  And it was just so so. While there are certainly a lot of onions, they aren't well grilled and so they are just sort of bland and there.  The fries were pretty average, and over-salted, which is a pet peeve of mine, and the burger was really kind of boring and unremarkable.   Perhaps it was a bad night, and perhaps I ordered the wrong thing but I certainly rate Burger's Priest, Zeal Burger and even Fresh Burger much higher and I am STILL absolutely heartbroken over the demise of Sinner's Burger, which I feel beat them all!  Hopefully Sinner's Burger makes a comeback in a better location, because it was too good to go!  So in the end I give Holy Chuck two stars.  Some of you might say \"Hey wait a second you gave Golden Star 4 stars, how can Holy Chuck be so low, and honestly, personally I'll take Golden Star over Holy Chuck any day, AND for a much more reasonable price.   If you are going to charge a premium price for a premium product, then you better bring it!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not blown away... perhaps based on other reviews my expectations were too high.  I had the holy chuck burger.  It was cooked medium which was nice although one of the patties was more medium rare but not the end of the world.  Could have used a little more seasoning in my opinion but over all as I said... not bad.  Fries were the same, good but not great.  It's worth trying but I doubt I'd make the trip back.  Form me personally I'd prefer Burger Priest or Five Guys."}
{"text":"This is my first time returning after trying a burger at the St. Clair location a few years ago. Unfortunately St. Clair is just too far away for me to visit with any frequency. Today I realized UberEats will deliver from Wellsley to my workplace! I ordered in for lunch and man was it ever delicious. I ordered the Big Bad Wolf with a side of onion rings. The burger itself was just the right size, and actually a lot bigger than I expected. I loved the mountain of fried mustard! it really didn't need any other toppings other than exactly whats on it, although I did add a few of my onion rings for good measure. Best Burger I've had in a long time, 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved it when it opened but the past couple of visits the quality has gone downhill we wont return."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this burgers for long, and finally did it! There's a huge variety of options and quantity of patties to choose from. Patties are very juicy, and although I ordered mine to be medium-well, it was very red, but I ate it anyways. The burgers are tasty, but too juicy, and this, added to the juice and grease from the cheese and bacon, can make it a pretty messy meal. It is good though,  and fries are good too. I'd take this burguers over the Priest allways!!!"}
{"text":"It's a good burger but it's nothing original.  Good milkshakes tho which Burger's priest is soon to offer at their new and bigger location at Yonge and Lawrence."}
{"text":"Would I come back? Probably not.  We ordered: -- Holy Chuck burger (double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions) -- Farmers Threesome (one lamb, one beef, one bacon patty, triple cheese, more bacon, and caramelized onions) -- Big Chuck fries -- Onion rings -- You Bacon Me Crazy chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich   I loved the onion rings (which aren't made in-house), but don't feel like we got enough for $5. The Big Chuck fries became repulsive really quickly. They're pretty much a deconstructed McDonald's Big Mac. It was too much Big Mac sauce; that's all you taste.  The Farmers Threesome was decent, but I had to eat it with a fork and knife; it's simply too big to attempt otherwise. My least favourite - but my friend's favourite - was the all bacon (aka pork) patty, which I found too salty. I mean, it was a burger. I feel like Holy Chuck's whole deal, especially with their six-patty \"Go Chuck Yourself\" challenge, is to woo you with excess. Three patties with different meats doesn't make it a better all-round burger experience. It was okay at best.  -------- DO NOT ORDER THE ICE CREAM SANDWICH --------  The worst offender of the night was the ice cream sandwich. In theory, sweet and savoury would work together, but this was really bad. It was so store-bought, down to the processed grocery store bacon bits that tasted gross to the rock hard, refrigerated chocolate chip cookie. We actually had to wipe it off the bacon bits to enjoy the ice cream sandwich.  I'm still giving the place 3/5 stars because I don't think it claims to be anything it's not. I feel like the quality isn't exactly there, nor does there seem to be thoughtfulness in the conception of their burgers, but it's a standard garbage greasy burger joint for the days you're longing for a heart attack."}
{"text":"Ordered the holy chuck burger and feta fries .... The cartelized onions look old and tasted nasty, the beef patty and bacon was overall way to salty and the feta fries just tasted like fries with salty cheese. The food has way to much sodium i felt sick after eating..."}
{"text":"Not personally a burgers fan, so take it for what it's worth. For this review I'm going to comment on their vegan burger. The place is okay, very typical fast food joint. Order your food, sit down, they call your name, get your food, eat your food, throw out your own stuff.   I kind of don't like burgers, especially ground beef burgers. So, I thought that I would try their vegan burger, \"the holy vegan\". I think it has quinoa and corn and some other veggies and supposedly made with olive oil. Honestly, from what I see, the burgers are quite small, when you account for the price. My burger was fine, it did have a lot of corn in it, like A LOT! And was drenched in olive oil, really oily, almost soaked through the bun. Overall, I thought the taste was decent, well, for a vegetarian (corn) burger. However, I don't think I will try again, considering the price, doesn't even come with fries."}
{"text":"This place is a good burger joint but it's just too greasy for me. My bun became a soggy mess. I did enjoy it but I've had better."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the GTA. Fresh beef patty cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning. Awesome bun to patty ratio which seems to b difficult to find as most patties seemed dwarfed in a gigantic bun.  The fries were fresh home cut and also perfectly cooked. Not at all greasy and a very generous portion.  I will make the trip into the city and pay for parking any time to get another of these fantastic burgers"}
{"text":"Hey all,  The burger selection is great!  I love the grind and shine.  The egg makes the burger truly spectacular.  I give the fires the low mark here.  I gave them a shot a few times but they just leave me disappointed.  I tend to not order them.  Sorry if you like them.  The milkshakes are the best ones I have ever tasted.  The grandmas apple pie one is not to be missed.  Drew"}
{"text":"This place is a little bit expensive, but their fries and burgers are delicious, specifically their feta fries and cheeseburgers. Their funnel cake is okay, but I would suggest asking for the nutella on the side for it gets too chocolatey for my taste. Overall I find this place to be pretty good!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their burgers!!!  We usually get their original burger which is the Holy Chuck or some funny name like that.  It has 2 patties, bacon, cheese, carmelized onions.   Chocolate sea salt and bacon milkshake is a rich and delicious savoury and sweet dessert I would say. Not even a drink as it's so rich!   Any of their poutine taste great as well.  Overall their service is speedy, knowledgable and efficient. We received our food quite fast and with no mistakes.   They are a little pricier than most burger joints but you can feel good about spending on this place because of the quality and great taste in every bite.   I reccomend this for anyone who is really hungry !"}
{"text":"Although you can see that the beef is freshly grounded in front of you, the texture of the entire burger put together wasn't as good as expected.The buns need to be toasted, it needs some kind of crunch to it. Don't get me wrong though, it taste good but I've had better.   I got the holy chuck burger and for a signature burger, it needs to be MORE exciting!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The meat is so fresh, the bun is so soft, you essentially don't need teeth to eat these burgers!  I ordered their most popular burger, tasted like an upscale version of a Big Mac, with all the fixin's... A little pricey, but worth it.  The reason it's a 4 as opposed to a 5 is because I wasn't a fan of their fries.. too thin and cold.  I prefer hot, thick-cut fries.  All-in-all, great service, spacious dining area, and tasty food."}
{"text":"We are on the hunt for the BEST BURGER in Toronto! Stop #1: Holy Chuck  Holy Chuck is a small, but lively burger spot. The casual as F decor is close to my heart, highlighted by the stack of buns that they've stored next to the door. (No sarcasm, I actually appreciate the the look.) It's not overly large though, so think twice about bringing more than a handful of friends.  On to the food! By popular suggestion I opted for the Mad Cow. To say the least, this sandwich was special. It's a combo of their Animal Feed burger and a Jr. cheeseburger. (Animal Feed: panko crusted portobello mushroom stuffed with feta & cream cheese, deep fried then topped with lettuce, tomato & lemon herb aioli) When you first bite into this sizeable mouthful you'll get hit with such a variety of flavours that you'll have to step back and do a double take. On subsequent bites you'll find that the aioli and oh so creamy cream cheese take a warm hold of the show. Eventually you'll discover the panko crusted portobello mushroom, at which point you realize how the Animal Feed burger holds up without the Jr. cheeseburger. And oh ya, there's a cheeseburger in there.  I also snagged the Fudge, Sea Salt & Fresh Red Chili Shake. You're likely thinking \"sea salt and red chili!?\". Trust me; reserve your judgement until you try it. The standard fudge shake flavour is great, but then after 10 seconds of wondering where the red chili comes in, it hits you with authority. To be honest I was a little offended, but not necessarily in a bad way. Think laid back sensual times with a significant other, then out of no where they slap you across the face. You're annoyed, maybe a little angry for a second, then... you're sort of into it. Not an everyday thing, but a sometimes thing.  Summary: Holy Chuck is dynamite! Why not a 5 star? It didn't meet the \"mind blown\" criteria. If there was a 4.5, it would have it. Go to Chuck!!!"}
{"text":"Man oh man, the Nutella and salted caramel milkshake! Even if you're not a fan of the burgers here, you cannot deny the awesomeness of the above shake.   Had the \"Holy Chuck\" Burger which was great, although super greasy, then again it's a burger so it should be. Appreciate the use of freshly ground meat, judging by the bits I saw being ground, it's no wonder there was so much grease. Nonetheless, awesome Burger and probably one of the best in the city. Fries were spot on. Definitely better than most,  DO order the truffle mayo though, you've already gone this far it wont' hurt!   Despite eating all of the above, I did not end up in a food coma, so that's saying something."}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had. Juicy, great meat flavor, nice crust to burger, just great."}

{"text":"Holy Chuck is somewhere we don't go often.... But when we do, we prepare to wait in a pretty long line, and we plan to enjoy the F*** out of our meals because how could you not?! The menu is wild and everything is worth trying if you are a daredevil. The bacon fudge seasalt milkshake is beyond anything I have ever tasted before. It's a meal in itself, the richest, most sweet+salty mouthgasm you MUST try that or one of their shakes. The line up was long this past time as usual but we brought our patience and it's cool to watch everything going on in the kitchen and watch them make your burger. I got the cowlerie which is a double bacon cheeseburger with grilled cheese buns , I get it every time actually... It's just SO DAMN delicious !!!!! Check this place out, it rocks."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey, and the burgers are smaller than they look on the Facebook page so don't let that annoy you right away. A couple of bites into your burger with some fries and you'll be full. I ordered the raging bull (two patties, bacon, jalape√±os-well done) with fries and I was so full I had to wait there for a while before i could get up lol. The fries are really good, but I wish they weren't as crunchy and a little more on the softer side! Nonetheless i really liked it with chipotle mayo. The only thing I didn't like about my burger was EVERYTHING was well done...like parts of my bun, the jalape√±os...all of it. I was just expecting the patties to be well done so that kind of took out some of the greatness. Unless you like everything to be overly cooked, don't get well done and go for medium well done. That was my mistake and just to save someone else from doing the same!  Service: the service here is really good. They have a well run system. You place your order with the cashier and take your seat. They will either call your name or if they're not too busy, bring it to your table. The cashier I encountered named Michelle was the biggest sweetheart. It was mine and my brother's first time going and we did the whole \"stare at the menu for ten years bit\" and she honestly was so patient! Plus she recommended some things on the menu that I personally thought would be gross (Nutella fries) so because of her recommendation when I come back I will give it a try. All the staff there is hard working and does their part which is hard to find these days, and it doesn't go unnoticed by me whatsoever!   **if you're a big cheesecake fan like myself try the strawberry cheesecake shake....it's so fu*king good******"}
{"text":"Yummmm. I love the burgers at Holy Chuck. They have a huge menu of burgers to choose from, but I usually stick with the Big Chuck and have never regretted it. It's all about the patties, and their patties are always fresh and juicy. I usually come here with my husband, and we usually each order a burger, a poutine and one milkshake to share. There's a good selection of unique poutines. I have tried the Big Chuck fries and Holy Chuck fries, and both are yummy. However, I find that when we each have a burger and poutine, it's a bit too much. So now we just get a fries and a side of sauce (e.g. chipotle mayo, lemon herb aioli). We find portion wise, this is much better. In terms of the milkshake, my favourite is the strawberry cheesecake."}
{"text":"Holy chuck, indeed!! I saw this place open up a few months ago but never found the chance to check it out so with the ToFoodPassport, it was the perfect excuse for me to indulge in a good ol' burger.  I was seriously impressed by this place. The music was on point, the staff was nice, and THE BURGER. Man oh man, the burger was delicious. Although a little on the saltier and greasier end, the burger was mouthwatering and extremely appetizing right from the presentation to the first bite to the devastating last bite of \"wait, there's no more??\". I had \"The Misunderstood Breed\" which was one beef patty layered with cheese, one bacon patty, and another layer of cheese. I also added complementary toppings of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and ketchup so all in all, my burger came out to be a beautiful masterpiece of fresh vegetable colours sitting atop a seriously juicy and succulent looking grilled meat and bacon patty with melted cheese oozing out. Acclaimed by their wallpaper, Holy Chuck only uses fresh home-ground meat that's \"never seen the inside of a freezer\" and I truly believed it after taking my first bite. The taste and texture of the meat patty was just so different from what you would normally get from a fast food chain; it was juicier and softer and significantly more satisfying. I also knew it was a real claim because they asked me when ordering how I'd like my patty done (rare, medium, well done, etc.), which wouldn't be possible if the patties were frozen!  The bun also deserves a shout out because it was soft and lightly glazed with butter? oil? who knows, but it was tender to touch and was basically the perfect hug to encompass all of my fillings and toppings.   Yep, I had a great experience here. Very likely to come back in the future.   P.S. for my fellow ToFoodPassport users: I was also really content with how they only charge $5 here as opposed to other participating franchises I've been to that charge tax ontop of the $5."}
{"text":"I was here last week and had the Mad Cow burger which is a vegetarian burger but with an added beef patty. It was good but I came away with horrible food poisoning for 2 days. My friend had the same order but was not sick. It may have been the undercooked beef patty, or the cheese, or the crazy amount of grease on the patty. I can never recommend this place after that experience. Horrible!"}
{"text":"this cafe has a super random selection of milkshakesI remembered just few nutella with salted caramel chocolate fudge with sea salt and chilly pepper all made with 95% of ice cream=) yum! very delicious and comes up to $6 or so. they also have veggie burger that looks yummy from the picture and free wifi that didn't work for me."}
{"text":"Coming from California with In-n-Out literally 5 minutes walking distance, I was skeptical of this place because my friend hyped it up. He was like, you gotta try this place, it's amazing, the best burger I had in my life. When I looked up the menu online, I am started to question whether this place is worth the money. Prior to going here, I was researching their menu because I didn't want to stand there forever and choosing what to eat.   After much effort of making the trek from U of T after class, I was starving and ready to devour my burger, the Grind'n'shine. I split a hand-cut Yukon fries and a Grandma's Apple Pie with a friend. The Grandma's Apple Pie was amazing, it tasted like an apple pie and ice cream TOGETHER. The fries were not great at all. If you think this is good, you need to try In-n-Out well-done fries, they are like heaven on earth.   The Grind 'n' Shine is pretty much a double cheeseburger with bacon, grilled onions, potato chips, and a fried egg. They got me at the fried egg. I was expecting a lot more from that egg. It became a disappointment. I couldn't really taste the grilled onions, egg and potato chips. It didn't live up to the expectations I had for it.   For $20 for half a shake, half fries and a burger, it was not worth it. I probably won't come back here just because the food isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Might be best burger in Toronto. Love the service and get up. Burgers are unreal. Not a milkshake man myself but they are off the chain here."}
{"text":"Went at lunch time, was not as busy as I expect it would be - maybe I went earlier than the main rush? Regardless, had their signature burger. Ordered my meat at medium with a regular bun and it was amazing, to say the least. The prices are a bit high for my liking so I can't see myself being a regular, but if I have to show a friend a good burger place, I'd definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Nothing beats fresh ground chuck. Fries and gravy are second to none."}
{"text":"The best burger in Toronto.  I get the double cheeseburger, strawberry milkshake and onion rings.  Deadly, but glorious.  Exercise 5-6 days a week and you can enjoy this guilt free.  Glad to see the business thriving and growing."}
{"text":"it was ok at best  I heard some guy at the table beside me say that his burger was great All i could think was some people have low standards. I travel for a living and eat out a lot, I'm on the road 22 weeks a year and see more than most and this place is just OK and the fries are just too greasy and yet dry. I wont be back.  My standards are higher than this place can deliver"}
{"text":"My god, I don't even know where to begin with this place.   I've been here about 5 times and each time my experience got worse and worse. One time I came with my family of 4 and 3 out of 4 of our meals were burnt. I can't believe they had the audacity to serve that to us as \"food\". Not to mention it was the $30+ Holy duck. Can you believe that? Another time I went I almost got into a screaming match with the manager over taking home my sandwich. I had already paid and he steps out to tell me it's not possible.  I get it, the fois gras probably won't be as good but I was buying it for my parents and I wanted them to try some. Point is, I understood the consequences AND I had already paid. Yet this guy still insisted on not letting me take it home.  The third incident happened just yesterday. I went there for my birthday and the restaurant was completely empty. My girlfriend and I are standing at the front counter for a good 5 minutes and we could see there were at least 4 staff members in there. Some of them even glanced at us, yet nobody came to take our order. Even a small gesture or a \"could you please give us a moment\" would have sufficed. But they stood around jerkin' each other off or something.  Needless to say, this put the final nail in the coffin and I am absolutely done with this location. Lord knows how they get by with service this pathetic. Just thinking about it makes me angry.  Anyways,  to anyone coming here I wish you luck with the service... or whatever you would call that.  For the record, I LOVE Holy Chucks, I just can't stand this location."}
{"text":"Menu board is displayed above the cash. Didn't have time to go over everything and felt rushed by the cashier. She keep talking to me while I was trying to figure out what I wanted. There was too many specialty burgers with too many descriptions. A little annoyed, I ordered what was familiar to me.  For a burger joint they have such small burgers. Ground beef texture with no binding or hold which breaks apart and gets the bun soggy. It's sort of a mix of In 'n Out and Burgers Priest. I ordered the signature Holy Chucks burger. She asked if I wanted it medium to medium well, like it is suppose to be cooked only at those choices. I find that ground beef should be cooked well done but decided she must know better and chose medium well. It was a soggy mess with no texture. Not too impressed with all the juices from the ground beef running down my arm and the puddle of red juice on the tray.  Portion size for the specialty fries are definitely for sharing. The fries are not the greatest but acceptable. I got the poutine and they were too salty and do not know why they sprinkled parsley all over. It did not elevate the poutine in any way. It was way too much for one and wished that the cashier let me know that it was a big portion. And I hate circle metal trays where the bottoms tends to warp and spins around while trying to eat.  Got a peanut butter jelly shake, which was the best thing out of my entire meal. Only complaint is, where's the jelly? Is the sweet taste suppose be the jelly part? It was all peanut butter.  Price for the meal was way over priced ($25) but made up for the portion size of the fries. All in all, didn't meet up to the hype. Probably will never go to another Holy Chucks."}
{"text":"Messy and big and with a wide assortment of options.  I was kind of overwhelmed. Price was really high but worth the experience"}
{"text":"i went to Holy Chuck while visiting Toronto and the menu alone is enough incentive for anyone to stop in.  The store is a little on the small side, but luckily it wasn't very crowded and a lot of people took their food to go.  On a busy day though I can imagine this place would be cramped.  I got a Holy Chuck burger and split a foie gras poutine with my friend.  I also got a little daring with a bacon milkshake. I wouldn't order it again (the milkshake, too many crunchy bacon bits) but overall the portions are huge- I didn't even get to finish my fries. It's a nice place to go for a solid burger and fries and that's the most important thing."}
{"text":"This and the Priest are my favourite burger joints in the city. Fresh and delicious. The service is quick and friendly. I'm absolutely devastated they got rid of the sweet potato fries/chips--they were my favourite!"}
{"text":"Still my favourite burger joint after all these years. I think it's better than Burgers Priest, Hero, South St., etc. Meat patty is very soft and juicy and melts in your mouth bursting in flavour. I usually get the Holy Chuck's original or signature burger (can't remember the exact name) plus truffle fries or poutine and a shake (love their shakes).   Next time, imma do the Holy Chuck Challenge!"}
{"text":"Holy Chucks is melt in your mouth goodness! Yes it is expensive. Yes the burgers are gourmet. Yes the fries and poutine are awesome.  And....finally... Yes to Leaving your diet at home!  This location has a drive thru and plenty of seating inside. If you are brave enough to do the Holy Chucks challenge, make sure you brag about it to all of your friends and wear your super stretchy pants!  I ordered a burger called \"The Farmers Threesome\" which included a Bacon, Beef, and Lamb patties all wrapped between a scrumptious bun.  The burger was cooked to perfection and I definitely got my protein intake for the day/week!    If you are looking for an epic cheat meal.....come to Holy Chucks!"}
{"text":"The most creative/insane/inspiring/deadly menu I have ever seen.   You simply have to experience it. If you like burger/fries/shakes you MUST go to a Holy Chuck. They excel in all these categories, and in my opinion have the best in the city."}
{"text":"Holy chuck without a doubt provides the most comprehensive burger experience in Toronto.   One look at the menu and you know it was put together by a burger madman/genius. Every possible burger creation is on the menu, and even ones you wouldn't even think were possible.   THEY HAVE BURGERS INSIDE OTHER SANDWICHES!   like \"the hawg\" that is a double cheese burger between 2 BLT sandwiches! or the \"go chuck yourself\" which is 6 CHEESE BURGERS BETWEEN 3 GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES!!!  The rest of the menu reads like the mind of an insane person. It's comically eccentric.  You really have to see it for yourself. To help put things in perspective you can get anything they serve with foie gras. EVEN THE FOIE GRAS AND TRUFFLE OIL MILKSHAKE!  Which brings me to my next point. Milkshakes have always been the quintessential brethren to the burger since the time of jesus, yet how can so many burger joints overlook this culturally essential part of the burger experience. And this is where Holy chuck excels against other burger joints because not only are they creative(they have shakes you wont find anywhere else), but they are a good value(unlike burger priest's tiny shakes).     I could write forever about this place but to save you time I'll get to the point. The style of burger is a perfect hybrid that captures the the size of the five guys burger, and the buttery softness of the burger priest. And because of the richness of the menu items, it really isn't a place you could safely eat everyday(unlike five guys, which i think is more so). For this reason I still prefer five guys slightly, even though it breaks my heart they don't have shakes.   There is much to say about a menu that literally inspires me. There is so much passion that comes across to the reader of the menu, that it's impossible not to be inspired yourself. The absolute absurdity of half of the menu items inspires a sense of wonder and awe that a child might experience watching a magic trick on tv for the first time. This restaurant challenges you physically, in that some of their burgers may not be physically possible to eat, and intellectually challenges you, in that they push burger technology to it's absolute limits. And this is what 99% of restaurants don't instill.... A SENSE OF ADVENTURE."}
{"text":"Second time to try holy chucks and definitely a better experience. I got the holy chuck burger and it was good, paired with their truffle fries!!!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place has got to sell one of the best burgers in the GTA area. If you are the type of person who loves your burgers greasy and juicy, I highly recommend this place. Their burger patties were very flavourful and it's almost as if it melts in your mouth. I felt that the fries were pretty standard though, not too salty but not over fried or soggy.   The interior of this place is like a fast food restaurant. The kitchen is pretty open to the public and the cooks are very friendly. The ordering process is typical: the cashier takes your order, you sit and wait until the chef calls for your name.   My minor concern is towards the pricing of the food they offer. I understand that they are making quality burgers, but the prices can be overwhelming for some if they sought for a meal that will completely fill the stomach.   Overall, I highly recommend this burger place to those who are seeking to eat a quality burger."}
{"text":"I can name 5 burger places 100 meters away  that is better then holy Chuck. Overpriced and Underwhelming is definitely how to describe this establishment. It's just very over hyped.   FOOD: It was not worth a fraction of the price, for 30 dollars we got.   -A burger too salty for anyones liking (if you have bacon which is already salty why add more salt on the next patty) -milkshake with pieces of raw banana floating around which also tasted very sweet and off -small portions and a bun much like McDonald's.  -NO customization on your burger  Service: pretty much like a good court, but if I paid that much meh.    I won't be coming back. i think it's just hyped up for no reason. I'll be going to 5 Guys next time."}
{"text":"Holy Chucks has developed to be a gold standard when it comes to burgers for me. Crumbly, melt in your mouth beef patties layered on the bun (with all the hot beef nectar dripping down the layers. The patties are so loosely packed that the cheese embeds itself into the caramelized crevices and becomes a whole other kind of cheese burger. If you ever have a big enough appetite going in, I encourage you to attempt the Holy Chuck Challenge (In the photo) and be sure to wash it down with one of their innovated shakes."}
{"text":"Most tasty non wood grilled burger I ever tried. Will recommend to a friend. Will come back again. Pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"$25 (30 with delivery) for a double cheeseburger blt and stale fries. Meat tastes good but the buns were soggy and I'm fairly certain they're using Kraft single processed cheese. Would not return."}
{"text":"This reflects my most recent visit. I'm a regular here for a few years and I never reviewed it,  I went with my signature order, cowalire and milkshake(usually nutella) this time it was nutulla, peanut butter.   For a burger place that has become my go to reliable place it finally disappointed me, the cheese wasnt melted, it had onions. Maybe its a new cook or an off day, if it wasn't for my past experience this place might have gotten an 2.star, the extra star is due to my love of the place  On bright side the milk shake didn't disappoint so maybe that a sign I shouldn't dismiss this place just yet  Even If quality of burgers fall and can come back for the shakes  Edit July 19 2016 Burger seem lacking, not cook enough and too salted, the cheese wasn't even melt on my cowlarie , probably the first time I really wasn't satisfied thou the time when the original review was posted wasn't good either. Rethinking holy chuck as my favourite. Drop in rating form 4 to 3"}
{"text":"I will  start off by saying that I have been to St Clair location and hadnt gone in while due to salty burgers even after saying something so I usually only went for the milkshakes.  At first i wasnt so sure to visit this location given I kind of decide to stop going to holy chuck but I went anyways. I figure see if this location is that bad.  From the pervious review I though it would be but it was good.  My order was my usual cowlarie and nutella milkshake,  the milkshake was great as usual, thick, creamy and very tasty. Moving on the cowlarie,   the first thing i noticed is that the cheese for the grill cheese bun was melt, the meat was good well and didnt taste like I was eating an handful of salt. The onion werent to my taste but they were fine  Overall all pretty solid meal, this visit redeam holy chuck from a few meh expereinces before"}
{"text":"My review is for the vegetarians out there in search of the best veggie burger. When here I got the grazer, two portobellos stuffed with cream cheese & feta, deep fried between two grilled cheese sandwiches. I know, what's health right?   But it's one of those things i just had to try, now I'm a huge fan of burgers priest and their are differences between their veggie burgers.   In trying the burger I had to say I was mildly disappointed, by the sounds a cheesy, fatty deliciousness of this burger the flavours just wernt all there. Although probably still worth all the calories, its worth a try, the flavours of the cream cheese and feta go well together although when I first heard it was the two cheeses I was skeptically, the thing I didn't like was the lemon aioli on top. But hey maybe it's my taste, worth a try for sure, but my hat goes off to burgers priest!"}
{"text":"A year later, we came back.  The Go Chuck Yourself challenge was out of question this time; we wanted to properly enjoy a burger, instead of throwing ourselves into a fat-dripping pile of meat and cheese.  We ordered the Holy Duck, The Holy Chuck, The Village Bahahastard \"Saganaki Style\" and Fresh Italian While Truffle Fries.   The burger patties were deliciously tender and flavorful, but this time I sorely realized that Holy Chuck is *quite* expensive: for the same price, the burgers are smaller than that of other joints. They make it up with the quality of their meat, I guess. The truffle fries were also quite good, with most of the aroma coming from the truffle oil/mayo mix.   Note 1: They have a super fancy soft drink dispenser. There's tons of choices and everything is controlled via a touch screen. The downside is that it can only serve one person at a time, and people tend to take longer given the number of options.  Note 2: We didn't see our photos on the Wall of Shame! Maybe they were lost?"}
{"text":"The most creative and tasty burgers I've seen and tried!!! #bestburgers The staff we amazing, very helpful in choosing a burger as there are so many I wanted to try!! Love that their meat is grinder on site!! Pleasant visit definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Walked in Saturday night 8 pm.  Was pretty busy almost every table full.  Ordered a Holy Chuck, Jr burger and onion rings to go.  They said would be about 10 mins, my name was called less then 5 mins.   It took about 30 mins to get home and couldn't wait to dig in.  Burger was great, cooked a bit more then medium although I ordered medium, bun was way soggy possibly because of the drive home.   I will definitely give it another try and eat in next time.   Onion rings were pretty good, a bit small and not huge as I expected though."}
{"text":"Great burger quality. Meat was nice and juicy. Price was fair I think. Just thought it was a tad too salty for my liking. Pretty busy for a Sunday night at 7pm."}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night - people mostly came in for take-out, so there were plenty of seats.   I got the Holy Chuck burger with a side order of fries. The fries were great, and came in a huge portion size. That said, I wasn't personally a big fan of the burger (two beef patties, cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions) - the taste was decent, but it was just a bit too greasy for me... the bottom bun ended up soaked in the grease."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers.  Not the best I've had but they get creative.  Shakes are unique as well."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about burgers but they are so delicious! I give people this face (o.0) when they say they dislike burgers. Holy Chuck was synonymous with Burger's Priest in my mind until I actually tried their food.  I love me some Burger's Priest, but this place has set itself apart and i know its going to sound ridiculous but I am so serious: they are very different for two restaurants that offer burgers as their focal dish.  This isn't a typical burger and fries joint..these are places where the beef/bacon etc is ground fresh in restaurant...hand-assembled patties and cooked to order. SO BE READY TO WAIT....AND I MEAN..WAIT!!! We were standing by the counter waiting for our order and noticed the cook literally cooked each burger ONE at a time.  I am honestly sad to say I waited 40minutes for my food. Yup. I love burgers that much. You better believe the meal was glorious- they even have GLUTEN-FREE bread (that was so good). You can't get that anywhere... But 40 minutes. They get 3 stars because I want to go back so badly and I will have to clear my schedule to fit them in...its like when I have a doctor's appointment- the day is a write-off.  If you've never had Holy Chucks do yourself a favor and give it a try. (but avoid peak hours)  Patty made out of BACON....omg. that is all.  Oh and before I forget: If you're reading this and contemplating trying this place out I suggest you read the reviews on here with an open-mind and be logical. Most people giving negative reviews are all complaining of grease. Why aren't other place's burgers greasy?...and how come places like Holy Chucks and Burgers Priest have uber-greasy burgers?. If I take a hand-full of beef and bacon and put it through the grinder that meat with grizzle will be greasy. (Think when you cook ground beef at home and its so juicy) But what do I know... =)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try this place out yesterday, I ordered the THE BIG BAD WOLF (TWO BEEF PATTIES FRIED IN BALL PARK MUSTARD WITH CARAMELIZED ONIONS) it was $9.99 The burger had great flavor, my only criticism would be the cost, for ten dollars I expected a little more. However the burger really tasted great. Ordered a side of fries and a cheeseburger for my girlfriend.  Her burger was very nice looking, but it was dripping grease (a few reviews had noted this) but it did taste good.  Thr best part of the meal was dessert, I had the funnel cake, wow it was fantastic.  The place is bright with lots of seating, very friendly staff, and orders are delivered fast. I was mad there was no paper towel in the bathroom, but I'm sure it was eventually refilled."}
{"text":"Ordered a JR burger as its the only one with 1 hamberger patty. The menu is HUGE and the variety is crazy huge ! So many differnt types of burgers and fries options. Great place !"}
{"text":"Service was really friendly, the staff were great and always came around to see how everything was. A lot to choose from including a variety of sides and dessert.   My gf and I had the Holy Chuck burger and Raging Bull burger and added creamy feta fries on the side. Overall, it was very satisfying. We want to have something sweet so we ordered the funnel cake. the portion was HUGE! No funnily cake in the winter time? No problem, Holy Chuck's got you. For 8 bucks, the funnel cake was more than filling.   Can't go wrong. Great environment, friendly environment, and lots of stuff!  Tl;dr best burger joint by far."}
{"text":"In Los Angeles Burgers are king. The Southern California region was the origin spot of McDonalds, In n Out and many other places. Consequently, I was very hesitant about a burger place in Toronto. However, I have to say this place really stepped up to the plate and him a home run. There are many different types of burgers, the people are really nice. I had myself a poutine and a greek bahahastard. It was very good, the name was a bit weird, but I enjoyed the burger much, the poutine was also pretty decent. It wasn't great, but I got a lot of it. I decently enjoyed eating here. I don't know if I would go out of my way to eat here again, but I would reccomend anyone who is a fan of burgers to eat here."}
{"text":"I'm always more of a fries person than a burger person. But the burgers and the fries are great here. Couldn't get enough of their spicy raging bull poutine and nutella fries with ice cream.  I'd say they are even better than the holy grail burger joint, Burger's Priest. Especially since their buns are durable and more impressive then the latter. Would go here a lot more often if their location was more convenient for me.  Did I mention they offer nutella and peanut butter shakes too?"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this place  The food is beyond amazing...I can't lie it's a little price heavy considering the competition they have from Heroes and a no-name place  that does pizza (no they literally don't have a sign)  But when I have a craving do poutine....unless I'm in Montreal no place does it better in my opinion the large container of fries gravy and cheese (REAL CHEESE) with a healthy helping of ketchup is what eating poutine is all about...  Please excuse me I now must eat this before my coworkers do..."}
{"text":"So I have to go back on my first review giving them 3 stars.  After my long time search for good burgers it just seems that I always end up coming back here and enjoying their burgers very much.  The wait times are a lot quicker now and seeing some of the prices everywhere else they seem to be right in line.  I would rather pay more for quality."}
{"text":"It was just my luck that I found Holy Chuck.  It sure did not suck, but holy f*ck, why won't my shirt tuck?    Alright folks, in all seriousness, this place was great.  We ordered almost every possible type of fries, foie gras pancakes, Nutella funnel cake and onion rings as sides.  My main course was a carnivorous burger (which I'm fully regretting now - but in a good way) called the Farmer's Threesome.  Only threesome I've ever had and may need some more.    What did my threesome consist of? One beef patty, one lamb patty, one all bacon patty all intertwining with each other topped with MORE bacon and triple cheese. IT WAS AMAZING!   What I liked was that you could actually taste all the meat and wasn't totally overwhelmed by toppings and sauce.  The only thing I didn't like was near the end, it got kind of salty and maybe that was just the bacon portion of it.    So my likes: -The Farmer's Threesome -The Raging Bull Fries (nice kick to them) -Foie gras pancakes -The funnel cake sans Nutella (sorry, I don't like Nutella)  My Dislikes: -It is slightly slower than other \"gourmet burger\" joints, but it's so worth the wait. Most gourmet burger places take 10 to 15 minutes, whereas this place takes around 15-20 minutes.  However this was definitely worth the wait.  Verdict: Come here if you got some time and I sure think this place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yes, their burgers are great. Definitely one of the better ones I've had. Very fresh and delicious. But that Foie Gras Poutine. So much decadence. So wonderfully flavoured. Not just the foie gras, which is always great on its own. But those fries. Soft and the perfect amount of salty. Just the right amount of cheesy goodness to make you crave for more. And the gravy ties everything together so beautifully, I don't have anything more to say. It was expensive, without a doubt, but definitely an experience I still dream about. They also have a Foie Gras and Truffle burger which I didn't have the courage to try, but it looks pretty magnificent in pictures. While you're there, you've definitely got to try some of their shakes as well. I was pretty adventurous and went with the Wasabi, Green Onion, and Ginger milkshake. Don't be fooled by the strange ingredients. It worked extremely well with the rich ice cream in the milkshake. You would get little bits of spicy wasabi and ginger here and there which was a welcome change from all that sweetness in the shake. I went on a Tuesday so there wasn't any line and a lot of free tables. I'm definitely planning on coming back."}
{"text":"I am from Maryland, and came here during my family vacation since my cousin raved about how the meat from Holy Chuck was round fresh before every burger was made. We had taken them to Five Guys, so they wanted to show us the burgers that Toronto had to offer.   The restaurant is a little small, which was bad since we had a group of 9 people going into the restaurant. So, we had to save about 4 table for ourselves.   I ended up getting the Cowlarie burger, which was AMAZING. the grilled cheese was melty and delicious. I loved the sandwiches and the burger was tasty as well. Literally the best burger mostly because of how deliciously cheesy and gooey the grilled cheeses were. I also had the Farmer's Threesome. I thought it was okay, I honestly didn't think my lamb patty was fully cooked, and I also found a piece of cartilage in my burger.   My cousin had the Dirty Drunken Burger, but his burger was almost completely raw. He ate about three bites until he asked us and we confirmed it was raw. I went to ask them to cook the burger longer, since it was a little raw for us liking. The staff looked at the burger and talked about it with each other. They ended making him a whole new burger.   My other cousin got the holy chuck burger and half way through eating she bit onto a small bone in her hamburger patty."}
{"text":"The burger was very very wet, I'm all for a juicy burger but this was excessive. That paired with a soft bun and caramelized onions makes for a mushy experience. Also the restaurant was filthy, looking around there was caked on dirt everywhere. The ceiling looked liked every pipe up there has been leaking. Everything you touched was somehow greasy and sticky at the same time. Bathrooms were gross too."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday afternoon and decided to order the Holy Duck. The server asked me if its to stay or if it's to go and they refused to serve me the burger because I wanted take out. They claim something about being 100% fat on the foie gras. I was fully aware of what a foie gras was but I still didn't understand why you would insist on me consuming a $30 burger in your dining room with your loud tv blaring and the bright fluorescent lights. I explained to the cashier that I would prefer to take it home and not have to contend with rush hour traffic. I even explained that I'm not concerned that the foie gras will harden or whatever piss poor excuse they came up with. I'm aware of the risk. But they didn't care. So I decided to take my business to The Stockyards instead. Bad policy = bad service. Therefore this place gets a 1 star."}
{"text":"Went here on a lunch period, during a friday. in a party of 2. This was not my first time visiting holy chuck. The burger for holy chuck still is as good as ever.   there were two burgers we got, and i got to try a taste of both. the first one was the most expensive one on the menu which was the holy duck, which cost 29.99 before tax. i can honestly say i am sorely disappointed in that burger, as it was basically an oil and salt factory. although the burger had premium ingredients such as fois gras. and some truffle, they really over salted the ingredients. on top of that it was the oil in the burger was that too much, now i expect burgers to be fairy greasy affairs. however this one the oil was so much it was dripping all over the hands and all over the plate. Basically its a tsunami of oil, which makes you believe the 29.99 was really not worth it. The meat on the burger is as good as usual.   The other burger we had was the grind burger, which was basically a cheeseburger with egg and bacon. This burger was exactly what you expect from a burger. and on top of it, the thing that makes holy chuck good, is that the beef patties they use are fresh meat, and you can taste the difference in the meat. There regular burgers are one of the best in toronto i can honestly say. Better then Burger priest i believe. which is why i still give it 4 stars.  The fries they have are regular fries, nothing amazing except for how much they cost. this time we had regular fries which was okay, however if you choose to go premium which we tried last time, with all the toppings i don't believe it is worth it. At least not for the taste.   Holy chuck is truly a Burger joint, if you want a fresh juicy burger that is just good, this is definitely the place to go. Next time i will stick to just the burgers."}
{"text":"I do not understand why this Holy Chuck location has such a low rating. Absolutely shocked to read that someone found that their burger was \"too juicy\"!!!! Liikkkee, im sorry,  but what do you expect to find at a gourmet burger joint?!?! A thin, dry, reheated patty that you'd get at McDonald's??  I think not!!   For those of you who have a true love and appreciation for juicy, flavourful, fun burgers, please, I beg you, visit this Holy Chuck location. It's just as good as the original location on St.Clair, however I like his one more solely because it's with walking distance from where I live haha! I was soo happy they opened a location here, don't let the mysterious current low star rating discourage you from coming here...trust me, I know good burgers!  I ordered the Mad Cow, I cannot express how much I enjoyed this! The feta and cream cheese just ooozed out of the crisp, crusted portobello mushroom patty. The cheeseburger patty was so just, succulent, thats the perfect word to describe it! I added a pickle on mine since I'm a pickle fanatic. Overall, amazing tasting burger. Also had an order of the Holy Chuck fries, great chili on there, and definitely need a fork to eat those (it'd be a bit on the messy side with your hands). To finalize the meal, I had a banana split shake. Extremely thick at first, had a hard time sucking anything up the straw!  But as you let it sit a bit, it thins out a littlw and becomes much more enjoyable!   Loves my experience here, and loved the juiciness of their great tasting burgers!"}
{"text":"Completely blown away with the quality of here! I ordered their signature burger, The Holy Chuck, and absolutely loved it. I would recommend having the patties cooked medium, this way there's extra juice from the meat to make it even more enjoyable. I also tried the bacon, fudge, and sea salt milkshake, which was surprisingly a tasty combo! Initially you taste the sweetness of the fudge, and will later experience a salty aftertaste......with little chunks of bacon mixed in. All in all, an amazing place, and would surely visit again!"}
{"text":"I'm simply amazed by the rating for this place. It's very, very expensive for the food quality and taste, and obviously the service isn't there. I visited a few months ago with a family member who raved about another location (St. Clair?), and all of the one-star reviews are right on for this place. Here are my biggest issues:  1. The burgers aren't really customizable. This is absolutely not a build-your-own-burger place like South St. or Hero Burger. This is a problem because the vast majority of menu items have numerous toppings.  2. The staff are not well-trained and lack focus. For example, I went to the counter and tried to order one of the burgers - I think Le Croissant du Paysan? - with a bacon patty instead of the beef. There was some mumbling between someone at a grill and the cashier and I was told that they can't do it. I mentioned this to one of the people with whom I was dining, and they essentially said that it's ridiculous that they can't make that sandwich with the one substitution. My dining companion went up to ask and was told that they were out of croissants and simply could not make the burger with other bread. This was in no way communicated to me, and I can see no reason for this policy. The cashier was, to me, much more concerned with talking to other staff than with telling me why they can't make the burger.  3. The food quality is appalling. Everything - every single thing the four people at our table ordered, with the exception of drinks - was dripping in grease. The bacon patty that I ordered on the side to have something to eat tasted like low-quality reconstituted ground pork with an oily feel and gross smoky flavor. It actually reminded me of walking past a group of people smoking cigarettes. The fries, despite the grease, are salty and not crisp. I tried the bacon, fudge, and sea salt shake and it was extremely salty and meaty, barely tempered by weak artificial-tasting chocolate flavor not even on par with a shake from McDonald's or Burger King.  I ate a few bites of the bacon patty, maybe 20% of the whole thing, and a handful of fries. On the drive home, I felt the food sitting like a lump in my stomach and the taste in my throat was sickening. I'm so glad I didn't spend more on an actual sandwich or one of the ornate poutines.  Zero stars. They take basic ingredients and transmogrify them into literal garbage."}
{"text":"The good thing about this place was that there is a parking lot across the street. There's seats! and there usually isn't a long line up. The wait time to get the food is fair enough.  The burger itself is kind of dry and not that tasty, but it was huge, at least the one I got. had to eat it with a fork and knife in the beginning lol (the mad cow + a fried egg). The feed was nothing compared to the option at burger's priest) The burger wasn't the best, but the fries were really good, I like all the fries selections. I would come again if I was in the area, but not specifically to satisfy my cravings, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Burger, fries and a fountain pop for 20 bucks?!  I get this is a local business but if Fresh Burger (around the block) can afford to provide a combo at $12 with the same, if not better tasting burger, then Holy Chuck needs to go back to the drawing board.   The burger itself was tasty (the holy chuck), but I'll definitely pass on the fries. Jackson's Burger is guilty of the same crime: brag about your freshly cut potatoes but serve oily shoe string-like fries that taste like the fryer.   IMO Fresh Burger and Zeal Burger are the best in the 6ix!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Holy Chuck burger and the Angry Wolf today. The Holy Chuck was good, a very hearty burger with quality patties and caramelized onions that added a subtle sweetness. I did find it to be a little on the salty side though. The Angry Wolf is basically the same thing with a lot of mustard, normal and also fried, and sort of tasted like the Holy Chuck with too much mustard. I did feel like the Angry Wolf had an interesting kick but would probably prefer the Holy Chuck overall.   Both burgers were priced at $13 tax included, which is a little higher than other burger places but lower than restaurant burgers. They were also very, very juicy. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Had to try the truffle fries!!!! The toppings were amazing! Super rich tasting and definitely a meal by itself. Actually I didn't end up getting anything else but my fianc√© got a burger and Nutella shake!   It's a bit pricey but at least the portions are hearty."}
{"text":"Been here a few more times and I think I'll be sticking with my double cheeseburger most visits  Tried the  moogats as menu describes and while it was quite good and unique I still prefer the taste of the dbl cheese and when you factor in price points it is a no brainer  As always call ahead for all orders so you are in and out  Good service, friendly staff, best patties in the GTA  Go try it if you are reading this"}
{"text":"A great burger overall. Fresh meat. Great toppings.  And it is absolutely the only place to eat truffle fries. Ever. I go pretty often and it is consistently great food  The meat is fresh, the buns are pretty good for soaking up the juice and they can actually cook a burger to medium. Properly."}
{"text":"Came to Holy Chuck for a casual dinner with a friend, and had a very good experience.  I spent quite a while looking at the menu, but decided on grabbing the Village Bahahastard, which came \"saganaki style\", which is probably the fastest way to have me say yes to something. I also grabbed an order of fries with it. My friend ordered the Cowlorie, also with fries.  Our orders came relatively quick, but they come out and shout your name, so you better be paying attention. A mild annoyance.  Once in front of us, it really hits you just how big these burgers are. I had the smaller of two burgers, but it was still quite the mouth-stretcher in terms of height. Taste-wise, the lamb in the Village Bahahastard was great, as I am a huge fan of lamb, but if gaminess bothers you, you might want to look elsewhere. The Cowlorie was also quite tasty, and the grilled cheese buns were a nice little touch.  In general, the burgers were very tasty, however, were quite salty and quite greasy. It was a solid meal, but I felt like I had to drink an entire bottle of water afterward.   Overall, Holy Chuck was a solid meal, if on the saltier side, but I definitely want to come back and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Called to place a pick-up order. Placed on hold for ten minutes. Hung up to try and call back and they never put the phone back on the receiver.  Be nice to be able to actually try the food ."}
{"text":"Overrated and expensive. Burger was a greasy mess (and not in the good way). The buns were measly and disintegrated in my hands as I was eating because of the grease. Fries weren't bad but nothing to write home about either.  Burger's Priest over Holy Yuck, any day."}
{"text":"Went there today due to web coupon (pay $10 ahead of time, get $20 off our total when there). I wouldn't go to any 'gourmet' overpriced burger joint otherwise.  I got the \"You Fat Pig\". Figured it'd be interesting to try a burger made entirely out of ground bacon (with bacon strips, and cheese, and a bacon dressing). Taste-wise, it was decent. It was about as expected. The problem that it was WAAAAAAYYYY too salty. Like, yeah, I know bacon is cured... but this thing was sodium city. I would not get it again.  I also got fries. I'd say the quantity was worth the price, especially with the coupon. More important is the taste... their fries were very good. Thin and crispy with a nice flavour.  My friend got the signature \"Holy Chuck\". He said it was good, but quite small. I commented on how fairly small both burgers were.  Value? Well, without the coupon, we'd never go there. My burger was definitely not worth $11.99 and my friend's was not worth $9.99 -- these up-scale pretentious fast food joints are getting annoyingly common and all charge far too much. It's a hipster movement and it's not worth the price tag at all.  Would I return? Probably not. Even with a coupon, the value is pretty horrific. I'd much rather a burger combo elsewhere for $10, rather than here where the burger on its own is $12, and to get a burger + fries + milkshake + tax =at least $21.  With the coupon, you could in fact grab $20 worth of stuff and pay $10, but the burger was small and it was out of the way to get there. Plus if the value is so poor that you need a coupon to make it worthwhile, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"So delicious, but so expensive!!   Had the Nutella peanut butter shake as well. Less bang for your buck, but decent splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"To each his own, but I don't like the style of burgers here. For the price, I'd honestly prefer Carl's Jr when it's fresh.   And somebody mentioned it was worth $30 for the Holy Duck? Don't think so.   Fries and onion rings weren't any special, nor was the gravy.   Decent food, but way,  way overvalued. There are definitely places that give much better bang for the buck and I didn't even think the food was all that"}
{"text":"We definitely will not go back. The burger was too salty. We asked for well done, and the meat looked like over-burned. The burger also came with dripping oil. It was just not right! Worse experience ever."}
{"text":"Really nice gourmet burger.  A bit greasy for my taste and tough to keep it under $20 a pop but worth a shot nonetheless if only to say you did.  Milkshakes to die for (try the peanut butter and jelly milkshake...OMG)"}
{"text":"My 1st impression, VERY Clean restaurant.   So many burger choices but I went with the \"Grind&Shine\" burger w/ the Holy Chuck Fries. Girl at the counter was very accommodating and cute. The ONLY bad thing for me was the fries. TO much chili for the fries and not enough fries for the chili. ALSO... I had to drive from Pickering to this location (40mins). A Pickering location needs to be a PRIORITY. Other than that I really like it. I would definitely order from here again.  3/5 stars for me, have to take -1 star for travel."}
{"text":"By far the best hamburger place in Woodbridge. Very pricey but really really good. The fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how good these burgers are! You have to try them.The burger was so juicy and soft..mmmm so good. They melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"They have some crazy things to order here and it'd be interested to spend close to $40 on a burger with foie gras one day but for now my husband and I got some old-fashioned burgers instead. Or rather, he got a double cheeseburger and I ordered the \"Mad Cow\" which is a mix of a junior cheeseburger and their animal feed veggie burger.   I was actually considering just ordering the veggie burger, a panko-crusted portobello mushroom patty stuffed with cream cheese, but when I saw that you could still get that WITH meat as well, I decided to get the best of both worlds. It was like having a giant, cheesy mushroom with my cheeseburger. It was great! Makes it hard to eat because it is stacked quite high but that's not a real complaint, let's be honest.  The side order of fries was my only disappointment. To be honest, the serving looked downright measley on their metal plate. My husband and I ordered one to share, but maybe it's best to just make your own burger a combo since they didn't give us much in the first place for one serving."}
{"text":"Great burgers and lots of different burger options (lamb, beef, ground bacon). Feta fries are amazing and a must try. They also offer exciting options like Nutella burger, foie gras on burger, poutine or even in a milk shake. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"They make great and untraditional burgers. Unique flavours and toppings sets thus burger joint from the rest. Where can you get frois gras on a burger? The meat is fresh and the fries our great. But their milkshakes are far and away the best milkshakes I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place, and I'm a fan of the hype!   Food portions 8/10 Neatness- 5/10 -- might be a good thing b/c it means portions were enough to ooze out.  Ordered- THE COWLORIE (DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER WITH BACON, CARAMELIZED ONIONS, BETWEEN TWO GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES) and a house special. single patty burger w/ tender juicy shredded veal cheek.  Umm ya.  Taste- delicious.  Tastes like real ground beef.  Staff- friendly, helpful and fast.   For my BF who is a big eater and picky with food places, he really liked this place.  But did say he could eat another one.   Takes a while to make a decision bc menu is big but not really that overwhelming.   Price- fair.  Portion is bigger and tastier than any chain restaurant (j@ck @stors or C@seys type places)."}
{"text":"When I found out that Holy Chuck opened another location right in my backyard (sort of) I was ecstatic! I've been to the St.Clair location numerous times and am always pleased.   With that said... I was surprised it took 40 minutes to get my burger. The restaurant was moderately full with many empty tables but I noticed a lot of people ordering larger amounts for take-out so that could be why it took so long.   I got the MISUNDERSTOOD BREED burger and my bf got the HOLY CHUCK with a fried egg on top (additional $1). We also got the HOLY CHUCK fries to share between us. The burger was greasy as many people have said and it does soak through the bun but my oh my was it delicious. My only complaint is that the whole burger was very salty! My bfs burger was very salty as well. I even had to ask for a peice of lettuce and tomatoes lol I don't remember the burger being that salty in St.Clair but then my memory could be wrong. The fries had this weird smell to them, kind of like lamb? I can't explain it - but they tasted ok hahaha The chili and toppings were mediocre.   I probably wouldn't come here on a regular basis - $10+ for a burger is pretty extravagant (our entire bill came up tp $32... ouch!!) but it's a good option when you're feeling particularly gluttinous.   This location is MUCH larger than the St. Clair location so you'll definitely find seating. There's also ample parking in the lot outside, another plus compared to the other location."}
{"text":"A work colleague showed me this place and I loved it!   The \"holy chuck\" burger I had was fantastic. The meat was tender and the bun soft.   The joint is a classic atmosphere. The coke machine that has a ton for different flavors is fun for anyone who has never used one before.   I highly recommend this place. However, I had a milkshake after my meal which was worse then I expected after my great meal."}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced and the service is quite slow. 25 minutes to get a hamburger today.  Food is good however (4.5/5)"}
{"text":"This place is not bad, from the outside it looks nice and attractive but the inside is your typical burger joint. I tried the raging bull burger which is one of their spiciest. It was okay, I really liked how they loaded it with bacon and the patty was cooked properly.   They are very expensive in comparison to your average burger joint. I paid $24 for the burger, onion rings and fountain drink which is way more than what you should pay for a burger that's decent.   Pro tip: ask for a canned drink instead it's a little cheaper and also isn't mixed with water like the fountain drinks. Wish I knew this!"}
{"text":"Tried their holy duck burger (beef patty, bacon, seared Quebec foie gras, black truffle and truffle oil). It's simply amazing. In my opinion it's the best burger given the combo is just so to my liking. And everything blended so well together.  Note: you cannot order this burger to go and we were glad that the lady who took our order let us know that. We wouldn't want the foie gras to melt."}
{"text":"High quality burger joint. Huge portions. It's definitely one of the must-try burger places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I had the signature burger. Double cheese burger with bacon and a poutine. The burger was $10, not bad. It was filling and tasted great. The poutine was $7 a bit pricey seeing it wasn't that special and not that filling.  So I preferred the burger which was def high quality . This place doesn't crack my top 5 burger joints in the city though but If you want to try all the best burgers in the city you have to try Holy Chuck."}
{"text":"There are burgers and there are meat pucks. Holy Chuck is not a puck. Pucks suck, so don't be a schmuck and get stuck with burgers that taste like the butt of a duck. Others have toppings that look like muck, (and Weber's has a sauce called \"Guk\") so spend the extra buck, so you don't press your luck.  Get in your truck and get to Holy Chuck!  With 90% of the creations at Holy Chuck pricing from $10 to $30, you NEED to come here at least once in your life.  There is a lot of pure, freshly ground beef involved, but also lamb, bacon patties, and portabellos. Burgers have amusing names to match the unbelievable concoctions, but even the sides are unique.  Panko crusted onion rings? Nutella fries?  And a Bacon, Fudge and Sea Salt milkshake!  Ok, so I put the lid on my unfinished bottle of iced tea and went up for the shake. With a crispy bacon strip garnish and crumbled bacon to the last draw on the straw, I could feel my arteries harden. Like bubble tea with pearls, there is a lot of chewing required to get through this milkshake.  There is nothing on the menu that is considered \"healthy\" unless you compare fresh ground meat to the frozen mystery meat at other puck slinger joints. Then you can feel righteous about your burger choice. Even if your selection happens to be 6 patties high with 3 grilled cheese sandwiches as buns.  The marketing is built around the inferences that occur with the word \"chuck\" so young boys will snicker and giggle.  I would continue, but I need more family friendly words that rhyme with \"chuck\"..."}
{"text":"Thank you Fotis, the supervising manager during our most recent visit to the Woodbridge location.  After politely and respectfully handling a complaint from a very rude and abusive customer, he pleasantly answered our specific questions about ingredients and allergens in a few menu items.  Then he went above and beyond and made a custom, personalized non-dairy shake for one of the diners in our party.  We were all fans of Holy Chuck before, now we are RAVING FANS of their excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing here, and the menu is really great, full of choices. A little pricey but the food is pretty damn good. My only issue is the large amount of oil and grease that comes out of the burgers (and all the other food too). I know this place isn't the pinnacle of health but I've been to many burger places before and this place has double the amount of greasiness, even with my burger very well done. It will definitely give you some bad acid reflux and perhaps a minor heart attack, however you will be totally satisfied otherwise"}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Tasty cooked and presented well. I had their signature burger and was happy with everything about it. It had good flavour was juicy and satisfying. The fries are also great not to thick or thin crispy light golden brown and delicious. Worth repeat visits and look forward to trying more of their burgers."}
{"text":"Great burger place. They are a bit pricey but they serve quality. You can taste the freshness of their beef.  I ordered the junior chuck burger I think it was called. Their version of a big Mac but better lol and fries.  I wasn't crazy about their fries they weren't anything to brag about. The burger was amazing I enjoyed every bite and I didn't feel guilty. It wasn't overly greasy. The meat toppings and bread all tastes fresh.   Thank you to the friendly staff who helped me with the menu."}
{"text":"This place is bananas.   First time visit was yesterday and good lord was the menu crazy.  Where to begin? We got a standard Holy Chuck burger which was really good, simple, and juicy. A tad greasy but in a good way.  We also got the Big Bad Wolf burger which was really original: they grill mustard so it forms thin, crispy mustard wafers they then stack on the burger as a garnish. It looks a bit unappealing (looks like burnt mustard but doesn't taste burnt at all) but tastes sooo good (unless you don't like mustard).   Really unique stuff.  We shared the Holy Chuck Fries which were cheese fries covered in bacon red wine chili. Pretty tasty but dunno if i'd order again.  One of us got the Bacon Fudge SeaSalt milkshake. I only had one sip but it may be the best milkshake i've ever had. Damn.  Will definitely be checking this place out again, it's a great place to take people who want something familiar but original. Plus the menu just begs exploring."}
{"text":"This was much better than my burger at Burger's Priest.   Sunday eve around 5p my brother went to see Holy Chuck. We plan on visiting all the religiously themed burger joints in the area. It just a thing were doing this winter.  Bang for Buck - yes.   Taste - burger's were made quickly but fresh, fries were nicely crisp with seasonings. I had the Holy Chuck. It has two beef patties I was afraid (from the pictures) would be too much but it was filling. Just enough. The onions on mine were my only complaint, they tasted and felt as if they'd been cooked/sauteed hours ago in a huge vat. They were much cooler than the temp of my burger. I would be curious to see their beef patties pre cooking, seemed more like a McDonald's patty (in texture) than a 'burger specializing' joint.   Atmosphere - Bright airy, has two TVs. Bathrooms were a pleasant surprise. Not only clean but tastefully done and decorated. Biggest disappointed decor wise for me was the chairs for the tables, they were quite short to eat at the table and were really outdoor chairs (hard metal) but the outside perimeter was lined with booth seating that was more physically comfortable and better height.  Service - it was empty when we walked in so we were well welcomed and they were friendly and helpful to us first timers facing the vast menu I'm sure both my brother and I will be back."}
{"text":"This was a good burger spot and I really enjoyed the experience here.  The food was very good - the meat of the burger was good quality and I really enjoyed the poutine and shake (Nutella and Peanut Butter) that I ordered with my meal.  I feel like the burger could have been so much better with a different, higher quality bun...the bun I had was extremely ordinary and seemed like the kind of thing you'd get at a grocery store when you grill burgers at home.  Changing the bun would really make the burgers much better.  Definitely get the double since it really makes for a very good burger experience."}
{"text":"Some of most artery clogging delicious burgers in Toronto can be found at Holy chuck. Everything on the menu packs a flavor punch with every bite and leave you wanting more. Be warned that you'll need to run for about 4 days to burger off  all those calories but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"This weekend, the hubby and I hit Holy Chuck Burgers on Yonge and Wellesley with Toronto finest passports.   This is \"The Misunderstood Breed\" burger ...which is a beef patty and a ground bacon patty with 2 slices of cheese.  We added onion rings on the side.  Verdict?  The first bite is really good, but could've used some lettuce or pickles to cut the grease and salt.  The girl at the cash absolutely did not allow us to put on any toppings for the passport special , even though we offered to pay for it.  She says it was the bosses orders....(but other TO passport holders said they were allowed lettuce... ) . . As we ate it we kind of wondered how much we wanted to run south to the mini grocery store to buy a head of lettuce.  I think this would've been a  good burger if it had some veggies to cut the salt and give it some difference in texture .  It was a soft bun with a soft patty with soft cheese and a soft bacon patty .   Next time I will add a salad to it!  The onion rings was a nice change in texture though. . . I loved the artwork in the restaurant!  From the brick wall paintings to the signs on the bathrooms....you can see how unapologetic they are about being absolutely not vegan friendly and it's hilarious! . ."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a sunday afternoon, i heard good reviews and i wanted to see what the hype is all about. Briefly glancing over the menu they had alot of unique options and the above average price reflected that.   I ordered the holy chuck burger, fries, and the lemon aioli dipping sauce, the burger overall was great and they request how youd like the burged cooked, i asked medium rare but it came out medium to medium well done. The burger wasnt anything too special but the fries were the best part! The fries are thinly sliced and and the lemon aioli took the flavour to a next level!   Overall decent burger but not mind blowing and a bit pricy for burger and fries."}
{"text":"Often cited as one of Toronto's best burger experiences, Holy Chuck was a place I was looking to try for a while. It gets compared a lot to and even accused of being a knockoff of a particular religious-themed overrated and overhyped-to-death-ad-nauseam local burger chain which shall not be named. I even read somewhere Holy Chuck apparently has a secret menu too (does it?). But who gives a chuck?  The only thing holy about Holy Chuck is its name and logo. Okay, maybe also the food, but that would be taking comparisons too far. You should read the menu, it's unbelievably amusing beyond comprehension; an amazing marriage of deranged punny thinking and insanely greasy ideas you thought of and didn't, manifested in creations like \"farmers threesome\" (involves a lamb, beef and bacon patty each), \"the sixxy cow\" (6ix chuckin patties!) or \"you fat pig.\" They also make milkshakes, and it should be known that our good friend Nutella makes a prominent appearance on the menu. Want a simple Nutella burger? Then you're asking for a \"venus my nutty cow.\"  What I like about their beef patties is that it is buttery and very tender, well-grounded but holds itself together, packed with fat whether cooked medium rare or well done. The products are on the small side, utilizes basic Weston Bakeries-made buns, a tad pricey for their size, making up only for its claim of a high quality product, stacked height, and bloody damn greasiness. The Holy Chuck burger is a decent tasty safe introductory choice into the mad cow's world of Holy Chuck.   But oh, they also stuff other sandwiches in a burger! They even use croissants and complete grilled cheese sandwiches as buns! The 'cowlorie' for example is a double patty burger with bacon served on two grilled cheese sandwiches. It lacks the size of the pancake burger at Lisa Marie on Queen West (the only thing I can think of to compare to this hybrid monster), but makes up for with its excessively greasy processed cheesiness and soft easy texture. Crazy. There's also just as insane 'the grazer', which is their 'animal feed' vegetarian friendly portobello mushroom burger spoiled in between you guessed it: Two! Grilled! Cheese! Sandwiches!  Wait, there's more! What other kind of greasy burger joint out there has foie gras and truffles on the menu? What the fancy chuck?? I look forward to trying their foie gras poutine soon.  Overall, it's a basic looking fast food restaurant with a good handful of tables. But the epic level of menu humour, mindblowing number of interesting choices, and very tasty products, makes Holy Chuck a giant leap of an experience far beyond (and less pretentious than) that-shall-not-be-named-local-overrated-chain Burger's P*****. Definitely one of the best in town. As much as I love this stuff from the first bite, it's something best had once in a while. One burger meal is filling enough and may (much like with Morgan Spurlock in Super Size Me) trigger a Holy Chucking Gurgles. Or the Holy Chucking Stomach Ache. If you attempted their notable Go Chuck Yourself Challenge (which doesn't come with much rewards, though it was fun perusing their wall of contestant portraits), you could very well experience afterwards their infamous Up-Chuck.  {TTC: St. Clair subway station. Find it a short walk south of St. Clair. Find it a long run from the nearest hospital.}"}
{"text":"There is no question that the meat quality here is high and the burgers are tasty. The fries are also good. 2 problems though. One, they are very greasy, so much so that the two burgers I've had here have actually been sitting in a small pool of grease, leading my bun and some fries to become soggy. This could perhaps be mitigated by asking for your burger to be cooked slightly longer, something I will ask for when I go back. Two, I am always disappointed when higher end burger joints opt for processed cheese slices; at least have an option for real cheese! This is a debate between burger lovers that will never be settled, some people prefer processed cheese, but I think there should always be an option if a burger joint wants to be considered a quality shop. It's the same issue I have with Five Guys and Burger Priest..."}
{"text":"Nice burger. I like the coke machine a lot. It's one of the things that let me want to revisit. You can select whatever flavor you need for your coke"}
{"text":"went to holy chuck the other day and had the farmers burger and fries and a drink (woodbridge location)  it cost me $20  what a dissapointment-what a waste of $20  picture they show is not what they serve you-so beware  so dissapointed-never will i go back"}
{"text":"I went to the Woodbridge location the other day  I was very disappointed the burgers are not like the pictures they post   It cost $20 for The Farmers Burger and fries and a drink what a ripoff   I will never go back"}
{"text":"This place will be the death of me... but in a good way, if that's possible? I've had to resort to sunglasses and a black wig to disguise the amount of times I have come here - it's probably abnormal. It's gotten so bad that when the staff see me they know to get ready to make me the best darndest shake on the menu lol. Yesterday they suggested the fresh lime. At this point, I've become desensitized to the bat-crazy names and ideas they have on their menu (foie gras and truffle shake anyone?). Regardless of what the name is, you can be confident that you're gonna get something good in your mouth ;)  Since I finally got a chance to try their burger and fries and not just those sexy shakes, I can say this is a unique and well-rounded burger joint.   Fries - they're a good contender to the beast that is mcdick fries. But better, cuz you know, they're actually cooked on site from like scratch n potatoes n stuff ;)   The junior holy chuck was tender, very juicy and generously seasoned. As promised,  there's no need for extra toppings and I enjoyed my perfect little burger with caramelized onions and bacon (hold the cheese). Not a fan of cheese, I know I may lose yelp points for that but I still know a good burger when I taste one, gosh darnit! Even better is that the staff are on point and make you feel totally welcome. As for atmosphere, it's a lot 'laidback burger diner' mixed with a splash of decorative retro eye candy, a TV, and topped off with spacious comfortable seating to spread out in. Love it.  Don't wait any longer to experience the King and Queen-worthy feast that awaits you here. Come forth to Holy chuck -the emperor of all burger joints, powerful redeemer of le junk food - and humbly bow the f down in respect!"}
{"text":"Holy Chuck has some really good burgers and is definitely one of the better burger joints in Toronto. The beef patty is very flavorful and is one of the better tasting patties that I've ever eaten. It also doesn't hurt that the patties are pretty thick as well so a normal guy will definitely get full off of one. There is a wide selection of milk shakes to choose from to down your burger. The milk shakes varieties are very unique. They have a Key Lime Pie milkshake among others.   If you're courageous like I was, you can even try their Go Chuck Yourself Challenge. You have to finish a Go Chuck Yourself Burger and any specialty milkshake. You have 6 minutes to finish everything. If you succeed, you get a picture on their wall of fame. If you don't, then onto the wall of shame you go. This burger consists of a grilled cheese sandwich on the bottom. 3 cheese burger patties piled on top with your regular tomato, lettuce, onions, bacon. Another grilled cheese sandwich on top of that. 3 more patties followed by one more grilled cheese sandwich. Let's just say, this is not an easy feat. I needed about 30 more seconds to actually finish the challenge.   Besides all the greatness of the beef patties, caramelized onions, bacon. The thing that I was a bit disappointed with was the bun. If they could get a better bun, the burger would spring near the top of my personal leaderboard. Maybe even get within range of Minetta's Tavern in NYC. Also, the fries were a bit disappointing and I wasn't a big fan of the poutine. I think South St. Burger has better fries and poutine but it's hard to compete with that place because they have New York Fries working with them which take fries to another level on its own.   Overall, Holy Chuck is one of the better burger joints in Toronto. Much better than Five Guys."}
{"text":"This burger ruined my life 10/10  It was only a few months ago I was introduced to the Raging Bull. Little did I know it would lead me down this dark path of sorrow and despair.   When my wife found out I was skipping out on her fucking dry roast beef again and again to indulge in this glorious masterpiece, she left me. And honestly the burg' is a much better conversationalist. I don't look back at that anymore.   But when you frequent the chuck like I do now, you start to lose sight of your goals in life. I've gained about 400 double cheeseburgers in weight and am racking up credit card debt for another taste of this sweet sweet $70 burg'. But Boy is it worth it.   This burg' is not for the weak or faint of heart. If you so choose to partake in the glutinous glory that is the raging bull I applaud you. There is no looking back. We are in this together. I love you."}
{"text":"I came here one day upon a coworkers recommendation.  I was starving.  Many of the options include 2 beef patties.  That's a bit too much for me. I'm quite certain I had the jr.cheeseburger, some fries and a drink.  It was definitely not cheap, but I have to say that the fois gras poutine and/or the holy duck burger would be on the list of things I want to try!  The service was relatively quick when I stopped in, but it was about 3pm...somewhere between lunch and dinner time so it wasn't busy.  I'm coming back and bringing people with me!"}
{"text":"OMG. I won't be able to eat burgers anywhere else after eating here!!! This is my fourth visit and I'm totally hooked. Juicy, perfectly cooked, tasty, the fried onions on The Holy Chuck are perfect. The regular fries are really good (but sometimes a bit over-cooked). This is my new regular lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Burgers were greasy and salty. The bottom bun was soggy (probably the sauces or meat juice) and was almost falling apart. It was a mess to eat. The fries are very average and tbh i wanted mcdonald fries instead at some point.... Overall this place was pricey and a huge disappointment"}
{"text":"Holy chuck? More like holy f*ck!!! OMG what a phenomenal burger place. To call it a joint is a disrespect. Great great great tasting burgers, great service staff, hard working chefs. Honestly? Skip burgers priest and just go here! You won't regret it. Sorry for no pictures, i was in too much of a rush just enjoying the burger! The only thing that we found filing was the milk shake: i didn't have it my coworkers did. I had to finish my onion rings and their fries! YUMMYYYYYYYYYYYYY"}
{"text":"I bought into the hype and I went to Holy Chuck.  While it was a very good burger, I am not sure it lived up to all the fanfare surrounding it.  Maybe after all the hype nothing could.  I do recommended going, but lower your expectations a bit."}
{"text":"Went to this place after doing a Google search for the best burgers in Toronto. I was not impressed with their service, one of the burgers we wanted a pineapple on and the other mushrooms. They do not do any customizing, despite the fact that they have both ingredients in the kitchen. We were willing to pay more money but she (the cashier) wouldn't even bother going to ask the kitchen to see if they could or would do it.... She just kept saying \"no, sorry you can't. You can get the burger that has it.\" Well no, sorry, we don't want all that extras. Anyways, enough ranting about the service. The food was good, the poutine was salty but decent size. The burger I had, had to return it. I asked for medium and they gave me medium rare. After that was fixed, I was over charged for drinks - she charged me 2.45 for a bottled drink when they had a fountain drink and that would have discounted me .85$ but anyways the food was good."}
{"text":"Very delicious burger - one of the best I've had.  Sadly, a burger and poutine came up to over $20, this is way too costly for my budget.  I bought the Grind N' Shine, which tasted great, I didn't pick up on the egg flavour too much, which was the only other downside of the burger.  The poutine was nothing special, KFC poutine tastes much better in comparison.  Definitely recommend the Grind N' Shine, but I  would not recommend the poutine."}
{"text":"4.8 / 5  One of the best burgers you can get in Toronto.  The burgers are extremely juicy and flavourful, with a wide variety of different types of burgers available to choose from.  Their milkshakes are fantastic if you're into shakes, and their fries are spiced up quite nicely and actually taste good.  The prices are pretty standard for a premium burger (around $15 for a meal) and its worth every dollar.  The service is fast and the seating is usually plentiful.  The interior is clean and welcoming.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I had to log back in to my account after 3 years of inactivity specifically just to help this place out.    I have been to the original Holy Chuck location several times over the past few years, and I can confidently say that this one is just as good as the original location.  This is simply one of the best burgers that you can get in Toronto, and their fries and poutine are equally outstanding.  Everything is outreageously flavorful and the meat used for the burger is extremely fresh and tasty.  As for all the people complaining that the food is too greasy/salty....it's a burger....did you expect it to be healthy and low in calories?  A juicy burger is the best thing you can ask for when it comes to unhealthy foods, and if you sacrifice that component of it then you end up with a dry, mediocre burger. If you want something healthy, sad and flavorless...go eat at a vegan restaurant.  Well done once again Holy Chuck, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've ever had in my life (Cowlorie is my fave). Amazing gluten free bread. Great service...always a happy suggestion and they never forget a face in the neighborhood. The milk shakes are to die for (Nutella and salted caramel rocks) and the poutine puts me in a happy place. Every person I bring loves it and goes back for more! Great place."}
{"text":"A worthy attempt for the burger crown in the great TDOT but ultimately it comes down to the meat and it just doesn't quite deliver. All the fancy condiments can't hide a mediocre patty and by no means am I saying their beef is mediocre..it's just not quite up to the standard of excellence set forth by some of the other burger joints in this city.  From a experience point of view, the menu is attractive with so many options to choose from. The service is so quick that the burger seems to have been made even before you've paid for it.  But ultimately it all comes down to taste and quality and it's not quite there.  The prices are a bit absurd. I think I paid almost $14 for  burger with zero sides.  Better than most premium chains like Hero Burgers and South Street but still far below the champions like Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"Small, noisy joint, with a great burger menu and shake menu.    would I return? yes Would I recommend? yes"}
{"text":"Burgers are great, not too loud.  Awesome shakes, awesome rings.  Fries are good but not spectacular.  Definitely a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I got a burger at Holy Chuck at the end of a run as a reward to myself and wasn't all that pleased with it. I had their signature burger that they ask you not to put any toppings on and found it a bit too greasy. I'd say the burger was greasier than Burger Priest but nowhere as good. However the service is great and the staff appears to be really passionate about what they do so I guess that's a plus. Not really worth it at $14 for a burger and a root beer IMO."}
{"text":"How should I even begin? They should rename this location Holy Salt! They were extremely generous with their salt.   I ordered The Smokey Cow and it looked a little sad. No wow factor at all. It was smokey, but all I could taste was salt! Yes it did warned me about the \"smoked sea salt\" but I wasn't expecting it to be that salty!   My bf got The Frustrated Cow and it turned him into a raging bull with that amount of salt in the burger.   We also ordered their Hand Cut Crispy Fries and don't get me wrong, they were crispy but holy salt!  It's such a shame because they claimed to use the highest quality of meats but what's the point of having Grade A meat when they cover it with salt? With all those hype about Holy Chuck and the price they're charging we expected a lot more from them but it was overall very disappointing.   I'd rather go to Fresh Burger (Church/Wellesley) - never been disappointed by them."}
{"text":"Tried The Holy Duck burger.. 4/5 I personally love eating foie gras. To have the foie gras combined with white truffles &  freshly grounded patty in a bun was just amazing.  It got a little messy when I ate this because of how much white truffle oil they put in the bun. But with all the ingredients combined together, the burger was delicious and I would definitely recommend this to my friends.  We also ordered the The Village Cow burger. We ate this after the Holy Duck burger so we definitely tasted the difference between the two - Holy Duck was better haha. The smell of the seared & melted Kefalotiri cheese was a bit too strong for my liking. Overall, this burger deserves a 3/5.  The poutine's portion was huge - the melted cheese with gravy was very tasty.  We couldn't finish it all!"}
{"text":"We went to Holy Chuck twice and were pleasantly surprised both times. The first time we got a regular Poutine and the second time we got the feta fries and Nutella fries. All orders were delish. I was skeptical about the Nutella fries but they are such a great dessert item. Also, the feta fries are so yum with such a nice garlic taste. I'll be going back for some more fun fries. I have yet to try burgers because I get full on the fries. The prices are steep so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"I still remember when the signs were posted that this was coming soon.. Now it's finally open!   Being my first visit, I had to try the original Holy Chuck burger. It consists of bacon, onions, cheese and two patties, at $10.49.  The service was decent and the food arrived in a timely fashion.  When I opened the container, the burger was honesty much smaller than I expected. The bread buns were very similar to McDonalds value burger buns - in taste and texture. The meat patties and caramelized onions were perfectly cooked. The bacon was a nice touch. It wasn't overly greasy.  Sad to say, I'm still hungry after eating this. It was small and too expensive. :(  Overall, it was a good snack... I'm looking forward to trying their desserts!  (Will post an update and hoping they will win on that front.)  * FYI : there are no promotions/specials for their grand opening."}
{"text":"A star each for the burger and fries, both of which are near perfect, absolutely delicious.   However, the menu is grossly overpriced, $20 a person if you order all components, but with none of the service or atmosphere of a sit down restaurant.   For this reason I cannot recommend it at all from any standpoint. You are paying expensive restaurant prices with none of the benefits unfortunately"}
{"text":"Out of all of the gourmet burger places out there, this is probably my fave.  The patties are filled with flavour and there's a LOT of options for your main and sides.  The greek fries are my fave.  I'm quite particular about my fries, and I love that they have the thin crispy ones.  The onion rings, not so much (and I love onion rings).  I got a fountain drink, but unfortunately nearly half of the options were not working.    As expected, the food is definitely pretty greasy.  Next time I'd probably just opt for a burger OR a side rather than both.  Not some place I would go too often.  A cheeseburger, greek fries and a pop was over $20.  For fast food..."}
{"text":"This is a review on the stall at Front Street Market.  I understand the space is limited and their menu is limited.  No problem.  I ordered the holy chuck.  All the burgers on the menu were double patties.  Later, when I got to my table, I found out my friend ordered the single patty version (why wasn't this listed on the menu??)  Burger itself was ok.  They gave away my order so I had to wait but other than an apology, they did not compensate me for waiting for another burger.  Burger itself is good but VERY greasy.  The bun was soaked in oil and that may appeal to some people, I wasn't as fussed.  Be good if they had a more heartier bun so that it would absorb the oil/fat instead of making it soggy.  For more than $10 I found it expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"The burgers and shakes and fries here are amazing. The burgers were fresh, not overly greasy, great toppings, great variety. The fries were perfect. Crispy and salty without being too salty. The shakes, again huge variety, thick, lots of flavour, large pieces of candy within. Worth the money for one of the better burgers I've had in the city"}
{"text":"I just can't justify paying $30+ for a burger fries and a pop. Mind you I had the truffle fries but still. For $30 I can have a nice ribeye at the Keg. Not saying Keg is my first choice for stakes either. Cause when it comes to stakes you get what you pay for. But a burger is a burger at the end of the day."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place. My brother told me about it and I'm glad he did.   I'm just rating the food and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it was too salty for my liking... And I generally like saltiness. I mean, I put salt on my strawberries, apples, watermelon... So ya, I like salt on my food, but this one is overpowering.   Aside from that, this is burger is soooooo juicy, it's amazing! I like the bun, it reminded me of Burger Priest. I'd say this is a tie between Burger Priest. Yum!  My advice, before you go in, if you can, check out the website to look at the variety of burgers they have. It's a wall of variety... Literally!"}
{"text":"had the smoky cow and the big bad wolf today; it restored my faith in holy chuck. the last time we visited the other yonge location it was all a little messy. these two burgers were amazing! neat and packed full of flavour. loved the fried mustard on the big bad wolf!"}
{"text":"We visited the original Holy Chuck a week ago and loved it, so checked the new location out a couple of days ago.   I got the Frustrated Cow (blue cheese, garlic mushrooms, caramelised onions and bacon)- my boyfriend got it previously at the other location and I loved it so much I had to have it again ASAP. I asked for medium rare, as before. It was more like 'well-done' last time, but this time it was perfectly cooked, still slightly pink.   Got the feta fries too and they were gooood.  WE LOVE HOLY CHUCK.  Friendly service in here too, much better than the other location! :)"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a weekday and it was super busy.   Tried the Big Chuck. It was so greasy, sloppy and juicy. Really enjoyed the flavour but the bottom bun was kinda useless, just soaked up so much grease and juice and got soggy so didn't care for it. But the big thing is flavour and I really enjoyed the medium rare patties.  Also had the panko onion rings and they were really flavourful as well.   Overall 4/5, just going to dock 1 star because my meal came to $20. A bit much for lunch."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, Holy Chuck makes a better-than-average burger, for sure. But for my tastes, the Burger's Priest is still king of Toronto's greasy burger.   Actually, while perusing the Holy Chuck menu on their website (crazy-long menu, holy!) I noticed tons of similarities to the Priest menu...both offer an array of over-the-top burger selections, including burgers that use grilled cheese sandwiches as buns, burgers with a deep-fried mushroom option, burgers with mustard-grilled patty option, etc etc, and both ladder up to some seriously insane burger insta-heart attacks, such as the \"Go Chuck Yourself\" (6 grilled cheese patties with triple bacon and caramelized onions stacked between 3 grilled cheese sandwiches. Really?)  I ordered the signature Holy Chuck burger (double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions) and enjoyed it....but not quite as much as I enjoy a normal cheeseburger with the works from Burger's Priest. That's just me.  Having said that, I WILL return to Holy Chuck...why? The MILKSHAKES! Holy awesome!! I had the 'nutella and salted caramel' shake and it was ridiculously delicious. Next time I will come for the shake and stay for the burger. Huzzah"}
{"text":"Have heard a lot of things about the Holy Chuck and gotta say, their burger didn't disappoint!! I got the The Holy Chuck signature and thought 2 patties would be way too much, but it was surprisingly very easy to eat. The patties were so fresh and juicy and just melted in your mouth. The crispy fries were also quite good. The service however was not that great... The cashier at the front forgot to give me a cup for my drink (it's self serve pop), so I went back to ask for one and she very rudely asked if I had already paid, almost insinuating that I was trying to steal a drink. At the counter, where you pick up your burger, I was also very rudely barked at asking if I was the one picking up my order. The service experience overall was terrible, but I only give it 4 stars because the burgers were fantastic. The price was also fairly steep, getting the combo with their cheapest burger on the menu with fries and a drink cost me $17 with tax. Not sure if I'd get a combo ever again."}
{"text":"Just terrible. The place is way too small and cramped so people are just milling around waiting in long lines. The burgers themselves are overprices and overrated, nothing special at all. And there is no flexibility, you take the burger the way they want it or you don't get a burger at all. The staff is incredibly rude and unfriendly. Do yourself a favour, spend your money at any of the many other burger joints toronto offers and don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Had a lamb burger here that was so good I regret how far away I live from this location."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, on so many levels. The bottom line was meh food and horrible service.   We stopped by recently one day on a Saturday afternoon, and between the line to order and the line to receive food, we waited an hour. As we were waiting for food, we could see they didn't have a constant flow of burgers on the grill - it really held up the time from ordering to receiving food. I don't mind waiting for something if they are genuinely busy, but get your kitchen in order.   Beyond the logistical nightmare that it was, we got a ton of attitude from the cashier taking orders. We ordered two burgers, one of which was requested to be on a leaf of lettuce rather than a bun due to dietary restrictions. At first, the cashier refused to do this as it would \"kill the burger\". Only after a minute of arguing with me, did she decide she was willing to do this. Given that I'm paying $10-$15 for a burger, you can take the bun off for me and not be incredibly rude about my dietary restrictions at the same time. I didn't ask for any other substitutions or special requests, other than just don't put it on a bun. Not difficult, and not crazy, but apparently too much for this staff member.   As I said, it was very overpriced. $30 for two burgers and a water? No. They were out of sweet potato fries, so we saved some money there at least. I doubt they would have been worth it given the quality of the food.   I will admit, the meat was delicious. Cooked well and well seasoned. But otherwise? McDonald's level burger (including the white wonder bun with my boyfriend's burger and the processed cheese) with good quality meat.  Not worth the time, stress, or money."}
{"text":"Hands down the saltiest burger I've ever eaten. Not normally picky with food, I can eat anything. This was terrible though. Seems like the burger etc would have been fine if it weren't for the amount of salt they put on the meat. Like what are you trying to mask bro? I tried the st.clair location like 2 years ago and felt the same. It was decent but too salty. So I thought maybe that batch was bad. So this time.i tried the Wellesley location. Got myself the 2 Patty burger. My God it's even saltier. Such a shame because you can tell the quality of meat is prob fine but it's hidden under 69 layers of salt. Can't recommend, sorry."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch and we ordered the peanut butter and Nutella milkshake (delicious) onion rings, and we each had a burger. I can't remember the name but it was 3 beef patties, 3 pieces cheese, 3 slices of bacon with Caramelized onions ( $.99) and my husband got the raging bull which he liked but it's very spicy. Overall we had a good experience except for a few minor things.  1: I asked for Caramelized onions, but she put down that I wanted a fried egg which I noticed on the receipt after I went to sit down. It's the same price for a add on of .99 but I'm assuming it was loud inside so that's why she made the mistake.  I also asked for pickles on my burger, and I never got them. 2. The amount of onion rings I got for the price you pay which is almost $5 was not worth it.   I would come back here again, but keep in mind it's not cheap. $40 for 2 burgers, a shared onion ring and a shake is a bit much I feel. Overall a good experience but I would get the lady to repeat the order back to you, or check your receipt to make sure you have what you ordered."}
{"text":"Ordered The Holy Duck.  Burger decked out with an array of luxurious toppings.  Quebec Foie Gras, truffle oil,  shaved fresh Italian white truffle, pure Canadian maple syrup and double smoked bacon.  Yep. All that on one burger.  You have to know what you're doing to have this type of burger on your menu.  Expectations are high!  Foie Gras was seared perfectly, toppings paired well and complimented each other.    For a burger The Holy Duck comes with a hefty price $30+tax.  Trick on getting bang for your buck?  Hover over the fries as you eat the burger and let the juices from the patty, grease from the Foie Gras, truffle oil and maple syrup drip over your fries.  No need for ketchup!  Oh and got the Strawberry Cheesecake milkshake.  It was amazing.  Just go get it.  Final verdict.  Was the burger worth $30? Yes because it tasted good and there was a decent portion of Foie Gras and shaved truffles.  The beef patty was flavourful and juicy and each bite was just heavenly. Even if you don't get this burger, try their other burgers! Oh and the milkshake. Go. Get. It."}
{"text":"It has to be said that the arrival of Holy Chuck following on the heels of the success of Burger's Priest caused some people to say that the former was ripping off the latter. Having eaten at both I'd have to agree that the timing was decidedly convenient in its indication that that claim was true. Still, there are a few differences.   Both have secret menus. Both have their own version of the Big Mac sandwich. Both have order counters and then seating areas for the hardcore. And both grind their beef fresh daily.   But I'd give kudos to Burger's Priest for a few reasons: While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, they were the original. Secondly, they're the better of the two. Lastly, while neither is incredibly cheap, the imitator (Holy Chuck) is more expensive ($38 for two burgers, one fry and two sodas).   Holy Chuck is a good, decent burger. I ordered their Big Mac and it was delicious. The fries were tasty. The soda was soda, although they do have those cool Pininfarina machines. But what put me off was that there was simply not enough effort here to justify a $38 price tag for two burgers and a side. This is still a take out counter just like McDonald's, and while the quality is obviously higher here when it comes down to it, its a hamburger and it tastes an awful lot like you're getting charged too much, especially when up the street at McD's it's still $10 for the Big Mac combo (and that's supersized).  You won't be disappointed, but I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"Moooooo gats burger was amazing!  Had the poutine as well, incredible! What an experience."}
{"text":"Yes, their burgers are very good. No, it's not affordable.   I got a burger with fries and water and had to pay 26 dollars. Ouch. The burger was very very good but that size! That's a kid's size at McDonald's c'mon!!    The fries were good... Not great but average.   It was alright in general. Expensive and not good proportions but the quality is a 100."}
{"text":"Our go-to burger place. You can taste the difference in the quality of the meat. It has the most interesting burger combinations and the best shakes of any burger place. And it's not pretentious with it's menu. Highly recommend.  One tip though: the St Clair location has much better and more amiable service than the Wellesley location."}
{"text":"My favourite non-Five Guys burger in the city and far and away my preferred burger over the Priest. The challenge burger is excellent in spite of the meh dare -- it's actually what I always order. The shakes are also awesome."}
{"text":"Went to Holy Cow after hearing rave reviews from friends. While the burger was quite delicious I could have really done without the overly pretentious attitude. I ordered \"The Village Bahahastard 'Saganaki Style' burger and asked if I could have some pickles on it (which I was more than willing to pay for). I was dealt with a terse \"We don't do that and we're not going to do that. I takes away from the 'experience'\". Now I'm a pretty fair guy but seriously? It's a burger not a virtual reality game or a tour of the Sistine Chapel. Was it really that difficult to give me two pickles?   Customer service is a sizable portion of any dining experience irrespective of whether is it fast food or not. I would not go back, there are better and friendlier places that are more than willing to go the extra mile. I will happily be taking my \"experience\" elsewhere."}
{"text":"All I have to say is:  Big Chuck  It's what the golden arches USED to serve as their Big Mac... all grown up!  It is off the charts!    Their fries always have a bit too much parsley on them... I always ask them to hold back if they can.  Aside from that, everything here is good..."}
{"text":"Meh, food is tasty, but nothing extra special. It's very oily and on the expensive side ($14.99 for truffle fries serving). Decor is cheap and bland (rather uncomfortable). Service on the slow side. I personally prefer the food at Boneyard or Fat Burger... I even prefer 5 Guys!!!"}
{"text":"They make a pretty mean burger, but I'm 100% sure they gave the couple behind me their order before me. Big no no in my books.  This happened the second time I was there.  I had waited ~15 mins for my order, my friend's order came up, another 5 mins, then the couple who ordered behind us.  Another 5 mins and John (the boss) asks the couple if their food was good and I'm still waiting...  So my friend's waiting to eat the entire time and his food is getting cold, while the couple behind us in-line is eating my nice and hot food, which was the same order as mine.  Not a big fan of the nepotism going on..."}
{"text":"The taste of freshly grounded beef always tastes different than your average fast food chain restaurant type of deal. They pride themselves with freshly grounded beef and you can see the machine that they use to grind it up per order.  However for the price they charge as well, somewhat overpriced. Comes out to be about 10 bucks for a single burger which may be aligned with Burger Priest that delivers good quality burger as well.   Since it's the only shop in the area (I did see Hero burgers down the street) maybe it charges more for the supposed freshness. But hard to justify coming back frequently cause of the pricing."}
{"text":"Juicy almost melt in your mouth burger, that's a good thing. I ordered cheese on my burger, but didn't really notice any cheesiness about the burger, that's not so good. I liked the taste of the gravy, but it could definitely be thicker. The fries though?  Not a fan of skinny fires and the seasoning they added just didn't work for me.  I'll likely do a return visit to try The Cowlorie."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for burger lovers!! They have quite a good selection of specialized burgers in the menu. All of them are some kinda unique... size is quite big, prices are at the upper-mid range.  I tried the Animal Feed... a \"large\" mushroom deep fried, filled with cream cheese, topped with lettuce and tomato and it's between the buns... Quite an unusual burger!!"}
{"text":"As I was introduced to this burger joint a couple years back(when I last visited TO), I know it's good bec it left a good impression in me. Good enough that this time visiting Toronto, it had to be one of my food stops in this rather short trip. I'm used to my In and out and recently shake shack. So for me wanting holy Chuck is quite impressive. I have tried the animal feed mad cow style, oooh I can still remember the feta cream cheese oozing out of that portobello...onolicious!!! I've also tried the holy chuck, plain simple goodness no extra shenanigans, this way you appreciate the beef itself. On my last night I had the jerky cow, this was suggested by the server that night. She took her time explaining the pros and cons of some of my choices( she probably noticed that I'm not from there) and we came to an agreement that jerky cow was the way to go. Let me tell you this one is quite spicy, but oh did they get the flavors right!!! The spice and that pineapple together was the perfect marriage. The sweetness of the pineapple balances the kickin spice of the jerky that you end up wanting more. I complemented that meal with their pouting, with extra curds and that helped put the fire put in my mouth.  So yes it's worth the try, you might want a glass of mil handy as well.  The place itself was clean and the design was bright and minimalistic. Service was awesome, I wish I caught her name because she was super nice and exemplify what customer service is! Holy chuck I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had. The patties are made in house (like almost everything else they have) and they're cooked to specification, tender, juicy, and magnificently seasoned.  So far I've only tried their signature burger but there's a concoction with foie gras that's calling my name. Will definitely, definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Holy CHUCK! I am a fan of these burgers!  There is a burger here for everyone. Bacon pattys? Check. Cheese stuffed portobello mushroom pattys? Check. Some truffles and duck confit for that burger? Check. Really, your burger dreams can come true here. Anything your heart desires ;)!  The burgers here are super fresh, super tasty, super moist. Are they on the pricier side? Yes. But, folks, these are gourmet, made to order burgers. You are paying for quality and a unique burger here.   Customer service is excellent. The staff are really friendly, helpful, and sweet. Yes, if you're here during peak hours on a weekend you may be in for a wait, however, the cashier will advise you of the wait prior to you placing your order so you know what you are in for. Outside of Friday/Saturday nights my friends and I have never encountered a long wait.   The desserts here are effing AMAZING. Holy Chuck has seriously some of the BEST milkshakes you will EVER consume. Again, just like the burgers, you have an array of options. I've tried Reece's pieces and banana (amazing), banana split (amazing), and bacon and fudge (my bacon loving partner in crimes absolute favourite).   Try \"The Butcher, The Baker, & The Ice Cream Maker\". You'll thank me later. It's cookie dough, wrapped in bacon, deep fried, and served with ice cream. It is a piece of heaven. We DEVOURED it.   Seriously, Holy Chuck is chucking awesome.  Check it out & see for yourself! And maybe put your mug on the wall of shame while you're at it if you want to attempt to stuff your face in 6 minutes ;)"}
{"text":"I ate at Holy Chuck Burger a few weeks ago and forgot to write a review for them. I came here after hearing so many good things that I was interested to try this new burger spot.  What I ate:  The Holy Chuck Burger ($9.99) - This burger was melt in your mouth, greasy and super soft, just the way I want a greasy burger to taste. My fav burger place is Shake Shack in the States and this was the closest thing I have had to their burgers here. The patty itself could have a bit more seasoning but regardless it was very good compared to other places I've eaten at in Toronto.  Greek Fries (Can't Remember) - These were not on the menu, but I was told by someone to order these if Johnny (the owner) was working. Johnny knew exactly what I was talking about and whipped us up a batch (Johnny was super friendly and very passionate about the food). I'd never had greek fries before, but these things were AMAZING! The fries themselves were nice and crispy with great seasoning and they were topped with a greek dressing and feta. So good!  Reese's Pieces and Banana Shake ($5.49) - I love chocolate and banana, and I love Reese's Pieces so this shake was like heaven for me. Not sure what more I can say.  Staff: As I mentioned above, Johnny was super friendly and when I watched him preparing another order you could tell he was extremely passionate about the food. Everyone else there was also very nice.  The only downside to this place is their location. I live downtown so it is too far for me to go to all the time which is probably a good thing because you will definitely put back some calories eating here!"}
{"text":"It's not always about taste, it's about value too. Taste of the \"Signature Holy Chuck\" was fine, very soft (generic) bun, beautifully processed cheese, fresh cooked bacon and crumbling meat patties (2).  But $10+tax for this? Nope. Enough reason not to go back. Ok, wait, I may go back to try the fries and/or bacon shake and, most importantly, some Frogger on the old school arcade."}
{"text":"Good, solid cheese burger! A lot of different variations but I only had the standard burger & fries which were flavourful & satisfying. I'd be interested if the Go Chuck Yourself challenge.. But I'm sure I'd regret it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to try this place for quite sometime.  Made a decision to drive down South to hit it up.  Parked on the side road and skedaddled to the joint around 9 PM.  Had to make it in because they were closing in an hour.  Got the last 2 seats in the place and the line-up was not long at all.  Had to order their signature burger and follow the instructions, not getting condiments for The Holy Chuck Burger ($9.99)!  Ordered 2 Holy Chuck burgers (2 patties, 2 cheese, bacon, caramelized onions) with a side of Onion Rings.  Worker called my name and I brought the grub to our seats.  The look of the burger... amazing!  The bun totally looked like it was straight from a hamburger/fish fillet bun from McDonald's!  Sank my teeth into this bad boy and hell... great tasting burger!  Patties were totally juicy and soft and the melted cheese were superb.  Oily as EFF!  Great artery cloggin' instruments.   However... I actually do believe it needs the condiments to enhance it even more.  I didn't even eat it with ketchup!  Also, a downside are the onion rings.  It looks like they were originally frozen and then deep fried.  For $4.79, it so was not worth it.  They were kinda tasteless and weren't really good.  Harvey's are better!  Even the tiny parsley flakes or coriander sprinkled on top of them didn't really help.  Next time if I was getting the burgers, totally would get the condiments to go with it.  And maybe I will try the poutine but not the onion rings.  I still am not sure if this would beat The Priest burger from Burger's Priest.    Try the burger out if you have not already.  You won't be too disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy chuck, I've finally decided to try this place after hearing about it for so long!  I was thinking of trying something extremely exotic...until I saw the prices...I guess I'll do that next time. I decided to stick with the fundamentals and ordered their specialty: Holy Chuck burger. I added a side of big chuck fries cause I heard positive things about their fries.  Comparing to Burgers Priest, I personally thought they were about equal, if not a slight edge to Holy Chuck for more variety and juicier patties. However Holy Chuck easily wins the category in better seating, as the place was significantly larger and I was able to grab a seat. The big chuck fries were nothing to write home about, but I liked the fries themselves. Maybe next time I'll just have the fries without anything added, or try the poutine.  Holy Chuck has a lot of interesting burger choices that I wanna try in the future."}
{"text":"What's great: Gluten - free bread. Soft. Tender. It sticks together when you bite.  What's not great: Makes you feel a bit sick after eating their signature burger. It's pretty fattening, but hey, if you love meat and think it's lame to be on a diet, this could be for you!  Service: Friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Frustrated Cow\": two beef patties with blue cheese balls, fried mushrooms and caramelized onions. I'm slow and didn't pick up on the phallic reference until after I ordered. The beef is definitely high quality but it's cooked on a frying grill which made it very messy. I ordered medium and it was more of a well-done. The price is high for a fast food style restaurant. $17 for just the burger tax included.  I would be more into a single patty burger with delicious topping choices like at Woody's in Etobicoke. If you took this patty and got Woody's toppings and lowered the price it would be 5/5. Holy Chuck is an expensive burger that was super messy to eat and the blue cheese wasn't that good. Only came here because I'm waiting to meet someone nearby. Probably won't come again because it's too pricey and didn't blow my mind like a $17 burger should."}
{"text":"Tried the Farmers Threesome and the Raging Bull Fries. The burger was nicely presented with even layer of bacon patty,  lamb patty, beef patty and cheese. The meat is cooked to medium as I wanted. The beef patty and lamb patty are very moist and juicy, they are very light in salt, which is perfect combination with the saltier bacon patty at the bottom. It is so moist that I can finish the burger without drinking a drop of water.  The Raging Bull fries is good portion but its pricey at $7.99. The fries by itself was great. The gravy contains some kind of smokey BBQ chipotle sauce, which is way too salty to my preference. At the end, I couldn't finish the poutine becoz it is way too salty. At this exact price, you can get a bigger portion, better quality poutine from specialty poutine restaurants.  Holy Chuck's burger is definitely excellent, the poutine will definitely need some work. I will go back again for the burger, but I may pass on the poutine."}
{"text":"Nothing special, what's so ever about this place! They advertise big burgers, and a big mess is what you get! The meat has a lack of flavour to it, the poutine gravy is bland, the fries plain. It does fill you up though! Yonge and St Clair, there are a million better places nearby to get a descent meal!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best burgers in the city, undoubtedly the best shakes.  I heard Holy Chuck was started by someone who used to cook at Auberge du Pommier, and it shows with the creativity of the burgers. I especially love the Village Bahahastard (lamb burger with a big slab of saganaki cheese), the Cowlorie (burger woth grilled cheese; they do the grilled cheese part especially well since the \"buns\" almost melt into your burger), and of course the classic Holy Chuck (simple and straightforward, allows you to really taste the quality of the beef). My wife has tried the Holy Duck - while really pricey, she swears by it if you love foie gras.  But where Holy Chuck truly differentiates itself from all the other burger places are with its shake. Sinfully thick, divinely rich - whether you go for a straightforward Chocolate or try Grandma's Apple Pie, the flavours strongly come through. My favourites are the Nutella + Peanut Butter, or if you want something more unusual try the Bacon + Fudge + Sea Salt (the shake will have bacon bits in it, so interesting mix of sweet and salty tastes... which works!).  One last tip: If you want the best Holy Chuck experience, go to the one near St Clair. The other locations, while good, just don't meet it's level of awesomeness."}
{"text":"The burgers are jucy but too oily which I don't like. Below my expectations but still worth the try."}
{"text":"the burgers here were very salty.. probably not my favourite due to the numerous amount of other competing burger joints in the area such as heros, burger priest, five guys, etc. i found their fries selection to be a bit intriguing cause they had a foie gras poutine. they also do burger challenges so thats interesting as well. the burger was still good despite the saltiness of the pattie. they make their pattie fresh so i think if u wanted less salt u could tell them beforehand."}
{"text":"Holy Chuck! Went here on a whim with a friend and it was amazing! Had the big chuck and a Nutella and salted caramel shake. I shared my friends fries which were seasoned with rosemary sea salt. No need to pick your toppings as the burger is already dressed. Let's just say the price is worth it as the meat was tender and the shake was heavenly. Like a salty Ferraro rocher!    Definitely going back and with a few intense workouts so I can earn my meal!"}
{"text":"First time Chucker here (grabbed the original burger for lunch). As a very picky burger eater, I must say I'm very impressed. Patty was very juicy and full of body. I followed their suggestion of not having any toppings added to the burger. I had tasty beef juices running down my fingers as I eagerly chewed away. The burger was gone within 5 minutes. Now, that's definitely a sign of good burger. I was a little disappointed that the burger was smaller than I imagined. I wasn't hungry before I indulged the little yummy goodie and I became hungry after having finished the burger. I guess the burger opened up my appetite!  I think this will become my weekly sin.  Good thing Goodlife is just downstairs..."}
{"text":"Posted this for the wrong Holy chuck location ... so reposting it for the right one.  Tried this place a couple of weeks ago after people have raved about it.  Not sure what they are going on about.  Decor looked like it was from the 50s.  Maybe that's what they were going for...  The menu is too large.  It took me 10 minutes to go through every item. They need a simplified menu for god sakes.  That thing was a headache to navigate.  At the end I was more confused about what I wanted before I came in.  Tried the you fat pig.  It was sloppy built and presented.  I got it to go and it tasted very undercooked and just plain nasty.  It was supposed to have bacon patty but the thing was not properly assembled.  It was falling apart.  It wasn't a patty!  No cheese or bacon was in there.  The bun was soggy and moist.  I was running late and chucked the entire thing after two bites.  It tasted nasty.  The fries were good.    Sorry chuck, I wasn't too impressed.  You need to bring up your game in the kitchen.  Lastly, I highly recommend you have your staff take food handler's course.  No one was hand washing before handling food.  If you touch a foreign object wash your hands.  If you pick something up from the ground and put it away... wash your hands!"}
{"text":"A lot of choices for burgers. Find it very greasy. Tried the bacon smoothie and its just ok. I did not like the poutine I ordered."}
{"text":"I never wanted my burger to end. And I'm not even a huge burger fan. I had The Grind and Shine and the chips and egg combo was delicious.  Went with a group and each had a different kind - another standout was the only vegetarian option on the menu, the Animal Feed burger.   It's fast food, but not like any other. With fresh meat ground each day, the parties are juicy and flavourful. Perfect Friday lunch."}
{"text":"Burgers are good.. The \"go Chuck yourself \"is huge and tasty.but wasn't impressed by the fries and the vegetarian burger..funnel cake with ice-cream was nice."}
{"text":"Yeah. Good service. Fast food. Literally. I got the mad cow. It's a mix of the animal feed and the standard cheese burger. It has a fried portobello mushroom, feta cheese and cream cheese, and a beef Patty with cheese. Tasted good.  Some tiny complaints. Wasn't cooked to medium even though I was asked if I wanted it medium (it was well done). Bread was soggy.   Overall, good food but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about the mixed reviews about this place, but gave it a try anyway with my boyfriend yesterday.  We were both VERY impressed with the quality of food - burger patties were cooked PERFECTLY, and the buns were soft and fresh. Many people complain that the burgers are dripping with grease, but I think it's mostly excess water from the freshly washed veg toppings. The slight drippings from when I picked up my burger seemed more watery than grease.   Also, judging by older menu photos, they've changed-up the cut of their fries, as the shoestring french fries seasoned with thyme were DIVINE: fresh, crispy and not over salted. Reminded me of the Jaime Kennedy fries I recently tried at the Luminato food festival. I was tempted to try the poutine, but drowning these perfect frites in gravy and cheese would seem tragic! Also, the portion was MASSIVE - you'll likely only need one order if you're willing to share.  I ordered the Jr. Cheeseburger, as it was the only burger with one patty. Usually most places skimp on \"kid\" size burgers, but I was REALLY impressed by the portion - while stacked full of toppings, it almost appeared to be the same size as my boyfriend's Holy Chuck (double cheeseburger.)   The atmosphere itself was comfortable: air conditioned and well ventilated, and plenty of table space. Staff were friendly and efficient. Granted, we visited when it wasn't very busy (5pm) so I'm sure it's a bit more chaotic during the lunch rush.  One minor complaint: the place doesn't offer a huge assortment of extra toppings (8 total, including ketchup and mustard.) Even Harvey's or Subway offers basics like bbq sauce or relish. But again, it's not a big deal.  And yes, the place is a bit pricier (our bill came out to about $23) compared to other burger joints in the area, but the quality of food is miles above those other places."}
{"text":"Made a special trip since I've heard such good things and I was really disappointed. Tried the mad cow (I think it was called), the one with the cheeseburger and their \"veggie burger\" (aka portobello mushrooms stuffed with cheese and deep fried) and my husband had the holy chuck burger. We also shared a poutine. The burger itself is under seasoned and not super flavourful (needs more salt and pepper). Their veggie \"burger\" (the mushrooms) was really disappointing (the burgers priest one is much better). You can barely taste the mushrooms and the cheese they use (feta and cream cheese), has no real taste or cheesiness. Honestly, I could taste the breading more than anything. The buns didn't seem fresh and honestly tasted and looked like week old wonder bread buns you may get at the grocery store. The holy chuck burger - same under seasoned party and bun. The best part was the carmelized onions... which isn't saying much. The poutine was alright. I found the gravy a little too salty. Tried the Reece's and banana shake, which was tasty and the highlight of the meal. The burgers were really disappointing - def prefer burgers priest or even south st to be honest Their fries are better than burgers priest though but that's not a good enough reason to come back. Id like to tell myself it was awesome before and has just gone down in quality... I doubt I'll come back."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't get it. There was just too much going on with the burger that I had trouble tasting the actual burger.  It was so juicy that someone could have swam in the drippings left on my tray. Some people may like that, I personally do not. I also found the bun too soft for my liking. A crustier bun would have made the whole burger better.   Oh and the burgers were expensive! I don't think I'd choose to come here."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers in the GTA. If you are a fan of the original, the staff here have found a way to replicate it and this goes beyond the burgers. The must-try on the menu is the Big Chuck, an homage to the Big Mac, with their own special sauce that is simply perfection. The fries can be a little on the salty side, which is the reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score. If you're looking to splurge, the milkshakes are a must especially the Madagascar Vanilla!"}
{"text":"I know this place is pretty hyped, and to be honest, I didn't have the burgers... so I assume that's their thing. Because veggie burgers are not. At. All.   We tried the shakes, and they are a decent use of your day's worth of calories, and the fries were okay. But the veggie burger was pretty flavourless, mostly just tasting of fried.   It was also pretty busy and the line takes a while, but the people there are really nice. I wouldn't at all recommend this place for vegetarians, but they have a huge following for the beef, and of course the obligatory eating challenges that can earn your photo on the wall :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers and amazing milkshakes! If you are trying to find the best burger in Toronto, you should make sure to have this place on your hit list!"}
{"text":"I am such a huge fan of lamb meat but that all depends on hows its cooked, seasoning and all. I have to say the best lamb burger Ive had! I got the Greek Bahahastard and it was delicious! I really like the fact that they asked you how you want it served because personally I prefer my burgers medium to medium rare. Not much a fan of their specialty fries tho, and quite expensive too. I wouldnt call it a cheap date."}
{"text":"Maybe the best  in town but when they decide to serve old fries and dont know how to cook a well done burger on a take out order for my little daughter they loose my loyalty."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had!  I had Cowlorie and it was just so yummy!  The fries was ok, not too crazy about the herbs that they put in it.  But beef pattie sooo nice and juicy.  Just wish they would expand the place in Yonge cos kinda small or have more branches in the GTA.   I would eat here again and would recommend the place."}
{"text":"Best burger I've tasted in the GTA. Freshly ground meat cooked to your preference is a must for a decent burger. Reminds me of a Shake Shack burger in NYC."}
{"text":"What can I say about Holy Chuck? What can't I say?  Never a bad experience here. Some say the burgers are too greasy but you won't hear that coming from me. The Greek fries are out of this world. Side note: I am now craving these thanks to typing this review. The milkshakes are too. My only caveat is that in the battle of the burgers, The Burger's Priest reigns supreme."}
{"text":"Been craving for a burger fixing for some time now and decided to have a risk taken here if all the burger places in the city. Stopped by here for a lunch. Place is small and spacious. Staff appeared to be friendly and patient with great knowledge behind the wide variety of options. I personally ordered the cowlorie with fries and a Reese banana milk shake.  Burger took a bit longer than I expected but it was made fresh. Burger was soft and melted as my teeth sank in. Fries were well seasoned and the milk shake was just heaven. All in all a great experience! Highly recommended if you're looking for some down right flavourful greasy burger!"}
{"text":"Sadnon P is either married to the owner, is the owner, or was snorting bath salts before writing there review!!  Dangerous Dans shouldn't even be mentioned in same breath as this crappy burger joint!! Five Guys is little over priced but even thats better then this garbage. If all crappy reviews make you think this place sucks.......it does!!  Over priced greasy burgers on a McDonalds quility bun for $10-20 just for the burger is ridiculess. The staff is to busy shooting the /@&# with each other to take your order or get your order out in decent amount time. This place is just all around bad, & that's why it's getting all around bad reviews. Hate to see people work hard for there money & piss it away on crap, because of some bs it's so great review. So had to join all the others had bad experience here & write a review telling the truth. Stay away, save your money. Go to McDonalds next door, you'll come away just as disappointed as if you went to holy chucks but least it'll only cost you $3.99 for disappointing meal not 20-25 bucks!!"}
{"text":"In November 2011, I checked out Holy Chuck which had just opened in the 'hood where I work.  I didn't have a great experience.  In January 2013, \"Anonymous\" left a couple comments on my blog post (1) ranting about how Holy Chuck makes the best burgers and (2) calling me a \"dumbass\".  Time to go back and check it out again ... maybe I had a bad meal.  I was in the office today (a rare occurrence lately) so had lunch at Holy Chuck.  Johnny was at the cash and was very friendly.  While I was eating, he checked on me (and others) a few times to make sure everything was okay.  Excellent customer service!  I ordered a single burger (with mustard, ketchup, pickles and tomatoes), fries and a Coke Zero ($11.29).  The burger and fries were okay, not great.  The burger was a bit bland and greasy.  It was smaller than burgers at other places but you are paying for quality not quantity.  I've had worse burgers, I've had better burgers.  There were lots of fries (too many to eat) and they had a different taste .. almost lemony?  So I gave it another try and wasn't sold on rushing back."}
{"text":"Great burgers, cooked to order. The fries can be shared amongst 2-3 people. The milkshakes are delicious. The first time there order their signature burger the holy Chuck."}
{"text":"A little expensive for me, but amazing nonetheless! I had the Holy Chuck burger and it was perfection. I loved the meat, it was so JUICY! I even liked the bacon and I'm not a major bacon fan. The place gets busy, so it's gotta be good. I didn't notice that much of a wait because I was chatting with friends. My two favourite kinds of fries: the big mac fries (droooool) and the fries with truffle oil mayo (WOW) Honourable mention goes to the poutine as well. I can't wait to try a shake here.  They have some pretty nifty flavours and I've heard they're pretty good. On to dessert. (I'm usually a dessert fanatic but the burger stole the show here. It was fantastic.) The funnel cake was pretty good. Okay, it was quite good. I couldn't stop stuffing my face with it. Nutella was flyin' everywhere and I loved the strawberries, they suited it well. I'm mighty happy to have another great burger place close by. :)"}
{"text":"For today's review I went to Holy Chuck as per request from Jared, one of my followers. I've been to Holy Chuck many times before and tried a variety of their burgers. Today I returned to review them and as is customary, I had my review standard burger.  There are two locations for Holy Chuck as I write this. I ventured out to the closer one, in Woodbridge, which has overnight become a gourmet burger hub for those in the know. Walking in today I was greeted with a line up that extended through the rather large seating area and almost to the door. I had to wait about 15 to 20 minutes before I could even order. This gave me plenty of time to look over the very, very large menu.  Now Holy Chuck has deserts and drinks and shakes and a variety of fry options but what makes the menu ever so large is the burger options. There are 30 burgers on the menu, made with beef or lamb or bacon (yes, bacon patties) or a veggie option or two. Here are two of the 30 burgers:  The Farmers Threesome: One beef patty, one lamb patty, one bacon patty, triple cheese, bacon, caramelized onions The Go Chuck Yourself: Six beef patties, six cheese, three bacon, caramelized onions and stacked between three grilled cheese  sandwiches I could go on for ever with the options they have but I'll skip to my ordering and eating.  When my time finally came to order I ordered a double hamburger with pickles, tomato, onion and lettuce, fries for a side and a coke (fountain pop that I choose myself), and of course well done. It took 20 minutes to order and only about five minutes for them to make my meal, pretty quick. It also only cost $13.50 (rounded), pretty cheap.  When I got my meal I sat down and dug into the fresh cut shoestring fries which were delicious. Not to small, very thin and full of a robust and delicious fry flavour. I poured ketchup over them and used a fork rather than dipping them. Then it was almost time to devour the burger.  First I took a look at the burger. Two pickles, one slice of tomato, thinly sliced red onion rings and a folded large piece of leaf lettuce that I think was romaine (I know it wasn't iceberg) but there was no ketchup or mustard. I walked back to the counter, got some mustard and loaded both sides of the buns (which I ordered butterless) with both the ketchup that was on the table and the mustard. Then I bit into it.  And as per usual for Holy Chuck the burger was delicious to the nth degree. Full of juice and flavour and the texture was just perfect. It did taste very much like the burger at Fresh Burger but it was smaller. It melted in my mouth and all I can say is that these beef patties are beef burger heaven. They are quite literally orgasmic, not dry at all, filled with flavour and just outright perfect.  But, with that said, the burger I ate as a whole was not quite perfect. Why not? Well first, the pickles were to overpowering for the burger. They were good, but overpowering, one would of been enough. The tomato was a good size but very thin and I didn't even notice it was there. And the bun was a white bread bun that was tasty but when I was done I had a fair amount of bun left and no beef left, which is a big beef of mine (pun intended). The patties could of been bigger or the bun smaller, although this could be due to ordering my burger well done. It's no Five Guys bun but it did the trick and held together very nicely.  When it came to the lettuce it worked nicely on the bun and the onions were plenty and yummy and just the right amount. This was one hell of a good burger and I would return over and over again, which I have, to eat here again and again. The burger I ate I would give a 6 out of 7 due to the pickle and beef to bun ratio but with that said, and I don't usually do this but I will here, I think the quality of the beef and the variety of toppings for the specialty burgers bumps the burger up a notch. They have so many varieties and tastes and options that the almost perfect basic burger can only get better.  Next time I go I will order a specialty burger. I really wanted, this time, to get The Raging Bull burger. When I return I can almost guarantee that is what I will do. What a place; it kind of took The Burger's Priest model and went wild with it and it works. Highly highly recommended. And if you go and do The Holy Ghost challenge please tell me how it is.  Out of 7 Holy Chuck scores 7"}
{"text":"I had the Signature Holy Chuck Burger. It's a double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions. ¬†They ask that you don't add any extra toppings so I didn't and let me say you don't need to. It tasted great just the way it is!They fresh grind their chuck hourly and nothing is frozen. They ask you how you would like your burger cooked. I like mine medium well. Let me warn you the first bite will be a juicy one. Please make sure you have plenty on napkins on hand.The burger meat is very tender, pretty much melt in your mouth. I usually have mixed feelings about bacon on my burger because most times it's either way to crispy or very fatty and soggy. The bacon here was perfect, it had a bit of chew but not overly crisp. The caramelized onions knock his burger out of the park! Holy Chuck is right on with this flavour combination. The bun was very soft. If I had a small complaint it would only be that the bun was too soft. Dont get me wrong I loved every bite.I decided to add on the fries and drink and make it a combo. All I can say is it came with a huge amount of fries. It's more than enough for two. The fries were fresh cut salted and an added touch had parsley sprinkled on top. They were fried to golden perfection. Just be warned there is a lot!They had the Coca-Cola Freestyle which is always nice because you can pick whatever drink you want. I think there must be more than 100 different drinks available."}
{"text":"Good, but not fantastic.  I had the Cowlorie (with grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns).  Obviously I wanted it to be cheesy or I wouldn't have selected this option, but the plastic-like taste of the cheese didn't do it for me.  They also didn't ask what other toppings we wanted on the burger, which was weird, and we had to go back and ask for lettuce, etc.  We ordered the burgers medium, but they were more like well done.  Burger's Priest has a similar burger with grilled cheese buns (on the secret menu) that is far superior.  Also, I didn't really like the rosemary seasoning on the fires.  However, on the positive side, they do freshly grind the meat and they have a huge and creative menu."}
{"text":"Welcome to good burger home of the good burger. Wait this is \"good\"? yea okay this was HORRIABLE. Everything down to the milkshake is disgustingly processed. Had an onion burger and the shake. ($15). Not at all worth its price. Let me rephrase I had an onion burger with beef. The thing was disgusting and gave the craps. Will not return ever!"}
{"text":"Holy Chuck would have received a full 5 star rating if I had visited this joint 2 years ago. Now with all these burger eateries surfacing in Toronto, the bar has been set high for quality & creativity. Still, Holy Chuck deserves to be in the top 10 of best burgers in the city and here's why:  1. Burger quality & flavor: They hand roll and grind their patties every hour, made of aged high quality steak, which is why they are able to make the burgers \"medium\". I ordered the Grind n' Shine - a double cheeseburger with bacon, caramelized onions, potato chips, topped with a fried egg. For $10.99 I was surprised when they called my name and I picked up a more mini version of what I expected. Still, once I took my first few bites, I was addicted. I couldn't put the burger down! The bacon was crispy, the chips added a crunch factor and the egg was cooked perfectly, oozing down my greasy hands while I savored every bite. Is it too much to consider this a breakfast option, since it includes bacon and eggs?!   2. Creativity & menu options: Quebec Foie Gras, French Truffle Oil, Garlic feta aioli & French fries (to name a few) as burger toppings?! Need I say more? There is something for everyone. Yes, even vegetarians. As a beef lover myself, even the \"Animal Feed\" veggie option seemed enticing.   3. Seating area. This is solely based on my comparison to my recent visit to the Burger's Priest just North of this joint. I was content to have a much more spacious seating area here to enjoy my burger (and take photos of course). Being able to sit comfortably allowed me to truly bask in the joy of devouring my burger.   4. The milkshakes!!!! I was already bursting at the seams (good thing I wore stretchy pants) but after assessing all the reviews on Yelp about the milkshakes, I just had to try one for good measure. And you yelpers came through!! The Nutella & Salted Caramel milkshake was divine. Just when I thought I couldn't fit any more in my stomach, this chocolaty goodness is something I will definitely come back frequently for. Worth the $6.20? Definitely."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but definitely worth the buck.  Over the years, the quest for good handcrafted burger took me from apache, Hero burger and Five guys to big smoke, Burgers Priest to Toma, woody's and royal meats.  I have to say Holy Chuck is in top 3 in T.O.  All beef patties have the perfect balance of texture and softness and the flavour of the beef oozes out with each bite.  Buns are brioche-like and has sweetness to complement the meaty flavour.  I also noticed the kitchen staff maintain a standard of quality and consistency - I haven't been disappointed in 3 visits so far.  Try big chuck or the raging bull.  They really need to do something about the names of some burgers (\"depressed cow\", \"fat pig\"....just don't tickle my fancy or the appetite) Their fries are not bad but nothing to write home about.  The $7 shakes are amazing but just don't get one with the burger and fries together in the same meal, unless you are trying to become a sumo wrestler."}
{"text":"Personally the best burger I've eaten in Toronto so far and also the huge variety of poutines, I'm so lucky so live close to this place."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday around dinner time- so it was fairly busy.  However, assuming that it was fast food I didn't expect it to take as long as it did.   With the time it took standing in line (3rd to order), giving my order and waiting for it- I was there for just over 30 minutes for 2 Holy Chuck combos.   The most aggravating part of the experience was that the kitchen staff took their time making the orders and orders were sitting either in the kitchen or in the window for pickup for minutes before a name was called out or passed onto the next stage of prep.  They hardly seemed to be enjoying their jobs, didn't engage with each other or any of the other staff, certainly not the customers, and showed their frustration if orders had special requests or needed clarification.  The burgers are small- just like Burger's Priest.  The underside of the bun had that same white circle donned on McDonald's cheeseburger buns- so imagine that size bun with 2 thick patties- the result- a gooey mess of disproportionate meat and bun.  The fries were perfect- fresh cut shoestring fries, seasoned with salt and fresh chopped parsley.   Notably, I was disappointed with my experience especially considering the $35 price tag for 2 burger combos that didn't satisfy; so I emailed them at the website listed on their website.  I was glad to get a quick reply from the restaurant owner/founder/chef to be able to speak to him about my experience."}
{"text":"So this is the second time to Holy Chuck and it does NOT disappoint. My tip: ask what's not on the menu.   Johnny was nice enough to tip me off about the Big Chuck which is their version of a Big Mac. Basically, my cholesterol is going to Hades with no stop in Purgatory.  If you want a #foodgasm moment, I highly recommend.  If you like spice, I would recommend their chipotle burger (also not on the menu). My colleague had this and he was SWEATING from the spice!   This time I had the fries and they did not disappoint. I liked the flavouring of the spices and the addition of the parsley.   So yes, Win Win. You'll probably see about 10 more reviews from me on Holy Chuck in the next three months and what I try next."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly, took the time to explain what we were ordering, and came by while we were eating to make sure everything was to our liking.   We came here as part of the Yelp Burger Binge week and had the $5 special, which was the Misunderstood Fat Pig. A bacon patty, a beef patty with bacon strips on top. The juices shot out when I took my first bite, it was delicious and full of fresh flavours. We shared a plate of fries and a Nutella milkshake after dinner. Everyone liked everything. Only thing I wish the beef patty was slightly bigger.   The pop machine was like none I have scene before, select Coke and it gives you other flavours options, such as vanilla or cherry Coke, I tried a grape Sprite which was pretty cool.   The atmosphere was spacious, airy and modern. The service was friendly and we were comfortable and didn't feel rushed placing our order. We'll be back here again and I'd recommend it to others as well."}
{"text":"executive summary: it depends what you're looking for. for many people's tastes, holy chuck rightly deserves to be called the best burger joint in toronto.  pros: if you're looking for substantial patties cooked on a flat top, this is the place for you. it's right up there with the legendary burger's priest in this regards. their other offerings - for example, their fries and their nutella lollipops - elevate it even above bp! you can see that the cooks in the back care a great deal about their offerings. the place is clean and spacious, though perhaps a bit plain.   cons: the \"problem\" for me is that i prefer a grilled burger. (i know many burger aficionados would say otherwise and that a flat top is the best way to retain fat and flavor. different strokes for different folks i guess.) also, the meat vs. bun/toppings ratio on \"the holy chuck\", their signature burger, is off for me. it's too meat-centric. i know that sounds like blasphemy, but eating a burger shouldn't be like eating a meatball."}
{"text":"Great burgers and arguably the best poutine in the city. A little on the pricey side for a burger joint as a Burger, Poutine and a drink can run you $20 bucks. Tons of options, crazy deserts and a decent amount of seating. The burgers are very comparable to burger priest, but there is significantly more seating, is not quite as busy and has a bigger menu."}
{"text":"Sorry but this place was really disappointing. They charge 18$ for a burger without even the fries, there is no lettuce or tomato and just a very small chunk of bacon and a very thin layer of cheese. I honestly thought at this price I'd get something a bit more remarkable, I guess the meat tastes good but overall it's pretty average."}
{"text":"Yup, pretty delish. I had the most basic burger I could order so that I could taste the basic ingredients. It was fluffy, buttery and smooshy. The fries were fancy with green flavour bits aka herb but naaaaaaaah, I didn't get it. I thought it was a touch expensive but I will probably try it again!"}
{"text":"I asked for medium cooked burgers and they were raw (not rare, raw) in the center.  For almost $12.00 a burger you should pay more attention to them."}
{"text":"Came to try this place out because I saw it's milkshakes had a good review from blogto. My meal: 1) Grind and Shine: DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER WITH BACON, CARAMELIZED ONIONS, TOPPED WITH CRISPY HOMEMADE POTATO CHIPS & A FRIED EGG  2) NUTELLA & PEANUT BUTTER MILKSHAKE  Cons:  1) the burger was so greasy that there was a pool of grease at the bottom after I finished it. (Not sure if yelp would allow a picture of oil/grease on it) 2) The taste felt weird. I bite into a burger I get that burger taste. Not over here. Maybe coz it was so rich and greasy it tasted weird. 3) Milkshake.The Milkshake was actually GOOD. However i did not expect it to come in a plastic cup (like those you find in bubble teas or starbucks). I actually thought it would come in a glass...like how I'v had all my milkshakes. 4) Price: the total cost of these two alone I could probably eat a steak dinner at moxies. To make it a combo, you add any fries and milkshake and save 85cents...OR a regular fries and drink is another 6$.   As the rating states: Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"The Misunderstood fat pig burger didn't hold up during the 12 minute drive home.  The bun was super soggy from soaking up all the greases, but who needs a bun anyway. The burger was yummy.   The onion rings were delicious, I wish there were more... I'd suggest eating in for the best experience."}
{"text":"I had been eagerly waiting for Holy Chuck to open at Yonge and Wellesley, and when they finally did, I couldn't wait to order a milkshake and rather than get a burger, I decided to try their Holy Chuck Fries. Well, the milkshake was as amazing as I remember them being. The fries however were nasty! I know, that is some extreme and mean language, but wow, the sauce in the chilli was all vinegar. And because the sauce coated pretty much every fry, I ended up throwing the whole dish out after three bites - three bites was all I could muster. I am still in shock by how awful that dish was."}
{"text":"Love it! A little in the pricier side burger-wise, but damn it's good. I got the Village Bahahastard burger with lamb patties and Kefalotiri cheese and it was great. The big chuck fries with special sauce, lettuce and pickles were really good as well."}
{"text":"Holy Yum. So I came here to try out this place with some other Yelpers and instead of trying a meaty burger, I tried the Animal Feed which was a panko-crusted portobello mushroom stuffed with feta and cream cheese and fried. I liked it - it was pretty tasty and I didn't have to wait super long for it either. If i had to make a complaint, it was the crappy bun. I would expect a better quality bun for this type of place. I might try a burger between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches next time I come here instead. I did like that you could choose how your burger was cooked.  We ordered pretty much every type of fries on the menu, and the standouts for me were the Feta Fries (fries with feta cheese and greek dressing) and the regular poutine. The fries with the truffle oil were indulgent and delicious as well. Onion rings were standard but nice and crispy the way they should be.  For dessert we had the fois gras pancakes. Geeez were they amazing. At $34.99 a pop they'd better be...but they did not disappoint. When they brought out the funnel cake (topped with strawberries, nutella and ice cream) I mentioned that it smelled like Canada's Wonderland...the owner said \"This is way better than Wonderland\" and I have to admit...in my head I said \"Yeah, sure\" but once I tasted it...HE WAS RIGHT! Delicious.  There is so much I want to go back and try. I'll have to save up a bit first though... ;-)"}
{"text":"BEST BEST BEST burger joint in the city - and I have tried all of Toronto's top burger places as per blogto, Toronto.com, Toronto life and more - I don't joke about burgers haha - the cowlorie is my favourite but they also have the fat pig which is 100% bacon and delicious as well as Lamb options!"}
{"text":"I had heard this place was better than Burgers Priest - I guess it is a matter of preference but in my opinion they are not even in the same league.  Dry tasteless meat at Holy Chuck and their Big Chuck was bland compared to the High Priest.  They also don't seem to be able to handle a rush.  I have been to many locations of Burgers Priest when the place was packed and still got my food within 15 minutes.  Holy Chuck took 45 minutes and had no place for all the people waiting for their orders, let alone a table to sit at.  Maybe they had an off day but I won't be giving them another chance.    If I am craving a Big Mac, and can't get up Burgers Priest, I would rather just get the original at McDobalds than go to Holy Chuck and that is saying a lot.  Buh-bye!"}
{"text":"SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love the burgers at the Yonge & St. Clair location. I work near the Yonge & Wellesley location to decided to try their Holy Chuck yesterday for lunch. I tried it with a gluten free burger. First, the burger seemed a bit smaller than the one I get at the St. Clair location. Second, I had to add salt to make it taste better. I love the salty greasiness of their original location. I know some don't. I guess to each his/her own. Overall I was not impressed. I really hope the quality is still the same at the St. Clair location. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Truthfully, I dont think this burger is anywhere close to Burger priests burger.   I'm not sure if its just me but I recall it being more expensive than Burger Priests.   I think if you come here, you want more of the freaky weird burgers that you see on TV,  The service was kind of shitty. Seemed like people didnt want to work there. The place was pretty big overall."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced considering its small portion. Got the Holy Chuck burger and Cowlorie burger. Both burgers were dripping in oil and soaked through the bun. Service was okay."}
{"text":"They've changed their menu a bit since the last time I was here. Luckily you can customize each burger to what you want. Though the sweet potato chips are gone. :( Anyway, before we used to always ask for our burger well done & they would never do it. This time they did. Sorry, I'm not a fan of semi-raw meat. I have the Village Bahabastard Lamb Burger & Hubby had the Big Smoke. It was all delicious. It started to get super busy as we were finishing our food so we hightailed it outta there as it's a small space."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Value: 3/5 Mouth feel: 2.5/5  Don't go out of your way to eat here, but if you're in the area it's a solid place to get a mouthful of warm, moist, salty meat.   Holy Chuck is part of an emerging trend of premium burger joints and competes against the likes of The Burgers Priest, P&L Burgers, The Burger Shack, and many others. I think they land somewhere in the middle of the pack.  My experience was pretty average, though not bad by any standard. I ordered The Holy Chuck, their signature double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions. I made the rookie mistake of asking for my burger medium rare (Burgers are usually at their best a little firmer at medium well), so it was incredibly soft throughout. I like a little crunch factor, which I expected the bacon to provide. I couldn't distinguish between the burger, the bacon, the bun, and the cheese. Dare I say the burger was almost too juicy? If I were determined enough I probably could have sucked this burger through a straw.   They are known for their shakes more than their Burgers apparently, but I didn't try one because it would have been too expensive. The Burger and a bottle of water alone cost me $14. For a burger as fresh as this, the price makes sense but it's a bit too steep to consider adding on fries and other extras.   I also think they'd benefit from a smaller menu.   Overall, not the worst mouthful of meat I've ever tasted but I wouldn't consider it a must-try. I much prefer the Priest's meat."}
{"text":"Alright,  Holy Chuck, I apologize but you are getting my first single star rating.  Here is why:  1) First, the star is for the cashier and the energy of the cooks along with the waitress who was the only one cleaning tables on a Friday night.   2) the part where you dont get stars... your burgers are ridicoulous salty. As I was waiting for my burger (which I don't mind doing if its busy... cause well... its busy) Buddy on the grill took the shaker and put two shakes of what I imagined was salt on each patty that is grilled med-rare. The poutine... was well... too salty and your fries are by far.... eugh. Salt on fries...cheese curds (that are salty...duh) and gravy sprinkled with more salt and green onion. Too damn salty guys...   3) grinding already grounded meat... huh?  4) portion for signiture... tiny. Plus I have to buy fries and a drink?!?!? Whoa... not worth it. I shared my poutine and purchased a sig. Burger for 17.65?!? I mean if it was really the best burger in T.O I wouldnt mind but dude... not the best... not even close.  There are better places to get a burger than this place... with less salt or none."}
{"text":"Fries aren't very good.  I had the grazer and it's not the best burger ever, but the texture of the panko mushroom patty is very good, very crispy!   over all just mehh."}
{"text":"There is moist, David Usher moist, and then there's wet.  This was wet.  Eighteen dollars wet."}
{"text":"I came here because I was told by a friend that it was the best burger of life. Bold  statement I know. So I just had to investigate. My boyfriend and I got the two most popular burgers according to the guy behind the cash register. The patties itself are good. We got the Holy Chuck (double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions) and the Big Chuck (two all beef patties, \"special sauce\",  lettuce cheese, onions and pickles). The Holy Chuck was nothing special. The Big Chuck tasted to me like a homemade version of a big mac from McDonald's. Oh! Big Mac ...Big Chuck I get it now. Makes sense! We also shared the Holy Chuck fries . It wasn't great. There was bacon and cheese with spicy chili. There wasn't a lot of cheese and their chili tasted like bbq sauce. I took a bite of my brothers Grind N Shine burger. It was very good! It's a double cheeseburger with bacon, caramelized onions, crispy homemade potato chips and a fried egg). If i ever come back I think I would try a more fancy burger with toppings you wouldn't normally see. The holy and big Chuck didn't really do it for me."}
{"text":"I was in Midtown with family who were visiting from the States, and they were looking for a quick bite to eat.  I knew that Holy Chuck was nearby and figured it would be a good fit for a family of ravenous carnivores.  We had ordered a few of McDonald's knockoff \"The Big Chuck\" as well as the \"Raging Bull\" and sides of fries.  The burgers were cooked to a medium and rammed with flavor.  The patties themselves were formed well with the exception of one of the Big Chuck's which felt the need to lose most of its structural integrity.  The fries and onion rings were done quite well.  I love when fries have a bit of skin on them as they add a nice texture.  The onion rings had a good level of crispiness to them; you could easily pierce the batter and also cut through the onion at the same time.  There's nothing worse than taking a bite of an onion ring and having a soggy ring of onion hanging from your mouth still connected to the severed end...much like a bird pulling a worm from the earth!  And on that note, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is Chucking Amazing!  I loved the Holy Chuck (Signature Burger).  They say on the menu not to add any toppings, but I added mustard, mayo, and ketchup (I'm a rebel like that).   It can be a little pricey, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The best burgers I've ever had  If you have money to spend, want a greasy full of flavor burger, milk shakes to die for... this is honestly the place. Whenever I go I always spent $25. A burger avg is about 12.99 a special fry platter 5.99 and a milkshake and drink.   I tend to experience the whole experience at this place because I go here once in every couple of months but when I do I go all out.   You can see the staff always hard at work. They communicate with each other and they cook the burgers to perfection!! 5/5"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Maybe I'm alone on this but I would personally say it's better than burger priest. It's just mouth watering good.  I've had a bunch of their burgers and my favorites would be either the Croissant du paysan or the Cowlerie. The signature burger is also amazing. I even tried the uber expensive Holy Duck with fois gras and truffles  and while not something one could order every time, I don't at all regret ordering it. I would love to try the Go Chuck Yourself challenge, but I don't because I feel their burgers are so good, having only 6 minutes to eat it is sacrilege.  Sometimes I travel all the way up to Yonge and St. Clair just to indulge."}
{"text":"It had been quite a while since I last tried Holy Chuck, so I was excited to give another go at their hearty burgers.   BURGER: Having been reasonably impressed with their basic \"Holy Chuck\" burger previously, I expected big things from their \"Cowlorie\" (a double cheeseburger with bacon, onions, sandwiched between two grilled cheeses). Though greasier than I typically like, the beef was fresh and highlighted quite well by the bacon and cheese - they certainly didn't skimp on the cheese here.  FRIES: The \"Raging Bull Fries\" on the other hand, did not complement the burger as well as I had hoped. These fries would be a good example that more isn't always better. The gravy seemed excessive to me, and its odd taste really detracted from the other ingredients of the dish. Consequently, my friend and I actually ended up eating only half the dish.  MILKSHAKE: With an impressive array of specialty shakes available (18 options!), I ended up going with the Nutella and Peanut Butter. The shake was thick and flavorful as I hoped, and reasonable in size.   The burger is a bit pricey given how much you get, though the fries/shake were reasonably priced. Holy Chuck is not a \"must try,\" but will definitely be on my list of burger places to head to when I have that craving."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in my opinion which I would consider myself to be a burger maniac lol. I know all of the good spots most being downtown but they are still not at par with this place. Get the big chuck if your a fan of Big Macs this is there version of it."}
{"text":"I usually go to burger priest & wanting to try it chuck after seeing positive reviews. I was upset. Their milk shake was THE BEST chocolate btw. But, I didn't like the burgers. I didn't like the fact how it was already built in for you. I like lettuce and all the veggies. I ordered a spicy burger- RANGING BULL. They didn't ask me if I still wanted the bacon. I don't eat bacon. And I was not able to put any veggies on to it. But service was excellent. The cooks and order taker were always asking if the food was good. The fries are meh.. nothing big."}
{"text":"great selection of burgers and sides , fresh meat great tasting except for the feta fries I ordered I personally didnt like , deserts are good I tried the deep fried nutela :-)"}
{"text":"I went here with my coworkers one day and I ordered the double cheeseburger. The order took a while to make since there was a line ahead of us. The toppings were fresh and the patty was hot and juicy. This place has been on my list of places that I wanted to try and I am glad I got the chance to do so. Service was standard and the restaurant was relatively clean."}
{"text":"Holy Chuck is an interesting burger operation on Yonge St. just south of St. Clair. There's lots of room for solo diners and groups to chow down on their choice of burger, fries, milkshakes, and other desserts. The Big Chuck is their take on a Big Mac and it's a decent attempt. I'm curious to try other some of their other offerings.  It's a bit pricier here than at other burger joints in the city, but they make some pretty good milkshakes and I'll definitely be back for another one soon. The first burger I tried was a bit messy, with the patties and toppings starting to fall apart as I ate it. It was just a tad undercooked, but still tasted fairly good. They're just a shade under 4 stars, but the service is good and they seem to make the food pretty fast. Hungry folks can get their fill here, in any case. It's a clean shop with a flat screen TV in case you plan on hanging out for a bit."}
{"text":"Tried it during the yelp burger binge.  Note the burger they were offering was the Misunderstood Breed not the Misunderstood Fat Pig.  Burger was a bit greasy.  But what do u expect when 1 of the patties is a bacon patty.  All in all, a tasty burger that is better than any of the chains out there.    They make things interesting by having an open burger eating challenge.  Tempted to try the challenge as well as the milk shakes next time."}
{"text":"It's all about the patty at Holy Chuck. It's very fresh, juicy, and flavorful. The patty almost looks uncooked. If you are not a fan of rare beef have them cook it longer."}
{"text":"Great tasting, fresh and real burgers. Certainly better than the fake, inert Hero burgers. Only criticism is their burgers are very wet, often dissolve-the-bun wet. But everything tastes fresh and amazing. Their milkshakes are real and freaking delicious too."}
{"text":"These burgers are chucking good!  I'll admit that I was rubbed the wrong way a little at first exposure to these guys. When they first opened there was a ton of biased (now filtered) reviews popping up and my first attempt to actually visit them a few months ago was a bomb as they're closed on Sundays and there are no hours posted on the door. I've now posted the hours on Yelp so hopefully no one else will make the same mistake, you're welcome.  I had been to Retro Burger once before which was in this location and it was alright. I'm not sure if it's still the same owners but all that's been done since Retro's brief existence is a splash of new paint and a new menu.   So here's what you should expect coming here: A big juicy, slightly greasy burger at a premium price. Don't come here looking for a veggie burger. Don't come here looking for a cheap meal. DO HOWEVER come here for a great burger. They grind their meat in-house and you can tell.  Being my first visit I went with their signature, The Holy Chuck ($9.99). It's a very simple sandwich consisting of two patties, cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions. Even on the menu they ask you not to add any condiments to it, and why would you? It's perfect just the way it is.   My only issue with the burger, and what stopped this from being a 5-star review, is that one of the patties was not cooked. It was medium-rare. While normally I would have taken the burger back I didn't fret since they grind their own chuck. A week later I'm still a healthy young man. I should also note that I actually do enjoy a burger cooked to medium-rare or medium when I have the option to do so.  I want to come back and try the \"Go Chuck Yourself Challenge\". It's a burger of 6 patties, cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions, stacked between 3 grilled cheese sandwiches. You have 6 minutes to eat the burger and drink a shake. Recently I completed Super Monster challenge at Freebirds so I think I'm up for this one. Though the 6 minute time limit does scare me a little."}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious! I always get the one that is similar to a big mac. I forget what it's called but I devoured one yesterday and it was glorious."}
{"text":"Foie Gras Pancake ($34.99) maybe the only thing I remembered eating at Holy Chuck.   8 buttermilk pancakes, foie gras, fresh Italian white truffles, pure maple syrup, truffle oil, whipped cream and a wild blueberry compote  Yes it is \"To Die For!\" Fluffy, Sweet, Savory, Smooth............and the smell....  Is it suppose to be dessert? breakfast? but I can eat that any time of the day with someone, or a group of us?!   For the burger, My Holy Chuck Burger ($9.99) is A-OK . I like how it was cooked medium and still juicy. I love caramelized onion and since it is double cheeseburger, it was filling enough for me as I need to save room for dessert.  A mega sized Funnel Cake with Nutella and Strawberry topping and of course Foie Gras Pancake!  Seriously, I think I might just PASS all the burgers and fries and go right to dessert!  Holy Chuck, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm picky with burgers. But this place amazed me. Their signature burger is simply cheese, bacon and caramelized onions. I ordered medium and it came perfect, red in the middle. The meat is fresh, juicy and flavorful. The cheese was melted, the bacon was crispy and the onions were perfect! I got a side of fries which were a little oily but the juicy of my burger made them tastier. Everything was delicious and I'll definitely go back.  It's pricey for a burger joint but worth the quality and satisfaction!"}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype about this place, maybe super greasy burgers are just not my thing. I think I just ordered the Jr. Cheeseburger, it was like the simplest, smallest, least intimidating thing on the menu, so I figured I would get to enjoy the taste of the high quality, organic beef without the distraction of all the fancy fixings. The beef was super thick and juicy, it's true, but honestly it was like eating 50% beef and 50% oil... hands down greasiest burger I have ever had. By the time I got to the last few bites, my burger was just this squished, compact, solid chunk of beef and bread with grease oozing out of it. I might give this place another try in the future just because some of the other burgers sound really interesting and I am intrigued (foie gras burger... at a hefty $30) but honestly, unless you're planning to order one of their more unique menu items, I wouldn't come into this place with super high expectations; in their purest form their burgers are nothing worth raving about and you might just be let down."}
{"text":"Although small in space, it makes up for it with it's massive menu and large portions. Anyone with an appetite for some serious food should try this. Their dessert menu alone will make you drool, with Nutella Pops, Fried Twinkie's and other treats. I have tried every Hamburger on the menu and I can easily say this is the best Hamburger joint that I have ever been to, and I have been to a lot.  5 burps out of 5"}
{"text":"Fries were very flavourful, absolutely loved it! I ordered the vegan burger and the patty fell apart after first bite and was probably the most nasty burger i've ever tried, didn't have any flavour, would not recommend it and it cost me over 20 bucks in total, overpriced and totally not worth it! TBH, would rather go to el furniture for the burgers, way much cheaper and tastier!  overall, disappointed!"}
{"text":"Holy Chucks is my fave burger place out of all of the gourmet burger joints in Toronto.   We usually frequent the Woodbridge location,  but we were in the 416 area so we headed to the Yonge and St Clair location.   This location is smaller but on the ttc subway line. Be aware there is no parking on Yonge by this area. There is Green P street parking on St. Clair.  The washrooms (well the women's one)  were clean.   We combo our orders but the cashier told us they were out of fountain pop.  They must be busy. Their turnover is about 20-30 minutes on average.   I got my burger the frustrated cow ($11.99) and was surprised that I got a fully loaded burger with a lot of topping (portabello mushrooms,  blue cheese and onions).  I usually get 1/4 of that at the Woodbridge location.    My boyfriend got the Cowlowerie,  (a slutty burger that has grilled cheese as the 'bun' $14.99) and said it was best one he ever had (as he usually frequents the Woodbridge location as well).   All in all Holy Chucks is on the expensive side (to your wallet and your waistline)  but has the best menu of burger and topping combos because of the variety.  Though this location is slightly out of the way we would come here again because the quality is great.   Though we love their burgers we only go every few months because of the carb coma that ensues shortly after. The guilt you feel after is worth this burger menu has been throughly thought through which is why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing great reviews on Yelp. I really love foie gras so I decided to shell out the $30+tax to try their Holy Duck burger. Without the combo, it came with a handful of fries but nothing else. The burger was a beef patty with a strip of bacon, shaved truffles and maple syrup sauce, with a piece of foie gras on top. Overall it was a good tasting burger, the foie gras and truffle flavours really enhanced the taste but I don't think I would pay the price to eat it again. The maple syrup also mixed with the oil and it was dripping down - a little too oily for my taste."}
{"text":"Over the past few years, there has been an abundance of gourmet burger joints opening up in Toronto. One of the burger joints that made an impact since they opened up in late 2011 was Holy Chuck. My friends and I were greeted with a large wall-mounted menu with an extensive list of burgers with pretty novelty names at the front. The order system is pretty straightforward, you order at the cashier, and they'll call your name once your order is ready.  I opted for their signature burger called The Holy Chuck, and they do not allow any additional toppings on this particular one. I am not sure how stringent they are with this policy as I didn't bother to ask for any toppings. I also got to try out the You Fat Pig as well, so it was nice to taste test two different ones. All of their burger meats are ground in-house so it's fresh daily, which is great. There are no additional fillers in their burgers and they guaranteed that their meats are \"the absolute highest quality\". While eating the burgers, I could definitely taste that the meat was freshly made and it was juicy. However, I found the You Fat Pig to be slightly too salty for my taste buds. Salty enough that I needed to order a milkshake to go with my meal which I will get to later. Usually, I am not a fan of onions on my burgers, but the caramelized onions here enhanced the flavors a lot, and I really enjoyed it.  Holy Chuck's fries are hand cut in-house daily and they use only trans fat free oil. The fries are crispy without being overly oily and had a decent amount of salt on them. Now onto the milkshake that J and I got to share since it was a pretty good size for the both of us. Some of the flavors of the specialty shakes stood out to me, but I decided to play safe, and got their strawberry cheesecake. Imagine my surprise when actual chunks of strawberry cheesecake came through the straw. The milkshake was creamy and thick, and wasn't overly sweet. This particular shake is probably one of the best milkshakes that I have had in a while now, so I highly recommend it.  Their burger prices can be a little steep as I saw one for $29.99 but it was topped with seared Quebec foie gras. However, most individual burgers are priced between $9.99 to $14.99. If you add any fries and drink to your burger order, you'd save 85 cents. It may costs you about $15-$20 for a combo, but Holy Chuck has established themselves as a gourmet burger establishment from the beginning so the higher prices are expected."}
{"text":"The first few times I went, the burgers were the best!  Last time though... very disappointing.  Soggy bun.  Extremely soggy when I picked it ftom the counter.  I told them there is no way I am eating that.  They just laughed.  I asked to make another.  No.  That's what you get.  Really?  $14 for something soaked in burger grease... damn!  No.  The girl that's working there all the time pretended she was \"busy\"  I asked if she was making me another burger.  She told me no.  The buns in the corner.... for me to get a bun out of the bag... that was the last straw!  NEVER SEE ME AGAIN BUTTHEADS"}
{"text":"If you can get past the long line, no combo option and expensive bill - this place is great.  Lunch time is busy with the line usually up to the door.   The burgers aren't expensive themselves for what you get, but $2.50 for a pop and $2.50 for fries turns a $9.99 burger into a \"what's my total??\" .. $16.99 that is.  I enjoyed the holy chuck burger, ALOT. I asked for it to be cooked medium well which they did perfectly.   All in all this place is a little pricey but the burgers are worth it. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The burgers aren't as big as the photos or price will lead you to believe. Expect to spend a lot on an empty stomach! Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"One star for the cool chairs and stools! Other than that this place does not deserve any rating at all! The food is ridiculously over priced for the quality they're serving their customers.  GREASY BURGERS! The burger dripped grease all over my hands and soaked the bun and was all over the paper it was served in. The burgers had no taste at all. The fries were cold and had weird green stuff sprinkled in the mix and had no flavour!   Will not go back."}
{"text":"We went down on a Friday night in December and after waiting in line for over 15 minutes just to order, decided to leave instead (that, plus that there was no seating in the restaurant) The menu is vast...some very interesting combos.......and we would have loved to try them....but after reading some of the reviews here prior to going and hearing of the wait times for the burgers to come out.....then it taking 15 minutes and still not be at the counter (to order), decided to bail. To be fair...it could have been that it was THE Friday night before Christmas......I'll go back mid week to check it out."}
{"text":"This burger joint is pretty good in Toronto, I am still searching for the best place for burgers. A lot of people say burger priest, and that isn't it. Overall, the burgers here was pretty good.  I forgot what I have ordered, but it looked like a big mac and it was pretty good, especially the fries on the side. One of the juiciest burger I had ever eaten. Maybe I can order this and add my own Big Mac Sauce in, maybe that will taste perfect. They also have this challenge \"Go Chuck Yourself\", I heard a lot about it and I really want to try it once in the future. Overall, this joint is pretty good, and is recommended to many people.  Service: 3/5 Food: 3.5/5 Environment: 3/5  Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"Mediocre, greasy, undercooked product, hamburger should never be served rare...equally,four people should be able to get burgers for under $80...does not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Went back for a quick bite, decided on the Grind N' Shine burger which is a double burger with fried onions, chips and an egg (I was curious to see how the egg would taste on a burger). Was offered to have the meat cooked well done or medium, I opted for the medium.   The burger was tasty and juicy, soggy towards the end....these burgers are not for those interested in eating lean. The egg on the burger was a nice change as the yolk coated the meat and added an extra flavor I usually don't have, it was worth a try but probably not something I'd have on a regular basis as I like that meat flavor on its own. Had some fries with the meal, hand cut slim fries, there were good but nothing that I would rave about.   It is bit pricey for the type of burger you get. IMHO, Gourmet burger is not what HC is all about, for me it's more of a custom burger shop for the meat loving man...It definitely beats the Mc disappointment burgers and rightfully there is a premium for it. Overall, not bad, not great, I'm really on the fence with this place. Must say, they do have some interesting topping that I like so at some point I would return when I get a honkering for something different."}
{"text":"We have been to this place many times but the burgers are never consistent. One time it would be very food, the next would be very salty, then good, then salty. Never know if it would be good or bad. As a result of the inconsistency, we hardly this burger joint ever visit anymore."}
{"text":"Burger priest is definitely better, in taste and service! I ordered a Jr cheeseburger from holy chuck and the cashier seemed incredibly confused..she kept asking if I wanted the \"cowlorie\" which is another burger option. \"No thanks...just a Jr cheese burger.. Oh and fries\" even more confusion ensued.  I was charged $40 for two of these meals. And when my order was up..sure enough I was given two of their \"cowlorie\" burgers. When I calmly said \"um this isn't what I ordered.\" I was met with so much confusion, I swear the cashiers brain imploded. The cooks in the back were visibly upset that I was returning this food. One of them snapped at me \"but this has TWO PATTIES\" ..OK..but I didn't order it and I was also charged for the two patties. Wtf I want a Jr cheeseburger. So finally they make the Jr cheese burger, practically throw it at me and ask if I wanted the difference refunded. \"Yes plz..?\" More confusion. The burger was only okay anyways. Not worth this waste of time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  $27 for \"two\" burgers only . Not to mention my feet and elbows were sticking to every surface they touched, I had to enter washroom with clean napkins and water them down to clean our table surface thoroughly to stop our forearm skin sticking to surface \"yuck\". Honesty we wished we had our meal at McDonalds folks . Lunch bag let down guys !"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Holy Chuck for awhile, and finally managed to drag a bunch of friends to accompany me!   We tried two milkshakes ($5.49 each)- Happy Frappy and Grandma's Apple Pie (my choice). The happy frappy tasted very strongly caramel. Personally, I preferred my Apple Pie milkshake, which tasted remarkably like an apple pie, served with vanilla ice cream. There were actual chunks of apples in the shake and I especially loved the intensity of the cinnamon!   Two friends ordered the Greek Bahahastard ($10.99)- two lamb patties, caramelized onions, and topped with a roasted red pepper and garlic feta aioli. I didn't try this burger since I don't eat lamb, but I was told that they undercooked Sandy's burger. Other than that, the burger was quite well-received by my friends. On a side note, the fries were excellent and Sandy's chipotle mayo dip ($0.99) was absolutely addictive!   Another friend opted for their signature Holy Chuck burger($9.99), which is a double cheeseburger with bacon and caramelized onions. I had a small sample and liked it quite a lot. Sometimes, simplicity goes a long way.   As for me, I opted for the Mad Cow, which consist of an animal feed (panko crusted portobello mushroom stuffed with feta and cream cheese, deep fried and topped with a lemon and herb aioli) and a single beef patty ($10.99). On the whole, I enjoyed my burger, but it was really really filling. I recently tried Shake Shack in NYC and the Mad Cow definitely wasn't as good (the deep fried portobello mushroom was heavier here). But since I don't go to NYC often, Holy Chuck seems to be a good substitute. Of course, I still need to try Burger's Priest's version!   Henry and Jeremy also ordered Holy Chuck fries ($5.99) with bacon, double cheese and topped with homemade vino chili. The first few bites were delicious, but after awhile it just became... too much! The portion was alarmingly large and we finish ours. Next time, I will stick with having the fries on its own.   Overall, I think Holy Chuck was an enjoyable experience, but we were all in a food coma after the meal! To my surprise, we managed to finish most of the food in the end, but many of us felt compelled to work out after such a fatty, artery-clogging meal. I thought that the burgers were pretty good, but not amazing.   My favourite was probably the milkshake, and I am tempted to come back to try other varieties (nutella and salted caramel!!!)"}
{"text":"My kids have been raised at Holy Chuck and now they have a distorted sense of what a good burger is. They frown at McDs and the like and would challenge all \"gourmet\" burger shops against Holy Chuck's Jr. Cheeseburger, fries, nutella Salted Carmel shake. Toronto's best burger."}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant on a holiday Monday and they were open.  I had the cheese burger with fries, and although the staff there advised me over and over to try it \"naked\", since it was my first time there, i got lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, mayo and ketchup. This burger was delicious. I wish I had taken pictures but from the moment I saw the burger, I just wanted to eat it. I think I devoured it within 5 minutes. The meat is juicy and does drip grease, but i'm not complaining. The meat was cooked medium-well done with no pink(i honestly didn't even know this was an option).  The bun is nice and thin which doesn't take away from the flavour of the burger. The fries are sprinkled with Rosemary and I honestly don't think they add any flavour, but that because I squeezed ketchup all over them. This restaurant is super clean, which surprised me because they were busy. They keep their Heinz ketchup bottles full and stocked up, which was another surprise. Between the friendly staff, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the flavour of the food, I'm giving this place a 5/5. I'm going to recommend that all my friends try this place at least once. If you haven't been here, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Bun was off, needs to be toasted or something. Beef was ok but definitely not on the same page as Burger's Priest. A+ for burger creativity though.   The Priest STILL reigns supreme."}
{"text":"Ordered a Jr cheeseburger today, and I have come here before for a spicy poutine. Both were wayyyyy too salty for me. They put wayyyy too much salt on the patty or in the gravy. Otherwise the taste was fine."}
{"text":"This place sucks, i went there 2 times in the past 2 months and both times my burger was soggy as crap, I had the holy chuck burger, caramelized onions my ass, more like onion soup that dripped out of my burger, decided to give it a second chance and got the double cheeseburger and guess what my bread was soaked up to the point it was a piece of sog! Whoever is making these burgers doesn't know how to make one properly or doesn't give a crap because he/she doesn't have to eat it. Don't bother going to this place if you want a garbage burger, go to Burgers Priest which is like 5 mins from there and you will get a burger worth paying for and one that tastes a thousand times better."}
{"text":"I had Holy Chuck today at Front St. Foods outside union station. The worst burger ever. Extremely undercooked, it was actually bloody and red. There was barely any colour on the outside of the patty, that's how little it had been cooked. No condiments inside. Just patties and cheese and bun. No ketchup, mustard, tomato. Nothing. I can't believe I paid $11 for such a terrible burger."}
{"text":"My husband and I were referred to this place by a friend. We tried \"The Feed\" which was a vegetarian option. A portebello mushroom deep fried with cream cheese and feta. It tasted ok but the taste didn't meet my expectations (maybe because it was hyped by our friend who said it's the best and only place for burgers with lots of vegetarian options). There were only 3 options. I don't think we'll be going out of our way to go again and try the rest.  The portebello & cream cheese filling was cold despite being fried. The toppings were fresh but the fries were a huge disappointment. The side of fries were soggy and very thin. The prices were decent and the size of the burger was really good."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for a TINY burger which cost me $14.00, and that doesn't include fries OR drink! This is complete highway robbery!"}
{"text":"Up chuck?  Maybe I'm just being mean, however, with the explosion of expensive American style burger joints, you got to be a standout. I ordered the Big Chuck - which they play on the Big Mac - and it was not good. The patties were surprisingly thin and just greasy - not tasty. It was like as if it was fried earlier and then fried again when I ordered it. The sauce was overloaded on a bun that fell apart. Messy and hard to eat. Sorry - not my burger joint. The hunt continues."}
