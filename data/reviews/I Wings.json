{"text":"Pizza and wings... That's what they have along with steak and meatball sandwiches and chicken Caesar salad, BLTs, onion rings, everything that is good about traditional Toronto greasy spoons. Their pizza is SOOOO good! Puffy crust and baked to perfection. And the wings are just the way I like them. Soaked in sauce and wrapped in foil for takeout. You won't regret stopping in here. Respect for the owners for rejecting the franchise costs associated with running a chain pizza joint and, instead, using a new name, I wings, and going it alone. Good for you I wing!"}
{"text":"I discovered this business as a recent addition to Just-Eat.ca when in the mood for some delivery pizza and chicken wings and wanting to try something new. For right around $40 after tax before tip we received delivered to our door:  -two custom 3 topping 12\" Medium Pizzas -1 lb of Buffalo style chicken wings (which is actually around 16 - 20 wings of ranging sizes, not your average rip off 8 wing pound)  I was really impressed with the pizza! All the ingredients were of good quality, and the crust a perfect mid ranged thickness which still maintained good form even after the reheat on the second day. Some pizzas I can literally destroy a medium in a single sitting, but with this one I was pretty satisfied after a few slices.  The wings were also good. We got Medium flavoured Buffalo Style chicken wings and they were tasty and seemed like a good value as although you do have some smaller wings in the bunch, you do get a decent number to work with.  I'll order again, and would recommend it to others looking to try something new in the Toronto pizza/wing game."}
{"text":"Okay so this isn't the classiest dine-in establishment (even considering that it's a fast food joint), but it must be said that the panzerottos here are TO. DIE. FOR. Ever since my go-to panzerotto joint closed, my life has been a mess... Until I experienced the mouthgasm of a panzerotto at unassuming, slightly ghetto iWing. Seriously, the breading was the perfect mix of soft and crispy. The oil was gushing out enough to ensure no dryness, but stopped just short of causing cardiac arrest. For about $5, I was not only transported to heaven, but got dinner AND a show (aka I people-watched all the nutty hipsters walking down Queen West). True ecstasy."}
{"text":"I ordered a sausage and onion pizza and wings.  The pizza had copious amounts of onion, was undercooked, and the sausage had a gross hotdog like quality to it.  The wings were not really breaded like normal buffalo wings and the sauce was not very tasty.  It wasn't the usual Frank's style hot sauce, but rather a weirdly spiced glaze of some sort.  With all the great pizza options in Toronto, I will not be back."}
