{"text":"Friendliest staff, no matter how swamped they are. Always smiling and gracious. Garlic parm and lemon pepper wings. Mmmmmmmm.

Love the simplicity of the place and the trinkets all over the walls, always discover something new."}
{"text":"I never knew there was a wing store in the dark alley of scottsdale! Its my first time here and i ordered a Buffalo tator tots and a long wong. The tator tots were crispy and tasty and the hot dog is soo good! They also gave me a good deal too since it was my first time! This place is lit!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Wings were tiny, dry, and over cooked. Steak sandwich was extremely salty. The best thing was the tub of ranch dressing. Expected more for a place that touts itself as having famous wings. Will not eat here again.

Need to add that the service was great! Everyone was very courteous!"}
{"text":"getting some food I wish it was a lot bigger though feel a little crowded. But the wings were delicious the French fries are awesome and the service was fast"}
{"text":"We ordered the fried catfish and a dozen wings.  The fish was perfect, flavorful and flaky, and the wings were outstanding.  

Some places that sell wings don't render all the fat and look larger but taste awful and you can't eat all of it.  These are the best wings I've eaten in years.

This place just opened and people who give them bad reviews should return a few more times before giving up.

The customer service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"We come to Phoenix once or twice a year and I've always wanted to try this place.  Needless to say it will be one & done for us.  

We purchased, two adult burgers (w/fries), 3 kids meals, onion rings, stuffed mushrooms, & 3 large sodas.  Total was $45.  (Not bad for family if five) But based on everything overall we left with my wife's comment: \"freakin' rippidy rip off\"... 

The inside of Long Wongs was very dirty, it looked like it was on a once a week cleaning and it was day 6!  It had that slight greasy grime on the tables, chairs, arcade games.  As for the good, you pay for  drink refills which is rediculous nowadays let alone for a \"wings\" joint.  Both the adult burgers were very weak, hardly any specialty toppings to give it a specialty flavor and way too much bun for the small preformed frozen patties.   Flavor was nonexistent.  The stuffed mushrooms tasted like they were dropped straight from the freezer into he fat fryer - worst I've ever had.  The onion rings were the best part and the only reason this place got one star. As excited as we were to try this place we were severely disappointed.

BOTTOMLINE:
PROS: price, onion rings
CONS: poor food quality, cleanliness (lack of it), experience"}
{"text":"Really scrumptious crispy wings, but the pizza is definitely FROZEN pizza. only one size offered and no crust to it. Will come back for wings but nothing else. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Worst wings ever save your money go to atl wings

I called in for my order and went 20 min later and they haven even started my order"}
{"text":"Great food a bit pricy but what's not in Scottsdale a cool establishment with an intriguing history."}
{"text":"The quality of the wings has deteriorated over the past few years and they are way overpriced. Paid $34 for 50 wings and they were well below average in taste. Wish I wouldn't have spent the money."}
{"text":"Best wings in PHX area.  Large Pizza and Wings Combo can't be beat! The decor could be better but u won't care as soon as u start eating. This is the best of the Wong's chain. I live by Lake Pleasent but whenever I'm on this side of town I almost always stop in here and over-indulge!"}
{"text":"Who ever answered the phone here is RUDE , 0 customer service couldn't even place a order before the guy hung up on me dude should be fired !"}
{"text":"If Im in the mood for wings, I come here. You can't beat their dozen wing, fries, n drink combo. They have some really good subs also. They could upgrade their tvs tho, and play the ufc fights."}
{"text":"The place is a pit and it always has been a pit. Poor service rounds it off to a nice one star. After years of hesitating to go back to this place that I remembered was so bad , I tried it once again the  other day and, I had to walk out once again. I will never be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming to long wongs for 10 years! They always get the wings just right!! Always super nice cashiers!!"}
{"text":"For the most part it's a unique and different place from the rest. From the old pin ball Machine to the flamed painted Cadillac parked outside. The fries suck but I love the crunchy wings with a side Bucket of hot sauce."}
{"text":"I love the cheap pizza & wings. Great food, great prices but it irritates the hell out of me that they always call the numbers out in Spanish.  I have to keep looking at the food being brought out to see if I recognize what I ordered.  That's just rude."}
{"text":"This place sucks I think the people who have it good reviews are related to workers here because the wings are BONES no meat, over cooked. guys from my work also said the same thing when I mentioned this place to them.  The workers all got attitude like it's some kinda members only club. There is way better places to eat in this area. The place is very trashy looking inside also. Don't waist your money. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Only been to this location twice. First time I came, they closed 45 minuets before the listed time. I was successful to get wings my 2nd visit. I ordered mild but was sweating while I consumed them. I think they just made one sauce for mild through their hottest. I'm still a fan of Long Wongs but not this location.... Sticking with Thomas and Scottsdale"}
{"text":"When this place was in Tempe it was one of my favorite places to hang out and to eat I used to come here at least twice a week with my friends when I was in high school as well as many years after but once they close it down I was very sad then I was excited because there was one that was right across the street from where I live so we went and we ate there and I was sad to say that the food was not the same their wings are still okay but their Pizza is horrible it's way too greasy!!! The staff is very nice and are friendly and greet you and you walk in if you want to order more than just a couple dozen wings I suggest you call because it can take some serious time"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this location, it's been an amazing experience. Very fast & very friendly service as well as amazing food, large portions, and incredibly modest prices. I encourage everyone to try this place out :)"}
{"text":"Food....fantastic wings and pretty good pizza.

Ambiance....this place has more character than any restaurant I've ever eaten at. The kids are always mystified and remark about how it feels like being in an I-spy book. That being said, it's not the cleanest place in the world and the unisex restroom, well unless you have an emergency situation going on avoid it. There could be some life forms that have yet to be discovered residing in that restroom.

Staff.....ok

Verdict....If you're in the mood for some delicious wings at a reasonable price, want an interesting environment that will illicit conversation, or have kids this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse wings I've ever had.  They were super small and skinny.  Had ok flavor but now I know why they are so cheap, it's because of the size!!  Go elsewhere for wings!"}
{"text":"I been going here for over 15 years 2 to 3 a month no more I never got mad about bad service foods good I have  got mad about wrong wings but that's I have tried them all even still good but when you order a pizza add a topping $1.50 good price  add extra sauce  $2.50 what the hell who charges for extra pizza sauce & then more than a extra topping wow am done and the manager what a joke she has no clue good luck. GOING BACK TO NATIVE NY YORK WORTH THE DRIVE"}
{"text":"The original. The best. The undisputed CHAMP of burgers, wings and all things in between in Phoenix. Ron has been serving it up for 30 years.

He's from Buffalo - he knows wings. Everything else - the burgers, the dogs, and even the Indian Fry Bread - are fantastic. Have only $5 for lunch? Ron's got you covered with the Fat Ass Special.

PERFECT to watch football and basketball games in. Great local family crowd. Do NOT settle for imitations - make the trip to the ORIGINAL Long Wong's at 28th St. & Thomas!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and check out this wild building. It's awesome and odd and the food tastes great. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is such an unusual place.
The staff friendly and accommodating,   I've been to many places that serve chicken wings but would have to say honestly these wings were the best. Cooked to  perfection in a tangy sauce. When asked Mama(Who is the owner /manager)about the sauce, and ingredients Her response was it's a secrets but said that's what makes them the best.
I would have to agree."}
{"text":"I always used to love the wings from here but in the past two years they have gone downhill...Customer service blows and the wings hardly have any meat on them.  Try another location they are all not the same.. Marcias Long Wongs in S. Phx is much better"}
{"text":"I love long wongs in phoenix. I go to the one over around 28th st and mcdowell and get fantastic service. I ordered garlic parm boneless wings and  zucchini at the staple and 60 freeway location and was shocked at the service and the food received.  Normally they come in a nice cream garlic sauce. What I got was canned grease butter with canned garlic and dried oregano sprinkled in it as a sauce for my wings.  Completely wrong.  My zucchini was over cooked and I watched 6 orders ordered after mine go out the window.  When i went to counter to get a refund my order magically appeared.  I will never go in this location again and will make a courtesy call to corporate tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love the wings here. They are the right size and price. Especially when you buy the buckets. Medium and honey BBQ are my favorites."}
{"text":"We love the food but it is so annoying to have to wait so long after having phoned in our order. They always say it'll be 10 to 15 minutes but I still have to wait longer than that after I get there because they don't cook the food until I get there.  I have complained to them several times.  Unfortunately my daughter really likes their teriyaki wings so I have to put up with their lousy service. 
Just don't bother calling in your order & you can avoid such frustrations."}
{"text":"I ordered the honey hot wings. The wings were nasty. They looked old and did not taste good at all. Sauce was horrible too!"}
{"text":"First time trying to eat here and will be the last time. As we pulled in to park a guy was sitting outside the restaurant on the ground, didn't think much of it until we got closer, it reeked of marijuana. U could smell it from the parking lot! The guy who was sitting outside got up went inside and went back around the counter. Couldn't even get passed the door it smelled so bad, turned back around and took my family else where to eat. Not family friendly!! For obvious reasons. Try the Dobson location, foods good but service sucks."}
{"text":"You dont come to long wongs because your new years resolution is to lose weight. You come here for cheap greasy down home unapologetic assault to your arteries food."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Cheap food at a cheap price. Can't complain but don't expect anything amazing."}
{"text":"Me and my family love coming here on Friday night they have they best wings in town the staff here are nice and friendly"}
{"text":"We went not too long before closing. The wings were tiny (some were Cornish game hen size) and obviously double fried.  As in, they made them and then threw them back in the fryer when we ordered them.  They were like jerky.  So very disappointing especially compared to the Long Wongs on Dobson in Mesa.  One would think that the owners would try to make this location better."}
{"text":"Their wings and hot dogs will never disappoint the taste buds. 

This place isn't a good hangout by any stretch. They do have a couple classic arcade games though, Golden Axe and Ms. PacMan."}
{"text":"This places looks like where you'd go to get food poisoning, me and my boyfriend drove by this location so many times and I always refused to try it. My boyfriend finally convinced me to stop by one night and the food was alright, but it did give me a stomach ache and the shits all night."}
{"text":"The wings are great! I prefer the hot wings.

The rest of the menu varies. Sometimes their burgers are really good, but it seems it changes sometimes..

The wings are always good, though."}
{"text":"I stick with what works for me.
This location and the same meal is why I love Long Wongs.
The customer service is always amazing. The same employees have been here since I was a kid ( long time ago ;)

Try the burger,4 wing combo, very filling. My little picky eater loves the pizza."}
{"text":"I was once in a bathroom with no mirror and that was jail don't try to check your look after you have a snack at long Wong's ,so yummy but soo messy"}
{"text":"What a dive!! And I liked it. 
I couldn't tell if the place was even open it was so dark from the outside. You walk in and there are a few tables and a walk up counter to order. We (husband & I) were hungry so we ordered the mini bucket of 25 wings all hot and crispy.  I didn't know what the crispy was but I'm glad we ordered it the wings were really good. We also got Longboard (I think) IPA on draft which was very good. The men working there were all very friendly and nice - great service.

There are more tables in the back (where we sat) with TVs and a small game area. 

Before eating the wings I decided I should wash my hands. Probably not the smartest thing as the restroom was disgusting! They have two restrooms both unisex I chose the one in the back for washing up after the meal and it was much cleaner."}
{"text":"Not only the best wings in town, but if you get the fries fresh, they are phenomenal! We always get wings and fries to go... the portions are generous, and the owner is a pleasure to chat with."}
{"text":"Awesome suicide wings crispy fried outside, perfectly done inside. Awesome decor inside and out, also ordered a 16 inch pizza pepperoni extra cheese. All CAME to $20!! Pizza cheesy and fresh, with chewy crust!! Definetly a diamond in the sky"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is trash! I called in my order as well as my friend.  We get there, my order was wrong. Supposedly I wasn't charged full price for the wrong order. My friend got her order n they looked horrible! She got garlic parmesean, whatever the sauce was on it was horrible. No flavor n dry. She also ordered fried zuccini as did I n they were not bad but not good. I open up my boxes of wings and they were dry and no flavor. I got spicy ranch n spicy bbq...ummm never again. I ate one and horrible. I also ordered jalepeno poppers, I threw those away too! Overcooked and tasted burnt. This place is not worth the money they charge. Also, they have a menu online, the prices are higher in the store! But didn't honor the price that is on the online menu. The lady said they changed the prices a couple months ago, well you should fix it or honor the price shown! I was EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED with this place. SMH."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Place looks old cheap and dirty. We had a large party so we were putting tables together and the guy working there said that if we were going to move the tables that we had to put it back before we left. The guy even had the audacity to come check after we left trying to look all intimidating. Won't be going back ever. In case this helps it was a big guy with bradded hair that was the rude one. We were a large party of paying customers the least we ask for is to have decent customer service."}
{"text":"Long Wong's is the home to chachkies from decades past, a storefront reminiscent of a tourist destination, jokes of an off-color nature, and really decent cheap food.

I have to disagree with the consensus that this is fantastic food and the best wings in town.  But, it is certainly good and won't break your wallet.  I'm absolutely not complaining.  I just think it was merely \"ok\".  The staff was pretty friendly even though we swarmed their dining room and rearranged their furniture, so that is a plus.

Walking in was overwhelming!  It's a small place with wall-to-wall knick-knacks and paddy-whacks.  You order at the counter, and there is plenty to look at while waiting for your food to come out.  My fella and I ordered a 12-piece BBQ wings with fried zucchini and a large pepsi.  The wings were very good, though they could have been more meaty and flavorful. The zucchini did not impress.  I do not, will not, can not do the spicy thing, so we opted out of \"the inferno\".  That said, I heard rumors that it wasn't that hot, so I stuck my finger in some sauce to try.  It was too hot for me (but hey, so is pepperoni) but I admit it wasn't nearly as hot as I'd expect an inferno might be.  I'd call it a medium/hot.

For a festive evening where I get to cover my face in bbq sauce without judgement, and both Andrew and I leave fed and happy for $12, I'd call it a great success.  I would not say no to a return trip."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER- anywhere, anytime in history, anytime in the future ! This is THE place !! check it out for yourselves. JP .
Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean"}
{"text":"Well I still have hope for this place.. it did just open. The pizza would have been good if it actually had pepperoni on it and wasn't burnt on the bottom. The wings had I weird after taste, a little fishy..and the potato skins had way to much cheese and a couple had no bacon on them.. The guy at the counter was a really nice guy. Hope it's just growing pains. Really want this place to work out."}
{"text":"People are always amazingly sweet and kind, and the food is always delicious! I've been going here since I was a kid and im grateful for a local joint that is still thriving! Especially because its so unique and precious. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years! The wings are great and reasonably priced. Our favorites are the fat ass burger meal for $6.99 double cheese burger with an onion ring, fries and a large drink. 
It's a small place but clean, but we usually just get everything to go. 
If your in the area it's a great deal and good food"}
{"text":"We bought an XL pepperoni pizza and 25 wings. The wings were okay but the pizza was so gross. It was burnt on the bottom and the edges were black!

So we took it back and they made another one but guess what the pizza was burnt again!!

DO NOT BUY PIZZA HERE IT WILL BE BURNT. and if you return it it will be burnt again. 

Very bad service also."}
{"text":"For the last twenty years, I've enjoyed Long Wong's...from the one near Phoenix College to the one in Chandler (and in between).  Some are long gone and some remain, and some serve great wings and some not so great.

A few Mondays ago, my craving for wings put me in a zombie-state....must have.  Now, living in S. Scottsdale, my choices are pretty limited.  Go to a sports bar or restaurant and pay 9 bones a dozen plus tip, grab sum from a deli at a grocery store (no thanks) or make THE trip.  Pssst...Scottsdale's LW is closed on Mondays.  :(  

Ten minutes later, I found myself at Long Wong's.  Basking in cold air amidst the Americana decor, I struggled whether to order Hot or Suicide...ya see, this wing joint actually makes a suicide sauce that rawks.  The Suicide allows me to actually savor the taste of the wings while bringing a tear (or two) to my eye...rare.

Waiting for my order, the presence of several families iced it as a family-oriented place...ya can't beat the prices or quality of the kids meals.  About 8 minutes later, I was walking out the door with two dozen wings and an order of breaded zucchini.  

Fifteen minutes later, the little lady and I were enjoying wings and still crisp zucchini (thick cut with a golden batter) over a Cary Grant flick, His Girl Friday. 

For medium-sized wings that taste great at a great price, this LW location is a keeper."}
{"text":"Been going to the 28st location for 25 years and have never had s bad meal. They gave THE BEST patty melt in town served New York style .... Awesome! Also, it's hard to find a better charbroiled chicken salad . Great food and even better prices... Best hole in the wall in Phoenix by far!"}
{"text":"What a bad joke! Rewards card, on the tenth visit it's free Right!! you cant even use it towards your meal. we always get the three dozen wings when we go and they punch the card, after about four years we had the card full I thought it was good for one dozen wings but its not even worth that they said we could get like 6 wings with it. They said it had like a $7 dollar value so I wanted to just use it off the price of our 3 dozen and they won't even do that. So it is a complete waste of time. I have had it with their shitty customer service and stale twice cooked wings there are plenty of places that at least act like the want your business I will never go back. And I have been eating there since they were on Lindsey & broadway back in the early 90s. You guys suck!"}
{"text":"It is a mixed bag here.  Great sauces (But maybe drowning a bit) fun atmosphere for families or take-out.  No alcohol at this locale.  Wings were good but not great."}
{"text":"Wow. This place has really gone down hill. My boyfriend and I had noticed the quality of their food had worsened but today was ridiculous. Not only did they not give us the full dozen of wings we paid for but their deep fried mushrooms were atrocious. How can you mess up deep fried mushrooms you ask? You'd have to ask Long Wongs because I thought it was impossible until today. They were soggy, the mushrooms tasted bad and the batter was somehow burnt and undercooked at the same time. Congrats Long Wongs, you literally made me spit out a deep fried mushroom, something I thought would never happen. As regulars here I can't imagine we'd be going back. I think I'd rather just spend a little extra at wing stop."}
{"text":"Great Wings!  Great pizza!  Kid friendly!  Everything that my wife and I need.  Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I work next door to these awesome guys! I unfortunately have a lot of dietary restrictions so I haven't eaten much from them but I know their food is amazing. Almost all of my customers eat there in a regular basis and you can't beat Josh's customer service. 

If you want good food at a fair price and to be treated like your at home this Long Wongs is the place for you

Josh works hard and it shows in his product. I asked if he could make me garlic parm tots which weren't on the menu but he did so happily and I just want him to know I appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Service has dropped food quality not the same not sure if switched owners or just poor staffing.  Is a shame was my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Met the owner and he was awesome! Great wings and more cheese than ever seen on a pizza ever. I'd highly recommend visiting this location."}
{"text":"If you don't have taste buds this place is for you.  The Burger was paper thin, overcooked and tasted horrible.  The chicken wings were also terrible.  Place is small, dirty and dumpy.  I will say the person working was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Man oh man, is this my kind of place. Where else can I crawl into a little shack and have some Asian lady in her PJ's slangin chicken wings?  Totally dig it. The wings are always great, prices cheap and it's definitely a no frills place. They even have a bed sheet or old curtain hanging to \"hide\" the kitchen! In my opinion, these can be some of the best places to eat. I've never actually been to any other Long Wong's, so this is my go to local wing spot."}
{"text":"The hot wings, medium wings, bbq wings, and even the mild wings here are bursting with flavor! The nachos here are super simple and lack luster. Just nacho cheese sauce with yellow corn chips. No pico de gallo, guacamole, or meat. I see a lot of people ordering hamburgers at this place that is known for their wings. I have not tried a burger yet but they are popular so they must be half way decent. This place would get 5 stars if they had beer and if the place was bigger. When they are crowded during lunch you can be left eating out in the heat on their picnic tables. If you love wings and have not been to Long Wong's you are missing some tasty bird."}
{"text":"Just returned home from dinner at Long Wong's with hubby and a friend. This wasn't our first experience with Long Wong's, but this was the first time we'd visited the Granite Reef location and it's definitely our new favorite. We decided to go full throttle, so ordered 50 wings: 25 with teriyaki sauce and 25 with medium Buffalo sauce. We all agreed that these were THE BEST wings we've tried in a very long time, and we eat a LOT of wings. So big and meaty...these things were HUGE - not tiny like you sometimes find at other wing joints. Both sauces were very good...just right. Definitely worth going back for. We also ordered the potato skins and were once again impressed as heck by the size of these things. Really...they were ginormous and covered with loads of cheese and the most bacon any of us had EVER seen on skins. Their potato skins are definitely Texas-size. Amazing! Also had the Tater Tots Carne Asada...more cheesy goodness and generously loaded with meat and green chili sauce. Again...very generous portions. These people don't skimp on anything and you'll definitely get your money's worth here. No one will go home hungry. Also, we met the owner, who is a really great guy. Friendly service. Great food. Fantastic wings. Reasonably priced. A hidden gem in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Buen lugar SUPER local! Muy original la decoración y la.comida buena si piden alitas lemon pepper pidan doble seasoning para que sepa realmente la atención increíble y la gente SUPER cercana"}
{"text":"This is my family's and I Saturday's dinner every Saturday night I order wings here . I've had never had a problem the wings are always on point Suicide are my fav and also the garlic Parmesan. But tonight was a no-no our celery that comes with in the small ball with the ranch was disgusting I cannot believe they gave me nasty looking celery. Who looks at something that looks nasty and decide \"oh Its edible put it in a he bag\"? I'm really upset with this kind of service I don't care if it's just celery it's something I'm paying for!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it fell a bit short of our expectations.  Our experience is based on a delivery by Uber eats, so we may need to dine in to get a better feel for it.  We ordered two of the mild boneless wings, but ended up getting an order of the Parmesan garlic wings, so off the bat the order was wrong, No biggie we thought. They looked yummy enough.  First off the boneless wings were heavily breaded and tasted very greasy .. as if they were deep fried.  The Parmesan wings were not breaded but still tasted very greasy.  The Parmesan sauce was messy, but interesting.  Overall we didn't feel it belonged on wings.  Just an odd combination."}
{"text":"Great traditional wings, home made fried rice and burgers. Wish they could stay open late and deliver but always convenient to pick up on short notice. The Japanese woman runs the place is very nice."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Long Wong's on Arizona Ave and Ray since I was 5. That's over 20 years of delicious wings. But I felt compelled to try the original one in Phoenix. I got that opportunity today and I wasn't let down or disappointed.

Yes, the outside and inside is outdated. Stuff collected probably before the 50's but that's what makes this place stand out. It's not B-Dubs or Native or Wing Stop. Yes, I'm naming wings place cause that is why you come here.. FOR WINGS!!

And by golly the first bite into my hot wings reminded me of my childhood. They are absolutely delicious! Every bite gets better. And that sauce is heaven! Not too much heat but enough bite to keep you going. The fries were seasoned nice. Old bay? I liked them.

In conclusion, if you're in the area, you need to try this place. Yes, to see the wacky decor  and to enjoy a dozen of Phoenix's finest wings."}
{"text":"Wings are small but cheap - $27 gets you 50 wings (2 different flavors), a large ranch (I don't know the exact size) and fresh, crisp carrots. Mild was very mild, medium was somewhat mild, so next time I'll order hot, or some of the other flavors. Not the best wings I've had, but not bad considering the price. For this area and for the price I recommend Wings Express (Main off Stapley), and a little further away is Wingstop (Riverview)."}
{"text":"Glad they're open close to me now.  The Wings are always a good choice.  Nice guys running this store, hope they succeed here and this location makes it.  I suggested they bring back the smoked jalapeno wings that a now closed location in Mesa used to offer.  Hopefully that will happen...."}
{"text":"After hearing how awesome things place was and driving past it a million times I  my life it was pretty disappointing. 
Wrong sauce was cold and salad was normal. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I love hot wings. It's a weird food. I mean, think about it for a second. You can't make them at home. Ok someone is reading this right now mumbling duhh ya you can duhhhh. Listen A hole, yes you can but its just not worth all the steps ok?  Besides they're just not gonna be as good so shut up. Shut it. 
 
Since Teakwoods moved from 28th st & Indian School I've been without a wing joint. Eating 2nd rate wings is depressing. Just thinking back to last month when I was munching on a breaded hot wing from Domino's puts me on suicide watch. It's like handing a strung out crackhead a freagin antihistamine. Speakin of crackheads, remember that episode of Saved By the Bell when Jesse was poppin all them pills singing that one song?   

I haven't been to Long Wong's in a few years primarily because the last few times I went there...I was not impressed. Well the other day a friend at work brought in some wings. Me, being a crackhead for these things I tried them out & asked where they were from. You guessed it.

So tonight I ordered a dozen hot. No zucchini, no mushrooms, no pizza - just some wings. The total came out to close to 8 bucks with an extra ranch. I came home to watch the ballgame & really enjoyed them. They were the only pleasant suprise tonight as the Dbacks got their asses handed to them once more.

They come a little bit on the wet side, which I think works. I would give the sauce a solid 8 out of 10. They cook them perfectly, done all the thru. They must have made some changes since I last been here because I don't ever remember the wings being on this level. Props to you guys.

I'll go back once I need another fix. Perhaps ill try one of there other sauces? One suggestion I would make to the Long Wong familia is maybe offer grilled hot wings to char up some of that sauce. Till then ill be alright with my normal crack. Maybe I'll get really wild, order TWO dozen, go on a naked rampage & eat some poor man's face. Then again...the dozen should probably do. See ya around Wong."}
{"text":"Best in Az! Suciadal- Infierno wings extra grill , extra sauce all over only pallets . The best. Highly recommend if  you like spicy food."}
{"text":"They have a Ms. Pac Man game here. DON\"T play it unless you enjoy donating free money to Long Wong. The machine clicked back to start during our game and we only had two pac people each. This machine is from 1980, but hey if it doesn't work then get rid of the thing. There really is nothing to look at inside the restaurant, just a bland little rectangle with old photos of days gone bye bye. The \"patio\" is two picnic tables out front. I had a few of the honey hot wings and they were crispy and of the small variety. Not bad tasting though and 10 wings cost 7 bucks plus all the extras are free. Lots of other stuff on menu, but wasn't in the risk taking mood."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  
I had to wait at the front desk for about five minutes before anybody showed up to take my order. I called back and one of the cooks said someone be up shortly. I ordered the mini bucket of hot wings to go. 
I was surprised when they said it would only take five minutes to make the wings but didn't think anything of it until I got home.  I opened the container and had some of the smallest wings I've ever eaten. There was hardly any meat on them and the meat that was was on the bones was dry as plywood. The ranch container was only half-full and even the carrots were dry and warm. There was very little sauce on the wings and it was gritty and tasted like water and chili powder. 

I have been to Long Wongs in Phoenix before and it was great. This place on Stapley was NOTHING like it."}
{"text":"Food was under cooked and staff was rude. The lady that answers the phone was disrespectful and continued to hang up on me multiple times.  Would not recommend!!!   2/28/16"}
{"text":"The wings here are pretty good. The hot wings are a vinegary style of hot wing. The onion rings are battered. The pastrami sandwich was a sub style sandwich. All in all not bad. The place looks aged, but the food is still good."}
{"text":"This place is gross! Not half as good as the other long wongs, not sure how they are allowed to be represented by the same people, slimy wings and different menus than the good long wongs in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A far cry from the South Scottsdale location. The wings I ordered were ice cold! when I brought them back to the counter, the lady said nothing and threw them into a microwave. I kid you not! If you want good wings, try another location. PROS : I didn't get e-coli."}
{"text":"Best spot in town for wings the staff is amazing and the seating isn't bad they have pool inside which makes the wait for food better or even after a good meal nothing better than some pool vs a friend! The wings are outstanding! The location is random but nice! I will be coming back I love it!"}
{"text":"Show up for the decor, stay for the wings. They also have curly fries, if you're into that type of thing."}
{"text":"This place is very nice inside tv everywhere, the people are so frendly and helpful. Was not even open yet and still let us in. The pizza was great and the onion rings was good... I will be back to have some more and play some pool and have a beer  I recommend this place to everyone who loves pizza wings and friendly place to just relax for a drink and food and mybe some pool."}
{"text":"\"If I could rate this place 0 stars I would\"
I have been to the Long Wongs in Tempe, so my boyfriend and I thought of stopping by here, we wanted to watch the championship game and we needed a place quick. We go in wanting some drinks, well the bar was closed...fine, we went and sat at a table a couple feet from a tv, perfect! We asked what draft beers they had and she said they had Bud Light, Coors Light, and Budweiser, so my boyfriend ordered a coors and i got vodka cranberry, she brought over a bottle of coors light and I walked over to the bar and looked at their tap handles and they also had Shocktop and Sierra Nevada on tap as well. Servers clearly do not know what they even have here.
After waiting for about 30 minutes for our appetizer, we finally got it and then 10 minutes later we got our two burgers.
We had no napkins and when we were looking for our server who seemed to be non-existent all night we saw her talking with the manager behind a wall, after staring at them for a few minutes he finally noticed and sent her to come check on us for the first time the whole meal.
Over all just awful service, our server did not know about food or drinks and on top of it could barely communicate with us. 

We were there to watch a game along with two other tables of five guys each who were clearly watching the championship and cheering loudly. After about 15 minutes while trying to figure out why I could barely hear the game I realized they had TV on a news channel right behind the counter, and the server & manager were also playing music from a jukebox on the other side of the restaurant in the \"closed\" bar so loudly I couldn't make out any distinct audio and once we asked why there was music playing she replied \"oh we're listening to music.\"

My boyfriend and I both have been working in the industry for years and we are completely understandable of a busy restaurant and things taking a few minutes. There were TWO other tables in there and our server was seen 2 times, our food took forever, and the burgers were not worth it at all. We finally got the check and payed and left, we wrote a small note about how the service was awful (we wanted to talk to the manager but he was too busy trying to get it in clearly) and this is where it gets so much better. We left and saw him walk outside, but we were already on the main street so we called and told him about the situation, he asked us \"Yes, was there a problem?\" We told him about everything, the service, her not being knowledgable of any of her surroundings or her menu, and he replied \"oh...okay\" 

This place is a disaster, they clearly need to make some decisions to get this place turned around or need a complete new management staff, they lost potential regulars and I will tell every single person I can how awful of an experience I had.

DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}

{"text":"My husband and I are new to Phoenix and have decided to try as many local places as possible. Intrigued by the outside decor, we ventured into this odd place. We ordered 2 meals and sat at a greasy, dirty table. 
Our wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed. The wings (some spicy ranch and some garlic Parmesan) were soggy from the grease and extra chewy. The burger appeared to have been  put in the fryer with the wings. The bun was soggy and the patty doused in pepper. 
They did try to make their greasy food healthier by handing out sandwich bags with carrots and ranch. Good effort. 
The one star it gets is for decor and fries. The fries are great, just covered in salt (shake then it off and they will be fine.) The decor will keep you entertained and avoid awkward silences."}
{"text":"How did I live in Arizona for more than 20 years without trying Long Wong's?  Probably because I don't usually eat fried food, but I've sampled Buffalo Wild Wings, Native New Yorker, Padre Murphy's, Wingstop and others.  These wings are definitely better, esp if you order the boneless.  A lot less salt in the batter.  The wings are good.  This place is a panic of kitsch and knickknacks."}
{"text":"The best wings, just as good as what I've had in Buffalo, even at the Anchor Bar. I ordered extra- crispy and hot and they were excellent! I tried the mild and they also tasted great. Came with ranch dressing and I asked for blue cheese. Both were really good. My friend had their hamburger with pastrami which I had a taste of and it was so good I'd consider getting that next time. I also loved the Sangria soda they have available in the cooler."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ for a couple of days and my friend is insistent in going to this  place. Cool beans.

Boy, this place is a DIVE by every sense of the word!

But...they have decent wings. The sauce is phenomenal. The size of the wing (winglets)...well...I wish it could be bigger. I ate a lot of them as a result. Which means I enjoyed them. But I could have enjoyed them more if they were bigger. Which means I would not have ate as many. But would have enjoyed them more...

Do you see where I am going with this???

{"text":"I got the golden wong that comes with a side of fries. All of it was really good and the place looked super cool with all the stuff they had in there."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way home from the Phoenix Zoo. With the name, you'd expect Chinese food, but it is an authentic wing/burger joint. You can't miss the building, as it looks like PeeWee's playhouse, and the inside is just as hodge podgish as the outside, but don't let that fool you. The prices are stellar, it was a steady busy, and food time was good. The lady working as the cashier was extremely pleasant and friendly. All in all, it was a good experience, and I would certainly come here again."}
{"text":"Just had wings from there since people really seemed to recommend them. I gotta say they certainly met those expectations. They where so jucy and delicious I had to take some home!! The only thing I would change is the dining area. Seems really small and awkward but love the decor. I will continue to buy and recommend this place to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of Long Wong's from my childhood. My parents were divorced, so my dad pretty much always took me out to dinner on his nights. Long Wong's was a solid part of the rotation, and not just because I only ate cheeseburgers. The place is crazy looking. Literally, the decor looks like it was inspired by an acid trip. Nothing says \"kid friendly\" like a hippopotamus trash can. If you are a single dad who doesn't know how to cook, you should definitely take your kid here for dinner. 

Since it had been at least two decades since I'd been inside a Long Wong's, last night my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. We had a craving for wings (I accidentally typed that I had a crazing for wings, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same thing)  and you can get a bucket of 50 for, like, $25. Going to be honest ... 50 wings might have been a bit overkill for two people. Still, it was worth it. 

We did a split order: 1/2 honey hot and 1/2 medium. The honey hot wings are where it's at. My only complaint is that I like them to be a little crispier. Some of them were slightly soggy. The fries didn't travel well either. In fact, everything was just kind of soggy by the time we got home. The wings were still very good, but I think they will be even better once I give the leftovers a little crisp in the oven. I will say, their homemade ranch was delicious. Can't beat a hot wing dipped into good, homemade ranch. 

I'm definitely going to have to keep this place in mind the next time a wing craving hits ... and maybe ask for them extra crispy."}
{"text":"When you're visiting PHX stop at Long Wong's.  Great special on 12 wings with salad and a drink for 8 bucks.  When I lived there I ate their every month!  Check it out"}
{"text":"One thing I've discovered about Long Wong's is that the quality and service depends a lot on the location.  For instance, the wings at the Scottsdale and Thomas location are different from the wings you'll get at the Two Hippies location which are also different from the ones you get at my regular spot, and the one I'm going to talk about; the Stapley and 60 restaurant located next to the giant laser tag arena.  If you're thinking that maybe I've eaten Long Wong's wings and then played laser tag, you'd be right, I did, and it was awesome.

This location is cleaner and larger than most, and though it doesn't have the Ms. Pac Man game like the Scottsdale and Thomas location, it does have flames painted on the walls and flat screen TV's which are almost always tuned to Fox News or some sporting event I don't care about. 

Another thing that has always intrigued be about this location is the walls.  The high walls are covered, mural style, with flames and boxers.  Yes, giant poorly painted flames and then black dudes boxing each other.  Why?  I don't know, and neither will you.

Sometimes my comrad and I will eat in, taking advantage of the beer special which are 2 dollar draft beers, all day, everyday which, by all accounts, wouldn't necessarily make it a \"special\" despite what the signs will tell you.  Long Wong's is really about the wings.  Most days I come in there is a line of people, all of them ordering wings, dozens, buckets, family packs, tearing at the bones, contemplating which flavor to get, licking their fingers.  I've only tried a few things off the Long Wong's menu: the wings, the fries, the hot dogs, and the burgers.  Seemingly there is a lot of other shit on the menu.  That's not important to me, the wings are the only worthwhile thing as most of the other items are reminiscent of slightly higher quality fast food with lettuce that is usually wilted.  Long Wong's carries a variety of wing flavors; teriyaki, asian garlic, Cajun, mild, medium, hot, suicide and my flavor of choice: SUPER suicide.  I think there are more.  I don't even know if \"asian garlic\" is really on the menu but it seems like it would be.

The thing about Long Wong's wings is that grabs me is that they're mostly heat.  It's not the flavor I love, it's the back of your throat, back of your tongue, lip burning heat.   I'm a sucker for the heat or anything that make me cry (like my life).  They serve the wings with Ranch, not Blue Cheese which seems more appropriate for these wings anyway.  The Ranch is good there too, not over done or spiced up by something, just a thin, normal, restaurant Ranch which they don't charge you for like some places.

They are horribly liberal with the sauce, dousing your order of plump wings in a thick, orange sauce touched slightly with chili seeds.  These are, by far, the sauciest wings I've had.

After each bite of a Long Wong's wings it looks like you killed a bunny or some other small, cute animal with your bare hand.  The sauce gets under your fingernails and the burn stays on your hands even after a run under water.  You must scrub, with soap, to rid your skin of that unique wing smell and the stain of the orange sauce.  Don't do anything sexual after eating Long Wong's wings for at least 12 hours.

There is one thing about this location which I go to that, for some reason, always seems to put a damper on my wing eating, beer drinking frenzy.  That is the grey, mustached owner who always seems to be annoyed by all the service he's getting.  I imagine this guy to be the owner based on assumption and his naturally ownery vibe.  

Long Wong's on Stapley and 60, despite the Angry Successful Business Owner, is one of my favorite Mesa spots and is a true testament to what good, true take out wings SHOULD be.  Even if you don't like them hot you can appreciate the honey bbqs or the Arizona chili flavor or even the blue cheese ones.  Plus, a 7.99 combo that gives you a dozen wings, fries and drink is, like, super reasonable especially considering the quality.  I have grown fond of the new, exciting fliers placed up periodically in an attempt, I assume, by the Angry Successful Business Owner to become even MORE successful, thus more angry.  Lately I've noticed they're doing karaoke on Friday nights and 25 cent wings on Tuesdays.  Long Wongs has helped me come out of the closet as a wing enthusiast so no longer will I hide my bones in my top nightstand drawer.  I will proudly leave them chewed and dried up for all the world to see and get grossed out by."}
{"text":"If you're going here for the wings, you will not be disappointed, and I am VERY PICKY about my wings. I really only eat here and at Native New Yorker because their wings are crispy instead of soggy, without nasty bread crumbing or coatings of any sort, just wings and sauce.

But sadly, everything else is kind of mediocre. Then again, why go to a wing place for fries or a burger?

Also, the decor is hideous in the best kinds of ways. It has a creepy charm to it, I love that about this location!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is better than Peter Piper, very yummy I can eat it all my life ! The owner is a very sweet man and there is a pool table and 25¢ arcade :)"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch after hearing a co-worker talk about it and decided to check it out. Pretty small restaurant. Service was pretty fast for the lunch hour, and the person who took my order was very courteous. The food, however, did not impress me at all. My wings were drenched in sauce and there were about three sad-looking, soggy carrot sticks in there as well. The fries were pretty bleh. I think the soda I ordered was the tastiest part of my meal, to be honest. I'm giving it two stars because the service was good."}
{"text":"Extremely addictive comfort carnival food all day everyday at long wongs! Really cool decorations all around the property. What a unique place to stop and feel good aft ward. I liked that the people were very up beat and helpful when taking my order because I am very particular. The restrooms are handicapped friendly which made it very easy to maneuver. They were also very clean and also smelled good! Please like this review if you found it helpful so I can see it on the top and earn a badge for being awesome! Thanks everyone who reads this,now go enjoy some delicious wings y'all!"}
{"text":"Great food and Great service.  Had a special request and it was no problem. Ty was PERFECT! A little hidden gem everyone MUST visit. On Granite Reef and just north of McDowell ... 1617 N Granite Reef."}
{"text":"We went there because of the ridiculous stuff that they had outside their building, and the inside was no different. But it was fun to go to. It's known for their hot wings, but the burgers that we ordered were amazing! Also the wings were drenched in sauce and tasted really good as well. It was a fun place to eat at, definitely recommend it for the wings and burgers."}
{"text":"If you love going to dives with great food, eclectic decor, and great prices, this place is a must. By food I mean hot wings. The wings here are excellent. The fries were average but the quality of the wings make up for any drawbacks. I wish Long Wongs expanded to LA. On second thought maybe not because I would be in trouble. If your looking for your hot wing fix in Phoenix, look no further."}
{"text":"Super nice staff.  Wish they had a few healthier selections but otherwise the food is okay and the price is right."}
{"text":"My first time eating here, I gave chance to try the Wings - BBQ. And I loved it. Finish the Wings with a messy face, and licking my figures off from the BBQ. 
 Definitely would come back if I'm near long Wongs."}
{"text":"The wings are good here (at least the hubby hasn't complained), and priced reasonably, however, the pizza is just not my cup of tea.  Too much crust and the tomato sauce is I think, just canned tomato sauce.  I could only finish one piece, it was flavorless and I am now awake at 2 am, still feeling the dough in my guts.  Thus would be a fine pizza for serving a group of drunk people who aren't chipping in, though as they would be filled up and wouldn't care too much about the taste.  

We will keep going for wings, the takeout system is good, but I am regretting still the choice to try the pizza. :("}
{"text":"Tried the wings and they are yummy! The beat park is that they are super crispy and well seasoned. I really enjoyed the lemon pepper ones (this is a dry wing with a spice rub). The garlic parmesan are NOT dry...I actually thought they would be and didn't ask, but they have a creamy sauce on them. I asked for mile wings too, but it seems I got them naked with no sauce, I'm thinking it was just an error. That was my reason for keeping the rating at a 3; I purchased 50 wings and of the total 30 we're supposed to be mild hot wings, so it was kind of a bummer that most of our wings had no sauce. Make sure to check before you leave if you make an order, it woulda been a quick fix."}
{"text":"Long Wong's has never let me down . The pizza and wings are on point and the atmosphere is so strange and cute. Love it. I haven't been here in a year and had to try when I came back into town. It's the same as it's always been. The only thing that has changed is that they no longer sell flan. Makes me a little sad but it's alright! I wish they would wipe the outside down more. Everything is a little sticky. I still return every time I have a craving for long wings :-)"}
{"text":"Famous!!!   omgosh!! the wings!!!  you cant go wrong with an order of Super dooper delicious Chicken wings!!  Finger lickin good!!
no matter what flavor they are crispy and fresh! love this place!!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day so my roommate and I decided to finally give the place a shot. Needless to say the best thing about this place is the name (and I guess prices--but remember you get what you pay for!). The wings made me sick, were super greasy, and the hot sauce was just ok. Their fries were super crispy, way too salty, and the food didn't come out at the same time for the whole table. The seats looked and felt disgusting, and I was really disappointed! I wanted to like the place, but I won't ever be going back."}

After 20 min I hang up call back guy answers \" long wongs 60& stapley\" i say \"hey man just need to place that order for pick up \" and the guy hangs up on me. I will never spend another dollar at this place"}
{"text":"I just posted a review on the fact that these long time flavored chicken wings are awesome. But I wanted to add that I was in professional baseball for 10 years and I ate chicken wings in all sorts of places in all different cities all around the country, particularly in the minor leagues. And I always loved coming home to Long Wong's wings, the best in town! I am still sure to go there sometimes like I did the other night."}
{"text":"The wings here are amazing. Other menu items like onion rings or fried mushrooms... not so amazing. This place has character. You feel like you need a tetanus shot after you leave. The staff are friendly and most likely prison parolees. Get your order to go and you'll be happy. There be strange people that frequent this place."}
{"text":".I ordered the pizza and 2 dozen wings for me and a friend.  The wings weren't cooked as I asked....they were very wet rather than extra crispy and they gave only two small plastic cups of ranch, you know the ones I'm taking about, can't even fit the tip of a wing in the cup. After 8 wings the ranch was gone. 

As for the pizza...it is NOT fresh...I think it's actually a frozen pizza.  Was horrible and I couldn't even eat more than one slice...waste of my money.

The place is very dirty. The kitchen is falling apart, it makes me gag just looking at it. The dining area is filled with too much junk. It would be better if they take half the junk out of there and rid themselves of those old and unused arcade machines, broken toys and clocks and sun bleached decorations.
Dusting is not a priority. If a big gust of wind comes in when someone opens the door you better cover your food.


I think the only reason this place is somewhat busy at times is because there really isn't any other place in the immediate area. I also think people go there because it USED to be good."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. The wings are slimy and the atmosphere is dirty and grimy. If you enjoy having constant stomach aches followed by a bathroom explosion, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their wings! The sauces for wings and their prices definitely knock out the competition. The staff is usually busy and I never wait much longer than what's expected! The size of the wings seems to be an issue with some, but to me they are the same size most places have for wings. I would definitely recommended this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 13 years. Long Wong's is known for their famous hot wings and decor! You'll find yourself in awe when you step in. Make sure to take some time to enjoy the awesome set up throughout the front entrance. I love their hot wings, fries and pizza!"}
{"text":"I passed by this place a few times but could never catch it while it was open.   The massive sign in the front caught my attention and a Phoenix native told me the place used to be the best wings in Phoenix.   Finally one night I made my way to long wings and ordered some wings.   To my surprise their menu had Much more than wings.    Pretty much everything you would want,  from hot dogs to cheese fries to a wide variety of carnival foods.    The wings were pretty good.   Nothing spectacular,  but definitely worth a re visit.  Seasoned good and nice sized.    Not to big,   Not to small.   The place is also interesting on the inside.   Memorabilia from the 50's to present.   Posters of everything from the 85 bears to historical baseball players."}
{"text":"These are hands down the best wings in the valley, and have been for many years. Often imitated, but never as good as the original. The service is great and the place is simple, but clean. Wait times depend on the current rush during meal hours and sports events, but it's well worth it. I've never been disappointed at the flavor nor quality and they give you plenty of sauce. Not only do I brag about this place when out of state, it's my gold standard for wings. If you're reading reviews to decide on this place, do it. Your taste buds will thank you for the best wings in the valley. Pizza is meh, but the wings are the best!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times, always noticing the exterior's bright & vibrant decor. 

My partner & I decided that since we'd be passing Long Wong's again on our way home, we'd finally give it a shot & placed an order for pick up.

The order was ready right on time. You pick up to-go orders outside through a walk up pick-up window. We got a large pizza, a dozen wings & chili fries. We were very impressed with the pizza, it exceeded our expectations. The wings were also very tasty, I would've liked mine a bit more crunchy, but I'm sure they are probably a bit better when dinning in. The chili cheese fries were tasty as well, the chili more than anything, the fries could've been a bit more well done, but what we didn't like was the nacho style cheese on the fries, next time we will request shredded cheese."}
{"text":"Well I had high hopes for this place. But the wings were over-cooked, a bit chewy, and nothing to write home about. It's as though they take Frozen wings from Walmart and throw them in the oil and then just slap on generic hot sauce. The redeeming value is that the food is cheap which is probably the reason they were probably so many people there. For $14 my husband and I got a dozen hot wings, a cheeseburger with french fries, and an order of onion rings."}
{"text":"This place was very dark inside, I realize that this is just the take out / lunch area and I didn't see the bar/resturant part.     But,  I don't understand why my boneless wings don't come with sauce on them. Instead I got a side of sauce of the honey BBQ to dip them. I would have to say that that theirbwings are not as good as Native NYR."}
{"text":"This eclectic dive takes \"pieces of flare\" to a whole new level! From the outside-in, it's littered with memorabilia, posters, and toy collections reminiscent of a baby boomer acid trip. After stumbling upon this place a couple years, I went back with much enthusiasm to the UYE: Wing Fest at Long Wongs.

I give the restaurant itself a 5 star rating for uniqueness. It seems to have pretty deep roots in the community, as lots of families poured in on a Friday night. Many came for the take-out. The parking lot outside is not very big, so it can be a tad hectic with folks coming and going. Near the front door, I think we saw someone selling jewelry. Not creepy \"van guy\" jewelry, but a nice lady with her kids interacting with customers. It is not your usual scene here, and I liked that.

I WISH I could have given the food more stars. But, frankly, the wings were lacking in meat. The BBQ sauce we got was ok. I did like the inferno flavor (it was more like a medium/hot level of heat). The wings themselves were mostly bone and gristle, and without amazing flavor to supplement, weren't up to par with other valley wing spots. We also ordered the deep fried zucchini, which I rather liked. But hey, I'm a sucker for deep fried *anything*. Also, the Pepsi is free refills, so that was a plus.

I do recommend you grabbing a few friends to check the place out. It's a neat restaurant and the food won't disappoint you. Just don't go in with too high of expectations."}
{"text":"Long Wong's has decent wings and great customer service when doing take out. Everything that you could possible want, i.e., extra BBQ sauce, napkins, carrots, etc are always there. The wings are good and fairly priced. I've had the burger and it's nothing to get too excited about, so stick to the wings.

This place has a lot of nick nacks all over the place. Your eyes will be constantly amazed at all the stuff they have crammed into this place. Some people call this collection eclectic, I tend to agree with that description. And of course, the name Long Wong's is a funny name that conjures up a lot of snickering and off color jokes.

In conclusion, I say this place is A-OK to hang your hat and enjoy some wings."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of wings or fried food, it was the only place open at 9:30 on a Sunday night, I got a salad, it was nothing special, most everything they serve is food-service that they just throw in a deep fryer. Not my type of restaurant, but for a divey sports bar is okay."}
{"text":"OMG....just had the BEST wings ever!...for a few years now, people have been telling me about them and I always wanted to try.....just kept forgetting. Today we felt wings...this place came to mind and we finally tried it..!  So glad we did....just sad it took us so long.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"What was I thinking?  I've seen Long Wongs in various locations throughout the Valley for years, and never have been. I finally went, and wish I hadn't. The experience wasn't too jarring or regrettable, but I would have been better off without. 

The neighborhood is sketchy, the decor is gaudy, the atmosphere is a little rowdy and a little too casual.  The wings were severely burnt and very dry.  The BBQ sauce was extremely mediocre and a bit too sweet.  The pizza was just okay... At least it was recently cooked.  The employees seemed helpful and friendly though.  I can now say that I've been there and done that - - but I wish I couldn't."}
{"text":"These are by far the best wings I've ever had! I was a strong believer in BWW until they stopped doing traditional wing Tuesdays, which is when I knew I had to find a new wing place. Great service, cute fun environment, and of course great wings! Very affordable. They have other things on the menu that I also intend to try. I gave 4 stars because they had a limited number of sauces but I could tell they were working on creating more! They've earned a life customer!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often, but when I do, it's because I've received extremely bad service. The Long Wong's at this particular location is absolutely terrible. When I made the order over the phone, the guy said \"go ahead and make your way on over.\" Not a time frame or anything, just come on over. Well, my girlfriend and I didn't believe that statement at all, so decided first to stop by the local Wal-mart, grabs some things we needed and then we'd head on over back to Long Wong's. We were at Wal-mart for a total of 25 mins and decided to head back on over expecting our food to be ready, or at least close to being ready. No, not at all. We showed up, and waited for another 30 mins inside. Funny thing is, this exact thing has happened to me before - you'd think I'd learn my lesson  about coming back here again. Well, this time around I have, and have also decided to give them a nice little review. If you enjoy poor service, expensive-mediocre food, and waiting an hour to get it, come to this location, they excel in this!"}
{"text":"When I first moved the Valley of the Sun, back in the mid-90's, my wife and I used to frequent a place called the Native New Yorker. Now, I know - the Native New Yorker is still around, but not like they used to be. You see, back in the day (wow - I'm sounding old) the Native New Yorker was known for one thing: Wings. That's because their wings were....wait for it....10 cents each. That's right - 10 cents. 15 cents if you wanted to upgrade to honey BBQ. So it was not uncommon to sit down and have tables around you with mountains of wings. We would settle in with friends and buy 100 wings (for $10!), then eat our way to a glorious food coma.

Now, I realize those days are long gone. After all, it was 20 years ago and now wings cost more per pound that breasts. Knowing this, I still cringe when I go somewhere and have to shell out $9 for 6-8 wings. Call me cheap (You wouldn't be the first). So I was happy to find Long Wong's on Thomas. No they're not 10 cents, not even close, but they are pretty cheap and they deliver better than average flavor.

Located on the SE corner of 7th Avenue and Thomas, next to an abandoned mini-mart, this run-down, garish pink shack serves up a variety of wings along with a number of other favorites.

Now if you're looking for a reasonably clean, nicely furnished eatery with some ambience, then don't go here. As another reviewer noted, the restroom is locked with a padlock. With all due respect, I probably wouldn't want to eat here - this is strictly a take-out dive. But don't let that scare you. Come for the food - you'll be glad you did.

On this last visit, I ordered a dozen BBQ wings. I had asked them to go light on the sauce, as they sometimes have a tendency to go a little overboard. They still went overboard. The wings were drenched in a sweet, tangy BBQ sauce. I wiped what I could off and enjoyed every single bite.

I also ordered a side of vegetable fried rice. It was a healthy portion (healthy is probably not the right word) that is probably intended to serve a small family. I ate about half of it. It was delicious - almost as good as the fried rice that my mom makes. And that means a lot.

They also have standard lunch menu items - burgers, fries, etc. but with all the wing choices, don't bother.

All in all, I am happy that Long Wong's is around to provide a great value on better-than-average wings. They provide food like your mom might make (if your mom was an elderly Asian woman) at a fair price. And they do care about making you happy.

Don't let the building scare you - order up and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since the 80s when they opened, we used to hit the place before the Friday night bar hop.  No matter what the other reviews say, I still think this place has some of the best wings I've ever had.  I will drive across the city 21 miles for their wings."}
{"text":"This is the best Long Wongs out there!!!
I'm just stating my opinion as far as how good the food is. Anyone who gives a bad review solely I'm there wait time should be ignored."}
{"text":"Wings? Good lawd
Burgers? Serviceable
Pizza? Good goes with the wings
Decor? I love their style
Specials? They anyways have them, and they are always random. (That's a good thing)
Entertainment? Bring your quarters boiz, they have old school arcade games!
If your looking for 5 stars fancy food, go else where. This is a legit pizza and wings joint with excellent food."}
{"text":"Pretty awful. I went by for the Wednesday boneless wings special for $6.99. Price for that is up to $8.99. Ok fine, I was there already. The bigger disappointment was the food. Their version of boneless wings is as follows: previously breaded and fried chicken breast cut into strips then refried and tossed in sauce. They did not seem fresh, were soggy, and not the bite-sized treats I craved. Plus, the place is dirty. I didn't finish my lunch. Seemed too risky."}
{"text":"I'm here cause my husband did a pit stop. Not for picky eaters. Hole in the wall. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"New to town. Great wing spot for a quick bite to eat. Fun atmosphere with a few games running! Check it out"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of hype about this place, so perhaps my expectations were too high. I wasn't really impressed with the food. The atmosphere is very cool though!"}
{"text":"Oh how do I crave the food from this Long Wongs. The wings flavor is amazing and their fries are very tasty. I will say that they have the best ranch dressing I have ever had.  I crave this on the weekends a lot, that's how good it is.

I was going to give this a 5 star because the food is tastes great but recently the size of their wings has decreased immensely. They used be big and have lot of meat on them but now they are small with hardly any meat. Last night was the smallest i have ever seen a wing. Super small, I was amazed that they would even serve them as a whole wing it should have been 2-3 wings = 1 wing.  I wish now i had taken a picture of it. Oh well."}
{"text":"Come on seriously you close at 10pm and grill is off no pizza what in the hell is going on here absolutely ridiculous  got customers walkin out smh"}
{"text":"I love this place good awesome wings spicy honey bbq are the best for me, specially Sunday's for football or when ever I feel like eating some awesome wings"}
{"text":"Great place for wings. Simple menu, Good deals. My boss and I normally go there for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 6pm Friday, and it was closed. What?!?  I'd been in last week and was happy they opened this location. I understand maybe you don't have a full staff when first opening, but you have to have Fri/Sat evenings covered. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ordered hot wings value meal. Wings over cooked and hard and too much salt. Fries were decent but wings were so bad I will never go back. I can make them better myself"}
{"text":"I remember moving here about 5 years ago wondering what the heck is Long Wongs.  First thought of course was Chinese food, but boy was I surprised when people were talking about their wings.  Chinese people don't eat chicken wings!?  Well, behold my friends they serve burgers and fries too - whoa! (Joey Lawrence)  I must say this local chain is pretty cool.  This particular location showcases a lot of pictures of local patrons on their walls.  It's a little pooper kinda place, but I'll survive.  They definitely have some ba-donka-donk butt and thunder thigh items on their menu!  If you need some decent take out food by all means, enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ordered a dozen garlic Parmesan wings and a order of fried zucchini. Although they weren't the worst wings I've had, they definitely were no where close to being the best. The wings were cold, probably due to the gallon of wet sauce they were covered in. The zucchini was burnt. I was skeptical pulling into the parking lot because it looked like a carnival. Let me just say it looked the same way inside. The dining room was covered in carnival toys and looked like they haven't dusted in years. They had hand made menus all over the place. We also had a homeless visitor come in to our table and ask for money so he could eat. One word for this place YUK!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend who raved about their Wednesday boneless wing special-18 boneless wings, fries, and a drink for $9.99. Subsequently, I just had to try it. 

1st try: Called them around 7pm on a Wednesday to confirm the special and to ask for hours of operation, in which they did confirm and told me 8pm. So I arrived there at 7:34pm, and were shocked to find that they were closed. 

2nd try: Called them again around 7pm to make sure they'd be open. The person answering told me 7:45pm this time. This time, I showed up at 7:15pm, and to my delight, I did not find a closed shop. I ordered the the special that I came for and was given one choice of over a dozen sauce options. Food came out fast and everything was good. However good it was, do not expect anything of high quality."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and they are fast. The wings were crispy and they weren't frugal with the sauce. I liked the celery and ranch too. I put buffalo in my celery and eat it up."}
{"text":"Weak.  This place is a far cry from the Mill Ave. location in Tempe.  Gone now.  Long Wong's quality is lost on this place.  I had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after I ordered.  Bad, bad, bad.  Wings have always been decent, but there's really no reason to go there ever again."}
{"text":"Had the Hot BBQ and Teriyaki wings....

The wings, while crunchy were dry and soaked in the sauce...really bad.

I got gut sick about an hour later. No way, Jose...never set foot in this dump again."}
{"text":"Long Wongs. How do I Love your Chicken Wings. Well these are pretty near heaven. The price seals the deal. Really don't need to say much else. Oh their Cupcakes rock and the Cheese sticks too. They sell other things too but why? Not so keen on the $5 12\" pizza though. Ugh."}
{"text":"Having some friends over for a party?? Stop by Long Wongs for some quick delicious wings. 50 wings for under $30. You get to choose two flavors so I picked hot and teriyaki. The hot weren't too spicy but had just the right amount of flavor. The teriyaki were delicious!!! The wings come with a baggie of sliced carrots and a heap of ranch dressing. 

There isn't much to the inside of the restaurant. The menu items have all been printed on computer paper and taped to the wall. There aren't any chairs or tables so it's pretty much take-out style. I've only been there once so I have yet to try any other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Not busy trash cans full. Wings were small and gross. And the employees were very unprofessional and cussed alot. No respect for customers. We're out of almost all soda. Didn't refund money right after we payed because we wanted to change our order and pay more for a better deal. First time comming here. Will have to try out phoenix location. Hopefully better"}
{"text":"Best wings, hands down. If you're just craving wings, Long Wongs is your spot. I've only been to this location and I typically do call in orders. Quick and easy. Eat some wangs!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious greasy buffalo wings. It's a pretty crazy lookin' place but it will satisfy the most vicious wing craving. This is a hole in the wall you tell your friends about!"}
{"text":"Long wongs never fails! Whenever I'm hungry I like to stop by this locally owned place for the wings and burgers they are very good!!! Will always continue to come here! They never disappoint !"}
{"text":"I really like the wings. They have a ton of flavors and they're crisp and delicious. I dislike slimy wings like most places serve so these are great. Service is friendly and locations are convenient."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The wings we ordered were dry and difficult to eat.  Don't know whether they were overcooked or had just been sitting there for a while but they were basically inedible.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"we used to go to the Chandler store until a recent trip yielded bad food and VERY slow service.  
W found this one and I talked the wife into lunch,  MUCH BETTER!  fast service. Owner Mike helped us and food was awesome. Wings were good size and had plenty of sauce on them.  Shop Was clean and we both ate wings and soda for $19
we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Phoenix this was THE place to go to get wings! Before their redecorating back in 09' it was very \"cozy\" and very \"loud\" (I'm saddened to see it \"toned down\" after the redecoration) on the outside.

This is THE place to go for a great deal on wings. 12 for $5? 50 for $24? Hell yeah man! They deep-fry them perfectly - they're still juicy in the middle; the mild, medium, hot, suicide, teriyaki, bbq, honey hot, is really delicious. My family and I love mixing up the teriyaki and medium sauce to give it a great sweet/hot/tangy flavor.

When I moved to Tempe, I missed the place; and the other ones - Mill (even though they closed, I still tried them)? Scottsdale? Mesa? Uh, no. Nowhere NEAR as fantastic as compared to the first and original Long Wongs in Phoenix, AZ. I've even ate at the Long Wongs Bars and Grills - the prices were too much for me, 6 for $5? No thanks. I love it as they also take your food to your seats, but always remember to clean up after yourselves! The trash can is the huge Hippo statue by the door ;) The staff and owners are really awesome and sweet, I love playing Pinball and the old retro 80's arcade games while waiting for my food.

The second best Long Wongs I would have to give props to is the one on Indian School Rd - we found this other gem while the original Long Wongs was still remodeling (and they had given a list of other locations)."}
{"text":"Basic hole in the wall greasy fried food.  Really good prices.  Can be a bit slow and can get pretty crowded.  I have only tried their wings and some of their fried items, not the burgers or pizza.  Overall mediocre food, but a pretty good deal if you are feeding a large family or group."}
{"text":"Wings were old and dry and gross. Burger was burnt to a crispy and loaded with beyond old lettuce.They forgot the zucchini and mushrooms but im sure they would have been equally gross like everything else. This place is disgusting. If you wouldn't eat this food yourself then don't serve it to your customers."}
{"text":"SUPER fast wings! This is our go to wing stop for fast wings, done ASAP. They charge for extra ranch, just a heads up. Haven't really tried anything else on the menu, other than the wings. The price is feasible, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!! OMG!!! There was a HUGE COCKROACH in our wings! The wings we had already been eating from!! I wish I could have got a pic but the lady took it from us once we showed her. This roach was at least 3 inches long. Almost the size of the wings. I guess that's why it just blended in with the wings. I still can't get the nasty feeling out of my mouth. No amount of mouth wash is making me feel any better. They were extremely apologetic and did refund my money, but who doesn't check the food they send out? UGH!!! Also, the soda was flat. (like that even matters at this point)"}
{"text":"There are few places that do comfort food as well as Long Wongs. 

This isn't a first date kind of place - there must be a clause in the Long Wong franchise that stipulates that any Long Wongs needs to be a complete and utter dive. I've never seen a single reputable looking LW establishment, but don't let the appearance deceive you - Long Wongs is a diamond in the rough.

The piece de resistance of every Long Wongs is their chicken wings. I'd like to believe that nowhere else on the planet could you find a more perfect blend of crispy, saucy, tasty wings. I've never had wings anywhere else that came close to being as good. I've tried most of their flavors, but my favorite is Honey Mustard. It's a perfect blend of sweet, spicy, sticky goodness. Other great flavors are Teriyaki, Honey BBQ, Honey Hot, and Medium.  

I've had their deep fried zucchinis, mushrooms, and their corn dogs (Foster Farms) and they're all delicious.

A dozen wings for $7-8 bucks isn't a bad deal at all. I've done larger orders for family get-togethers and work potlucks and the wings consistently get rave reviews. If you want good wings, you're not going to find anything better and you'll only end up paying more, save yourself the trouble and go to Long Wongs.

I'd recommend phoning in your order ahead of time otherwise it can be a 10 minute wait (and make sure you have the correct location).

If you can get over the fact that the restaurant looks like (and actually is) a shack, you'll be delighted at what they serve up. It's certainly worth a try, and I doubt they'll disappoint."}
{"text":"Long Wong's is awesome,
Love the decoration and the staff.
The fatass burger is very tasty and juicy.
Their wings are always on point.
I love eating here"}
{"text":"No, the \"quaint\" building on Thomas doesn't look like a 5 star restaurant, but they've got the best wings I've found in Phoenix.  By far.  Oregano's, Buffalo Wild Wings, none of them compare with the greasy, spicy, juicy perfection of Long Wong's wings.  And they've got great prices.  My family of 4 will frequently order the bucket of 72 wings, for only $32.52.  For those of you who are curious, that's only 45 cents a wing!  Every day of the week!  We love the Hot and Honey Hot in particular, but all are delicious.  Although, the BBQ and Garlic Parmesan are a little too sauce-y for me.

Some others have criticized the service; I've never had a problem.  That being said, they do seem to have a limited staff.  Every time I've gone the same man and woman have been managing the restaurant.  It does get crowded around dinner time and there isn't really a clear system of lines for those who are picking up and those who are ordering.  Also, when they're busy you may not be able to call ahead.  Superbowl Sunday the phones were constantly busy so I ended up having to go in and order there, then wait.  But overall I've found the service to be just fine and the staff to be pleasant.

Not a place for a romantic dinner, but if you wanna see how comfortable you really are with your SO, take them here and watch each other stuff your faces with wing-goodness.  Yum"}
{"text":"Been away from the valley 15 years, really miss this place! Yes this location is small and dark. Yes, the wings are still delicious and cheap! So is the beer. No the wings are not huge, they're also not $1 each! Service was fast and friendly. For me, you just can't beat a dozen spicy Bbq and curly fries at Long Wongs!"}
{"text":"Looking for the best deal, this is the place to go! I tried the garlic parmesan wings Amazing. This is my new favorite flavor. My son got the Bbq very good, the flavors are on point, service is quick. Absolutely will be going again, best wings ever and great price!!! $$$$"}
{"text":"Wings were good.... Way too much sauce on the wings. 
Very dirty!!!  Almost Gross- well-very gross.....I'm not afraid of gross as long as there are no bugs. (I did not see any). 
Funny part if my dining experience- I wanted 18 Wings:  1 order of 12 is 8.99 + order of 6 for 6.99 ( $15.89+tax) so I had to order 2 orders of 12 for (17.98 + tax).  That Asian lady in her PJs just didn't understand why that didn't make sense:(. paid with my Credit Card:  she charged me $197.00 -V- $19.00....... Ut-oh.... She didn't know what todo..... She ended up having to refund me cash back. Poor thing. 
I would go back, just need to pay cash and light sauces."}
{"text":"My favorite old faithful!! Been eating there since high school!! My kids have grown up loving it too! Its a family thing and always will be!!!"}
{"text":"The building doesn't look like much but the wings are great and the service was nice and friendly! This will be out new wing take out place!"}
{"text":"The wings at this LW were fantastic.  Not battered, but deep friend how they should be.  They were crispy and well done with a sauce that tastes fantastic (I got the hot).  From a wings standpoint, it totally gets a 4.5.  

I tried the ribs and they were pretty bad.  Everything else looked good though.  

If you want hot wings, this is the place to go.  I only wish they had some sort of hot-teriyaki sauce.  Oh well, can't be perfect."}
{"text":"Decent for the money, but not spectacular. Wings were overcooked and dry. 

The western bacon burger was decent. Bread was good."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of positive things about this place, so I decided to see what all the hype was about. I was very disappointed with everything. The wing sauce was mostly oil and didn't taste good at all. Save your money and don't eat here."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time and the food was really good.  I got 12 honey hot wings with salad and a drink for $7.95!  My friend got the steak and mushroom melt and it was delicious as well, she loved the frys 

downfalls - can't get any more than one flavor for 12 wings 
the place is fairly small and a little dark in the inside 
there was one television on, and it was fairly loud and sounded like one of the speakers was blown

Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has to be one of the worst places I have ever eaten at. It makes me angry that it has the positive reviews it has. I merely ate here because of the good reviews. I love wings and I'm always looking for new places to try. When I walked in, I was not impressed, it was very cluttered but I kept an open mind..I wasn't there for the view..I was there for the food. When I received my dozen wings,they came out on a Styrofoam 5-part throw away plate. The entire bottom was covered in oil and grease. The wings were fried past the point of being able to salvage any meat off of them. I couldn't even taste the sauce.. All I could taste was grease. I could only stomach eating 4 out of the 12. I ate two wings and two legs hoping i had a few bad ones... But I could clearly see by looking at them the whole order was uneatable. I thought about complaining, but it just wasn't worth my time or energy. I was completely shocked this'd place was busy and has the reviews it has. If you don't care how your food tastes, then I say this is the place for you, it's affordable and the staff is nice. But if your like me and have some standard to your food order... stay away from here, don't even waste your time or $7.00. It's a dump in more ways then one. I didn't even want to give it a star."}
{"text":"The Pros:
Food came out FAST
LOTS of food, and cheap too!

The Cons:
Everything that came out of the kitchen was premanufactured. Frozen fries, frozen wings, canned chili, canned cheese sauce. Wings were frozen and precooked so when they were cooked again for our order they were overdone. 

After many many years of driving by this building I finally came in. Not underwhelmed because my expectations were in the right place. If yours are, you will not be underwhelmed either. It's basically bar food but without the bar. Not the worst I've ever had by any stretch, but never a place I'd circle a date on the calendar for. I'd come back simply for the volume of food and price point."}
{"text":"Probably the worst place I have ever encountered in both food and service. 

First visit:
Called 15mins ahead and was told order will be ready in 10mins. Arrive and pay while waiting for another 15mins for order to be done. Not a problem. Got my food and my hunger fixed. Food was decent as it was just cooked wings are splattered hot sauces. Not bad. 

Second visit:
Called 30mins ahead to place an order. Arrive to pay and pick up. Cashier is not at the counter but in the back, behind closed doors, with 1 other guy joking around. The cook had to go get him to come to the counter. Whatever, I paid for the food and was told to wait, AGAIN. 30mins later, food is still not done. I went up to the counter and ask what is going on; I placed my order 30mins before coming here and now another 30mins wait? Guy at register told me that it's because the policy is \"Order will only be process until customer arrive to pay\" and that they have a new cook in the back; so if I let him go, I will be getting my wings in 5-10mins instead of holding him up here. Kind of rude, just kidding, it was rude. Whatever, I'm just really hungry at this point. By the time I got my food, I ran home and eat with my mom. 

I ordered: 
1 dozen of mild hot wings with salad and a medium drink. 
1 dozen of medium hot wings with fries and a medium drink. 

What I actually got:
1 dozen of medium wings with salad and no drink. I got 10 actual wings and the rest are little pieces-- see picture
1 dozen of mild wings with fries and no drink. 

How I feel:
Ripped off and pissed off. 


I will never be ordering from here ever again and I wouldn't recommend you to go here either."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing amazing in my opinion but absolutely satisfying! Cashier was friendly and had neat old timer games in the back. Also, great variety of food. The burger was just as good as the pizza and wings! I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"five stars for a joint like this? yeah. you have to know what you are getting into, as it wont be everyones cup of tea though. but if you want cheap sandwiches, hot wings, fresh baked deserts and PINBALL this is a great find"}
{"text":"I mean who doesn't love good wings! Best long wongs in phx that i have ate! Price is always on point!  Should get free wing just loving this place hahah jk just the pizza is not good hate to say...."}
{"text":"Best lemon pepper wings and buffalo wings as well, I love lemon pepper wings dipped in buffalo sauce, pizza is plain old pizza pretty good still, don't forget to get ranch! I love getting their cupcakes every now and then they happen to be less sweet than the store kinds which I love ! Best for take home place is a tad overwhelming for me but neat to look around and see all the souvenirs posted all over the wall"}
{"text":"Wow. Very delicious wings. The ribs were the best I had in a long time. Juicy and melted off the bone. And the fries! Mmmmmmm. Crispy, and deliciously greasy. We''ll be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 20 years.The food has always been delicious, the service was always great. Staff always treated me as family, happy to see me if I stayed away too long, that sort of thing. Thanks for years of great service."}
{"text":"Prices are good. Hot dog w fries $4!! However, Very salty hamburger. Watch out if you have sodium restrcted diet."}
{"text":"I don't get what the hype is about.  Their wings weren't good at all.  Their burger combos are very inexpensive, and honestly do okay in a pinch and on a budget, but you get what you pay for.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The most awesome experience I've had with wings came in Atlanta back in like 94' or something.  There was this little shack outside our hotel that sold a dozen wings for like $6 or something.  They were the best wings I've ever had.  Fried perfectly and with a sauce hot enough to know I'm eating buffalo wings but tasty as well.  We must have gone through at least 9 dozen wings.  No exaggeration.

Long Wong's wings are the first to remind me of that little shack.  Partly because it really is a little shack itself.  But the wings there are simple and effective, something that I haven't found in a buffalo wing since.

Sure the place is a dive, but what else does it need to be?  You're in the middle of Phoenix.  You're hungry for wings.  You don't need Native New Yorker type atmosphere.  You just need wings that are good and won't break the bank.  Long Wong's ain't pretty, but they fit the bill for some affordable and top-notch grub.

They've got some other things on the menu...a couple chinese dishes and some stuff that I can't remember now.  Its not important.  You come here for wings.  Oh, there are burgers that people seem to enjoy as well.  Maybe I'll check them out next time.  Little joints like this tend to have good burgers for some reason...nice and greasy!

Anyway, for under 7 bucks you can get a dozen wings.  If you're a kind person, the lady behind the counter can tell...she'll give you a free ranch.  If you come in there with an attitude or like the rest of the world is here to serve you, you get no free ranch.  She doesn't say much, she doesn't smile much, but she gave me free ranch.  So she's a saint in my book.
It took about 7 minutes to get my food, which is perfect when I'm on a quick lunch.  There was one other person in front of me, so that's really a good time frame.  I have to mention that it was cash only...don't know if this is all the time, but that day there was a sign stating no plastic.  A small inconvenience.  There's about 5 chairs in there so you'll probably be standing around while waiting.  I guess there is a back area you can wait in, too.  Though it looks as if you're not supposed to be in there or something.  

Got my little styrofoam container and got back to the desk.  I opened the lid and the smell of correctness filled my cubicle and drifted throughout the office.  The aroma took me back to that little shack.
Presentation was surprisingly included here.  They had the little red and white paper in there on the bottom of the container, and celery and stuff, too.  Nice touch.
I grabbed a wing.  It was crispy.  Heavy.  Big.  A real piece of chicken.  Not those mini-wing dings I've gotten at some inappropriate places.
Took a bite.  
Heaven.
I was back in Atlanta in 1994.
I was amazed and utterly pleased.  This was the buffalo wing I'd been patiently waiting for since the shack.  And I found it not at Native's.  Not Buffalo Wild Wings.  Not anywhere else but a little hole in the wall joint called Long Wong's.  
Life is full of quirky surprises.
Crunchy.  Even after they'd sat in the sealed container steaming while I went to purchase a beverage.
Juicy.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, no undone or overdone stuff here.
Tasty.  Delicious isn't a great enough word.  These wings were simply perfect.  The sauce (i saw the lady pour it out of one of many jugs they have in the back) is honest and humble and simple and real.  No frilly stuff.  No Sweet and Sassy this, or 5 Alarm that.  Just some good stuff.  I'd eat a tire if you fried it and put this stuff on it.
What more could you ask for?  There is nothing fancy about Long wong's whatsoever.  Just the perfect wings.  I noticed some awards posted around the joint for their wings.  Rightly so.  To get the best tasting wings in the city for this price makes this joint my new indulgence.  So long, diet.  Hello buffalo wing paradise."}
{"text":"Great prices, incredible food, fresh ingredients. My girlfriend and I tried this place since it's close to her house, and we were so amazingly surprised. The atmosphere is that of a mini-sports bar, with arcade games in the back for kids and TVs around the walls.

The pizza was incredible. The wings were amazing. And the cook came out to introduce himself and chat with us about the food and what we liked or disliked about it. We will most definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"You get your money's worth. The Wings will speak for themselves. The establishment's atmosphere is low-key and not hectic. Nice for those who want to chill and have a beer and Wings with their friends. Or for families who want a more down to earth, quiet place to dine in. You can choose to call-in your order. 

They have an online menu or a take home menu inside on the counter. Either way you can't go wrong.  I noticed some people have commented on the servers' attitudes. Which, with my experiences if you're cool with them they'll be the same with you. Not talkative with customers really, perhaps because their job is to cook it, ours is to eat it. Can't have a natural conversation with teenagers behind the counter anyway, but they do want your satisfaction.  

Which if you do have an issue the Manager seems to want to make it right, as well as the servers/cooks. But I personally haven't required any changes cause they  nail it right on each time.  People's tastes differ too so it's hard to justify with words unless you try it out yourself, which I would highly suggest. Compare the tastes/prices ratio to other Wing places. Long Wong's has them beat."}
{"text":"Garlic Parmesan, all drumsticks, extra crispy chicken wings were good the first time I tried them. The atmosphere has not changed in over a decade, which is a cool, funky, sixtyish vibe. The bathroom leaves a little to be desired - the paper towel to dry your hands is not inside the bathroom itself, but outside it just as you exit on the right. I will continue to make an annual pilgrimage to this place. The food is too rich for me to eat here regularly."}
{"text":"Love the food especially the wings they were crispy not dried out i will be back again"}
{"text":"First time I went here I ordered a Long Wong, BIG MISTAKE. The long wong was a hotdog smothered in EZ-CHEESE and tasted like cancer, so I avoided this place for awhile after. Later on I came back to try the wings and damn they were good! Well the suicide wings were, only ones I got. But for 12, they were cheap, LW's didn't skimp on the dip, and they had a good burn to them. Definitely worth the price if you don't feel like cooking and want to go out and get some cheap spicy wings."}
{"text":"Best Wings EVAR!

First off, I have a problem with wings that look like they came off a chicken who was given steroids everyday of it's life.  I also have a problem with tiny wings that barely have any meat on them (I mean who wouldn't).  At Long Wong's the wings are a happy medium.  Good amount of meat and the sauce is BOSS!!  

I've eaten at LW twice and both times was amazing.  This time we ordered the Mini Bucket (25 wings) and split the flavors: Medium and Spicy Honey BBQ.  Our friend ordered the hot.  The Medium sauce was very tasty with some bite and the Spicy Honey BBQ was on point!  So rich with the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  I tried a Hot from my friends plate and actually liked the Hot better than the Medium and I'm not spice junky.

We also ordered a side of fries to round the meal out and there was nothing special there.  They weren't bad, just ordinary.  Had a little seasoning on them but they were best enjoyed with ketchup and after you fill up on wings.

When in Phoenix and want wings this is my default.  Only complaint:  A place that sells spicy spicy wings should not be charging 50 cents for a darn soda refill."}
{"text":"Since it was National Chicken Wing Day lol, I decided to eat some wings. It was my first time eating Long Wong's and it might be my last. I'm still not sure. When u walk in, the cashier or whoever will just stare at you waiting for you to order instead of greeting you like a normal person would.  They did cook my wings extra crispy like I requested so that was nice. One question, were the wings taken from baby chicks or full grown chickens b/c those wings were small as hell!! Good thing I got 12! The fries needed to be cooked longer. I've never had fries that looked like they had hella seasoning on them but still bland until here. I'll more than likely stick to Buffalo Wild Wings from now on when if don't feel like making them myself"}

{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times now, it's always different people and none of them seem to know what they are doing. This time I went in at 4:30, I ordered a bucket of wings, 4 orders of cheese sticks, 3 orders of potato skins and 1 dozen boneless wings. At 5:20 someone came and said my order was almost ready then within 5 minutes came and told me they were out of potato skins and boneless wings. I was told they would refund my money for those things and give me 20% off the rest. The problem is I needed all that food to feed my family. Part of the order wasn't going to work. I had heard them talking in the back earlier about being out of potato skins but I assumed they meant after my order or they would have told me earlier. I also had to leave for work at 6:30 so had very little time to figure out what to get for dinner. I cancelled the order and asked if the refund would be immediately back in my account because I needed the money for dinner somewhere else and was told it would be. It wasn't. As I write this I still don't have the money back. I tried to call several times finally after the 5th try someone answered. I explained the situation he took my phone number and said he would call back. I have not heard from him. I like to support neighborhood business and I understand new businesses needing to work out some kinks but this was ridiculous. Poor management, poor customer service, poor communication and poor follow up. There are several other Long Wongs, I suggest picking a different one!"}
{"text":"This is the worst location of all the long wong's in the valley. We went and the hot wings were old, just re-heated with new sauce on it. Chicken was dark colored and chewy. My husband said he saw a bucket of cooked chicken wings just sitting on the counter. Unluckily, he told me after we ordered. We also ordered burgers and they were cooked medium rare. Bad, when it comes to hamburger meat. Never again! This particular location used to be good, but long gone are those days. I guess they have new management and dirty boys wearing skatershoes doing the cooking."}
{"text":"This place has really delicious wings. I come here every now and again for lunch with my co-workers. The wings aren't very expensive and the place is pretty easy to find from the road. Nothing in particular stands out about this place.

I'm wondering if the atmosphere is better at night. It's pretty dark inside and not too many people come by during lunch hours in my experience. If you're in the area and don't want something like Chick-Fil-A or In-N-Out but are looking in that price range, Long Wong's is a pretty safe bet."}
{"text":"amazing wings for a great price but i wouldnt eat there again its small and not the cleanest plus super squashed in there. but the ppl were nice and the food was made quick. the lil food place outside is nasty"}
{"text":"Since this was the only restaurant open late in the vicinity that wasn't fast food but that would accept an order for a hamburger over the phone to be picked up (plus not a major pain for parking), it rates a 5 star. The hamburger was delivered and devoured without complaints, so the food must have been good. 

Interesting exterior. I definitely should have taken a picture, but it was dark out and I figured that the effect would be lost.

If you need a reasonably priced hamburger and fries that isn't fast food, this is the place. Call ahead."}
{"text":"Food and prices: 5 stars 
Customer service: 1 star

As others have said don't even bother calling ahead. I called and ordered wings and asked how long it would take. The guy told me \"the sooner you get here the sooner you'll get them.\" I wasn't sure if that meant that they'd be done right away or they wouldn't start them until I got there. 

When I got there 10 minutes later and told them I was there to pick up my order they couldn't find it. After looking in the back on some random shelf they found my order and said \"we didn't know what this was.\" It was just an order for 25 medium chicken wings. It wasn't complicated at all but apparently the person that took the order didn't bother to let anyone know that I was coming. 

They said it would be just a few minutes while they got it ready and asked if I'd like a drink while I waited. I said I would and asked for Mr Pibb. Apparently it was a hollow offer as he ignored what I said and I never did get a drink. I didn't push it though because I saw the soda machine had two or three out of order flavors and one was what I wanted to drink, so I just sat down. 

Another couple was there and said they'd been waiting for half an hour for their food and the cashier didn't know why it was taking so long when they asked him. They were still waiting for their food when I left. It seems like they need a system for taking orders and getting them cooked and out to the customers. Whatever system they're using now doesn't seem to be working very well.

About 10 minutes after arriving to find my order hand't been placed they had my food ready. Their chicken wings are awesome and so is their ranch. The ranch comes with some carrot spears which some places have gone away from in favor of celery. I prefer the carrots so I really like that. They got my order right and it was nice and hot. The wings were good sized and all 25 were there. I've had some places short me a wing or two when I order more than a dozen. Long Wongs didn't, so that's a plus. 

The prices for their wings are really good and probably the best price for chicken wings you'll find on a day to day basis. The flavor of the wings is top notch as well. The customer service on the other hand... well, that's one huge glaring downside for this place. 

If you want a lot of chicken wings for a party or something you may want to consider somewhere else as you'll most likely end up frustrated with how they handle to go orders."}
{"text":"I have only visited the location on Thomas and 28th st. I usually go here for take out wings specifically the lemon pepper wings which are so good. The other flavor wings are pretty good too. The service is fast prices are cheap. Every now and then my wings can be a bit greasy from the fryer but it is fried so I kinda get it. I love wings and kings wings are good."}
{"text":"The place to go for a great, greasy cheeseburger and decent wings. I was most impressed with the quality of the bun on the burger. Very tasty like a brioche. Also, the decor looks very garage sale chic and the exterior is just crazy looking, in a good way. For $6, I thoroughly enjoyed my burger, wings, and drink combo. No, it's not a fancy nouveau premium hamburger place, but if you're looking for one on that part of Thomas Rd, you're possibly a crazy person, or hungover from your Quinceañera."}
{"text":"when you walk in its old school which is cool and the outside is cool but the food was medioca just a bit i would not give the a second shot now a different location maybe..."}
{"text":"I have given this place two chances. The first time I got their wings & some mozzarella sticks. While the cheese sticks were good, the wings were only ok. They were a bit slimy & were a bit bland, flavor-wise. I had heard a lot about Long Wong's wings being so great, but I was not impressed.

The second time was a complete disaster. I waited over 20 minutes for my food & when I did get it, everything was cold except for the burger. The fries were old & soggy. I ordered mozzarella sticks & there were two separate kinds of sticks in the take out box. Huh? Did they run out of one kind in the middle of the order or something? And the sticks were cold & did not taste good. My roommate got fried mushrooms & told me they were cold & not very good. The burger was pretty good, but everything else in the order was awful. And while waiting for my food, I had to listen to loud & annoying hip-hop music coming from the kitchen. That's very unprofessional.

I will not be going back to this (or any other) Long Wong's. Their wings are overrated & the overall experience just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Today was my birthday and my wifevtook me to this Long Wongs. Long Wongs has always been a favorite place for me to eat. My love for long wongs started as a kid. I would get excited when I knew I was going to get some of their wings. This excitement continues even to this day.

Their is just something about their wings. The sauce is great and instead of baking the wings, they deep-fry them.  Making them that much better, with a crisp out side and a juicy inside. 
And this Long Wongs did not let me down. And officers many new flavors of wings. All just as good.

Today I had the Inferno, parmesan and teriyaki wings. All had been wonderful. My wife like the teriyaki the best. Me, I loved the inferno. They have many other items on their menu however,  I have never had anything, but their wings. So I can not give my opinions on the other items. 

The service I received from the staff here is hit or miss. This is still a fast food joint, so this tends to be expected. People with good customer skills get hired on for more money at other places. While people with bad customer skills tend to get fired so you're always getting new people. So your quality of service is random. 

With all that said, I do find that the person's who are behind decorating this place must be some kind of Hoarders. The outside looks like a juck yeard for things the circus has thrown out. While inside looks like a horder ran out of space at home to keep his, or her junk and just started storing it atbthis Long Wongs. 

It is primarily because of this reason,  why I can't give five stars to a place with the best wings. Eating at a junkyard just is not very appealing at all. 

Pros: Great wings with lots of choices. 

Cons: service quality is random and I feel like I am eating at a junk yeard."}
{"text":"Husband and i love the wing! Have been coming here since i was in high school. Cannot complain have had no bad experience besides like all fast foods they forget something you order but that happens. Recommend the wings!"}
{"text":"Cleaner than most Long Wong's I've been to, but with some of the most brusque staff ever. Even the menu reads something like \"This is NOT fast food. Be patient!\" as if anyone would like to wait 20-30 minutes for items that aren't that tough to whip up. In any case, I love the wings...I don't think they're the best, but they're really close. The burgers are alright too, especially that California burger loaded with guacamole. At only $3.69, it's totally worth it.

For a sports bar, this place has some weird hours for a sports bar and grill. They're never really open too late. What a bummer--they'd get more business from me that way."}
{"text":"i love their wings but other than that i dont think the food is worth it and everytime have gone in the place looks dirty and idk how theyre still open. its super packed in such a small area, it smells and looks dirty. ive even seen people bring their animals in there which arent service animals... the ppl are nice though but i wont go in there again unless i want the wings then ill order it to go asap"}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Long Wong's on Mill back in the day.   Best wings in the Valley.  This Long Wong's lives up to my memories.  If only they would upgrade the swamp cooler in the back, this place might be worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite wing spot. I grew up going to the one in mesa and was stoked to find out they opened a location less than a mile away. I can't speak for anything but the wings(but let's be honest that's why you go to long wongs in the first place). Spicy ranch is my favorite flavor but I've tried most of the flavors now and they've all been solid. Their ranch is amazing as well, nothing worse than great wings with weak ranch. Service has always friendly and the spot has a chill atmosphere inside. Will definitely be frequenting this place more than usual as football season rolls around."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that after some quality hitches that I mentioned in my last review, Long Wong's is back to good!!  

I've been in several times since my last review and each time the pizza and Pepsi were perfect and the wings were amazeballs.  Seems they took note of the issues and corrected them, good on them!

If you haven't had Long Wongs wings then you really should try them.  In my humble opinion they beat all the other wing places, hands down."}
{"text":"Found this review in my drafts... It's been about 3 years since I went there.. Who knows if it's eve still open...was gonna delete but after reading it I remembered how mad I was and decided to post!

Worst customer service ever!  Called in to go order 30 minutes before got here to pick up and waited for 45 minutes for my order... Guy at counter either hates his job or just doesnt care about anything... People in and out never once did any staff  say hi or how can I help you and everyone had to wait at the counter for him to return because he was never standing there... Never to return..."}
{"text":"I stopped by Long Wong's today for the first time. I kept hearing things about how good they were here and there so I decided to give them a try. I tried the spicy boneless chicken in medium hot sauce and it was really delicious, I agree with the things I've heard. The workers were helpful and courteous. The building looked as if it was built by a single person as the first building ever built in the city of Phoenix, but it was clean and had a nice working air conditioner and TV. I agree with the reviewer that said this isn't a first date kind of place, but once you get tired of the hum drum family restaurant environments, try Long Wong's."}
{"text":"Anyone saying anything positive about this place is either drunk, high, or both.  

I am not a food expert or critic by any means, but I do eat a tremendous amount of pizza and wings.  The wings seemed like a great deal, and of course they're supposedly award-winning, so we got 2 dozen.  We ordered garlic parmesan and regular hot.  First and foremost, the wings are HALF the size of everyone else's wings.  What an extreme disappointment.  Both sauces were bland and boring.  The garlic parm was just a melted stick of butter and some sprinkles of garlic and parm.  The hot sauce was nothing more than a store-bought hot sauce.  All of the wings were way overcooked.

Oh you wanna hear about the pizza?  No, I assure you that you don't.  We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza.  We received a big bag of d1cks.  It's not delivery, it's not Digiorno, it's Long Wongs :(  The crust was chewy and flavorless, the sausage was pathetic little balls of crap you find on $0.99 frozen pizzas."}
{"text":"The place is a great place for wings burgers and friends. It is busy weekend nights and has a huge take-out following."}
{"text":"Long Wongs has long been known for good service, great pizza & amazing wings at a reasonable price and this location takes it to the next level."}
{"text":"Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!"}
{"text":"Wings were really great.  The Western Bacon Cheeseburger was good, but I picked it up 15 minutes late so I'll have to try it fresh to give it a more accurate review.  What really gave it 5 stars for me was the service though.  So polite and helpful, both over the phone and in person.  I will be a regular customer as long as they're in this new location.  I've watched several restaurants fail there because the property manager has never had a sign out on the street to help his tenants advertise better."}
{"text":"Finally decided to check this place out and it's nothing fancy but I would say it was worth the trip. Ordered the wings with bone in and they were pretty good!! Diner style and fun look on the outside and service was nice. Will come back again"}
{"text":"They used to have really good wings, not sure what happened. The pizza was also unimpressive. Bummer."}
{"text":"I've never ordered hot wings and received cold wings before until today. To sum up my thoughts in a quick four words....this place fucking sucks."}
{"text":"I wish we had the option to give no stars. I normally don't waste my time on bad posts or negative reviews but, I feel this is something I should share. Today I took my dog into the dog groomers next door. I do not live in the area so I tried to kill time around the area. I came back to the area and I still had twenty minutes to kill... There's nothing in the plaza to sit down and relax at SO I found Long Wongs. It was about 4pm so I didn;t want a filling meal because, I had to cook dinner for my family... I had my two year old with me so, I asked for a kids meal.. The lady I believe they call mama looked at me and said that's it? I smiled and said yes. She got very rude with me and said you need to spend 4 more dollars for me to take your card. I said fine can I get a slice of pizza? She said Okay you don't want a drink? I said no I had a tea in the car. She sighed at me and took my card. She said is this to go? I said No, I will be eating here. She said I don't let people eat here unless they spend 10.00. I said are you kidding? She said no but, since we aren't busy I will let you sit down. I HAD A TWO YEAR OLD WITH ME IN 120 heat mind you! Wow! So... I was a little irritated needless to say but, it was better than waiting in the car in the beginning of July... When our food came out... i was appalled! My two slices of pizza looked like Dignornio.... My daughters corn dog was BLACK... and her fries... Were DISGUSTING so DISGUSTING... They were tasteless. We took a few bites threw it away and walked out. I will never ever ever go back to this place. You never know who is going to walk through your door as a business and your impression lasts... I own a store in the area... When they asked for a good quick bite to eat... it will not be long wongs.... I can't believe how we were treated and served. Sad!"}
{"text":"We've been to Long Wong's on several occasions and have had reasonable luck with most of the attempts at eating the fare; however, the last (and it will be the last) time we went was for my fiftieth birthday dinner. 

He ordered a patty melt - which was extra greasy - and chili cheese fries which came out with no chili, no cheese... But! We did pay for the extras, just never got them. I ordered a mushroom and swiss burger and an order of fried mushrooms on the side. This last time was a real kicker to the intestines for both of us; he had to use several napkins to blot up the grease on his patty melt so it was edible, and his chili cheese fries were just fries. This was the third time he had order and paid for chili cheese fries and the third time we got home with our order sans chili/cheese...

After eating our mediocre birthday meal, things seemed okay. By midnight, we were both experiencing the side affects of food poisoning; the city sewer was busier than usual in other words. While his temporary dysentery had eased by lunch time the next day, I spent the night with cold sweats, vomiting, and passing out from the pain. My intestinal fortitude had seemingly burst from what we can only guess were noxious mushrooms. My illness lasted a gut-wrenching 72 hours.

We won't be spending any more money at this establishment. The fact that the place has all the visual distractions of giant metal animal statutes outside and more \" nostalgia\" on the inside, should be a clue that they don't want you paying afternoon to what you are eating. 

As Mr. Wonderful always tells me, if you have to dress something up that much to sell it, you are clearly trying to overcompensate for something else. 

Buyer beware."}
{"text":"I finally got around to checking this place out.  I got a dozen medium wings to go.  Very fast, friendly service, affordable prices and the wings were excellent. I live nearby and I have no doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"I love wings.. this place was just a-ok.. I would pick Buffalo Wild Wings (BW3) any day over LW's

It's cheap here tho 12 wings for $6.99

The wings were a hit and miss (mostly a miss) in my lunch today. (first time here) 

Disappointed since the reviews were GOOD so i had faith in this place..

The owner was nice and friendly not miserable like one other review said..

Dont think i will be back unless im craving wings (its right near my work)

Also puzzled that they only serve carrots and ranch with the wings.. Where did the celery and blue cheese go? (i requested blue cheese and they charged me 49 cents.. oh well so much for Long Wong's)"}
{"text":"So bummed, heard about this place for years and finally went. Was not a fan of how dirty it was I actually didn't want to put my purse anywhere than my lap! The bathroom is padlocked lol and was so small I just decided it could wait. The food was pretty cheap but still not worth the price. They gave me something different than what I ordered and I know mistakes happen, but once they gave me the correct one I realized the mistake was better! I was really unimpressed and actually a little annoyed. Only reason I give it two stars is because they handled my mistaken food nicely and quickly. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"The name is very deceiving but is actually a nice family owned restaurant (you'll notice right away that they're interested in customer satisfaction). Don't expect Asian food!!! This review is strictly for the 28th street & Thomas road location. 

THE PROS:
Great Location
Ample Parking and easy to get in and out of
Great service
Great Food
Very cozy and  friendly atmosphere
Unbelievably affordable
Video games, pinball machines and TV. 
Kids (and adults) will love it.
What else can you ask for?
I loved the buffalo wings, fried zucchini and bread pudding (plenty of napkins for the wings).
I  plan on making this place a regular stop.
It's even nice enough to bring a date.
If you leave unhappy, go back a second time.  

THE CONS:
Not open 24/7"}
{"text":"If you could imagine what a restaurant would look like if you gave someone acid and told them to do some interior decorating, I am pretty sure this would be the outcome.  The outside includes statues of geese, hippos, buffalo's,  and assortment of other creatures.  The inside is wall to wall with stuff from Humpty Dumpty to an American flag to totem pole.   If only the food compared with this quirky atmosphere...

Long Wong's gets one star because the FOOD WAS AWFUL.  I ordered boneless chicken wings.  They were so hard and inedible that I broke my plastic fork trying to stab one to pick it up.  I am not talking a little freezer burn here but am talking hard as a rock.  The medium buffalo wing sauce was hot but had no flavor.  I also had a hot dog.  The bun was super stale and fell apart as I tried to eat the hot dog.  

The Costco style tables were filthy.  My child's high chair table is cleaner after she eats than the table we sat at.

If you bring your own food and table, you can enjoy the atmosphere. Otherwise, I highly don't recommend."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service.  Its a family owned business and the people seem rough and rude but once you get to know them you realize it's just their strong personality.  They have the best wings in town and my whole family have been coming here for the past 16 years.  I have tried other places but nothing beats the wings here, not even buffalo wild wings which to my opinion not so good.  Family from out of state either come here to eat when in town or ask me to take them some when I go visit."}
{"text":"I've been too Long Wongs in Phoenix, but it's been awhile so I don't remember if they are all like this, but this place is seriously run down. Just about everything was dirty even crusty food bits in the condiment containers. Looks like on old, vacant warehouse inside. I gave it two stars because the burger was pretty good, though I am waiting to see if I get sick from it. Hopefully it stays down."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years. It's cheap, delicious and consistent. It's a guilty pleasure for sure. This place needs to be ranked higher it's the best Long Wongs to share the name in the Valley."}
{"text":"Like their teriyaki plates too bad it's so far away from home. Been going there for manny years."}
{"text":"I must say after my experience at this particular Long Wongs is that not all Long Wongs are created equal.  It wasn't bad. No, not at all. In fact, if I were to judge the food part of the experience against other popular chicken wing food experiences (i.e.: buffalo wild wings or native new yorker) (I don't think that I used the I.E. and parenthesis correctly there) but the overall experience was sub-par.  I felt uncomfortable in the dining area and there was a strange smell.  I will say that the service was amazing and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  If you are in the area and have 45 minutes to spare (in good traffic) (again not sure if i'm using the parenthesis correctly there) just drive to the mesa location which is... well it is better."}
{"text":"Been goin here for years an the only thing I can say is yummy yummy yum the menu is huge they got what you have a taste for ! Trust me this is noble plan wing spot. Very colorful and has a lot of history and cool item inside! Definitely a place to recommend!"}

{"text":"The wings were yummy and affordable.  They were teeny tiny though."}
{"text":"Man I really love this Long Wongs. I've been to a lot of different franchises but I think this one is the best. The wings are amazing the burgers and sandwiches are great and the pizza is really good as well. 

The atmosphere in this one is not so great though. It's not a great place to eat in at. The TVs are super tiny smaller than than a iPad and it's dark."}
{"text":"If you can get past your initial,\"Do I really want to go in there?\", you won't be sorry. They have your typical buffalo wings, but they also have some unique sauces, too. I never thought I would be gaga over honey mustard wings, but they are sticky, sweet goodies."}
{"text":"I've been to this Long Wong's a few times and have enjoyed the experience. Great wings, chill atmosphere with cool airbrushed flames on the walls, and friendly customer service. You get great food at a great price at this Long Wong's! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and I've gotten tried of their amazing WINGS! They have other great food hear, such as their cheesy potato wedges, but their wings are the main item hear and the prices are great. I do see a few people complain from time to time, so let me put it like this. If you're the type of person that needs their food cooked a specific way or expects it a certain way instead of just try it and judging it how it is, then you're going to be disappointed not only with this place but several others."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for over 10 years and absolutely loved this place but today with my to go order it was a different story. After we ate some of the food we noticed a baby cockroach in the box of wings. So so so gross. I did contact the health department and when they went to do an inspection it was clean but the inspector did say a lot of times they can't see the roaches because it's day time."}
{"text":"Growing up in Phoenix, I have always eyed Long Wong's while in the family car.  

\"Is it Chinese food?\"

No.

My friend Ann R. had taken me there yesterday for lunch.  She had claimed these are the best wings ever and I was a bit skeptical.  I had ordered the Honey-Hot and my friend got Medium.  Upon first bite, it was pure bliss!  The wings were deep-fried perfectly and the sauce had me burning up with a sweet after-taste.  I also like how there's not too much vinegar in the sauce.  Food is brought to your table by a super friendly staff and then once you're done, you get to throw your trash into a giant hippo statue.  What?!

It's a bit small, definitely more hole-in-the-wall but not dumpy.  It's cluttered with lots of cool stuff to look at both inside and out.  Take your time and wander the premise!  Do try to avoid the bathrooms though.

This is by far the best place for wings!  If only they'd kick out annoying high school brats and the old creepers that gets too friendly...  XD!"}
{"text":"I first had Long Wong's in the middle of a 28 hour shift.  I was starving, it was somewhere around 10 pm, I'd missed dinner, and the hospital cafeteria wasn't going to be open for two more hours.  Luckily I had some family members in town who brought me a burger from Long Wong's.  I devoured that thing and it tasted just like those $15 upscale burgers across town.  I had no clue where it had come from.

Since then, I've actually been to Long Wong's restaurant.  I was completely in shock when I walked in - the outside building and interior didn't match up at all with what I had imagined.  It's super kitschy, with old-school video games lining the walls alongside that talking Mr. Fish that my grandpa has.  It's definitely not a date interior - pretty sure this must be a popular hangout for high school kids and anyone else stoned out of their mind - but the food really hits the spot when you're in a burger mood.  Much better than those big name fast food restaurants and much cheaper than those big name slow food restaurants.

All in all, I'm a fan and Long Wong's remains on my go-to list of unhealthy treats."}
{"text":"Under new ownership. Things have improved greatly. Awesome customer service wings still great actually have improved, slight price increases but if I didn't eat there on a regular regular basis would not even noticed. Met new owner he is very customer oriented and that shows in his staff. As I said Wings are excellent, subs and sandwiches are very good, have not had the pizza yet but talking to folks who have they are pretty good. Had fish fry and that was awesome. Remember this is a mom and pop place not a national chain so your supporting local business the money stays in local communities not stuffing some corporate big wigs pockets."}
{"text":"Interesting decor.  Fun little hole in the wall for greasy yummy burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"Okay ..... for the money spent was ok! I used to go here when I was a broke 20 year old. I went for good ol time sake. The flavor great! The service great! Fries good, but as a suggestion.....wings were a bit overdone for my liking......I do think if wings were not as well done would have enjoyed the memory more..just sayin....but they have been in business for a Long time, maybe a bad night for fry cook that's all guys!"}
{"text":"First off this is not the original long wongs, how do I know this, because one I know the franchise owner and two because my father designed the original logo. This owner is very naive and claims he designed the logo because he put flames around the original logo. 

No here's the objective view of this particular  Long Wongs. Usually I just pick up a combo of wings and fries. Prices are reasonable however if you do get wings your mostly paying for the excess sauce they put onto the wings. Fries are ok nothing really special, Burgers are meh, the only reason why I go to this long wongs over the one on Thomas is because of the proximity. I'm not afraid to say I go here just because it's close by, however there other places to go to like Native New Yorker as well as Buffalo Wild Wings right around the corner.

Over all it's an ok place to dine nothing really special decor can use some updating. On a personal note this owner isn't even paying any franchising fees or anything plus some of the staff is rude at this location"}
{"text":"I went here after reading an article online from the Phoenix New Times that said Long Wong's Mesa made the wings extra crispy.  Well, no more....  The wings were very small and not crispy at all.  The sauces were good though.  I guess I should not complain about the size of the wings because the prices are good, 50 wings for $25."}
{"text":"Had a last minute birthday party and need enough food for 20 people. I was able to call and place a large ordering wings within the hour. Very friendly stuff and our guest loved the wings they kept asking where we got them from. I'm sure a lot of our guest will be visiting soon."}
{"text":"We got takeout from Long Wong's Granite Reef on 12/16/17. I got the Big Ass - Double burger, fries and onion rings, my wife got the Mushroom cheeseburger and we added a Dragon Wong chili dog. I called the order in and it was ready for pickup 10 minutes later, total was $19.80. The restaurant layout is basic, but the decorations are clear and the environment is clean. The staff were efficient and friendly, adding ranch to my order by request. 

The food was outstanding! The burgers well cooked, the hot dog was crisp  with a nice snap. The chili was hearty and both the hamburger and hot dog buns held up nicely to the food. Fries were provided for each entree; we were flooded! All in all, an excellent experience; I highly recommend stopping by for a bite!!"}
{"text":"This little mom and pop establishment can be easily missed as it sits in the shadow of a condo complex on a fairly quiet corner of the 7th Ave and Thomas St intersection.  I have heard about this place from several people. The name of the establishment is rather memorable in a funny way...  \"Long Wong\"....  *giggles*  So, of course, I've always wanted to try the wings out.   

I ordered the 12 wing plate and fries.  The fries were not very good to me or my friend.  In fact, my friend didn't eat the fries... I was a little hungry so I had more than a few of them.  They weren't very good.  Plenty of the reviews reported how quickly the wings come out... This I can say is quite true.  I am not sure I was in my seat more than 5 minutes before they were calling me.  The wings themselves were severely overcooked with little to no flavor.  I prefer my wings to be sauce-less so I can dip them.  This means your chicken wing has to have some seasoning and taste good plain.  Unfortunately, these wings don't taste like they have any seasoning on them before they are cooked.  If the wings themselves don't taste good stand alone (without sauce), it is difficult for me to enjoy the wings.  However, the sauce on the flavorless wings was good.  .


People swear these are the best hot wings in Phoenix.  I beg to differ.

{"text":"This would be the ideal stop if you were on a scavenger hunt because any and all pop culture trash has been stuck on the wall, shelf or is hanging from the ceiling or parked outside.  OMG, hoarder heaven.
The food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table.  I actually liked the hamburger.  There were wings too but i'm not a fan of those - soaked in enough sauce i'll eat though. There are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order.  There were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal - how annoying was that.
It appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce."}
{"text":"I always drive by and wonder what kind of food such a crazy looking place can serve.  Stopped in one night craving wings, and just about everything on the menu was screaming to get ordered.
I ended up with a dozen spicy BBQ wings and a side of fried zucchini and mushrooms.  For the price, it really couldn't get any better.  The wings were hot and crunchy, covered in a sweet but spicy BBQ sauce.  The zucchini and mushrooms were fried fresh, so good!
Everything is really affordable and the eclectic decor is fun to look at while you're getting messy with some wings."}
{"text":"I love little diners like this. I eat here weekly and have never had a bad visit. Tasty foods for super cheap. The entire staff treat you like family and always have fun at their job. Phoenix is a rough town in general but when you're away from family and hometown diners, this hits the spot."}
{"text":"I wish I could post a picture on here! We ordered wings to go tonight and when we got home and opened the box they were the scrawiest shriveled wings ever. I took a picture of them next to a quarter and they were the same size!I called them and I was told that \" I'm between a rock and a hard place in this is what my vendor gave me\". Then I said maybe you should give more wings and he said \"then I will lose money\" except for he pays for the wings by the pound not by number, he wouldn't be losing any money, he's making money by selling these small scrawny Wings it the same price he was selling the normal Wings . Terrible customer service. We will not be back!"}
