{"text":"Their pizza looks great, but after biting into it you realize there is very little flavour caused by the fact they put hardly any sauce on it. It reminded me of a 50 cent slice of pizza I ate in Montreal years ago. Which was worth 50 cents; this Panini pizza is worth about the same, not the $4 they charge.  You know, even their name is weird. I don't recall seeing panini's on the menu, but maybe they were there. They just have to loosen the grips on the toppings, other than that it's decent."}
{"text":"I'm always attracted to original combos of food. What is this girl talking about you ask? Well for example, how often do you see pizza being served with poutine? Or pizza being served with onion rings? I haven't seen it that often, so that's why Panini caught my eye.   Located in the food court at North Hill Mall, Panini offers interesting combos for that 'Italian food lover' inside of us all. Sometimes you just crave an excess of carbs, and ordering pizza and fries is A-OK with the people at Panini.   The prices for the combos were pretty standard for food court fare (ie: Pizza & Poutine for $7.98) and the pizza was decent. The service was fine as well.   And don't worry, for those of you who just can't take the plunge and over indulge in the world of carbs, they do have delicious salads on the side. You can get fruit salad, Greek salad, pasta salad or plain salad and skip the double dose of grease ;)"}
{"text":"I have been on a spaghetti and meatball tear lately, so this is the first of four reviews.    Being in a food court, my expectations were tempered, but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavour of the spaghetti and meatballs.  They parboil and then finish the dish in front of you.  The meat sauce is very tasty, and so are the meatballs.  They boil the meatballs before adding them into the final dish and then pour extra meat sauce over the whole order.  I put some pepper flakes on it for added zing.  It comes with a garlic wedge, which is a winner in itself.  All of this for $7.99, and I admit I enjoyed this meal the most of all the places I went recently for this dish.  The counter help is a husband / wife couple that are very friendly and efficient.  The atmosphere is food court admosphere, loud and airy.  As we sat and ate, noticed there was a line-up for their pizza and wings.  Have to give those a try next time out."}
