{"text":"Lemmi tell you, I never review but i think these guys definitely deserve one. This place's food is damn good. I usually get a mixed shawarma plate on fries and my mother gets a chicken shawarma combo plate. (combo come w/ salad and garlic potatos on rice, plate is just on meat on rice/salad/fries)

I thoroughly enjoy the meat, its perfectly seasoned and not at all salty which some places suffer from. The portion size is amazing, the sauce on top is delicious and the ratio to meat:rice:sauce is perfect. 

also the prices are more than reasonable and im dreading when they have to raise them. 

My ONE complaint is the potatoes. Something about the taste is off. As well as the portion size. Maybe theyre just too greasy/oily compared to the rest of dish or something, I really dont know but theyre the one let down. I also ordered extra potatoes on the side of a regular plate an there was such little potatoes, not worth the extra 2 dollars. its like, 6 little potato pieces. I end up just not ordering them anymore and im fine without them."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Shawarma I've had in Mississauga. Solid lunch spot, quick, and great service. Can't go wrong with this one. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Really good food! I'm amazed at the portion quantity. Also the hot sauce is not as hot as they say it is or I just have a high tolerance of hot sauce. But overall would definitely return here again. Everything was good the salad, potatoes, and the chicken on rice."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way.... If I could rate it higher I totally would.
I stop in here weekely from Niagara Falls.. 

The quailty of the food and toppings are amazing.
I've simply never had a bad experience there. Shawarma is one of my favorite foods, but not all are created equal ... And this place is one of the few I've been to that get it right. 

Do yourself a favor and stop in....prices are crazy good too!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Everything was delicious and at good prices. We had the fried calamari (good price and delicious), the chicken shawarma combo (huge portion and packed with ingredients) which came with fries (fries were just ok), chicken shawarma dinner and mix shawarma dinners, which come with salad, rice and garlic potatoes. We paid for extra chicken for all of them and could barely find the rice beneath all the meat! The rice itself was tasty as well and the salad was beautiful! It had so many ingredients in it! My only complaint is that you barely get any garlic potatoes, if you don't pay for the $2 extra. Like 5-6 little cubes and that's it.  The potatoes were hands down my favourite but the fact that you barely get any... Will certainly try them again but perhaps pay extra for the potatoes."}
{"text":"Got it delivered through SkiptheDishes.com  and the food did not disappoint at all!! My sauce was on the side which they followed instructions. Great!! 

We both got a mixed platter with chicken and beef. The base is a salad, but not your ordinary salad!! The salad already had a nice flavour to it and it was a Mix match of goodies, including beets, turnip, parsley and jalape√±os. There were some pita chips too for a crunch. The portion is large and half of it was the meat!!! I was too full to finish all the chicken. There was less beef. 

Disappointment- we ordered a side of grilled veggies and we hardly saw any of it. I was surprised it was thrown into the platter/salad. 

Verdict: I would definitely go back for sit in or take out since it's worth the $10. 

Thanks to SkiptheDishes that we discovered this new place in our community!!!"}
