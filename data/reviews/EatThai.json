{"text":"1) Pad Thai (vegetable + tofu) - $8.95 Noodles had good texture (not mushy). A lot of vegetables and a variety. The base was not spicy nor ketchupy. They put a lot of peanuts on top which I like.   2) Thai iced tea - $3  Cheaper than most places but it is smaller. Either the tea was brewed stronger or there was less evaporated milk because the tea was darker than usual and not as sweet. It was different than other places but still good though.   Small restaurant, 20 or so seats. It was mostly empty on a Sunday night so we didn't have to wait and the service was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently had a fire, so they're closed for renovations. This is my favourite Thai place in Toronto aside from Khao San Road (and in my opinion, even better than)."}
{"text":"Decent Thai restaurant and fair prices on the lunch menu. Not the best in the city but a good place to stop in if you're in ye neighborhood for lunch."}
{"text":"We decided to come by here from a referral of a friend after 'Thai Bistro' was closed; eventhough, it was listed that it is open on sunday dinner service. Needless to say, we came here. It was around 5 pm and it was empty, so we weren't sure if the food would be good or not.  We ordered 4 entree portion to share among 4 ppl. We got the 'Beef Panang Curry'. Green Curry Chicken, Pad Thai Shrimp and Pad Kee Mao Shrimp (Drunken Noodles).  Ratings on the food:  Beef Panang- Served with side of rice. Beef was fairly tender, cooked with green bean and mushroom and onions. The sauce was alright. 2.5/5  Green Curry Chicken- Served with side of rice. This one is standard. You taste the coconut in it for sure. 2.5/5  Pad Thai Shrimp- Did not taste like ketchup, but not that strong on the tamarind too. It did taste fine. It came with 'Tiger Shrimps', and it was good size shrimp. Usually rare in Asian places that you get good size shrimp for the price of $12.95. 3.25/5  Pad Kee Mao Shrimp- This one tasted the best out of the rest. Its flat lazy noodles plopped on the plate with some red/green peppers and onions and the good size tiger shrimps.  Service was alright. We had to ask for water even when not busy. I would come back b/c the food was decently good and the price is fair."}
{"text":"I was wary about trying out yet another Thai food place - esp one located right on Yonge St.  Most of the time, they end up skimping on quality and flavour to make more profit.  I was pleasantly surprised with So Great Thai.  We had take out Pad Thai (chicken & shrimp), the Penang Curry (beef), Pad Si-Ew (beef).  Everything was tasty and cooked well.  Pad Thai was very flavourful and didn't reek of ketchup (not a drop!).  My absolute fave was the Penang Curry (beef).  Thick, creamy coconut milk, curry, peanuts...it was dreamy!  I still crave it to this day, and we had it at Christmas.  I'm looking forward to eating here again.  Great little place, mellow ambiance.  Good service."}
{"text":"Great food, quite nice ambiance and their prices are unbeatable. Pretty good service as well."}
{"text":"I'm some what skeptical when a place proclaims them self \"great\" in their name. But true to their name this restaurant does cook up some great dishes. My favourite dish to order here is their \"Kang Kheaw Wan Kai\" (Green curry chicken), a very flavourful sauce that is enhanced with basil leaves, coconut milk and bamboo shoots. It goes really well with rice. I have to fight the urge from straight up drinking the sauce. Another standout dish is their \"Pla Tod Rad Prik\" - a deep fried red snapper in a spicy coconut sauce, just writing about it is making me drool. One thing that irks me is that they use a lot of onions in some dishes, I think for no other reason than to use them as fillers to make the dish look plentiful or for who knows what? for flavour? I doubt it.    I've been here more than five times, and have had nothing but pleasant meals, one of my favourites for Thai food. I've had their pad thai, satay skewers, calamari, and many other dishes that I can't remember - all of them had great flavours. The decor is modern and sleek, a great place to take a date out for dinner."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday evening with 3 others. We all didn't have much expectation but it truly exceeded and then some. The restaurant was somewhat empty at 7:30 pm but maybe it was the torrential rain and lightning that were keeping diners home. The food is well spiced and delicious. We ordered their specialties: khao soi and crisp pork belly with rice and also added the pandan curry and papaya salad - all very delicious (the tomatoes in the papaya salad could have been slightly fresher). We coudn't even go for dessert as there wasn't much real estate left in our bellies to do so. Our server was friendly and was honest with her opinions on the food which we appreciated. She overheard us saying that we didn't have any room left to order dessert and gave us some wafer rolls to go. It's a very casual place with good value for food. I'd say the music playing overhead was a little annoying but in this strip of ubiquitous restaurants, the food stands out. I would return and bring friends along."}
{"text":"When I used to live in this area, I had walked by it so many times but was never prompted to go in. From what I remember it was closed for a while and I thought they were either out of business or being renovated.   I was in the area today to visit a friend of mine and had decided to try this place out. We got our seats right away.   The prices of the dishes were affordable and reasonable. My friend and I had both ordered the Golden Curry. The food came relatively quickly and the portions were good. I was pleasantly surprised, the Golden Curry was absolutely delicious! The restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere and the server was attentive. She came by to ask us about the food while we were eating and had came by to refill our waters regularly. I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The golden curry, seafood fried rice and pad thai are the best here. Customer service is good. The only thing that I don't like is the drink portion is small but other than that everything is great."}
{"text":"Ordered grilled chicken and red curry shrimp, pretty yums! will go back"}
{"text":"The place just opened. Too be honest, below the average. We ordered two main and one apper and cost 50. Taste a lot if MSG."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOT CLOSED PERMANENTLY!  They had a fire in the back and need a couple of months to fix.  Stay tuned for their re-opening!  Great lunch deals which include soup or mango salad, along with spring roll.  But the real highlight of the meal was the curry.  I had green curry chicken and my companion had the curry chicken pad thai.  Both dishes were creamy with the sweetness and fragrance of coconut.  Also, the chicken served in both dishes was breast meat and not overly dry.  The chef and owner are from Thailand which speaks to the authenticity of the dishes.  My only complaint was the soup was only okay.    But, at $7.95 per set, it was delicious to my stomach and my wallet!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular; Every time I have been here, it's almost always full of people (many return customers!)  The food is yummy! I love the fresh spring rolls here and can have two plates of this stuff for my main. This time around, my SO and I also ordered the Mango Salad and a green and red curry dish (one beef, the other veg). Both curries come with a nice helping of rice. The portions are good enough for one person so if you intend on sharing, I would recommend ordering 2-3 main dishes to share (depending on how hungry you are).  Service is quick and efficient - the one man made sure that our water glass was always filled which sometimes you don't even get in a \"fine dining\" restaurant so very impressed with that!  I also ordered a glass of house white and it came perfectly chilled and refreshing - even the glass was chilled!  Over all, I would highly recommend this restaurant for great tasting Thai. So glad that this is in my area"}
{"text":"note: the name of this location has changed.  we checked in on Yelp and then asked the server if we could use our 5% discount as offered on Yelp for checking in. she had to go back and forth for a bit with someone before getting back to us.  we came here for lunch, the only thing I really enjoyed was the iced tea. we got a spring roll with a soup and then our lunch. I got the Pad Thai, he got the curry chicken. my food wasn't flavour full, I've definitely had better pad Thai at a fast food joint in the mall.  I was disappointed with the service. I understand everyone needs to eat, so take a break. but our server was eating while serving us, so we actually felt rude asking for anything we needed. she dropped our food and didn't come back, until we had to flag her over to bring the bill."}
{"text":"The place was pretty empty but it was a late lunch hour on a weekday (2-3PM)  so expected as such. I ordered the green chicken curry and rice. The service was alright, restaurant looked nice but I wasn't a fan of the food. The green curry wasn't as expected and was very sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry.  Even tried adding hot sauce but that didn't remedy the situation. There isn't much else to note about the restaurant, just didn't like the food is all."}
{"text":"Taste of Thailand in North York Yonge street. Clean place, nice decor, bright sunlight inside. Good service.   Can't comment on the usual Thai foods because I decided to order something different. Saw two people at the table next to us order this signature dish so I decided to try. Crispy pork with Chinese broccoli. What attracted me to this dish was the fried egg with rice. That was pretty good and it went well with garlic sauce. The Chinese broccoli was nicely cooked and drenched with flavour from the sauce. The crispy pork belly was okay, it's a little fatty for me but I'm sure someone else who likes pork belly will love it. It's got a light crispness all around but didn't seem too fresh. Also tried Thai curry chicken puffs, cause there's a big picture of it displayed on the window and it looked good, but wasn't. The puff pastry way too thick and not enough filling inside proportionally. I couldn't really tell what was inside besides some curry flavour, couldn't even tell if there was chicken.   Overall, the place is good but I'm still reserved on the food perhaps if I tried more of the traditionally dishes like curry or noodles I might update my rating."}
{"text":"Modern and clean aesthetic, slightly cramped seating considering the size of the restaurant (sandwiched between other street shoppes along Yonge), relaxed ambience. Prices are a bit pricier than they should be - but it is an affluent neighbourhood. Dishes were good, came in a timely manner and the server was friendly. She refilled our waters a lot :) the group I went with, including myself, got the pad Thai, pineapple fried rice & drunken noodles. Good portion size, slightly overpriced though. *3.5 stars*"}
{"text":"Heres my quickie review :   Extensive lunch special menu Super clean retaurant. Glassware, utensils, plates,... Fast & Friendly service Decent thai food (that will satisfy  your craving....but is it top 10 in toronto?...Not by far)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Thai, I liked the interior but wasn't completely sold on the food.   Might be because I'm too spoiled by Khao San, in future I'll probably go back to doing take out at Thai Bistro, however So Great is way better for group dining.   I had the chicken shrimp glass noodle, it was large, lots of veggies, chicken and shrimp but the noodles to me seemed to stuck together and taste was just ok to me.   Also had to tom yum soup which didn't particularly blow me away."}
{"text":"Ended up here with five friends for a group meeting.  I was so proud of my friend for looking this place up on Yelp and then e-mailing us.  Looks like my preaching about Yelp is paying off.  Even though it's a small space, we were able to get seating in the \"mezzanine\" level for the six of us.  We sampled an assortment of appetizers and entrees, all of which were pretty delicious.  The chicken satay wasn't that special (the chicken pieces were big, but not that flavorful); however, the hot'n'sour soup (vegetarian) was delicious, as was the seafood appetizer platter.  Special mention should go to the mango salad, which everyone sampled and raved about.  On the recommendation of other yelpers, I requested the green curry chicken (extra spicy, of course), and was a little disappointed by the mildness -- very coconutty, though.  The Chilean red that we ordered was tasty and split nicely among the six of us, working out to $4/glass.  All in all, a tasty Thai place that lived up to its reputation."}
{"text":"Good thai food but the over all is dragged down by several issues:  1) Understaffed. The one waiter trying to serve 5 or 6 tables wasn't really keeping up despite his best, earnest efforts.  2) Small portions.  3) The green curry chicken has a two chili spicy rating but wasn't spicy at all."}
{"text":"This place just re-open recently,  I went for dinner with a group.  I arrived late.  So the order had already been placed.  So I'm not too sure what these dishes were called in the menu.  But the food taste very good.  My favourite dish is the sour curry.  It has a nice mix of curry spice.  I can tell it's not from a canned spice.  So they made their own curry (at least for that dish).  Probably one of the best Thai curry I had. The mixed pork salad (Yum Moo Yang) and the seafood- chicken fried noodle (Koi Taew Kao Kai?) was also very good.  And the papaya salad is good.  I wish they put more chilli to make it more spicy.  They did held back on the spiciness, which is the signature for Thai food.  Having said that, one of my friend who eat mild(compared to me) can also enjoyed her meal.  Her favourite is Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Was going to eat here only to find out it closed down recently.  I had one more voucher left from dealticker which I'll need to ask for a refund.  The restaurant itself was small, with only one waiter and food that takes a long time to prepare.  Dishes were decent but portions were small.  Menu had many typos, and some dishes had funny names.  Overall it was a good place for thai food, but still does not compare to the restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"Got takeout from this place as I figured it was the closest real Thai food around that wasn't located in a food court.  We ordered Khao Soi, garlic beef and broccoli, Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles), mango salad, and a vegetable and tofu fried rice. The dishes were quite tasty and flavourful. Not as impressive as the trendy restaurants downtown, but I would certainly come back here again for Thai in this neighbourhood.  The prices were a bit high considering the amount of food you get, and it was comparable to the downtown prices. The above fed just enough for four people, and the total came to $60 including taxes.  I'd definitely come back if I am in the mood for Thai and don't feel like trekking downtown."}
{"text":"+ Flavourful Food + Clean establishment - Don't come during lunch rush of you won't find a seat!  Recommended Dish: Green Curry Chicken"}
{"text":"Loved my Thai Basil Fried Rice (Spicy) - fried rice with egg, onion, garlic, fresh chili, pepper and Thai basil w/ veggies. Exactly how I like it and it was nice and tasty. Also tried the Thai curry puffs w/ friends. The puffs were about average. Too much batter and too little stuffing. Pretty inexpensive meal. I'm so coming back !   Service was also decent and fast. We were probably in and out within an hour. Loved the nice white seats and modern clean interior. The highlight was getting 5% off checking in w/ Yelp. Yes I love my deals."}
{"text":"A-OK.  RIght on, Yelp.  Solid 3 stars.  I was kinda disappointed that they didn't have khao soi, but it's not a common dish.  The \"spicy\" pad kee mao didn't have any hint of spice.  I had to supplement with chili sauce.  It was strange to have tomatoes in the pad kee mao, but it didn't taste bad.  If I had been craving good pad kee mao, I would have been majorly let down.  Instead, I had a pleasantly different meal."}
{"text":"We've been ordering deliveries from here for past few months and food quality has been consistently good.  Their Thai Fried Basil Rice is excellent with veggies. I tried chicken a couple of times but it felt a little uncooked. Same goes for the Ginger Chicken. No gravy at all but herbs and spices were spot on.  The best item on the menu for me is Spicy Chicken or Spicy Shrimp. Its got a lot of bamboo shoots, green n red pepper in slightly sweet n tangy red curry.  Tom yum soup is a good indication that the chef knows his job. The delivery lady has a pretty smile (sets the mood, good thing wifey's not on Yelp!) and food always arrives on time."}
{"text":"I live a few steps from this place.  It had been closed for over a year because of a fire.  My sister and I decided to grab some dinner after reopening after a few weeks.    We started with the coconut soup and the entree beef panang.    Coconut soup was not very impressive, it did taste good.  It was my first time so I cannot make a real judgement of what is good and what isn't.  To me, it was coconut milk hot with a Thai spicy flare garnished with some mushrooms.  Beef panang was 3 out of 5.  The beef was tough and overcooked.  The sauce was not creamy and the spice level was not much.  The veggies they used was not the traditional ones.  They used long green beans!?  I have concocted a better panang in my little kitchen.  The service ok, nothing that stands out.  They really should probably focus on this as they really need to get there business busier.  If return it would be a lunch special, the prices otherwise are too high for the quality they served to my sister and I."}
