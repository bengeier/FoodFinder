{"text":"This place just recently opened up right at the intersection of Bay and College and it is perfect. It's full of natural light and fresh flowers. The hot chocolate is by and away, one of the best hot chocolates I've tasted at an indie cafe in Toronto, it is not too milky nor too thick and chocolatey. The music is nice and quiet, the ambiance welcoming, a great place to meet with friends, read a book, or study. I haven't seen any outlets yet - so bring a fully charged laptop. I will definitely be back here many times, I'm just so excited for this new cafe right near Ryerson :)"}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place and had an excellent americano. The baristas were very lovely, and I found out about their points-per-dollar loyalty program. I'll definitely be coming back many times."}
{"text":"I love it that they have birch sap drinks. I've tried their hot cider and a flat white, both with sap and both tasted great. Black coffee that they serve is good and they are starting to roast their own beans. The ambiance is nice and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"They have quite a few options of teas and they're all delicious! There is also plenty of room. I got a chai latte and it was spicy! I had never had that before, and now I'm hooked. Worth checking out ."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere to take a rest in the middle of tall buildings
Nice staffs serving warm coffee and dishes
Tasty coffee and all day long good breakfast menu"}
{"text":"I work across from this coffee shop and one year later... I finally checked it out. Call it laziness or call it creating suspense..

Anyhow, the shop itself has a very boho hipster feel to it down to the chalk written menu. I ordered a small apple cider which was pretty good. The barista was super adorable and offered to add caramel to it. Is that even a question?? Of course I said yes before she completed her sentence. 

The apple cider was good. Tasted like an ordinary apple cider, nothing special- not to say that's a bad thing. Was it worth the $4ish price tag? Probably not. They are usually busy so I will go out on a limb and say that Coffee Public must be popular for their coffee :) 

If you're in the bay/college area, it's worth to check out!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, friendly staff, clean and nice spot! Way better than other choices in the area, will be back for another almond milk cotado(I may never sleep again, however, SO strong!)"}
{"text":"Lovely space, great staff and Free Refill Fridays when you bring your own mug. Sweet! Except that the coffee is bitter. Like, undrinkable! Maybe if I'd tried an espresso drink and if the Florentine breakfast sandwich had been better I'd be thrilled with this place. (Old onions, no sauce, flabby focaccia and really small. What's the Woody Allen quote? \"The food here is terrible. And such small portions!\") The pastries look pretty delectable but I'm trying to be good here, people!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Staff are nice and it's a great place to people watch!  There is bar seating and their are tables.  Nice and spacious.  There is a bank inside it which is kind of weird...but ok."}
{"text":"This place just recently opened (Jan. 4th, 2016), and THANK GOODNESS! The Bay/College area needed a coffee shop like this!
I've only been once so far but can certainly assure you that I will return. Decided to go with their regular drip coffee, just to see what it was like, and it was definitely satisfying :D Cost $2.25, little pricey, but I don't mind. They also offer a variety of baked goods, sandwiches and even soup, kinda similar to your Aroma or Panera.
There's a good seating arrangement, and the overall vibe the cafe gives off is perfect (love the instrumental/jazzy music they have playing!).The staff was veerrryyy friendly, willing to talk to you, joke around, and get to know you which s awesome! 
Plus, they have free, reliable Wi-Fi, huuugggeee plus for any cafe-goer!"}
{"text":"Great service here with really friendly staff....I love that they serve tea in this extra large mug. Pretty neat"}
{"text":"Ordered a hot chocolate, the sweetness was just right. They forgot to make it at first, but upon alerting the cashier she happily made me one and apologized. Also ordered a Corleone sandwich. The bread was tasty and the fillings were okay."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for a tea and flat white. Loved their tea choices and the flat white was done nicely, just as expected. Service was super nice and all the staff are very patient and friendly, so that was definitely a plus. If you choose to grab and go, this is a solid coffee shop.

Prices are a bit higher than I would expect, but the main issue was their seating. There's a serious lack of seating here and tables are usually dirty and not cleaned up, which makes it a highly unwelcoming place to linger and enjoy coffee at. There are cups and water on the side you can pour yourself, but again, that station was quite dirty and it seemed as though it had not been cleaned up in a while. I only spotted 2 seats with access to an outlet, so if you're considering working for an extended period of time here with a laptop, that also might be an issue."}
{"text":"This coffee spot is connected to Alterna Bank. 

Their breakfast sandwiches are one of the best breakfast items on the menu. This is not your Tim hortons or Starbucks type of breakfast sandwich.

I ordered the Fresh one - you can get the sandwiches in half or whole. Order a whole breakfast sandwich if you would like to save half for lunch or order half to share with someone if you'd like a light breakfast. Personally, if you eat the whole sandwich, you might feel very very full afterwards and might to too full to work.

The fresh one is comprised of a fried egg with cheese, mayo and a thick slice of tomato. There is enough mayo in the sandwich that prevents it for being too dry. The egg is not too greasy and fried

The fresh brewed coffee is ok, nothing memorable, but not burnt."}
{"text":"I work at College and Bay. This is my go-to coffee spot. It has great quality coffee with a great atmosphere. Definitely recommend to those who want to try something different than the typical big box coffee chains."}
{"text":"Incredible service, incredible coffee, incredible muffins. Cannot give this place enough love."}
{"text":"I literally just had he best breakfast sandwich of my life. I don't know if was the fancy free angle eggs or the delicious bread but I will get 'The First One' again.
Coffee is also delicious. A tad pricy for a coffee spot but I've always had great service and the food is yummy."}
{"text":"Solid layout, spacious place, & good Coffee.  I just wished their internet was working more effectively."}
{"text":"Really great food here. A bit on the pricey end, but worth your pennies if you can afford it. The \"First One With Bacon\" bagel is a great medley of ingredients that create a lot of mouth orgasms. Highly recommend starting with that one and exploring from there. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great cold brew! Good place to get work done or to meet friends. The public wifi doesnt work all the time so make sure to ask for the password to the other wifi!"}
{"text":"Was walking by, and grabbed a latte. 


Washrooms clean, nice seating area. Didn't sit since it was pretty quiet and had to go, but seemed nice place to relax.

Latte was decent quality. Nothing amazing special, but good walk in and go!"}
{"text":"A lovely place downtown that's not a Starbucks.  Spacious but not the most comfortable to do work--cute but uncomfortable chairs . Staff were really really great!

Soup and Bagel was just over $9 so not the cheapest but still lunch under $10.  Interesting coffee in large pint like mugs.

Free wifi."}
{"text":"First time coming here after reading at Chatime gave me a headache (they were blasting rap songs). Coffee Public is a nice environment for catching up with colleagues or a lot of people are independently working solo on their laptops as well (I'm one of them). They are nice chill music on. One suggestion I have is that they can cover the glass windows up, because in the past 45 min I've been here, at least 8 people have tried to open the locked glass doors into Alterna (some credit union shop behind me). Why not they open the doors so the customers can enjoy a cup of coffee upon entering/exiting their business establishment. Or make a small reno to cover it up. Otherwise, I am enjoying this environment, I will come back to read again :)"}
{"text":"A cute coffee locale tucked in an otherwise non-descript office tower. They offer some nice seasonal drink options, so it was hard to choose just one. Ultimately, I settled on the Iced maple latte because, hey, there's a maple leaf in the flag, gotta go maple. It did not disappoint. As far as sweet drinks go, this is a solid choice. Even better, they offer a nice array of small sandwiches that were the perfect bite sized lunch when you just want a little snack to get going. I had the rotating special of the day, which was a Mexican variety with avocado and baked beans, plus a nice egg. Fresh ingredients and toasted up fresh. Can't beat that. It's hard for a coffee place to stand apart, and they nailed it."}
{"text":"Coffee Public's space is airy and bright, the service is super friendly, and the food is really yummy. They serve breakfast sandwiches all day; I had The First One with bacon on a croissant and wasn't expecting much (the ingredients are your standard egg, cheese, tomato, bacon and mayo) but I was very pleasantly surprised! I would go back just for that sandwich. I'm salivating thinking about it. The coffees are also very good, although a bit overpriced. However, the service, food and nice atmosphere mean it's definitely one of my go-to cafes in the area."}
