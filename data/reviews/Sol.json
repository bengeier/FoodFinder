{"text":"Excellent brunch today, felt compelled to write review! 2 people in our party of 4 ordered the eggs benedict, another got the Spanish tortilla, I got the bacon/egg tacos. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts and side dish of home fries.  All was exceptional and our server was so nice!"}
{"text":"The guy who owns this place thinks it is located on Cedar Rd, in Lyndhurst. When in reality they are located off Glenn Ave in Downtown Willoughby. Willoughby is a blue collar, family oriented city. SOL is a place that thinks it only needs to catering to white collar young professionals without kids.   I can't see this place staying open for long. Good thing there are so many great restaurants right next to it. Brew Co, Ballantine, Oliver Twist, Nicklebys... The list goes on."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant! THANK YOU Sol for helping to revive the area's stale restaurant scene. Cleveland's eastern suburbs have been in need of healthier, higher quality food options for a long time. Your concept and menu is a breath of fresh air. My family has eaten here multiple times and have yet to have a bad meal. As a so-called \"blue collar\" resident of Willoughby, I am proud to live here and embrace the changes coming to the city. Please do not listen to the negative reviews saying that this restaurant doesn't belong here. Those people have boring taste and fear change. I challenge them to step out of their comfort zones. Great job Sol and here's to continued success!"}
{"text":"Great meal and super nice people. Met the owner who was also great. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We were so impressed with the vegetarian items on the menu. The food was very delicious, the waitress was wonderful and we were able to hear each other during dinner even though the place was full."}
{"text":"It is well worth your effort if you are in the Cleveland area to make the trip to Willoughby for this gem of a spot.  The brussel sprouts themselves are enough for me to return.  The woodwork in the restaurant is immaculate...and it's a great place for a romantic dinner to a night out with great friends."}
{"text":"I love it--just what downtown Willoughby needed. Great to watch a game at the bar or sit down for a special occasion. My favorite dish is the pork chop and to drink you must try the avocado margarita. Sounds different but it's amazing!! Can't go wrong with anything off of the lunch menu either. Looking forward to the warm weather and patio. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"SO DISSAPOINTING  The place is beautiful. Great atmosphere and décor -- and it makes you expect the service and food to be great as well. WELL, we were sadly mistaken. Food presentation was pathetic. Food portions were minute. Food was AWFUL. We had several Tapas and Two main courses. None blew us away and we were still hungry at the end. We basically ate the food because we were hungry NOT because it was good! Sad. Drinks were so so. Service was horrible. Everything took way too long to get to our table, and we were practically the only people in the place on a Thursday night. OH, and if you want to park your car yourself near the building and not use valet, its 3 DOLLARS!!!!!!! insanity. Surprising because we love Local Taco and Local Tavern."}
{"text":"New menu and EVERYTHING looks and tastes great.  Went their last night with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised with the food and great service.  We will definitely be going back on a regular basis.  You must get the Spanish donuts for dessert!   Best restaurant now in downtown Willoughby along with a great bar and outside patio!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I have no idea what the bag reviews are talking about. Everything on the drink menu I tried was made extremely well and didn't skimp on the alcohol. The piri piri wings and meatballs on the tapas part of the menu are really spectacular. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. I'd easily recommend this place to anyone. The only caveat I have is in regards to the grilled octopus. I was unimpressed with the sauce and confused with the pairing of octopus and potatoes. Other than that, I can't speak highly enough of this place."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was absolutely terrible.  40 minutes for water,  the servers threw our fid away before we were done,  the bar was rude and slow and ridiculous... this time was completely different.  Alyssa was our server, and she was the sweetest thing. She never rushed us, was attentive but not overbearing, and we had a great time.  Thank you, Sol, for cleaning house,  your staff is much better and so welcoming. The food was perfect as well.  Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Totally renovated it and it looks absolutely sweet. Only tried a few things off menu, which were all delicious. Looking forward to a trip back soon!"}
{"text":"A party of six of us visited Sol on a Friday night at 7:00.  We had reservations, but it did not appear to be overly crowded.  We had a drink at the bar before taking our table.    The restaurant is nicely decorated with two bars, one on each side of the space with a large outside patio.  It was quite warm that day so the patio did not seem like a good choice.  Even in the restaurant it was a little warm as the air conditioning seemed to have trouble keeping up.  Our waitress wad very friendly and helpful.  She explained the menu and made recommendations.  We decided to go for tapas and to split the paella special.  This provided plenty of food.  We tried some Portuguese and Spanish wines which were good.  The food was good and came out relatively quickly.  The prices are a little high, but not too bad.  We all said we would come back and try the entrees next time.  In general a very nice addition to  the Willoughby restaurant scene, especially if you are looking for something a little bit different."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner there last night. The place is very nice, and the service was great.... but, all of the entrees were over cooked. Park chops, shrimp, and octopus were all over cooked. Can be a great place with a little more finesse from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food. I love that it is not your typical restaurant Spanish restaurant. Service was great very friendly! I got the veil chop, every bite was delicious. Every time I go I am impressed by the food. I would recommend if you want to get high quality food! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"If the management and owner aren't embarrassed by what they're serving for Mothers Day today they should be. I'm embarrassed for them.  Today my wife and kids took my parents out for brunch. The buffet was $30 a person which I'm very happy to pay for a good buffet, but this was pathetic.    That $30 a head got us salad with one dressing option,  a plate of rolls straight from the grocery store, burnt pancakes,  raw on the inside potatoes, oily greasy mixed vegetables, lamb pasta that was reheated and burned beyond recognition, and store bought sliced ham drowning in \"marinade\".  Dessert options ranged from half a sugar cookie with some cool whip on top to... no wait.. that was the only dessert option...  The table had a drink menu which featured Bloody Mary's, but the mix option I ordered? They were out of that. The two garnishes I selected off the menu? Out of those too.  I might understand running out of menu items at noon if they were busy, but I counted about ten tables, maybe a quarter of the restaurant.  The last thing that just made me lose all faith: this is easily the biggest, nicest, most beautifully decorated restaurant in downtown willoughby, so why are all the servers dressed in cavs tshirts and yoga pants like we're at some scuzzy sports bar?  Am I at a nice restaurant with my mother for mothers day or am I watching the game at Paninis? I honestly can't tell."}
{"text":"I always order the same thing for brunch no matter where I go.. Eggs Benedict. Some places it comes out stone cold, or the muffin is stale, or the hollandaise tastes like metal, or on the occasion i order it on a crab cake the crab is usually old and fishy or has clearly turned... Sol was the best eggs benedict i have EVER had hands down. My whole family (8 of us) enjoyed everything so much we were passing plates around sampling everyones food until there wasn't a crumb left.. If you haven't been yet,  GO.. this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Sol in downtown Willoughby last week. The Cubano sandwich is a meal in itself and comes with fries or salad. I chose salad and couldn't eat it all. Large portions of freshly made food, not from frozen. The chips are homemade and delicious. Very light and different. The salsa is wonderful. Just right - not too spicy/not too mild. The renovation of the building is very creative and the patio is fantastic. it was cool the day we were there so we ate inside. i'm definitely coming back to try something else on the menu. It all sounded good."}
{"text":"We had a number of items over at Local Sol. The Kale salad w/ sliced chicken breast was on point. As well as the Brussels sprouts! Service was very good."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this restaurant! My drink was not even half full, and my grilled flank steak came out cold. When I had my food sent back it came right back out within 2 minutes with the meat looking overcooked and yet still cold. Talked to the manager and he had another entree made and this time it came out hot and fresh!   Service was slow and it was not busy all servers were doing busy prep work. Cute place so hoping my issue was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't normally write bad Yelp reviews, but after eating here, I think the restaurant would appreciate constructive criticism.  I normally love local businesses and want them to succeed.  I'll start with the GOOD: They did a great job on the redesign of the Gavi's building, and the atmosphere is excellent with a Latin American/Caribbean islands/Polynesian vibe going on.  Also, they played good music, mostly reggae, if a little loud for dinner service.  The servers were very attentive, in fact we had two waitresses (which actually caused some confusion because they would ask us if the other waitress already took our drink, app, dinner, etc. order).  Our food, appetizers and entrees arrived very quickly.  Also, the drink menu and prices were pretty good.  But here's the BAD, which equals the two star review: I guess my wife and I are spoiled by the Latin American restaurants in the CLE area like Paladar, Momocho, and El Carcinero, but the food here was not even close to those places.  We ordered:  Goat cheese and chorizo croquettes - the flavor was good, but they were OVERPRICED at $8 for THREE of them.  My wife ordered the nights entree special which was: Lobster risotto with a frisée salad and sun dried tomatoes.  Like the croquettes, flavor was good/OK, but VERY underwhelming, small, and cost $28 - not exactly good value.  Finally I ordered my entree off of the \"shared\" menu (which seems like it's just an appetizer + menu, the \"plates\", or entrées are basic proteins like salmon, chicken, pork, and steak - kinda boring for a Latin restaurant) which was their shrimp and grits.  The grits were terrible; no flavor at all.  No garlic, salt, pepper, or cheese - nothing.  Quaker grits in a can taste better.  There were four shrimp in the bowl and they were very blah as well.  All for $14.  When all was said and done, our bill for the appetizer, two entrées, and three drinks was about $70 plus tip. For that much, I would have been very satisfied (size and taste) at Momocho or Paladar.  We had to leave and get more food, due to the small portions.  We won't recommend this place to any friends for dinner, but summertime drinks on the patio will be great, and we'll come back for that."}
{"text":"I really liked it here and I hope they make it as a restaurant. We went to the bar after work tonight and got a few drinks and some tapas. I got the avocado margarita and it was delicious. My boyfriend and I split the sol plate, and although the portion was smaller than we anticipated, it was delicious and I highly recommend it, esp if you have a picky eater (like my boyfriend). I will definitely be going back, esp in the summer for that patio and their house made cinnamon whiskey (yum)."}
{"text":"Bar tender/Hostess was irritated and ready to go home. We walked in for our  first visit and asked if we could sit on the patio for a drink and appetizer.  Granted, it was 9:40 and apparently they quit serving at 10.  We could tell by her facial expression and body language she was not pleased with our patio request so we said we would sit at the indoor bar.  When we asked why it was so freaking hot inside she starred at the closed glass garage doors and said, \"I assume because the sun was shining and it's a hot day\".  No offer to open the garage door for a breeze.  The restaurant was boiling!  When we asked when \"Local Sol\" opened she corrected us by stating \"we are not part of the Local\" chain, we are Sol.  She was rude and she knew I did not appreciate her attitude so she kept to herself and so did we. 1 drink and we left, too many other great places in DTW to put up with this. BTW, we shared the \"peppers\", it's 1 pathetic pepper for $9. I'm rating a 3 just to be nice; the establishment is really beautiful.  Why does Yelp say \"open till midnight\" and we have nothing but a cocky bartender/waitress sending us on our way at 10:15.  We paid our bill and continued to finish our drinks at the bar when she came back and said \" do you need change or something?\"  As if we needed to leave.  The manager working at the bar register turned and said good night, the bar tender did not say a word when we left. (Manager appeared because the power went out and everyone was having to pay cash)."}
{"text":"Worst. Food. Ever.  I gave one star only because there weren't any cockroaches that I could see.  The menus, however, were printed on regular cheap paper and were soiled and dirty.  The venue itself is amazing.  But it's totally wasted with the food -- or should I say lack of food.  \"Spanish\" inspired?  Seriously.  Nothing on the very short menu is inspired.    Is this a bar? Is this a restaurant?  The menu doesn't even have enough on it for a bar.  And the food we ordered was at best mediocre.  Saturday night. No specials. Nothing appetizing on the menu. And not many customers.  I dare you to find two dishes that you need to decide between.  And the Spanish influence? Non-existent.  We ended up ordering mariquitas and montados for appetizers.  The mariquitas were soggy, tasteless chips with a small amount of guac and salsa. The montados were like bruschetta without the taste.  Three of us ordered the paella and added either chicken, shrimp, or scallops.  A tasteless mess.  I left most of mine untouched.  The fourth person ordered the ribs.  Again, they were tasteless and overpriced for what he got.    Finally, for dessert we ordered the deep-fried donuts which were touted as being \"freshly made\".  When they arrived, they were so hard that it was difficult to stick a fork into them.  I asked the server once again if they were freshly made and she again (lied and) said \"Yes\".  There is no way that these were freshly made TODAY -- maybe I asked the question wrong.  At any rate, we were visiting with friends from Rocky River.  How embarrassing for Eastsiders.  Run -- don't walk -- far away from this restaurant.  We literally drove through Mickey D's after that terrible experience.  P.S. And then there were the \"valets\".  When we drove into the parking lot, we didn't see anyone.  We drove around to in front of Willoughby Brewing and asked what we were supposed to do.  He said that we needed to use the valet.  However, he said, we could give him the $5 charge and park the car ourselves!  Really?  Same story when we left.  We asked the valet to bring our car and he said, \"You did such a good job parking it, you should just go ahead and get it yourself.\"  Seriously, you can't make this stuff up.  P.P.S. And as for the 5-star reviews you may see here?  Clearly these are written by management or the owner's mother.  No one else would dare put their names to such fraudulent reviews.  P.P.S. #1: If the owner wants any hope of salvaging this mess, he should close for a few weeks, decide what he wants the venue to be: bar or restaurant. Totally revamp and expand the menu. And, most importantly, open under a new name.  This name is trashed."}
{"text":"The bartender tried to shortchange my friend ,gave him change for a twenty he gave her a 50, You could tell by her reaction  she tried to clip him,she is not slick enough to pull that s--t .She should wait till the patron has a few before playing that game ."}
{"text":"Great space and decor. Food was so good. Highly recommend the patio. Avocado margarita was unique and tasty. Pepper appetizer was quite good. Short ribs and mashed plantains was absolutely amazing. Probably the best short ribs I've ever had. Spice was really good. Staff was friendly. Overall, I would really recommend. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A nice space run by greedy meatheads. That best summarizes it. The food CAN be good if the same person prepares it each time but employee retention is an issue here. Don't offer suggestions because management is afraid to approach the owner! Two things are wrong with that statement!  The prices are higher end but clearly aren't being passed down to employees...which is part of why the food is inconsistent and the men's room is GROSS. The mini-tiled floor can't possibly have ever seen a scrub brush and soap. Get rid of the bowl sink and clean the floor!  Good luck sitting down at the bar for a meal and not having some staff just hanging out there doing their paperwork right there. Rude. Find an office.   Great space, great food concepts all ruined by close-minded and greedy ownership."}
{"text":"When naming the restaurant did you consider what the initials s.o.l. could insinuate."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, service could not have been better on a very busy night (Sat 2/13).  The brussel sprouts were the best.  My Valentine had the Mahi Mahi and raved about it.  I had the Pork Chops and they were perfect.  Chef Michael has put together a wonderful menu. Everyone we know will hear about Local Sol."}
{"text":"YES! One of the best experiences in DTW yet! My husband and I have lived near Willoughby for three years now, and I've been waiting for a fun, unique restaurant to move in. Finally, it came in the form of a Latin-infused cuisine that was fresh and delicious! The atmosphere was fun and beautiful. We went early, so we were seated immediately. Our server (Debbie, I think) was fan-freaking-tastic. She greeted us quickly, reviewed the menu with us, set our expectations, and took our drink order. I was feeling fun- so I order the Mai Sol. Dear god- it took me straight to a tropical island. It was AMAZING. We took some time to review the menu- there were so many tasty- sounding options!!! Debbie walked us through the types of courses, and was very knowledgable about them. She was able to recommend items for us, and even told us to take our time; we didn't have to order everything right away. So we ordered the Brussels sprouts. Now- my husband and I don't eat brussel sprouts, ever. So when they arrived at our table, I was hesitant, but my fears quickly fell away with the first bite. Cooked to perfection, with a yummy grilled sear and this citrus aioli- they were out of sight!!! My husband and I ate them, had great conversation and when Debbie reappeared, we were ready for our next order. Now- all of the food looked so good, but I knew I wasn't going to be able to eat a full entree. So, we decided to split the flank steak skewers- and it was also amazing! The skewers came with a stack of freshly made fried onion rings, super thin and crunchy. Just plain yum- the steak was peppery and mega flavorful, cooked to perfection. After we ate the plate, we were ready for dessert. We ordered the churros, and were not disappointed. They were at least a foot long each, with chocolate and caramel sauce, and cinnamon sugar. SO good. Throughout dinner, our waitress would pop in and see if we needed anything. She was great for conversation, and didn't feel too invasive. More like part of the family. The manager also popped in to check, which was nice. Overall, amazing experience. We're going back for the Valentines Day pre-fixe dinner- SO EXCITED!"}
{"text":"The entire restaurant itself looks great for this area but every food item we ordered was awful, it was a Tuesday so maybe the head chef had off.  I get octopus everywhere? I see it on the menu, this octopus was poorly prepared, extremely chewy, bland flavor.  The chips, salsa & guacamole were good but a small portion for the price.   My flank steak was also poorly prepared, good thing you included more of the potatoes that my octopus was also loaded with so there was something to eat.   My taco I added was edible but nothing to write home about in the world of tacos.   The spicy margarita was ok but they tried too hard on the spice, it was immediate not an accent to the drink.   Also, it's 2017 stop \"zig-zagging\" mayo(or whatever that stuff is you use on every dish) across the food like it's art!   Would I go again? At some point but I'm not rushing back.   Like I said the restaurant is very nice and probably a great addition to downtown Willoughby but it needs some fine tuning in the kitchen(not a new chef, just refining)   The music selection was pitiful. If it's going for lowest common denominator then it achieved that, it was juvenile in a bad way, not a fun way."}
{"text":"Hola! I took 7 years of Spanish, so I knew I had to come here. Arrivederci! Whoops wrong language, sorry, but maybe you Brad Pitt fans will get it. Anyway, they left the (Brad) Pitt in the guacamole but I was able to work around it. It was a little bit cold here but then we realized we were eating outside in October. The vibez here are tight! Unsure what that means but my younger and cooler friend said it, so.  They did have a pretty neat mimosa arrangement. And the breakfast burrito was seriously very on point. I did not have an issue with the bathroom facilities. But, I never do so that isn't saying that much. Um, I do forget what we were talking about. However, I would definitely hit this spot up for BRUNCH, which is my favorite meal of the day and I wish I could do it everyday but maybe that is why I enjoy it more because I have limited access to it? Okay guys, also a pretty neat fireplace/patio setup! Alright alright alright (random Matthew Mcconaughey reference)"}
{"text":"Nice job on the remodeling, looks really nice.  Our waitress did a fine job considering that even she had a hard time with the food and drinks menu. The disappointing thing is the price for the portion and preparation.  Ordered the Yuka fries, they were cold, crammed into a way to small dish and taste like eating sticks.  Had a Cubano sandwich, while the taste was just okay, it was definitely not worth $12.  The sandwich consisted of one piece of ham, pulled pork that was dry, a piece of cheese that was so thin that I didn't even realize that there was even any cheese in the sandwich, a pickle and some kind of sauce (true Cubans use a Dijon mustard). The sandwich is supposed to be slightly pressed but this one was hard as a rock.  I could have eaten 3 of them but not at $12 each.  The Cuban at the Wild Goose is much better, bigger and way cheaper.     Would I go back to Local Sol? Probably not unless they up the portions and lower the prices.  Lunch set me back $70 for me and my wife and we left hungry."}
{"text":"This place was great! With this in addition to morehouse in dt Willoughby it is really giving the area more of a selection that could be competitive with the Ohio city/tremont food scenes.  All ingredients were fresh, well blended and perfectly combined. We had the sol plate which was delicious! As well as as the venison meatballs (love seeing different things on the menu) and something else (pork adobo?) we loved everything.  The best thing was the Brussels sprouts. Lemon flavor was so different. I considered getting a takeout order of them to eat the next day they were that good.  Decor was neat and again something more of the likes you would see in Ohio city/tremont area restaurants.   Smaller portions and more pricey than other dt Willoughby eats but you pay for quality and a more upscale atmosphere and menu choices.  I hear they will be doing brunch which I can't wait to try!   Not sure why such negative reviews on this place- people need to get out more or just give this place a second try!"}
{"text":"Food is ok for the price point - maybe not a great value, in terms of quality of ingredients and presentation. Got the vegetable paella dish. Carrots were very undercooked and rice seemed to be minute rice.   Drinks are good, but way overpriced. Should be between $6-$8 based on ingredients."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always a great experience. They have some of the best wine around (try the black slate, it's delicious ) and their menu is amazing. Painstaking attention to detail with every dish really pays off. The flank steak was probably the best cooked piece of meat I've had in recent memeory. Will be back for sure! Thinking about being adventurous and trying the octopus next."}
{"text":"I went to a work dinner recently at Sol. Overall I felt underwhelmed. I ordered a caipirinha and it was barely muddled and very lacking in the lime department. Appetizers were average. I ordered the seared trout and for $22 it was ok. It was pink which I have never seen before, def wasn't salmon but was unexpected.   For the price point, there are many other places in the area that I would rather go to."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Local Sol for the first time tonight, it was amazing. We started off sharing the mussels, and then a beet salad. I would highly recommend either one or both.  I had the salmon and my husband had the double boned pork chop for our entrees both were outstanding. In fact the best meal we have had in years. My husband is hard to please and I can tell you he was pleased. Our server Edwin, was exceptional from start to finish. He was knowledgeable, attentive and guided us through the menu which at first was intimidating. We were in good hands. Edwin told us that last night the Chef, Mike had just won Iron Chef of  Cleveland, I know why. We are looking forward to coming back and exploring his other creations. Now for the decor, that's simple just beautiful. It's not really Mexican food if that is what you're thinking this food has a flare of Spain. Chef Mike and Lee the General Manager both stopped by our table.  I would feel confident in recommending this gem to anyone. The East Side has something to brag about. One last thing I'm shocked by other reviews they seem personal; my next visit I am going to order everything past reviewers have knocked,  just to check the validity. I'll keep you up to date."}
{"text":"Don't hesitate!  We had a wonderful experience.  We were greeted warmly and made to feel welcome right away.  The interior has been completely transformed & is simply gorgeous.  Our server, Debbie, introduced herself, making us feel right at home.  We chose to order off of the tapas portion of the menu; my husband likes the concept of \"small plates.\"  He loved the \"explosion of flavors\" our selections provided.  The Crispy Brussel Sprouts were unique, simply delicious.  Marinated Spanish Olives were huge & very good.  The Albandingas (venison meatballs) superb.  Really liked the Montados, too, a Spanish take on bruschetta!  The bartender provided me with a perfect Old-Fashioned and my husband truly enjoyed the Chocolate Martini she made him for his dessert.  I gobbled up my Churros, which were presented very nicely.  When we left, we were happy.  Yes, happy!  Can't wait to return..."}
{"text":"AWESOME Spanish-inspired brunch! Really impressed by the complex flavors and quality. I recognized all of the dishes, but it was refreshing to have a new take. For example, my egg and bacon tacos had a delicious aioli and slaw. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall, my experience was average. DO NOT get the queso unless you like the taste of soured cheese. Also, this was over priced and not worth spending my hard earned money on. The fries were good."}
{"text":"Nicest spot in Lake County. Foods great. Service is great. Patio is ridiculous. Brother in law is planning his \"brunch\" wedding here in May. Theyve really raised the bar high for the downtown Willoughby bar scene"}
{"text":"Had the honor of attending Sol's first dinner pairing last night! Chef Mike Schoen's menu was delicious! Each course that came out was our new favorite! The wine pairings were also perfect! Looking forward to attending more events like this at Sol. I am also a fan of their Sunday Brunch and their Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"This place serve's small portions for a big price! Dry over cooked chicken that was almost too salty to eat but for $22 didn't want to waste. 2 entrees, an appetizer, 2 ice tea's and tip came to $90 and we were still hungry. I will say that the service and atmosphere were very good. Definitely not coming back again."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. I was lucky enough to meet David and Tanja the owners on a recent visit. It is obvious the passion they have for this place and it can be seen in the way they run the place. The food was incredible and the drinks were delicious. I can't wait to have my next corporate event there."}
{"text":"Had an appt in Historic Willoughby and had time for lunch so decided to stop in and try out the new restaurant in town with my girlfriend.  Parked, walked into a beautiful  and welcoming entryway.  We were greeted and seated.  Even though it was a cold day out, the Patio area was stunning! I just kept thinking about hosting a party here in the summer!  Inside the restaurant, there is a bar area, regular seating and an adorable cozy sitting area before the patio.  Love the atmosphere and the menu was fun! Brussels sprouts and kale for the healthier crowd and Cuban sandwiches and other foodie dishes for me!   The red pepper soup was wonderful as the Brussels sprouts were spot on!  The sandwich was super flavorful and we'll executed. Mind you, this was only lunch and an early one at that so we can't wait to go back for dinner.  Opened last November and rising to be a great hot spot in the community. Friendly staff and management. So appreciate having good quality foodie fun food with a twist and awesome atmosphere in Willoughby!!! Try them out and you will become a regular!!!"}
{"text":"First off the place looks great. Has a very nice open feel to it and the lighting is great. Not too dark not too light. The other thing that's nice is the place is large enough to accommodate whatever your dinning needs are. It has two bars, two dining areas and big common areas. As far as the food goes there's lots to choose from. This is not your \"run of the mill\" downtown Willoughby place to eat. I had the pork and beef meatballs. They were outstanding and the portion size was great. I also had the stuffed cabbage rolls. I got two larger than normal cabbage rolls and they too were fantastic. Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! We came in today for dinner with our kids and found out that kids under 11 eat free on Wednesday's! They had a woman doing the most amazing balloon animals, crayons for the kids, great service and excellent food. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed. I would recommend the chips, salsa and guacamole, brussel sprouts and chorizo bolognese pasta. The kids had chicken fingers which were great. We had an excellent time and will be back next Wednesday for sure!"}
{"text":"I live and work in Willoughby, I eat in DTW several times a week at least. We have a few great restaurants and bars, this is not one of them.   About a month after Sol opened I had dinner at the bar with a friend, the restaurant is beautiful, the way the staff talked up the food we were anticipating a fantastic meal. What we got was decent, the Shrimp & Grits were great, the rest of the apps were only OK.   The next week I went back with another friend and we had the steak w/Chimichurri and frites, that was also good.   The next 3 visits were bad were over the course of a few months, won't be back again. If I'm paying those kind of prices I expect to get great food, it will be great when this restaurant closes and gets bought by someone with actual culinary experience."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the group of \"Local\" restaurants around town. My wife and I decided to try Local SOL for her birthday dinner on a Saturday night . We got there early so it was not crowded yet and we had the pick of dinning room. The Local group did a great job transforming the inside from the old restaurant. We tried a couple appetizers , the Brussel Sprout salad was awesome and the Sirloin for our dinner.   The food was fresh and fantastic and worth every penny. I read all the reviews prior to our trip there and noticed the  complaints about too expensive and small portions .  The saying you get what you pay for applies to these reviews. Fresh, gourmet restaurants do cost more and are not a place to go to over indulge . I believe the place you are looking for would be called Golden Corral and that's near by in Mentor.    Reviews on Yelp are notorious for having the employees or owners post to boost the numbers . My wife and I are not affiliated and have nothing to do with the owners. We live near by and love all of the Local owned resteraunts.   Another thing to think about is that all the reviews are responded by the restaurant manager and that shows they care.   2 things I would change about Local Sol-   1. The plates were fancy looking however they were plastic, I would have liked to have regular glass plates it gave off a cheep vibe  2. The Men's room was freezing cold which made it very uncomfortable  , maybe check the HVAC in there to get some heat in there   Definitely not a deal breaker or worth knocking off stars on the review , try it you will love it !!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined there last night. Beautiful place and very comfortable. We love all of the local establishments,they are unique, quality driven and reasonable. The ghost of Gavis's took control of this establishment. 12 dollars for two tamales really El Mexicana in Painsville sells them for a buck and that is authentic. I am not Looking for the most bang for my buck, but I am also not looking forward to having an upset stomach for the rest of the evening either. There is tremendous resturant competition in Cleveland a little adjusting might keep them in the game."}
{"text":"Went by myself for lunch last week.  Had to wait for the hostess, she was too busy talking to some other customers.  A bartender noticed me standing there and sat me down.  Now that's the only complaint I have.  The place is gorgeous, the view out the windows beautiful, the house margarita, yummy, and the food, awesome.  I had the pineapple/shrimp tacos, with chips.  It came with some kind of sweet salsa that was good.  Will go back again.  Can't wait for the weather to improve, to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  I got the Brined Pork Chop - Could've used a little seasoning but moist and tender.  The polenta and red pepper sauce were very good.  My friend got special, Mahi Mahi, and said it was excellent.  It didn't replace the top on my list, but it sure will get a return visit."}
{"text":"I was last in this restaurant approximately two years ago and our intent was to go to the bar sit down have a couple appetizers and maybe decide to stay for dinner. After reviewing the menu at that time which seems difficult and confusing to digest we decided to leave. Flash Forward about two years and we went last weekend and what a surprise it was. Not only were the menu prices lower, but the menu was simple delicious and to the Delight of my gluten allergic friend, lots of gluten-free menu items were available. However I did learn that gluten-free doesn't necessarily mean gluten free when it's fried in the same oil as the glutens or fried in it. I don't understand any of that. We chose a few appetizers to start and we started with the octopus, the Mexican street corn, fried pickles.  I can't comment on the seafood because I don't eat it however the other appetizers were killer and on point. My dinner I chose the fried chicken sandwich which I know isn't to create it or original on my part but it's something that you can either screw up really badly or get it perfect. This restaurant happened to get it perfectly. The fries portion was good however I found the chicken breast was a little on the thin side and did not seem over 6 ounces which in my opinion is a normal sized chicken breast for a fried chicken sandwich if you're comparing it to Chick-fil-A. The only real big turn-off for me is you cannot park anywhere near the restaurant unless you use their valet and having strangers drive my car kind of freaks me out so I don't do it which means I had to park across the street and it wasn't really a bad walk at all. My only real feedback is they only had one menu option for dessert. Well I can appreciate having a huge dessert menu isn't the best idea in the world most of them are refrigerated and do keep for some time so maybe expand your dessert selection? Anything peanut butter and chocolate will do fine."}
{"text":"Really great brunch -- got the eggs Benedict with brisket and it was phenomenal. The staff was very accommodating as well, and bottomless mimosas never hurt"}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday Brunch. Easy to find parking, and the place didn't get anywhere near crowded during our time there. In fact, it looked like we were the only ones in the whole restaurant until around 11:30.   Food wise, it was okay. I got the shrimp and polenta. It was good, but came with a lot of maple sauce that was very sweet. To be fair, the description i the menu did warn me. It's not something I would get again. My friends got the breakfast tacos (which looked delicious! With a really thick piece of bacon on top) and the eggs benedict. Coffee with free refills was $3.   They also had a table full of a few kinds of donuts that they said the chef baked fresh that morning. They were really good! A perfect combo of fluffy and cakey and the glaze on top was thick with good flavor! We split a vanilla sprinkles one for $2. Would definitely recommend the donuts!"}
{"text":"Great place, good dinner, great service, amazing looking back patio area.  The interior is beautiful, and the back patio or outdoor eating area looks beautiful, I would love to get drinks and relax outside.  We ordered the brussel sprouts as an appetizer which is a crowd favorite. Great flavor and delicious crunch, huge portion. My boyfriend ordered the Cuban which was also a huge portion and very good. He really enjoyed the corn that comes on the side. I ordered the kale salad with chicken, which didn't really have much kale but a lot of greens I've never had before. Overall good flavor, but the greens had a very strange extra earthiness, but still very good.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint is we came for dinner and had to pay $5 to park in their lot."}
{"text":"Just attended an event and the food and service was great! Awesome patio for the area especially, and completely renovated- definitely will return to check out the regular menu. Highly recommend for large parties as well!"}
{"text":"My 3rd time eating here and the food is amazing.   Great atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Sol only because Barrio was going to be a 2 hour wait for 9 guests. We walked right in and got sat as no one was in the restaurant. Immediately thought that was a red flag but it was something new so we wanted to give it a try! We got the braised beef tacos which were definitely good, but not worth the price. Spent $10 on a margarita that really I only got about 5 sips out of. If their prices weren't so high I would consider going back, but as of now I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Sol. The food is delicious, the service is wonderful, the atmosphere both inside and out is perfect. My favorite part about Sol is the patio...they have lights strung across and there is an enclosed fire pit area with plenty of seating. The food is different than anything I've had...the chips are sooooo good, especially paired with queso. They also have an extensive tequila list which makes for yummy margaritas! My goal is to try their brunch sometime soon..."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with unimagined food. Small menu that is confusing and the food left us wanting more food but not off their menu... Very pricey for small portions. For the prices I expect to be blown away and the food just didn't do it for me. Just another \"local\" establishment to check off the list to not go back to. Underwhelming."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. The service is next level and the food taste amazing. You pay for quality. Its not just a run of the mill restaurant. This is the luxury car of fine dinning. Will definitely be back. Vince the manager is next to none. I felt like I was the only person there."}
{"text":"There are really a lot of haters out there. Good lunch on a Saturday. The burger was cooked perfectly and the side salad was fresh and the dressing flavorful. The scallop tapas were abundant and a nice pairing with the cauliflower and squash.   We would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First off, this place looks super trendy & fun! With that being said you automatically assume that the food will be a compliment to the aesthetics. Not the case at first reading the menu I was extremely unimpressed! I thought Mexican food yum no there isn't any! Usually I rate a menu based omg I can't decided what to order! Nope not the case! So I went ahead ordered a Brussels salad. First Impressions bland, boring, & hardly any ingredients it claims it had! The chicken portion was only 3 tiny pieces so I was disappointed! Btw it was a $17 dollar salad! Holly Molly! It's a very expensive restaurant for what? I get it you charge a premium for food but at least make up for it, not the case! I'm sorry but not worth the money!!"}
{"text":"We love everything the Local Tavern bunch has done..........But they missed on this one. THE MENU HAS A FREAKING GLOSSARY. Guys, you're trying too hard to be trendy here. This is Willoughby, not San Francisco. Remember what happened to Johnny Mango (now Ballantine)? Too Foo Foo! While the space is absolutely stunning, and the quality is at the usual high standards, the menu is a disaster. I consider myself a fairly knowledgeable, adventurous, and even somewhat sophisticated diner. But the only things on the menu that I could bring myself to try was the Heart of Palm salad or the Octopus. My wife became so annoyed by the menu that we left after only drinks. Take a lesson from what has made you great. Local Tavern, Fish Bar, etc. deliver great food in a great setting. This space is so nice, but the menu over-reaches almost to the point of making anyone who isn't a chef rather uncomfortable. Take it down a few notches, please"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Wednesday. It was pretty quiet, but the atmosphere was pretty cool. My husband and I shared tacos so I had the pineapple shrimp and the braised pork. They were both very yummy, but the portions were a little small. $12/13 for two tacos, although they didn't skimp on the ingredients. I think we will go back on Taco Tuesday for more bang for our buck. Service was good, waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"Couldn't disagree with the shady rando's with 1 total review (happens to be of this place)....zero friends and zero pictures....Yelp needs to police these \"reviews\" better.  This place is top notch and a fantastic place to eat. A hidden gem in the downtown WB area.  If you want cheaper food....swing by Taco Bell on your way out of town. You want cheaper drinks....Applebee's has tall $3 Bud Lights. The atmosphere and deco are beautiful. Sunday fun day brunch and mimosas. This is a great place to start off if you are staying downtown Willoughby and walking the bars/restaurants. Rob Zombie is a must try.  Really easy parking and again within great walking distance to everything after a great meal"}
{"text":"4 stars.... It's difficult reading some of the poor reviews. I mean, you gave Texas road house 5 stars... How do you take yourself seriously. I gave them a 5 to help offset the morons in society.  It's great seeing a restaurant in a small Midwest town like Willoughby, Ohio sharing some culture from the outside world, even if it's not the most authentic.  If you're interested in not scaring off future businesses taking risks I suggest the locals learn to support the small business and try to think(eat) outside the box.  Review:  We started with the queso. Nothing special, but it was original. Probably won't have many fans of this tapas dish. So if you aren't open minded, just pass.   We also shared the croquetas which were good. The chorizo and goat cheese were barely existent. still had a good taste. Would compare it to a deep fried tamale. Yes small portions... But that's tapas. Traditional Spanish tapas.  Shrimp and grits were top notch. Grits were cooked perfectly. The honey ginger on the shrimp did not shine through, but still had a great taste.  Tamales in size have been upgraded according to the others at my table. They were not traditional tamales, but they also had a great taste. The golden raisins and poblano sauce added some nice complexities to the flavor.  Finally, the entrée. The salmon. Very tasty with a mustard cream base and Yukon potatoes. Really hearty dish.   Sculpin Ipa from Ballast Point(sell outs) on the beer list doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"Ok.  We love Sol.  But, when I pull up right in front of the restaurant on a slow Wednesday night and the valet parking Nazis demand $5 just to park?  Sol, you have a problem.  We took our business else.  But, two nights later we returned.  We walked from our house.  We voiced our concerns to the manager and chef who came to our table.  We had our say.  And then had excellent food!  Still nicking them a star for the parking."}
{"text":"So much potential, but..... A friend suggested we try a \"new\" place in Willoughby (new to us because it is somewhat out of our hood). Checked it out online and it sounded right up our alley. When we walked in, I was immediately impressed by the total makeover they had done with the interior from when it was Gavis. It looked classy/casual in just the right way. Ordered drinks and beers. The beers were, of course, just what you would think. The drinks, however, were both quite watery. Could not get the sense or taste on any actual tequila in them. Wouldn't order another so I got a beer as well. Ordered chips with guac & salsa. We were delighted to see that they were Malanga chips which we love. Salas was quite flavorful (although a little sweet for my particular taste) and the guac was also great. Got another round of it. Ordered several grilled romaine salads. Halfway through them we realized that there wasn't any of the goat cheese, that was supposed to be there, in any of them. By the time our server came around and we told her and she brought some goat cheese out, one of us had already finished his salad and the others were 3/4 done. More apps: Serrano ham toast with wild mushroom, manchego, EVOO and thyme. Does that sound like a sugary sweet dish to you? What they don't tell you on the menu is that the thyme is (very) heavily encrusted with a thick sugar coating. I wasn't looking for a dessert. Either tell diners about that heavy sugar coating or, better yet, lose it and just use a nice savory herb garnish. Stuffed peppers with chorizo, manchego, and romesco sauce. Could not believe how little flavor this dish had. Just the chorizo alone should have brought out something. Anyway, close to $200 later we left feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. Clearly Sol has high aspirations and it is the kind of place that should be a unique and enjoyable experience. It was not. They definitely need a fair amount fine tuning. Too bad. I had my hopes up high for this one."}
{"text":"Was really happy on our return visit to Sol this past month. The dining room is large, which can distract from the atmosphere. If you can get into the lounge area by the fireplace, it has a very cozy, rustic hip vibe. The only downside here is that it's also by the door. I hear the patio is very nice in the summer. There are garage style doors off the bar area that open up.   The menu has several tapas style offerings. We tried The Brussels sprouts and the fries.  The fries weren't bad and the brussels sprouts were delicious, just a tad bit over oily. I was very impressed with the serving sizes for the pricing on those. They were definitely shareable. I then had the chorizo tacos. It came with two nice size tacos and a little cup of off the cob street corn. The flavor of the corn was excellent. The tacos were tasty as well but the meat tasted reheated in the microwave. It had that funny little flavor that you get when you reheat pork. If you can get past that, they were good, lots of flavor. Others at our table tried a salad or sandwich and a dinner entree. They all looked delicious. I do feel the pricing was way too high for the dinner entrée portion size. Everything was very fresh and flavorful though."}
{"text":"First let me say this is my first negative review on Yelp, but this needs to be addressed.   When deciding a location for brunch we ended up deciding on Sol. Walking in with no reservation on a Sunday, we expected to wait for a table. Standard 30 minute wait for a table for 8, which was fine. Once seated things took a turn for the worse. After our initial drink order was taken, we didn't see our waitress for at least 30 minutes. We sat for an hour, no over exaggeration, after we ordered our food. I would normally not say anything but this was ridiculous. My husband with attitude asked if our food was coming out any time soon. Our waitress said it should be. Shortly after a man, assuming a manger apologized for the wait. The apology was appreciated, however he than says \"this seems to be a regular thing on sundays for brunch. We seem to get bombarded with orders all at once. Looking around at empty tables it surely did not seem super slammed. Also regarding his response to their busy Sunday's. As a restaurant that serves brunch I would expect you to know how to timely take orders and get food out to patrons. I'm no stranger to brunch and have gone to incredible brunch places, all of which seem far busier than Sol, and I have never waited so long for food. Once our food finally arrived, my side of potatoes were not hot, and super bland. Two other meals were cold also, after waiting so long we didn't want to spend any more time waiting for new meals. Overall, after a wait like that the food was no where near worth it. I can guarantee I will never step foot in Sol again. If you want to spend your entire Sunday, literally, at a restaurant be my guest. For anyone that wants prompt, good customer service do not waste your time with Sol."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was perfect, really great place to get together. We celebrated a birthday there, food is impeccable, and different. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Had a brunch date with my sister!  I love the setting of this restaurant.  So modern, but yet rustic.  I definitely want I check out the patio once it's warmer out.  I asked for hot sauce with my plate and the manager brought over their house made habanero and it was amazing!  The servers and management are very nice and efficient.  They also make sure you have everything you need and how everything is."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but loud. Had the tacos with Shrimp and Pineapple and they were very good. The pulled pork taco was a bit mushy."}
{"text":"The patio outside is the best around town! Great atmosphere! Had the avocado margarita, it was phenomenal. Only minus a star due to the drink was ten bucks and mostly ice, I finished it in about 5 sips. Would have stayed to drink on the patio but drinks were overpriced for the volume they delivered. Croquettas were delicious as well. Menu ha a variety. We were the only people on the patio but service was quick and efficient. Will go back for the patio at night but maybe they have a happy hour?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people are being so harsh. This is a nice little restaurant that just opened and is working out the kinks.  We dropped by on a Friday night and immediately sat down at one of the two bars. Word definitely hasn't gotten out that they're open yet so it was a little dead, but that just meant we got our food and drinks extra quickly.   There isn't a drink menu yet, but the bartender told us about their specials - we went with an avocado margarita (just ok) and a Rob Zombie (super boozy). We tried the papas bravas (potatoes covered in tomato sauce) and found them to be a little salty but still good. We also had the chips and salsa and the chips were a little salty, too. But not terrible.  The one thing that seemed odd about the menu is that a third of the menu consisted of descriptions of the words used on the menu. I'm not a fan of trying to decide what I'm ordering, but that's just me.  I plan on going back once the dust has settled. I'm sure the menu will be tweaked and the recipes will be perfected. But they're off to a solid start."}
{"text":"We have been customers of Sol since they opened and love going for Sunday brunch. This past Sunday 9/10/17, we had a brunch reservation for 30 guests, to wrap up our wedding weekend. We arrived shortly before our 1:45 reservation and our room was completely setup and ready for us. We had a few extra people that weren't included in our initial reservation and the staff wasted no time in getting extra tables, chairs and place settings for our guests. We had multiple servers and were able to get drinks within minutes. Everyone seemed to order immediately and all of our food was served quickly, hot, fresh and delicious. The staff members were happy, patient and courteous. All of our guests commented on how delicious the food was and the vajriety available. Thank you for making the end of our special weekend spectacular"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. I have been here 4 different times since they have been open. Pork chop is amazing. On Valentine's Day I had the ribeye and it was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The food was very good but if your hungry skip it. Three people three salads, 3 shared plates didn't even get entree/ dinner and four beers bill was a 94 plus tip. Still friggin hungry. Guess they got to pay for the Gavai's building somehow. Maybe I don't fit into the new  downtown Willoughby ."}
{"text":"I get it.. it's the 'soft opening'.  The service was tremendous.. the server did the best she could.. writing hand written notes down on the backs of blank menus of the drink specials.. she gets 5 stars for sure.  The restaurant is a totally different animal.    When we looked around the table at the end of our meals we all said, and I'm not making this up,'is there more coming?'  We all were left wanting a larger portion.. a more clear menu.. and an easier to understand breakdown of the menu... something.    Perfect example is the pork tortillas.. which I was lead to believe was essentially pork tacos.  When the meal came.. it was soup.  Yes... soup.  With three tortilla 'chips' on the side.  Comical honestly.     I just came from Yuma, Arizona and trust me when I say I know what tamales taste like.  The tamales we ordered came out bland and the serving was 2... yes TWO.. for what had to be close to 20 bucks.  For 10 bucks a tamale those things better give an orgasm or something.    Long story short.. the food falls short and doesn't seem to understand that it's not located in downtown New York.. this is cold, crusty, OHIO.. we need portions that warm the belly.  This place won't be here long.   Oh... and every drink tastes like tequila... Come on guys."}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff and atmosphere.  The tapas menu is slightly limited.  Tried the mussels and they were fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"June 30 met 12 friends at Sol. This was my first time at this restaurant. We had reservations. The outside temperature outside was in the 90s. The room we were seated in had no air conditioning. There was  a fan in the corner and after we complained about the heat they moved some furniture and brought another fan. I walked to the other room at the other side and this room was much cooler and had only a few tables filled. I asked if we could move there and was told there was a reservation for that room. I returned to the cool room a few times and did not see more people. The manager stayed away from us. The server was doing his best in the heat. After our meals, we were  brought desserts to sample with plates and soup spoons. The manager must have thought this would  appease us. I did not  like the way we were  treated  by the manager . I am never returning. In addition,  there is a $5 fee to pay to park in the  parking  lot. I ate a Hamburger which was ok."}
{"text":"The Local crew did a great job redesigning the building and setting arrest atmosphere for a new restaurant in Willoughby. I give it two stars because of that and the creativity of the drink menu. Unfortunately that is not enough to make us come back.  We checked this place out with a few friends last night for dinner. After about 45 minutes of waiting for the server to acknowledge us and to figure out the menu, we contemplated just finishing our drinks and going elsewhere. We all felt the menu was odd but given the good vibes and reputation the Local restaurants have, we thought we would give it a shot. I will tell you that $100 \"shot in the dark\" with what I order is quite the chance. We talked some things over with the server and placed our order. We were appalled when our meals actually came, thinking we were still waiting for additional plates, because the serving sizes were so small.   We all like nice places and do not expect giant portions but when we are spending $25-$35 per entree we expect a little more than a crock of grits and 4 shrimp or a pork \"soup\".  Sadly, I know what Local Sol is doing here and they have a great shot to really shine in this big beautiful building in a great location but they will sadly end up, like Gavi's, if they continue on their path of overpriced, idealistic food that they expect patrons to come back for.   We will not be fooled again, and chalk it up to a $100 loss...too bad we can't write it off!"}
{"text":"Had the most wonderful meal at Sol. My wife and I had the Double Bone in Pork chops with polenta and wild mushrooms. They were to die for! I enjoyed the Pork chops so much (I know it is not socially acceptable) I actually picked up the bones and cleaned them at the table. Meal was prepared to perfection. Atmosphere, staff, and service are all top notch. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a first class experience."}
{"text":"Love the space. I had only been in the building once before when it was Gavi's. Okay, there are some positives and negatives to report. We asked about the scallop appetizer/ tapa, and if you know me, you know I'm not a fan of tapas (but wife is). I know people like them and I get it, so I wasn't expecting a plate full of scallops. But I directly asked the waiter and he wouldn't give me an approximate number he explained it's by weight. I know it is, just give me a ballpark figure. Anyway, a plate full of cauliflower and two scallops was disappointing. I feel the waiter could have been more direct since we asked him directly. They both were very good though. My fish tacos were good, not spicy but good flavor. Wife was disappointed with her grilled cheese and lack of more vegetarian options. And last complaint was the pour on her wine was pretty stingy. Anyway, not really for us menu wise. Patio looks nice."}
{"text":"I have already posted a review but I'd like to make a suggestion... When my husband and I dined at the restaurant the manager (a woman with glasses and short hair) never made eye contact with us. There were maybe ten people in the restaurant at the time. I would recommend having the manager ask people for honest feed back before they leave."}
{"text":"I was here with our extended family for a dinner together. We started with appetizers to share we got the calamari, the octopus, a meat and cheese plate, and stuffed peppers. All the appetizers were very good and were well liked by everyone. I got the mussels and pasta which was delicious the mussels were  cooked well and the pasta went well with them. My mother got the scallops which were good but she only received 4 so that dish could have been better. You also have to pay 5 dollars for parking because the lot on front of the restaurant is privately owned by someone else which is annoying. All in all I'd rate the food 4 stars but the total experience 3 or 3.5"}
{"text":"Gotta say this is disappointing! I'll admit I've had a good experience here but that was a long time ago. Every time since then which is only a hand full of times cause some friends have suggested we go here ( never the same friend cause they learn from their mistakes)  As we have been sitting here with two empty plates and one with a horribly burnt piece of chicken on it we have seen the waitress walk by our table several times within the 40 minutes we have been waiting for her to give us our check. I know a lot of people on Yelp will exaggerate to make their story better but it is literally 40.  However a different waitress than the one we had was nice enough to refill our waters a couple times while ours stood at the bar. The waitress who brought our waters is the one who earned the 2 stars. Nobody else and definitely not the dinner.   Also this was meant to be a grilled chicken. This is a horrible charred dry piece of poultry that was difficult to look at.  I'm addition to that. It's a Monday night and there are 4 tables here including us. Other than that this place is dead.  This is horrible dude."}
{"text":"Sol is a cool place. I have been twice and I really like the vibe in this place. I'm really interested in coming back this summer to hang out at the bar when they have the garage doors open.   Anyway, like I mentioned, Sol has a cool vibe and I find it relaxing to hang out there. The people are very friendly and the food is very good.  Here is why they got 4 and not 5 stars. The menu can be a little bit vague. What does that mean? The first time we ordered Chicken Croquettes and on the menu it said ham and cheese filled but what we got was potato filled. They were good, but it wasn't ham and cheese. Then just a few days ago my wife ordered Salmon which was fantastic. On the menu it said it comes with \"roasted veggies\", sounds great! When we got the plate it had sweet potato and cauliflower. Odd for \"roasted veggies\" but it was great!! Loved it! But my wife is not crazy about cauliflower. Why not just put sweet potato and cauliflower on the menu?  Lastly, like I said the food is great, but a little expensive so keep that in mind.   These things are very minor I know but I just thought i would mention it. Check this place out for yourself. You should go at least once."}
{"text":"Came here for late happy hour, sangria was very good, also tried the Sol fries - also delicious, if you like garlic, I recommend! Loved the spicy aioli. Tapas menu wasn't that tempting, may try a few next visit, would love to have seen some empanadas or bacon wrapped dates but they were not on menu. Some of the sandwiches sounded good.  Bartender was friendly and service was quick. Nice interior, bar is cozy."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! A must visit if you haven't been!!!!! The patio is amazing, and the inside bar is perfect too!"}
{"text":"The menu contains some exotic dishes.  Nice to see variety. The menu is basically all small plates. So yes portions are small. I have always felt tapas restaurants are great for an appetizer or two before you go someplace else for dinner. This place fits that bill. Cocktails were tasty. So I will be back for cocktails in the summer on the patio."}
{"text":"Excellent location for business or family affairs. Brazilian style menu, with a meat heavy focus. Knowledgeable staff, quiet setting, and contemporary design. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"The short version; lovely presentation, gorgeous interior,  and highly professional staff are let down by bland execution and technical errors, as well as iffy pricing considering the food quality. Undercooked yet charred and unseasoned chicken kept my review at two stars. Perhaps someone was having a bad night (definitely happens!) and mistakes were made, but unfortunately I was unimpressed with my first impression. Very high potential, and perhaps the dish I ordered just was not in the cards for that night; que sera sera.  The long version;  The interior styling and atmosphere were top notch, I will say that with no hesitation. The solar motif shines in the sunbaked colors of the dining area, and the rustic solidity of the tables and seating. Obviously the work of either a professional or a very savvy eye.   The wait staff were friendly, and our server was attentive and polite. Management checked on us a few times as well, which was a nice touch, and very much appreciated. A single table visit and a kind hearted and confident \"how are things?\" Professional without being overbearing.   The menu is compact and simple. With such a small menu, however, one would expect bold flavors and a certain level of expertise in execution.  I always believe that the best way to get an idea for a restaurant's food is via a thorough cross examination via mastication of the potatoes. We snagged some fries for the table. This is where my worries started. They were solid--fries are fries after all, hard to mess up--yet there were two issues that would crop up again later in the meal; a select few spuds were undercooked, and the fries themselves were very much under seasoned.   Despite this, the aioli they were paired with gave me some hope, and was quite good, so we headed into our main course. My selection, a zucchini and carrot \"pasta\" with goat cheese and a grilled bread underneath (chicken added extra) initially impressed. The flavors accompanying the sliced zucchini and carrot \"noodles\" were subtle and savory, and while I don't really know what it was doing there, the grilled piece of bread was very tasty and countered and acidity nicely. The dish was inventive and highly creative. High ingredient quality for sure, and I'm such a sucker for goat cheese I was sold--until I hit the Olive bomb tucked at the center of the dish. Don't mistake me, I do like olives quite a bit, but their presence in the dish was beyond overpowering. All I was tasting was the salty musk of the too numerous olives.   Running then to the chicken, I was shocked to discover that it hadn't been seasoned or marinated, not in any way I could tell. Chicken is a flavor sponge that enhances taste with strong texture, but left on its own it fights an uphill battle in the flavor department. The chicken had been charred on the outside, yet was chewy and a little undercooked on the inside. Sadly very unpleasant, especially considering we had paid extra for it as an addition.   My thoughts walking away were primarily of the location's vast potential, and how pleasant my experience had been in contrast with the quality of my food. Compared to other restaurants in the dtw area, and having lived in this area all my life, the menu at Sol just cannot compete with the experiences available at the other locations right nearby, neither in quality or price. My dish had been so close to greatness, but the chicken sadly cemented my score. Despite having been happy with trying something new, we couldn't help but stare ruefully, and with heavy hearts, as we passed Tacolocal on our way home.  I wish the location only the best however, and I personally hope it flourishes in downtown.   --J.P."}
{"text":"Very good food and atmosphere. Sat on the patio. Had the Brussels sprouts for an app! Awesome!  Pork tacos were super as well. Chicken sandwich is very good as well. Good craft beer selection from Ohio. A little disappointed they discontinued the platform beer. Not over priced for the food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. Andrea our server was extremely friendly and quick to go over menu and offer recommendations as this was our first time in here. We ordered the zucchini and squash tacos and the chips and salsa. I thought the food was very good.  I liked the atmosphere. My only complaint which I did not share with them was it was too hot in the restaurant. The windows were all open but it was 89 degree day. We did do a take out order for our daughter who is a vegetarian. She loved the food. I was pleased to see many vegetarian and vegan items on the menu. I also liked they served local and Ohio beers."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunny Wednesday late afternoon.  Walked in, and was greeted, and asked where we would like to sit.  I stated the outside patio area, to which the host replied \"at a table?\".   I said I have never been here before, so I had no idea.  As we were led outside, she asked if we wanted sun or no sun.  I opted for a table with both.  Why not just allow us to choose our table?  And why would you ask me if I wanted to sit at a table, when there were ONLY tables (no bar area outside) ????    The waitress then started walking toward us as if to take our drink orders, and noticed the table beside us had their credit card out and ready to pay.  She took an immediate turn to their table to take their check, and then darted back inside.  Could you not have multitasked and grabbed our drink order as well?    I then decided that this was not a good experience thus far, and if I stayed, it would only have gotten worse.  As we stood up and walked out, we were asked if we were looking to sit inside instead.  Nope- going elsewhere where I am sure I will feel much more valued.   Feedback for Sol:  Your drink menu is vague pertaining to your beer list.  Were they all bottled?  Do you have anything on draft?   Wouldn't know just by looking at your menu.    Won't be back.  As far as parking, sad to see a couple parked directly in front of your front door, only to get out of their car and walk to another establishment.   Maybe they had already tried Sol and were using their wallets to vote."}
{"text":"After reading reviews and people wanting hearty foods and writing that cleveland wants more on plate.  I'm sure people do not understand what Tapas are and what the true Spanish cuisine is.  I believe cleveland has some of the best restaurants and chefs. Glad we discovered this gem and drove from summit county. Looking forward to checking out their brunch"}
{"text":"This one is difficult to write. I live in the Willoughby area and want to support local businesses. However, I must remain loyal to the fellow Yelpers and speak the truth. I've been here a few times and have yet to write a review.....Just holding out hope that it would get better. It hasn't.  My biggest gripe...... The food has NO flavor! We started off with chips and salsa and were told that the salsa is freshly made with tomatillos, onions, and peppers. Well, they must have cooked the flavor right out of the ingredients. We also ordered the tostone cups and was underwhelmed.   Drinks are nothing special and cost 9 dollars apiece. They do have a happy hour......But wait...... You have to be sitting inside at the bar in order to partake. It's 80 degrees out! I will be finding another patio to dine at.  Sorry SOL..... I tried. I really did."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Margaritas and figured this would be a great place to try. I was beyond disappointed when I saw the bartender on a Saturday night pull out the pre-made margarita drink mix! I could have gone to Walmart or Giant Eagle and got that, not pay $7 for someone to shake it over ice for me."}
{"text":"The only knock I have is that the item I tried to order apparently was no longer on the menu, but the menu's were not updated. Still giving a 5star because that is not important in the scheme of life when there are 20 other menu items that are amazing. I have only been for brunch so I cannot comment on the other times of day but Saturday and Sunday for brunch please stop in. There is a pastry chef who makes doughnuts and spreads them out on a table for 2$ a piece. These are freshly made doughnuts and there is a great variety. Also the waffles are made by the chef as well, and have the consistency of funnel cakes. The only thing wrong with waffles usually is that they do not usually taste like funnel cakes. The hot sauce is made in house and usually is super unique and used perfectly with the chicken. Mimosas come bottomless, and the bloody marys are huge and unique. a+ brunch."}
