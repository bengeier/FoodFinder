{"text":"Best Food Truck in Charlotte! Food was great! I got the smoked hash which was perfectly seasoned as well as the brunch burger. My friend got the Veggie Hash and Late Morning Fries and  that tasted delicious! Would recommend this truck to anyone and everyone in the Charlotte Area."}
{"text":"While attending the Legacy National Dance Competition the food truck was on site. It has been a long day; we were starving. We paid $17+ for a chicken sandwich plate and a chicken tender basket. We ended up throwing the chicken away and only eating the chips. The chicken was fried  floured fat and grease! Out of 3 or 4 tenders I was able to get enough meat off all of them to have maybe one tender. The deserts appeared to be brownies, cookies, and a couple of cup cakes that looked almost melted as they sit in the container  basking in the sun. This was our first experience with a food truck and it was a very disappointing one!"}
{"text":"We ate here at the Harrisburg ARTwalk and were blown away with the delicious food! We had the smoked hash and the grilled bacon and cheese sandwich. The bacon was the thickest bacon I've ever seen  the smoked brisket in the hash was very tasty. Definitely recommend finding where these guys are for the day and going there!"}
{"text":"I am all about breakfast food and it is great that somebody in town took the initiative to put some darn good breakfast food on a truck! The food was absolutely superb! I had the Veggie hash and the Stuffed French Toast Bites. I was hesitant to get the hash at first because I am not a big fan of beets... But it was a great impulse decision. The roasted beets were like none that I've ever had. If I could have beets prepared in that fashion everyday, they might be my favorite food! The hash was great and all, but the Stuffed French Toast was by far my favorite. The banana foster was perfect! I could have eaten it by itself. Each bite had a perfect texture and I loved the addition of the cinnamon toast crunch cereal! These things are a must have!"}
{"text":"I've found these guys at Lenny Boy's on Tryon the past couple Sundays and used to see them during the summer at the Cabarrus County Food Truck Rally.  Have quickly become one of my favorite food trucks in the Charlotte area.  They've got real creative Brunch-themed menu items - like the \"Morning Fries\", hand-cut french fries covered in sausage gravy, thick-cut bacon and a fried egg, or the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Waffle-Sandwich.  I would eat at this truck only for the rest of my life and die a happy man."}
