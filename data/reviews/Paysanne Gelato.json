{"text":"My usual place for gelato :) Although I don't go often, since it's a bit on the pricey side. Very good sorbet and gelato. Don't forget to grab a point card available in other franchises.. (Not in the main store)"}
{"text":"Everyone was talking about this place so I decided to give it a try. 

It is a very small place with some seat outside to enjoy your gelato. They have a lot of different flavors. It was very busy so we had to wait a long time and unfortunately couldn't find a seat outside so we had to eat in the car.

Gelato was not amazing but still good. Don't think I would try it again because the long wait it not worth it in the end. The prices are also a little high so all around not a good deal in my opinion."}
{"text":"The ice cream is horrible, it tasted so old like the your grand mother keeps in a jar on her coffee table. If you have time drive to Little Italy it's worth it, if you don't Adonis is down the street. My wife doesn't stop saying how disappointed she was."}
{"text":"Du gelato artisannal, avec plusieurs saveurs offertes. Ma préférée : mille feuilles! Une portion moyenne est très satisfaisante et est extrêmement délicieuse. J'ai rencontré le frère de la propriétaire/ créatrice. Il était très sympathique et a pris le temps de nous faire goûter plusieurs saveurs et de nous expliquer un peu l'histoire du commerce malgré la petite file qui se formait. 

J'ai aussi goûté à leur fameux beignet fourré au gelato de votre choix. C'est un beignet chaud qui contraste bien au goût avec le gelato bien froid. Très cher, mais vraiment à essayer!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for gelato! If you're in the mood for gelato with a twist, make sure you try either their smoothies or their gelato donuts. They make them with any of the flavors on display. 

They also offer gelato cakes for special occasions like birthdays or even dinner parties.

The staff is friendly and doesn't mind you trying the flavors they have, which are varied enough to satisfy all sorts of palettes.

I found their Mille-feuilles flavor to be a little disappointing but loved the mango, the triple chocolate cookie dough, the banana chocolate and their Madagascar vanilla to be very satisfying.

Again, make sure you try their gelato donut! It was definitely worth the 3 dollars! I had mine with hazelnut and thoroughly enjoyed it. Find out which flavors you prefer and ask the staff for helpful suggestions.

Enjoy your discoveries!"}
{"text":"I ordered a medium cup of gelato and it was pretty good. Flavors were cappuccino and hazelnut. It wasn't amazing but they were pretty good and it came with a cookie on top! Service was fast and friendly and I'd definitely be back here to get some more.

Price-tag was a little stiff though but hey, good ice-cream plays hard on the wallet."}
