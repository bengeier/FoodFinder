{"text":"Great Place.  The owner Melissa is passionate about what she does and it shows. The pancake, oatmeal, and donut were phenomenal. Great variety of favors with healthy ingredients."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience.  I was there with a large group of moms/babies and the owners were very patient.  I had the almond blueberry oatmeal and it was fantastic!  Truly a gem! The owners are super friendly I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Recently bought two bags of cranberry maple pecan - one at Tempe Community Market and sent one to a friend in S. Carolina. I'm enjoying it a lot and so is my friend. Going to order another bag for my brother for his birthday.  A healthy & delicious breakfast"}
{"text":"The Cafe was recommended as a place my husband, who has medical problems, could eat. What a find! When we explained what could and could not be consumed, suggestions for lunch were graciously offered with explanantions about the ingredients, making our selections easy. My husband had the My Sweet Pepper (as a salad), I had the Greek Vegan Burger with the zucchini salad on the side and our son had the Not-Cho-Macho Pizza, all quite delicious. Great food, gracious, friendly and accommodating staff/owner and so inviting. The place was very busy (always a good sign).  We even brought home their Oatmeal Mix. The three of us really enjoyed eating here. The Oatmeal Cafe could well become our favorite place and we look forward to going back as often as we can."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning based on Yelp reviews. Was not disappointed! I was grabbing food to-go and was advised to try a peanut butter banana parfait. It was delicious and filling! The wide variety of flavors and preparation options means this will now be a weekly stop on my way to the office!"}
{"text":"Not being vegan to be honest when this place was suggested I was a little skeptical. But I was more than pleasantly surprised. The pancakes were amazing."}
{"text":"We drive all the way from Apache Junction for this tasty, healthy, cruelty-free food. Love the quote from Hippocrates on their wall:

\"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\""}
{"text":"Had a great time at Iss' Oatmeal Cafe!!  Nicest people ever!  They explained everything to us.    We had the cranberry maple pecan pancakes and they were delicious. I bought the Iss Magic mix of it and have been eating it at home and love it!  My only regret was not being able to stay in Arizona long enough to try their burgers!  I will be back Melissa!  See you in December!  Also I will be ordering your yummy mixes online!  Thanks for making us feel so welcomed and for the most delicious pancakes ever! I would give you more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Found this little spot by chance driving by and couldn't be happier to have stopped in. 

Enjoyed excellent pancakes and fresh fruit with organic coffee. 

Love the quaint atmosphere and environmental friendly ideas behind their menu! 

With food this good, it makes being vegan so easy. Do not miss food or dairy when I'm at a place like this!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry - stop what you are doing and go here now. Friendly service & atmosphere plus great (and healthy) food = No brainer"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  These are definitely some of the best vegan pancakes I have had.  I tried the walnut apple pie ones.  The apples were diced on top of the pancakes.  They come with syrup and vegan butter.  Staff was very informative and friendly.  They make you feel welcome as soon as you walk through the door.  Their food and service is definitely a reflection of their 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter, but this oatmeal cafe is magical. Super friendly, helpful staff, and cozy atmosphere. Plus locally owned!  I usually go for weekend breakfast and get pancakes, but they do burgers and just started offering pizza too. Can't wait to try more of these lunch options! #localfirstaz"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT hidden gem! - And proof that healthy, clean food doesn't have to taste boring. A group of us popped in this morning to grab a late breakfast, all trying different combo's, and everything was to die for. The owner walked us through all the different ways to try the variety of oatmeal and pancakes offered.

The prices are definitely on point, they don't over-charge for anything on their menu. We all will be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The menu can be a bit confusing, but they explained everything clearly. We came for breakfast. My son had the chocolate peanut butter pancakes. They were very filling-he ordered 2 and did not finish. He said that they were a little dry, but that was likey due to the peanut butter. I had the black forest smoothie. It was not too sweet, which is a plus for me. All around a pleasant meal that we could feel good about."}
{"text":"Rating this any lower than 5 stars would be criminal. Outstanding fresh food, hearty portions, top notch customer service... I could write a novel about the class the family who runs this place and the food they make but I will spare that in hopes you come experience it yourself. Everyone has to come try their amazing food."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered Iss' Oatmeal Cafe but have been here multiple times and every time leave extremely satisfied! I have tried multiple menu items and always have a hard time deciding what to order because everything is delicious. 

You can order multiple flavors of oatmeal that are custom to Iss' and choose how you want to have it prepared: hot water, cold milk, warm coconut oil or with yogurt. They also have oatmeal pancakes! If you are looking for lunch they serve up some amazing house made oatmeal burgers. They have a variety of flavor profiles including an Indian influence, tropical and black bean version. You can order these as a sandwich or a salad. It doesn't stop there either, they have multiple baked goods. 

The food is amazing and the costumer service is equally wonderful! The owners are extremely friendly and knowledgable about their food and nutrition. I believe the food is of high quality and I always leave feeling full but never with the uncomfortable feeling that low quality fatty foods give me."}
{"text":"Love, love LOVE this place. I've spoken to the owner on multiple occasions and love everything about her, what she's trying to do and where they're going. Although it's not 100% organic, a lot of her stuff is. But she wants EVERYONE to be able to eat this way which is why she keeps her costs down.

Some of the presentations could use a little improvement (like the sides of hummus in plastic containers, visible burger patties being pulled from ziplock baggies) but the food quality and taste is consistently amazing.

Keep it up."}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch...vegan burger, hummus, and raw veggies to dip.  Gorgeous & delicious.  Very reasonably priced. Owners & servers were terrific.  I'll be back!   Thanks so much for the energetic lunch ... served outside on this sunny day."}
{"text":"Superb service and excellent food. This was my first time here, so I ordered 3 different pancake flavors, and the Vindy Jewels Burger with beet salad as the side. I loved all of the food I ordered. I also tasted the Hillbilly BBQ which was good, but the Vindy was better IMHO.  I also ordered one of the flavored iced teas and was very impressed at the variety of flavor in it. I'm typically a regular black/pekoe kind of guy so this tea was terrific. The food is very filling so don't overdo it on ordering.  I had a ton of food to take home with me.  I was particularly impressed with Melissa, the owner, for taking the time to sit down with us and explain some of the products and choices. I'm glad I splurged on one of the oat mixes she sells because I'm a huge pancake fan and can't wait to try my hand making them this weekend at home for the better half."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best oatmeal I have ever had! I'm so used to the gross processed bags on instant oatmeal and now I feel so grateful to have found this place where they actually care about the food they are serving you and also care about the environment! Everything they do at the café you can tell has a purpose, from the food where they try to make everything they serve organic and non-gmo as much as possible, to the cups, plates, and silverware that are all either compostable or recyclable. The owners clearly love what they do and are just trying to make the world a little bit better to live in which really means a lot to me! 
I have to recommend the s'mores pancakes because they are to die for and also either the frozen hot chocolate or the monkey business (with cold brew) for a drink, also to die for!"}
{"text":"I was afraid that the food here would taste a little too healthy, but I was so wrong. It is decadence without the guilt! There is so much variety to the menu too. I recommend trying the oatmeal cold in yogurt or warm with Coconut oil.  The coconut oil will literally make you feel weak in the knees, it is that good.
The decor is like a micro brewery/shabby chic country store. Which doesn't sound like it goes together, but it does and it looks great. It's a really relaxed atmosphere and is the perfect place to meet friends for brunch!
If the food wasn't already good enough you should go to this place just to see the Robert Downy Jr. look alike that works behind the counter! Seriously though, Sam and Melissa were great hosts every time I've been there. Very friendly and knowledgeable.  Melissa seems like the kind of gal that would go out of her way to help a perfect stranger,  and it really shows in the way she runs this family business.
You won't regret trying this really original take on how to eat oatmeal."}
{"text":"Pros: good food, kind and caring staff, all vegan. Did I mention all vegan?! Good prices for the food. They recycle and compost, which is cool. 
Cons: all disposable plates, a feeling as if the space isn't quite finished. I guess I just wanted or expected real plates, silverware, and glasses. 
In the future, I would purchase the oatmeal mixes but would probably not dine in."}
{"text":"I am in town only for a few days and so glad I found this place! Not only is their oatmeal and smoothies delicious, the staff is so knowledgable on their products. It's a family ran spot and the husband and son are so nice and helpful! I didn't get a chance to meet the woman behind it all, the creator, but feel like this place radiates her spirit of positivity. I will definitely be back....specifically for the milk mama cookies i heard about, which is great for milk production in expectant and nursing mothers...I'm expecting my first little one next month! Thank you guys for making my morning!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I don't normally take the time to write reviews (although I always ready them before trying a new place--go figure), but I feel compelled to do so this time.  Everything I've tried here has been fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  I highly recommend the Cashew Bacon Pancakes and the Vindy Jewels veggie burger.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is soo quaint and welcoming. I just found out that they will close their doors on Saturday and focus on the Farmers Market while having local workshops on cooking using their products.  Sad?? Yes since I was here when they first opened and I will be here when they close. Such a beautiful spirit of people.

Please patron the ISS Magic Mixes company at the farmers market and other places within the community."}
{"text":"Great place! Everything is vegan and pretty reasonably priced! Pancakes and smoothies are delicious! Staff is very friendly as well! Definitely recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful people, wonderful atmosphere and wonderfully vegan. The taste of any oatmeal mix will make you smile and leave you happy. They have many options ranging from oatmeal cups to pancakes, raw cookies, muffins and donuts with many gluten-free options. You don't have to be vegan to eat here! Anyone will love Iss' oatmeal mixes. I'm in love with this place!"}
{"text":"Was in Mesa for a Photoshoot and found this fantastic spot on yelp. This family has opened the kind of restaurant I would want to open- healthy, delicious, affordable and full of love. If you want a great start to your day - come by. I had the blueberry vanilla GF pancakes. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots! Not only is everything on the menu delicious, but it's all made with healthy, nutritious, clean ingredients. The staff is super friendly and the restaurant has a warm, inviting atmosphere. A great way to start the day!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places lately.  I would say \"new favorites\", but I think I've been coming here long enough that it isn't new to me anymore.  

First off, this is an all vegan joint and their grub is organic. They have tons of different oatmeal mixes and offer several ways to enjoy: hot or cold cereal, thick magic (mixed with vegan yogurt or applesauce), slippery magic (mixed with warm coconut oil), and my personal favorite PANCAKES!!

I usually get the peanut butter chocolate chip mix, but once I got the Protein Powerhouse and the Love Potion cakes.  They are served with some fruit, vegan butter and grade B maple syrup.  In addition to breakfast items, they also have a nice array of \"burgers\" all made with a base of their original oatmeal mix.

They have some tasty beverages, as well! Most often I get a large Jnantik (a slightly bitter tea made from a Mayan seed, super good for your bod) one of their two coffee alternatives but they also have smoothies, pour over coffee, frozen hot chocolate and teas.  

This place is cute and cozy and the people who work here are supremely awesome.  Genuinely nice, not that fake nice you might encounter elsewhere.  

Ooooh! I almost forgot!  Should you find a mix that particularly tickles your taste buds, they have small and large bags for sale! Woot.

Get yer buns over and try, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is what's up in the vegan world!!!    I stopped by for a quick lunch the other day. If you're a newbie (like I was) - quick run down: They're only open until 2.30p and closed on Sundays (like pretty much most of my favorite places) and Mondays.

BREAKFAST: They have an amazing variety of oatmeal mixes - all with goodness like chia and flax and I can't remember what else but it's good. You can get any flavor as a hot oatmeal, cold cereal, parfait, pancakes, and a few other options I'm forgetting. Remember, I'm there for lunch, so wasn't paying much attention to breakfast options. However, I have sampled several varieties of their oatmeal mixes at Gilbert Farmer's Market, so I know if breakfast's your thing, you won't be disappointed.

LUNCH: And this is why I'm here yelping about this place. They have \"burgers\" and pizzas. Now please don't expect it to taste like your greasy meaty burger or cheesy oily pizza. That's not the kind of delicious I'm talking about. But if you're in for some whole food goodness, dive right in.

I ordered a Hawaiian BBQ pizza. Their pizzas have oatmeal crusts. Sounded weird to me too but I tried it, loved it, and now craving it again on a Sunday afternoon.

Wait!!! Have I told you about their beet salad? Every entree comes with a choice of a side. There were 3 options I think. One of them involved something zucchini. The other one I can't remember. And then there was this beet salad!!! I've grown up eating a lot of beets (thanks, mom) - and let me tell you this beet salad was DaBombDotCom. Simple flavors of orange and mint blended so beautifully with the shredded beets and brought about an amazing beet experience.

SERVICE: very prompt (for the sake of complete honesty a quick disclaimer - it wasn't super busy) but gosh everyone was so friendly. One of the guys took time to explain all menu options, and another lady took her time to walk me through the drink options.

P.S. Their iced coffee with maple syrup and coconut cream is great  

From the looks of it and overheard conversations, the place has a lot of regulars - which is always a good sign to me."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Very friendly owner and I love their intention to provide yummy vegan healthy fare to all! I've had the oatmeal and the vindaloo Burger so far and I am sold. The burger is so flavorful and filling this place will be in regular rotation for me. Just wish there were even more lunch options.  I understand they are keeping it simple to keep it great though."}
{"text":"Really great place! I stopped in and got the muffin of the day and a Strawberry Kale Zing smoothie. So delicious and very filling! Both of the people who helped me were extremely nice and very informative about the options. I'll definitely be back to try the pancakes."}
{"text":"I love oatmeal so when this popped up on my search of course I had to go for breakfast...and now I plan to return for lunch today! So good! So many options and all of it so good and fresh. And the staff and Melissa (Iss herself) are amazing."}
{"text":"Warmly greeted by staff upon entering, and menu thoroughly explained. Ordered cold cereal with blue berries and almond milk, and pour over coffee they grind the beans in front of you which is neat. Very fresh and flavorful food. Got \"my sweet pepper\" to go, and look forward to that for lunch.  When you check in you get a free cookie....yum! Definitely will return,  cute little cafe, very nice staff."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place! Initially, I thought the idea of an oatmeal cafe seemed a little silly because, really, is it that hard to mix hot water and oats? But it's so much more than that!

The owner gave me an overview of their offerings, and I went for muesli option since I'm a euro wannabe. She suggested the campfire s'mores mix, and I was so delighted to hear that they use gelatin free marshmallows. It's one of the hardest things to turn down as a vegetarian. I loved the oatmeal so much that I went out to the farmer's market a few days later to buy more mixes for home. 

The cafe also has lots of great tea selections. I got the vanilla mate and brewed a second mug at work per the owner's suggestion. There's also muffins, smoothies and pancakes, but what I'm looking forward to the most on my next visit is the veggie burgers."}
{"text":"I knew Iss' Magic Oatmeal from several Food Festivals. I love their oatmeal. As it's a bit of a drive coming from North Phoenix it was not before this weekend that I finally managed to visit their café. The waitress was greeting us very warmly and explained us the whole menu in details. After 10:30 they also serve lunch options like pizza and burger. 
Everything on the menu sounded sooo delicious. So we simply had to try everything. We got the 
Mushroom Asparag-Iss pizza, the Hill Billy BBQ burger and the Peach'n Cream pancakes. All vegan and amazing. It looked very appealing, it tasted differently than everything else before, but also you got the comforting feeling when you take a huge bite of a pizza or burger that you have been craving for a long time. 
The pancakes where so good, no words for that. I can't wait to go back and try all their different mixes for the pancakes. 
I want to go back every day. 

Just sad they close so early. I would totally have their pancakes for dinner as well."}
{"text":"Genius. Just genius. The flavor the pairing of different flavors and combinations of spices I can't even explain. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Very friendly right as you enter the door. It feels like someone's home and not your typical cafe. We were greeted by a young man who asked us if this was our first time or if we had been there before. Since we let him know it was our first time he was kind enough to break down the menu for us. He went through every section and then let us sit down to make our decision. I orders the Thipi Thai and it was deliciously fulfilling! I'm still getting use to being on a plant based diet and learning to try new flavors and getting use to them. Your first bite it takes you a moment to taste all the different flavors combined. I'm not a picky eater and always willing to try something at least once. This is a place I will be coming back to and trying the different menus they have to offer! 
Make sure you check in on the Yelp app to get and try a free oatmeal raisin cookie. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Saw the amazing reviews so drove a little out of our way to try it. SO glad we did.  EVERYTHING was amazing. Banana bread pancakes and pumpkin spice pancakes were so good. My husband had the bbq burger and said he would eat it everyday even though he's a meat eater. Bought two bags of oatmeal to go and an amazing pizza for dinner.  The oatmeal chocolate chip cookies were delicious too. Met the owners who spent a lot of time telling us all about their story. Can't wait to go back to Arizona to try more things!"}
{"text":"Loved the interior, the options, the taste and the staff. 1/3 of our family is vegan (me) and 2/3 are vegetarian-esque (husband and 9 year son). It's exciting to find a restaurant that cater to my diet AND that meets the desires of my family. We will most certainly visit this as one of our staple vegan eateries."}
{"text":"I want to cry! This place was so freaking yummy!!! Everyone was so nice, and you could tell they had a serious passion for the food they make here. I tried a burger (tasted like eggplant parmesan) and the cold zucchini salad. It was amazing! They don't use processed junk, it's all whole ingredients. I cannot wait to go back to try everything. I also took home a bag of the oatmeal mix, along with a cold tea (super yummy btw). Thank you for existing guys! It really makes me happy to find some bomb vegan food."}
{"text":"Locally owned, this family knows how to make someone want to eat oatmeal.  They have so many varieties, but my favorite is the protein powerhouse mixed with warm coconut oil.  Ask for a sample, they give great suggestions on what to get and you must try a pancake made out of their mix.  Not only a breakfast place, you can get some pretty tasty burgers too, these are not just any veggie burger, they put their mix in the burger along with other yummy items. Try the Islander with grilled pineapple.  They have a nice area to sit and enjoy your food. I always sit at the bar and chat with the owners and staff, they are so friendly and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Very high quality, yummy and healthy.   We found them in yelp this morning.   Once you wade through the menu (they help you) then you have some hard choices to make.   We ate the cranberry pecan and
Blueberry almond pancakes.   Excellent!   Around $5 for 2 pancakes.   Filling."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good breakfast here. Large option of oatmeal flavors, cold or hot, and a few other menu items. We went here because my friend is vegan, and to my surprise the food is great, and makes you full."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything is made from the oatmeal mix, including the burgers. I really like that you can get any burger as a salad. It does not look like a lot of food, but is really filling.
I really apreciate the story behind Iss and that she is willing and able to share her magic mixes with us. Thanks!"}
{"text":"After purchasing Iss' oatmeal at the local farmers market, I decided to give the restaurant a try. Honestly, one of the best oatmeal pancakes I have ever tasted...nice and moist and flavorful, not dry and crumbly like the one's I've tried in the past at other establishments. And so healthy! No processed pancake mix garbage here!

The owners are friendly and go out of their way to make sure you understand the menu. Don't leave without purchasing one of their mixes (I like mine in yogurt, the perfect grab and go breakfast). Can't wait to go back and try their lunch and smoothie options!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The owners are fantastic and the food is amazing. My picky 5 yr old loves it just as much as me...can't beat that!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place smells amazing when you walk in. The Cocoa Mayan cookie is TO DIE FOR. Don't forget your free cookie with check in! The lunch burgers are decent. Very healthy and sustainability conscious restaurant. It is family owned and makes most of its money through farmers markets and opened the storefront and restaurant by customer request."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could! Love the layout, love that it looks like walking into my mothers kitchen, love the staff and LOVE the food! Seriously this restaurant is the reason why I was inspired to start a new full color 42 page magazine for the east valley! Even if you are not into eating plant based you are going to be very pleased!"}
{"text":"We just went here for breakfast for the first time and everything was delicious and so satisfying. My 8 yr old has a lot of food sensitivities (wheat, dairy, egg and citrus) and the owner was so helpful and accommodating. He had gluten free pancakes w/the smores mix added in and he was so happy with it! He ate two entire very hearty pancakes which is quite a lot for him. Overall my whole family was very pleased. My three year old had the chocolate peanut butter oatmeal, I had the banana bread oatmeal w/PB and yogurt, my husband had the banana bread oatmeal w/almond butter and yogurt. We cant wait to go back and try all the other flavors. This is not your average bowl of oats! They also have smoothies, fruity chia drinks, baked goods, and lunch items."}
{"text":"If you like good, healthy food this is the place! I could not believe that I fell in love with oatmeal after my first  visit to Iss'. I highly recommend the oatmeal pancakes and the vegan burgers. Owners Melissa and Sam are always so nice to me throughout my visits. They truly care about this place and the food they make. Must try!"}
{"text":"The world needs more places like thIss! Food is uber healthy,.clean, and fresh. The family that runs the cafe might be the nicest people ive met. Such a nice change from impersonal chain cafes/restaurants. Only complaint is finding the place is difficult first time. Perhaps a better logo that is more visible when driving?"}
{"text":"Me oh my! One of my favorite vegan spots! I really wish there were one in Ahwatukee too... This shop has the most delicious... EVERYTHING. I've had the hot cocoa, delish. I also got one of the \"meat\" sandwiches and it was so good, very filling. I really like their cookies, they are the perfect quick \"I'm starving and need a snack but not junk\" pick me up. I bought their ISS Mix which I've already used for both pancakes and vegan burgers. Both turned out delicious and I'll be stopping back to pick up more when I run out. One big thing that I love, the owners are so nice! It's a family ran business and I spoke to both owners, the wife gave me a free cookie! I believe the kids help run the place too but unsure. Great people, great shop! Stop by, you'll be happy you did :-)"}
{"text":"This is my kind of restaurant! Yummy food with quality products, casual ambience, environmentally conscious, and very affordable.

Cereal: got the traditional with blueberries, vanilla, and almond. Filling and comforting, I could see myself eating this regularly in the morning. There are so many more combos too that I look forward to trying. 

Pancakes: best pancake my brother has ever consumed! Chose a banana bread addition and the other was a walnut apple pie. So dense...one can tell that there are healthy ingredients in this pancake.

Burger: the Goombah! Basically an eggplant parmesan burger and it was hearty and tasty. About five more varied and intriguing burger options...it was hard to choose but I am quite appeased.

There are smoothies, drinks and other hot beverages, and baked/raw desserts I plan to sample next time. And there will be many more next times."}
{"text":"Oatmeal has a bad rap for being boring, but after a visit to the Oatmeal Cafe, it will never seem boring again!

After noticing this place a few weeks ago and putting it on my need to try list, one of my friends and I popped in for breakfast. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the most amazingly delicious smells AND the nicest people. 

There are so many options--all of which sounded delicious--so it was difficult to make a decision, but I finally went with the blueberry vanilla almond mix (yum) and a black forest smoothie (double yum), while my friend went with the glogg aka Christmas in a cup and a red chai tea, both of which she raved about. 

I love that this place is healthy, yummy, locally owned/operated, and environmentally conscious. There aren't many restaurants I've been to that offer recycling options, let alone containers/cutlery made from compostable materials, but the Oatmeal Cafe does!

I will definitely be back to try their other flavors and will be recommending this place to my other friends and family!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet, you have no idea what you're missing!!! Melissa's knowledge is outstanding and her recipes are awesome. Not the average \"health food\" for sure. Enjoy the ambience and the friendliness of this place. It's a family run establishment and it's clean, friendly and welcoming. The oatmeal is great (don't leave without buying bag or two) and the pancakes rock!!! The cookies and muffins looked great too. You can see the kitchen and the ingredients and appreciate the cleanliness of the cook area."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great environment end the people are the best. Great for breakfast and/or lunch!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes on Earth! Not exaggerating at all. This is the best pancake experience of my life!"}
{"text":"Expensive, portions are small and oatmeal is made way too sweet. This was an experiment that won't be repeated"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! They have an awesome menu, and lots of ways to to mix your oatmeal. They have pancakes, oatmeal, pizza, burgers, and it's all vegan! 

So so good. 

My oatmeal had hemp and maca which was amazing and delicious. I had the mango bliss smoothie too as well and that was great! 

This place gets three stars for the food. It's missing two because the service wasn't stellar. The people they do have are AMAZING, they're just understaffed. Everyone was working really really hard, and hustling. They were all really nice too. Because of the short staff, we had to wait 25 mins for oatmeal. And then we had a fifteen minute wait for a second pancake that needed to come out with the first round of food. There was one guy working the entire outside and inside and he really didn't even stop moving the whole time we were there. It was amazing to watch him work, and I'd definitely want him as an employee. They just need to clone him! 

We did hear from the manager (without asking) and she apologized for the wait, so that's nice. If we come back and there are more staff, I'm happy to bump this review to have more stars. 

Go here for amazing vegan fare, delicious smoothies, and nice people. Don't come if you're in a rush or need to be in and out fast. Take your time. This is a spot for a leisurely breakfast."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for months, and unknowingly bought oatmeal mix from them just over a week ago at a farmer's market! I will certainly have to do an updated review after going to the actual shop and trying some stuff on the menu.
I am completely obsessed with oatmeal, used to eat it every single day, so when I found out there was an oatmeal cafe I was pretty pumped. I was also very happy to hear they would be at the Gilbert Market.
The mother and daughter (I think..) working at the farmer's market stand were extremely kind and informative. After trying a sample of the raw oat mix, which I thought would be super weird, I was sold. I got a small bag of the original mix. People were teasing me for spending so much on a tiny bag of oats, but it is SO worth it. The ingredients are excellent quality, and it can be used in so many ways. I got a little sheet with recipes on it, I want to try making black bean burgers with it, yum! I have been using the mix to sprinkle over banana protein pancakes with peanut butter, and it is delightful.
I can't wait to go to the actual cafe and try out a smoothie or something, unique healthy places are the best!"}
{"text":"This is one of the friendliest, most welcoming places I've ever been. You can tell that *everything* about this restaurant has been crafted with care. The staff is friendly, helpful, and came by several times to ask me how I was doing and if my food had turned out okay. 

On a side note, their cold brew coffee is absolutely delightful!

It's also a really nice place to work quietly. I feel blessed that this place is within walking distance from my house!"}
{"text":"ISS' is an oasis of vegan delights in a desert of self-styled vegetarian or vegan \"friendly\" eateries. ISS is the nickname of the proprietor, manager, and chef. After eating at the restaurant for several days on a recent trip to Mesa staying at a hotel that was unfamiliar with the word vegan, I wanted to rent a room at ISS; but alas they only create, prepare and cheerfully serve a variety of breakfast and luncheon selections. Nonetheless, My wife and I were able to eat there at least one meal per day for the rest of our stay. Not only am I vegan but I am gluten free as well, No problem for ISS' who easily provided me with gluten free selections. 

I wish that I could say that over the times that I ate there that I could say that I sampled a large number of the menu offerings, but alas I cannot, for once I had the pancakes for breakfast and the Hillbilly BBQ for lunch, I could not bring myself to order anything else. Shame on me, I never got to the legendary pancakes although we did a bag of pancake mix to use at home. This family operated business is supplemented by equally friendly and helpful staff, If you are vegan, vegetarian or whatever else give ISS' a try and enjoy a healthy, delicious meal."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing I got the love potion pancakes and my sister got the chocolate peanut butter banana pancakes delicious!!! The cold brew was also tasty! It's a family owned business they all were extremely sweet and helpful about what to get support your local businesses and go here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is so friendly and the food is great. It's a vegan kitchen with a unique way to order and customize your pancakes, oatmeal or breakfast cereal and yes, they have GF! It's a must try when you're looking for something heart healthy and delicious. 

Shot out to the people working here, our order was wrong and they were so kind about it they even packed the incorrect one to go with a kind note ."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Oatmeal Cafe for quite some time now. I have a love for all sorts of food, meat included, and Oatmeal Café continually draws me back time and time again. First and foremost, the customer service is top notch. Melissa, Sam, Quint, Julia, and Megan are super friendly and have the best sense of humor. They do their best to make sure every single customer is happy and satisfied. Sometimes I call in my order, and I am usually late. They always make accommodations for me to ensure 1. I get my food and 2. my food is hot. I always feel like family every time I am there.

Their food speaks for itself. There is so much thought and energy into making it tasty and healthy. If you had to ask my what my favorite thing is from there, I wouldn't be able to tell you because I like everything. Well, I guess their Cookie Dough Madness smoothie is to-die-for. The gluten-free pancakes won me over first. Then the lunch sandwiches. Then the oatmeal. Anyway, every time I eat it, my appetite is satiated for basically the whole day. The food is always made fresh. The food always looks colorful, and presentation is very nice. They are also environmentally conscious and compost most things. I love everything about Oatmeal Café and recommend it to all my friends and family. If you're considering, you know my recommendation!"}
{"text":"John had the original pancakes and he said they are the best he has ever had! I had the blueberry almond oatmeal and it's scrumptious! We wish they had someplace like this in Queen Creek!"}
{"text":"I found this wonderful place from going to the farmers market and I am so glad I did. This place was so welcoming and the staff was so helpful and nice! I can easily say that I will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Welp, I went in for some pancakes and found out this business is closed.

I'm very disappointed because I really loved coming into this place for their mega healthy pancakes and their iced coffee with coconut.

I previously reviewed this business, so I want to make sure my information is up-to-date, and everyone knows, including Yelp, that this business is closed.

WHICH LED ME TO HAVE AN ENTIRELY NEW EXPERIENCE WITH THIS BUSINESS!

I am such a fan of their Magic Mixes, I googled Iss' Magic Mixes.

I found out Iss still sells her magic oatmeal mixes online, which makes me happy, because I love getting Iss' Magic Mixes! 

I also found out where the name \"Iss\" comes from!

Iss is a cute nickname for the owner, Melissa, from when her brother wasn't able to correctly pronounce her name as a young child.

It's fun interacting with local business owners and learning new things during NEW EXPERIENCES with the business!

*************ORIGINAL REVIEW***************

My recommendation: 

Put Iss' Magic Oatmeal Mixes Café on your \"MUST TRY\" list!

ISS' MAGIC OATMEAL MIXES CAFÉ

Iss' Magic Oatmeal Mixes Café is a healthy vegan café in the strip mall of the SE corner of Dobson and Guadalupe behind the Urgent Care, near Tillie's Attic.

From what I gather, their concept is using yummy delicious food that also has tremendous health benefits.

Their Motto:

\"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\"      Hippocrates

The oatmeal is a mix of organic chia seed, ground flaxseed, almond meal, Himalayan pink salt, true cinnamon, organic coconut palm sugar, and organic whole grain rolled oats. (see pic for descriptions)

The menu includes oatmeal mixes, custom pancakes, lunch specials, smoothies, unique hot/cold teas, hot chocolates and hot/cold coffees. 
(see pics)

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

I tried the lavender raspberry pancakes with mixed fresh berries.

The pancakes were SUPER dense. I could only eat one, but one is actually a LOT of food.

I also had the iced coffee with coconut cream and maple syrup. Also delicious. 

The staff was really friendly. I had a nice visit. I even got a chance to meet the owner, who is quite a lovely person.

CONCLUSION 

In my opinion, this is the kind of local restaurant that deserves a lot of business for all the right reasons; good food and good service.

5/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"Found this place on yelp. The staff is incredibly friendly and immediately asks about allergies. The food was amazing. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast place I've found. The service was great. The pancake I ordered (chocolate peanut butter) was delicious. The chamomile tea was really good and the jars are a cool idea. (Jars can be taken home for an extra dollar and reused or be brought back for next time). I had a glogg cookie from checking in on Yelp and it was really quite good too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been buying their oatmeal for years now at the farmers market. The owner, Melissa and her husband are super friendly and shared with me their amazing, gluten free, vegan, AND organic oatmeal mix. I've been hooked ever since. They have a billion flavors and now they have a cute little Cafe now where they serve breakfast  food like tea, pancakes, smoothies, and oatmeal. I'm spreading the word to the gluten free seekers about your Amazing pancakes!!! :)"}
{"text":"First of all, attentive workers with great service! The manager(?) let me know when my food was taking a little long, as well as, checked on me when I received my food while dining outside. 
Secondly, the food you're eating definitely tastes clean.  Not filled with processed junk and feels nice and light in the tummy. I got the Thipi Thai in the a salad. They broke up the patty into pieces and placed it over a nice green bed of mix greens and cabbage with a light drizzling of vinaigrette.  I had the peanut sauce on the side. 
Thirdly, by checking in on Yelp, you receive a free cookie. first impressions of the cookie..im not going to lie, you'll be wondering to yourself, \"is this going to be hard and taste like cardboard?\" But after I took my first bite, not only does it have a tiny bit of chew but it was very tasty! Not oily and has some vegan chocolate chips in there to sweeten it up a little. It was delicious :) 
I will definitely be back again. Probably tomorrow since I work near here!"}
{"text":"As if Iss' magic mixes wasn't good enough now we have a cafe too? So if for some reason you're too lazy to make your own oatmeal creations now you can have them made for you! Can't go wrong here. Something for everyone. Seriously!"}
{"text":"Such a great little hole-in-the-wall spot! This place is a unique vegan restaurant that you must absolutely give a try! Who knew oats could go so far?! The staff is friendly, the food is amazing, and the environment is great. It feels like you're at home in your own kitchen!

I'd definitely recommend this place for anyone! ESPECIALLY if you're VEGAN!"}
{"text":"boys love their oatmeal and this place takes it to a whole new level. vegan options too so yay!"}

{"text":"This is one of those places where you leave feeling like you did something good for your body & the amazing thing is how good everything tasted. This is a quaint little place that serves up healthy great tasting food. The service is friendly and more than willing to explain or give suggestions on what to try. I wish they had one of these in Gilbert & I wish they were open for dinner. I will be back - so worth it."}
{"text":"I took my nephew to this place because he has decided to make have a diet change in his life (at 15). After he did some research on the place, he agreed to go. He had the chunky monkey and the smoothy with strawberries. He followed this with a blueberry oatmeal cup, we bought cookies and one of the big oatmeal packages for his school week. I tried the pancake and the organic hot chocolate...yes! we were really excited about this place. The girls are friendly and very helpful. We will be back to the oatmeal cafe! 
PS: my nephew use the oatmeal preparation to make peanut butter bars - he used almond instead....they were delicious! This place is a keeper! :)"}

{"text":"My girlfriends & I meet here every Tuesday for breakfast. The staff remembers us & checks in with each one of us. It's a welcoming, safe, homie space where you can get happy from the inside out with yummy healthy food. Their lunch options are to die for....oh my goodness! You can do a Burger or maker it into a salad for low carb options. Their food always fill me up without making me feel heavy & I absolutely love the way I feel when I leave here. I look forward to what type of pastries they are going to have each week. Today, I had their Raspberry Chocolate Muffin. It was delicious. They have compost/recycling options, which is a commitment for any company to encourage & they do a wonderful job. They also share their recipes & cooking options for their oatmeal. 

Love the people, love the food, love the atmosphere, and love that my friends and I can hang out here every week. 

Thank you for being such a lovely business!!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice with a friend who has been coming for awhile. I had the pumpkin pancakes with chocolate chips the first time and my next trip I had the banana pancakes. Both were so yummy and delicious! Great family own vibe in the cafe and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I went there after work just this afternoon (6/24/16), I had never been before and it looked like a great vegan place. As I began to walk my first impression was that it looked as if I stepped into a family home, that made me feel very welcomed. What was even better was, which whom I'm assuming was the owner, Melissa, greeted me with such a warm welcome! She told me everything about the menu to all the products they use. I can assure you, everything was amazing! I had the Mushroom Asparagus pizza with the zucchini salad on the side, it was PERFECTO  
Although, I did have a smoothie as well, which in my opinion was not great at all  I had the Kale- Strawberry Zing. It had ginger in it but had way too much, to the point the strawberry and sweetness of it failed. I didn't drink any of unfortunately which was sad because it was almost $7. 

All in all, I love this vegan oatmeal cafe and will surely be coming back!!! I highly suggest any vegan breakfast/brunch lovers to seek it out !"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something other than the usual breakfast fare of pancakes and eggs so when ISS' came up on Yelp it looked like a good option. And it was!

My husband and I walked in and were immediately welcomed and walked through the options - oatmeal or pancakes. We decided to try both - I got blueberry vanilla oatmeal and he got a pancake with cashew bacon. We also got a s'mores donut and a smoothie with strawberries, spinach and almond milk.

The donut was the best vegan donut I've ever had. Often they can taste kind of plastic-like but this one had a really good flavor. It was a little crumbly but nothing we couldn't handle.

The oatmeal was excellent - very hearty and filling. And they used fresh blueberries, not freeze-dried or anything. The smoothie was also really tasty. But the real (and surprise) winner was the pancake with the vegan cashew bacon. It was way better than I expected. It was smoky and sweet and the real (yes, real) maple syrup really brought out the flavors in the pancake. Delish!

Oh, and did I mention neither of us are vegan or even vegetarian for that matter? When the food is good, it's for everyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing oatmeal-- the Original mix is my favorite, Ceylon cinnamon makes it. Their veggie burgers are to die for. Seriously, the bun is perfect, the oats and veggies in the burger are dense and soft with a little bit of crisp on the outside. Their teas, smoothies and teeccinos are fantastic. Pancakes... if you have never had oatmeal in pancakes you are missing out. It isn't ordinary oatmeal, they have over 30 flavors and I have never tried one I didn't like. The owners are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. I can't say enough good things about Iss's."}
{"text":"So many five star reviews really gave me an unrealistic idea of what to expect.
Had I read the reviews and it may have had greater influence on my decision to come here.

I wanted oatmeal for breakfast and so many 5 star reviews gve me cause to bookmark this place.  
So when I got a hankering for oatmeal the other day this place seemed only logical.  
Our time of arrival was good cuz we only had one couple ahead of us.  A young lady approached and asked if it was our first time visiting there and then proceeded to school us on the menu. 
Sounds good and it looked interesting too.
I do wish they had a menu that provided more details of the various mix on combinations.   That would have greatly influenced my choice and possibly my opinion of the food.
Upon checking in I see a Yelp perk FREE COOKIE.  Yippee.  We order, pay, grab a seat and do our phone thing.
The coffee took a few minutes and i was glad we had our phone thing to keep us occupied while waiting.  I mean there was only one other customer.
The cookie was devoured while waiting for our meal.
The oatmeal was NOT even close to what I anticipated.
It was palatable but it seemed more like a treat I would offer a horse.  I mean you're basically eating this stuff dry because they use the minimum amount of liquid.
Eating my oatmeal required some serious mastication.
Flavor was good but it was so, well I suppose just too dry for my taste that I ate (chewed and carefully grinding the oats)  maybe half of mine and just took the rest home with the intention of feeding it to my hens.  It was like eating an oatmeal cookie recipe sans the eggs and butter.  It wasn't pleasant and i just couldn't eat anymore.

The disposable dishes and utensils for dining in was strange too and apparently they provide an explanation why but it doesn't seem very earth friendly.  Yes I know the recycling concept appeals to many but I suspect it helps to reduce labor cost more than it benefits our environment.
Overall I was far from impressed.  Sadly Iss' didn't even come close to satisfying my desire for a hot oatmeal breakfast and I can't imagine ever coming back and not likely to recommend. Az"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The owners and their family are extremely friendly, shop is clean, organized, and the food and drinks are amazing! Everything is healthy and freshly made or made to order. I've referred many people here and will continue to go here! They just expanded their lunch menu and I can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"If you lean vegan or simply want to explore tasty food that's also wholesome and good for you, you gotta explore Oatmeal Cafe. Family owned and operated the service and intimate interaction with the family and staff make for a homey, small town-like experience. However, it's all about the food. So ask the staff for recommendations, and just try something different with each visit. It's a delicious journey."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic and personable, pancakes are so yummy!!! And OMG can we talk about the coffee?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"This family owned business kept me fed (and happy!) during my recent trip to Phoenix.  I had a 5 day class in Tempe and made the quick pilgrimage to Mesa for *every* breakfast and lunch that I ate during my stay. 
Before I get into my \"favorites\" I want to mention the freshness of the produce.  They clearly select THE FRESHEST of the fruits and veggies to give to their customers.  I have this image of them lining up everything they have and going, \"Okay, these are clearly the seven freshest raspberries of all our raspberries... only these (PERFECT) seven will make it onto this girl's plate.\"  ;) 
My favorite of all the burgers that I tried was the MexiCali burger.  I could eat that every day!  :)
The most mouthwater pancake (for me) was the Lavender Raspberry.  So good!
And the pancake that tickled me the most was the Grog flavor.  I was just in Prague and that option took me right back to wonderful memories of enjoying that warm drink.  :)
One more note about the fruit... On the third or so day, I asked for extra fresh fruit and the owner (who is so sweet) was like, \"Sure!\", and then loaded my plate with so many goodies that I left with a tummy that was a full as the smile on my face.  
This is a real gem of a place.  I give them 5 stars and 5 hearts!
:)"}
{"text":"What a great family restaurant. I walk in and it looks like someone's kitchen in their home. I love it. It has a welcoming feel. Its perfect just the way it is. 

I love the story of how they got started. Melissa or Iss,  is a certified nutritionist and when her father was diagnoses with type II Diabetes, she set out to make tasty, healthy food for him to better his health. 

This was my first visit and the young man at the counter was very professional and thoroghly explained how this works. I can tell he likes his job. 

I ordered the Walnut Apple Pie and Fountain of Youth tea.  The oatmeal was out in less than five minutes. 
I could see real chunks of apples, and the crunch of walnuts. Its so refreshing to eat at a place that cares about quality ingredients. 

The tea was pretty good. I would have liked some splenda or alternative sweetener but I didn't see any out. I'm sure they could have accommodated me if I asked.  If you give the glass jar back they will credit $1. You are allowed to take it home if you wish. You can re seep the tea bag for a second glass. 

I also received a free oatmeal raisin cookie for checking in with Yelp. The cookie was a little dry and would have been great warmed. It has a nice flavor though so I had no trouble finishing it. :)

This is a wonderful family business, it would be nice to see them successful. I hope you give them a try."}
{"text":"Great Vegan oatmeal pancakes, yummy and clean smoothies and really nice people. cute cafe, but a little small. The food is super clean and really delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful!  I'm a meat eater, and I found wonderful tastes and textures.  The oatmeal mixes are to die, no, to live for"}
{"text":"Who knew oats could be so tasty? I was skeptical that a restaurant serving strictly vegan food, and mainly oat/grain-based nutrition could be that good but was pleasantly surprised after our meal here.

The menu is quite varied for an oatmeal bar, and the gentleman at the counter was friendly and patient as he explained their selections to us. I decided on the traditional style (oatmeal and hot water) gingerbread oatmeal and also shared some glogg pancakes. 

The oatmeal was excellent, with a combination of flavors and textures that were pleasing to the palate. I loved the kick of ginger in it. The pancakes were amazing. The flavor was really like glogg, with just the right amount of spices and bits of tangy fruit flavor. 

There is an equally diverse selection of drinks such as teas, coffee, smoothies, and coffee alternatives. I grabbed a honeybush cacao iced tea from the fridge. It was a very very light tasting tea, almost to the point where if I hadn't known it was iced tea I would say it tasted more like tinted iced water.

Service was excellent and very friendly. Although there wasn't any meat or dairy in our meals I didn't miss them at all and was full afterwards.

This oatmeal truly is magical so stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"The cookies were AMAZING! I got a drink that was an alternative to coffee and it was good. It didn't dehydrate me like regular coffee would. I also got a FREE cookie witj check in. After receiving my drink and my coffee and i walked out. Let me tell you, when i tried the cookie i came back to get 4 more!!!!!!! They were sooooooooo good.. Must get!"}
{"text":"So glad my boyfriend and I found this place during our trip up to Phoenix. We came in for breakfast super hungry and left full. Pretty sure the owner thought we ate an insane amount of food (because we did!! Lol) We tried cranberry maple pecan pancakes, Jewels of India hot oatmeal with yogurt (traditional + thick magic) and she let us sample some dry before getting it. We had a Maple Bacon donut ('bacon' was actually toasted coconut flakes that tasted bacon-y) and a mint chocolate chip donut. Check in and you'll get a free cookie. Tried the jnantik and cookie dough madness smoothie (so... Good...!!!). Jnantik tasted like a seed, because it's brewed from Mayan seeds, and is non-acidic and caffeine free unlike coffee. Sounds strange but I enjoyed it and the fact that it brings you into an 'alkaline state' and gives you alertness without caffeine. Cool :D. Unfortunately we were getting full so we couldn't try anything else, lol. So jealous that Phoenix has a place like this, will definitely be back when traveling. Nowhere like this where we're from. I regret not getting anything to go!! Just goes to show you don't need meat and dairy in everything for it to taste good. Also, the service here was amazing."}

{"text":"I thought I'd eaten oatmeal before but as I found out, I had never really had the good stuff. They can turn the most normal breakfast food into the most amazing of treats. Then there is their lunch, which is of course exquisite! You think this review is over?  No way, I haven't even talked about the coffee or the staff, both of which I recommend starting your day off with because of how delightful they are.  Yes,  get to this place immediately,  indulge in a healthy and delectable breakfast or lunch and enjoy the best choice you have made today."}
{"text":"While visiting Tempe, AZ I looked on my yelp app to see what vegan restaurants were nearby.  I couldn't find very many vegan places in the area, but was happy to find Iss' Magic Mixes Oatmeal Cafe relatively close to where I was staying.  I was also happy to see that they opened early for breakfast.  They serve oatmeal and pancakes for breakfast, and I had been craving pancakes!  They are diabetic friendly with a low glycemic index.  The breakfast was delicious and filling. I love the tea that they serve! The owners are super friendly, I asked what other vegan restaurants that were close by, and they named off several places that I ended up checking out.  We ended up going to Oatmeal Cafe twice in the week that we were there.  I look forward to going back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to try Oatmeal Cafe for awhile and today I finally had the opportunity. We went on a Saturday afternoon and I had a hard time deciding between breakfast or lunch. In the end I decided on breakfast as the pancakes are what drew me to the Oatmeal Cafe. Will be back to try a lunch soon. The pancakes are based on Iss Magic Mix - flavorful, healthy, just plain yummy! The coffee was a pleasant surprise too. I had hot and my hubby had the cold brew. The owner is passionate about her food, your health and the environment. Food and coffee is made to order. I purchased a family size bag of the original mix and made sure to pick up a recipe card. What a healthy afternoon!"}
{"text":"Best tasting pancakes! I would recommend this place to everyone. The  tea was superb! I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"STK. Sashiburi desu yo! These ninja here are up really early in the morning.  An outstanding product they offer, that does not assassinate your budget ;) You can take home this magical mix to experiment with, or they can just make it for you.  And they got sandwiches, too!  5 Ninja Stars!"}
{"text":"Outstanding oatmeal burgers! The Thia and BBQ burgers were very good. They have very good cold crew coffee as well. I took home some of the oatmeal as well, and it also was outstanding. I live with 2 vegetarians, this is one of our new favorite spots."}
{"text":"We first discovered Iss' Magic Mixes a couple of years ago at a Scottsdale farmer's market, and have sought out their oatmeal mixes ever since. The ingredients used in their oatmeal mixes are top quality, and the combination of ingredients in their variety of different oatmeal mixes give a flavorful meaning to the phrase \"healthy eating\". Heck, I'll even eat their oatmeal dry, which sounds odd, but try a bite and you'll see how good it is.

I can't praise their oatmeal mixes enough, you just feel good eating it. 

We stumbled across their new cafe, The Oatmeal Café, on Guadelupe and Dobson, and were astounded to find it as we've been fans of their mixes for a couple years now and had no idea they had opened a physical location. We've been there several times now for their delicious food and have been warmly greeted and engaged in great conversation. They are friendly, outgoing, educated in nutrition and ethical practices pertaining to the food industry, and are all around masters at their craft. If you're uncertain as to which to try, ask and they'll happily provide you with samples. They have a myriad of concoctions to arrange and combine to your liking, and they offer so much more than just oatmeal (although their oatmeal is so good it's hard to decide on anything but). Their pancakes are wonderful, as are their cookies. 

I highly recommend Iss' Magic Mixes and The Oatmeal Café. If you eat for nutrition and fuel, are conscientious about your health and what you put into your body, and if you want the benefits of healthy eating without sacrificing flavor, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We found by complete accident the most wonderful breakfast spot, Oatmeal Cafe. Incredible oatmeal, pancakes, remarkable vegan burgers, and this is from a true lover of his beef hamburgers. The owners run the shop, explain everything and are the most friendly people. We have a new favorite."}

The waffle they shared with me was great. The oatmeal I had was as good or better than I've ever had. Creative and different but excellent taste and good for ya. 

Glad I went here. I bought 3 bags to take home with me it's that good. Every time I'm in Phoenix I'm going here CV

But the way the donuts are great, try them, different and good, baked not fried. 

It's a family business, they do a great job."}
{"text":"Iss' Oatmeal Cafe is SOOOOO delicious!  After my first experience over a year ago, my wife and I have tried to make this a weekly occurrence so we can try all of the Pancake flavors and even a few of the veggie burgers (don't forget to try these!).  It's hard to say which is my favorite flavor of pancake, but the Peanut Butter Chocolate (add Banana!) is my go to.  I do LOVE Blueberry Vanilla Almond, Banana Bread, and Raspberry Chocolate Rapture as well.  Me and my lady always split a stack and add a muffin plus doughnut (rotating flavors) to get the full effect of flavors.  If the raw desserts are available we try to bring one (or two) home for later.  Now, we will always go somewhere for GOOD food, but Melissa (Issa), Quint and crew are great, great people with a lot of passion for health and are even good for a few jokes (as long as it's not busy) too which is why Iss' Oatmeal Cafe is a place that we will always frequent.  Don't forget to try the local tea from Wisdom Nectar and locally roasted coffee which is pour-over too."}
{"text":"Iss' is amazing. Super friendly and wholesome. Great value and you'll walk out full of healthy grub. 

I've only been once, but I enjoyed my oatmeal and free cookie (with check-in on yelp).

I'm looking forward to returning with my family so we can sample the pancakes. Nom, nom."}
{"text":"Very surprisingly tasty . It is all vegan fair but so delicious It is mainly oats based but they do have bean and oat burgers. I got the MexiCali it was more than up to par with any bean burger I have ever had and yummy. I also got the walnut apple pie oatmeal  it was good but the cranberry maple pecan is by far superior . Everything here is filling so you dont want to much of one thing. There business plan is based on nutrition and sustainability and they are GOOD at it. Thank you for giving my bf who is borderline diabetic a healthy place to eat bfast"}
{"text":"\"I get up in the morning, I make myself a bowl of instant oatmeal, and then I don't do anything for an hour, which makes me wonder why I need the instant oatmeal. I could get the regular oatmeal and feel productive.\" ? Mitch Hedberg

Well, Mr. Hedberg, I call your instant oatmeal and raise you ISS' Magic Mixes Oatmeal Cafe [IMMOC]!  I'm sure a lot of you are wondering why anyone would go out and get oatmeal when you can buy that processed junk at the stores.  Well, here at IMMOC, they do things the right way.  All they oatmeal mixes are pesticide free; organic; and have a diabetic-friendly blend of chia seeds, flax seed, almond meal, Ceylon cinnamon, coconut palm sugar, Himalayan pink salt, and whole-grain rolled oats.  You can get your oatmeal traditional [prepared with hot water], morning muesli style [served cold with your choice of almond or soy milk], thick magic [made with either vegan yogurt or apple sauce], or slippery magic style with is served with warm coconut oil.  There are also a wide array of mix blends you can add onto your oatmeal like chocolate peanut butter, vegan cashew bacon, et cetera.  A bit overwhelmed by oatmeal choices?  Ask their staff!  It's family owned and they're very sweet and informative.

Everything they serve here are vegan and GMO-free.  They even have burgers!  Before you roll your eyes and assume you're getting a Boca burger or Morning Star patty, their burgers are handcrafted in store.  It has mushroom, ginger, and oatmeal.  W-hoa!  All burgers are served with sweet peppers and hummus and you can upgrade to their daily soup for an additional fee or even turn it into a salad for you no-carbs bunless-loving people.  They are a bit on the smaller side with a price tag of $9-something.

They also serve pancakes too but I haven't had a chance to try those.  Hankering for something sweet?  Check out their muffins, doughnuts, and pies.  Better yet, check-in on Yelp and get a delicious cookie FOR FREE!  And before I forget to mention, you have got to try their smoothies.  The Strawberry Kale-Zing and Mango Bliss are delicious.  They also serve hot tea, coffee, and vegan hot chocolate.  I hope you vegans out there are drooling because this place is great.

It's a clean and cozy shop with seating indoors and out.  Order at the counter and have a seat.  A parade of healthy food will come shortly.  IMMOC is a great way to treat yourself to flavorful food that's also good for you!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love the pancakes, very filling, good value. Healthy and delicious! Great to have a breakfast place like this. Awesome service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was hidden in a strip mall. We ordered 2 of the burgers, and took home a madonna jar of tea, and a package of the chocolate oatmealix. We've been back twice. Very filling ad you can imagine. The owner mentioned they were about to release their new Pizza. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Truly awesome.  My wife and I have been looking for a solid breakfast place that stood out from the crowd and offered morning fare that was filling, delicious, and didn't rely on sugar/fat.  I had the Blueberry Vanilla Almond mix oatmeal mix in my pancakes and they were great.  My wife got Pumpkin Spice in her pancakes and she loved them.  The Oatmeal Cafe also offers a variety of vegetarian burgers (not just one house variety as most restaurants do).  We ended up ordering two different types to go for lunch.  The interior is contemporary and suits the theming of the food.  The price was very reasonable for unique and healthy food.  We will definitely be coming back here regularly."}
{"text":"Confused about all the good reviews. The food was terrible neither my husband or I finished more than half.  But even more annoying than that was they don't have any silverware or plates only \"compostable\" paper plates and forks and also non compostable plastic containers even if you eat in. It creates so much waste it's insane.  Compostable items still takes lots of water and energy to create and you throw it away after one use. They gave us hummus in a plastic cup that just goes into the garbage right after. Every side is individually packaged in a container instead of just being on the plate. Our burgers were disgusting and had bad flavors! A real waste of money :("}
