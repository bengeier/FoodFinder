{"text":"Some of the worst food I've ever had. I would not be surprised if whoever came up with the recipes they serve had no tongue."}
{"text":"Yup I am a fan of this place especially if you've ever worked in the Edifice Sun Life ( Sun Life Building on Rue Metcalfe. Fast servers and above cafeteria quality food, you can get a homestyle soup for around $2.50 w/crackers and a small pasta or fruit salad on the side for about the same price. The lineups get intense at 9am and 12pm due to lunchtime rushes but they are always quick and friendly, almost like a catering company."}
{"text":"Decent, quick food. It is pretty packed during the morning coffee runs and peak lunchtime hours since it is located inside the Sun Life building. However, they are super quick, so you'll be able to get your lunch really quickly. They offer sandwiches, soups, wraps, pasta, etc. Their soups are $2.5 with some crackers with 2 options every day - the cream of mushroom was very, very salty in my opinion. Their coffee isn't that great either - there are other cafes, even inside the Sun Life building. But I guess if you work inside the building or nearby, this could be occasionally be a quick, cheap option for lunch once in a while, although there are better alternatives for sure."}
{"text":"I stop here for lunch to-go very often.

Fantastic variety: 
- Hot meals 
- A huge variety of different types of cold salad 
- Deli sandwiches, panini's, epinada's, wraps (lots of different meats to chose from) 
- Everyday two types of soup are available, the Minestrone is great with lots of vegetables.
- Coffee en masse!

Stecchinos also offers good quality catering for a fair price. I've used it personally.

For general info: There is no place to sit. You have to buy your food & go. It is located in a Corporate building so most people stop in, purchase their food and go."}
