{"text":"Malheureusement le restaurant a ferme en 2013. Le restaurant-mere sur Mont-Royal est toujours ouvert."}
{"text":"Have been here three times. The food is quite good. The mole is excellent. The chairs...slightly uncomfortable...the ambiance is ok...not great...the food though is why you go...but at that it is overpriced in my opinion. Giving it two stars for the overall experience but the food is closer to three or four....Tough to find decent Mexican in this city (country!)"}
{"text":"I tried the shrimp fajitas.  They were served with lots of peppers and onions.  The tortillas were served with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream and guacamole."}
{"text":"The food was fine - I had tacos - it was strange to me that they didn't come with cheese. Our bill (when we added the tip) was close to $40 (for 2 people) - and we didn't even get drinks (not even soda). Edible, but overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is just adorable in every way.  It's been a good few years since I've tasted the wonderful Mexican cuisine.  Every chance I get, no matter where I am, I tell people to give Tamales a try.  In fact, just a few days ago I praised the food and ambiance to ready ears and hungry bellies.  I think I will find an excuse to make my way over to Saint-Lambert in a couple of weeks for a birthday bite!"}
{"text":"I had the tortilla soup which was slightly above average. The chips were good the  salsa was not very good. The Tamales with the green sauce were excellent. The side of rice was very plain. Not much spices. The gold margarita was pretty good but nothing to write home about. Wait staff was friendly and did a good job."}
{"text":"Good and fast service. The food is good, but it doesn't taste like the \"original\". I know that's almost impossible, but if you have tasted \"tacos al pastor\" in Mexico and then at Tamales you'll know what I mean, it's not bad yet not really tacos al pastor."}
