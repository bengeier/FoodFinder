{"text":"the food is superb thus is my third time and I love eating here. next time please remember my marshmallow on my hot choholat"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. Let me start off by saying that i am the pickiest eater and rarely get impressed with restaurant food. 

Ok so onto the review..

We got here on boxing day,  just a bit before 10 am so we were able to be seated without waiting. 

According to the reviews, the Velvet Pancakes, Fork Scramble and Animal Fries were really popular so i decided to order all 3 (yes i was that hungry) to give it a try. 

The Red Velvet pancakes really do live up to the hype. They are one of the best pancakes i have ever had. Very tasty and fluffy + the cream cheese sauce it comes with is perfect. It is not too sweet nor too bitter. It perfectly complements the pancakes. 

The fork scramble pastry was HUGE lol but despite the size it was very light but a bit too bland for my liking. 

The animal fries is amazing. Its basically their home fries with home sauce, ketchup, avocado and a few other ingredients. 

I ordered 'the hulk' smoothie which is made with Spinach, Mango, banana, coconut water and honey. Its very refreshing and not too sweet. 

All in all, i highly suggest you pay this restaurant a visit! its definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"If you've never had peameal...you need to try it here. The thick Canadian style bacon with perfectly cooked over easy eggs and crispy breakfast potatoes were great. It took a while to get the food, but that was okay because we could tell the red velvet pancakes were made from scratch and they were delicious. Definitely try this brunch spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ooh such good food! Me and a friend went there for dinner and were pleasantly surprised to find both the quality and quantity great. Their mussels in coconut sauce is to die for! Pair that with their sweet potato fries and their excellent mulled wine, and you have a dinner you'll be yelping about ;) Keep in mind that the chicken pot pie is delicious but huge! If you have an average appetite like moi, pair it with a side of salad and not more carbs. Also, better to make reservations - this is a popular place."}
{"text":"The Good Fork has a great selection of breakfast plates and all are equally delicious from pull pork bennies to red velvet pancakes, excellent service.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I'm a regular, at least once a week for breakfast.
However... go on the weekend for breakfast and the service is terrible. Last time it was 40 mins to get coffee and 1.5 hrs from time of order to get our food. Needless to say, that was the last time i would ever invite guests to go there or take my family on weekends. However, during the week when it's dead at breakfast, great food, great service."}
{"text":"I recommend the Italian Job.  Lots of sweet pancake options too.  They don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Pancakes were delicious. Ordered \"huevos\". So delicious but massive portion. Couldn't finish. Burger was good."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast.. For 10 am. We were told there would be about 45 min wait. No problem I get its Sunday morning wait is expected. It's now 11:30 and we just got our table!!! After speaking to the hostess twice. Wont be coming back here, the wait is just way to long.... My son is so hungry at this point he's feeling like he's going to throw up;( 
Lesson learnt won't wait this long next time. Service is not that great either."}
{"text":"Had a brunch twice here already and definitely would come back. Really like a wide selection of poached eggs these guys serve. Sure it gets a bit busy on Saturdays, and maybe downstairs some of the grill fumes can be bother some. But overall the food is very good and had no problem with the timely service."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore good fork! The food is always so unique, fresh and delicious. I usually get the spanish hash which is one of the best breakfast dishes i have had in Toronto. The burgers are also sooo good and juicy. They usually change up a few things on the menu every season so theres always great new dishes to try. If you are coming on a weekend the wait time will be a little long because it gets so busy!"}
{"text":"We decided to visit this place since it has good reviews. We got there around 2pm for brunch. There were some people waiting, good sign. We had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table, and ended up to be a table we saw empty since we got there. 
Once we sat, to order our food was fast. We ordered Spanish Hash, extremely tasty and Rancheros eggs or something similar :) soooo tasty! 
The smoothie Hulk was very good too.
Service is a little bit slow, but the rest was great
We will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Excellent food and cozy environment. Pulled pork sandwich and red velvet pancakes are THE BEST."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience. Simply delicious and well-presented food, impeccable friendly service, warm vibe. A little snag with their waitlist app prevented us from receiving our text message to tell us our table was ready, but that's all peripheral as far as I'm concerned. Fantastic brunch spot, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It is very rare that I find a brunch that serves terrific coffee, offers wonderful service and has awesome delicious food. The two dishes I tried were the Nova Scotia (eggs Benny with smoked salmon and dill) and the Fork Scram ( scrambled egg and smoked salmon on puff pastry). Usually when trying two dishes I find a clear winner and a close runner-up. However, in this case, I'm stumped... Which would I order next time? 

The answer is... I don't know... They were both Soooooo good.

The Benny was mouthwatering both in looks and taste. The hollandaise sauce had a hint of butteriness and a light zing of lemon. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the English muffin was not tough but melted in my mouth with every forkful. So you'd think it'd be the clear winner. But Lo and behold... Along comes the Fork Scram... The light buttery pastry danced the tango with the fresh salmon and the soft moist scrambled eggs (perfectly cooked of course). The fresh sour cream added a perfect balance and the dill helped fuse the dish to new heights.

So overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is...you can't go wrong. Your visit to the Good Fork will not be disappointing! Just remember the door is a push not a pull!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places in Toronto. I don't live near it but the half hour drive is worth it for not only the friendly staff but the fabulous breakfast items they have!  Always serving with a smile no matter how busy!! Yes, there's a line but take a little stroll and you'll be sitting before you know it!"}
{"text":"There's the good and the bad. The good is the top notch food & coffee. The Spanish hash was amazing & my wife lived her steak & eggs. 

The downside is the service & very long wait for the food. It was Friday brunch when we were there so fairly busy, but the service is very slow & from seating to food arrival was at least 45 mins. We're used to efficient service at brunch joints.

Took the shine off the excellent food."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday for lunch. We didn't have to wait to get a table for two but I can imagine this place being busy on a weekend. 

Atmosphere: 4/5 Relaxed vibe. Wooden tables, kitschy decor. 

Service: 4/5 Server was attentive, just wasn't forthcoming with the menu right away, we had to flag her down to ask for it. 

Food: 4.2/5 
- Chicken pot pie- flaky crust and not your typical chicken pot pie ingredients-- chicken with chunks of bacon. Delicious.
- Nova Scotia Eggs Benny: Also had it's own twist, with dill garnished over top the Benny. 
- Red velvet pancakes- this is what I would go back for. Fluffy, and perfectly made with a side of maple syrup and cream cheese icing. 

Definitely, a place worth going back to."}
{"text":"I can only give this place 2 stars as the service was HORRIBLE, but the food was so good.  So I don't think I will be back since the wait staff are very uppity (eye rolling/whispering about customers) and need some lessons in  customer service."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now, really enjoy the place. I need to remember to come here more often, it's really better than the typical places I usually go for brunch. The smoothies are awesome and I love the omelettes, the service is good too. Still haven't tried the famed red velvet pancakes, I need to remember those for next time."}
{"text":"I come here often. They deliver on the promise of a great experience. Their breakfast items are great. Unique and delicious. Awesome staff. Best place on the bloor west strip. Just tried the new capn crunch French toast. Ridiculous. Soo good. I wouldn't bother going to either of the other options...you'll just end up at Good Fork wondering why you didn't go there in the first place."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on Sunday with our two friends for brunch. The place seemed inviting enough and the line up although inconvienient is usually a sign of good food.
Our drink order was taken quite quickly but it we down hill after my wife, who had ordered tea was given an Earl Grey. When she asked for an Orange Peokoe the server replied with \"I dont think we have any...it's been really busy this morning.\" We then waitied over an hour before the food was brought to our table. I had asked for no salad and extra home fries and was given salad. My friend Louise had asked for no toast but was given toast. I had ordered the Double down which is their interpretation of a poached egg which is then breaded and deep fried. As interesting as is was food was cold and bland. 
Very dissapointed in the food and the service. They would have to improve tenfold for me to return."}
{"text":"Walked by this place plenty of times, but never went in until recently. Oh my, where have you been all my life?

Cute decor with paintings of farm animals at the lower level, a row of forks along the wall upstairs -- quaint!

Everyone looked like they were having a grand ol' time and just a quick sniff told me food must be pretty amazing. Ordered the fork scramble and it was beautiful. LOTS of fresh dill over smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and a rectangle of puff pastry. I ate all of this in careful rectangles, like a carpenter measuring each section -- took real self control not to devour this in hasty bites! Mmm...savoury, brunchy, nom nom noms.

I'll be back...got my eye on some pancakes...mmm"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch joint in Etobicoke: their classic meals are tasty, the service friendly, and the coffee bottomless and delicious!"}
{"text":"We live in Swansea so this is a \"local\" for us. Over the years the menu has expanded, the food prep is great and the service is friendly. The Good Fork is not our destination for a quiet, romantic or gourmet experience, but we appreciate having its variety of comfort food in our neighbourhood.

It is a convenient location to meet friends and business colleagues who have to travel by car or transit - close to the Jane TTC station and Green P parking lots - altho we are within easy walking distance.

Lunch can get quite busy so reservations are essential to avoid waiting. Lots of families and small children - so a quiet business conversation may be difficult. The tables at the front windows provide great views onto Bloor Street, but can become hot and glaring on a sunny day.

The Good Fork is so much better than a routine fast food franchise outlet - Bloor West Village has enough of those!"}
{"text":"I found this interesting brunch place while meeting up with someone and I loved every bit of the experience. The ambience is cozy and well-lighted and there is a patio at the back as well. Our server took us upstairs and we ordered Spanish eggs as well as the meneman. I love the uniqueness of the meneman especially the mild spiciness of fennel seeds. It came with an argula salad as well. I noticed an interesting selection of drinks on the menu and the next time I am here I will be trying out the freshly squeezed juice or their date& almond milk smoothie which looked particularly enticing! Definitely worth a second visit :)"}
{"text":"I have been here 2x already.  I do love the HUEVOS so far.  Still find it over priced for what you get.  Two people pay $20-$25 each.  That's just the dish you order, coffee would be an additional $3.00 for bottomless, plus, if you want to \"add\" to your plate it's an extra $3-$5.  Which is bothersome as it's already overpriced and should come with the chorizo or whatever it is you are getting.  I would give it 5 stars if if wasn't so expensive.  Also, the second time I went, we requested to sit on the upper level so we would not be so squashed and near touching with others, but waitress refused and said that she needs to fill up downstairs before they seat upstairs.  Was not happy with that,  customers should be seated comfortably and really, where they like, as any other restaurant.  Once you are not happy with your seating, your meal isn't that great either I think."}
{"text":"First off, they don't take reservations. Which is fine, so I arrive ten minutes early to put our names on the waitlist and am told will be 30 minutes. Which means my guest only has to wait twenty minutes - not so bad. A full hour later they text that the table is ready. We are rather hungry and know what we want, order quite soon after being seated. But it's another full hour before the food comes. We ordered eggs... While waiting we run out of water and have to ask for it as no one came near us throughout the wait. The servers are clearly overworked. The food was fine, but I wouldn't recommend this place unless you are up for a very lengthy wait."}
{"text":"The first impression of The Good Fork was not all too pleasant.  We were greeted after a little wait and we're told that a table for two would be approximately an hour to an hour and a half.  Looking around there were a couple of tables available, but we complied,  left our phone number so we can be called when a table opened up.  We waited for the call at the Second cup around the corner. 

We were called and seated after about an hour wait. Before being seated however, we were forced to throw out the drinks we had left over from Second cup, as no outside drinks were allowed. The person seating us was quite rude about this.  Understandable, but a bit annoying considering we had no problem doing so ... just ask!  We were seated on the second floor and noticed quite a few empty tables ... more now than before.  

The wait for our food and drinks was quite lengthy and there were no apologies for the long delay.  We ordered the Eggs Benedict and Red Velvet Pancakes.  The Eggs Benedict was good, but wasn't anything overly impressive.  The Red Velvet Pancakes were fantastic!  Better than a few other spots in the city.  I would definitely recommend ordering them! 

Overall, the experience was quite poor.  The lengthy wait despite the available seats (with no reserved signs, the lack of communication from the staff and the rude staff made too much of a negative impact. The Red Velvet Pancakes were amazing, which really contributed to the 3 out of 5 rating.

Food: 
Eggs Benedict
Red Velvet Pancakes 

Drinks: 
None ordered due to the manner in which were rudely asked to throw ours out."}
{"text":"The brunch here is really delicious and the service was great.  If it were closer to downtown I'd probably eat here a lot just for the red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"I come regularly and have found overall the food good and satisfying.  The service is not bad.  One thing I do wish is that they took credit cards instead of just debit!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, just roll me down the stairs and out the front door.  The red velvet pancakes are absolute perfection, and the only quibble we could find is that the portions are HUGE.  I didn't order the pancakes, but I ate the equivalent of half of one in sneaky bites from my friend's plate, and he still couldn't finish his order.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, which is a sloppy mess of incredible deliciousness (loaded up with coleslaw on a crisp sesame bun), and again, couldn't finish it.  Our other friend opted for the bread pudding French toast, which was very tasty (he cleared his plate!), but I didn't feel the same compulsion to fork an entire slab onto my plate as I did with the pancakes.

We got there around 11:30, which is ridiculously early on a Sunday morning, but it meant that we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table (which we spent down the street at Coffee Tree).  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Just delicious! Perfect bennies and home fries, fresh ingredients and attention to detail. Full of colour and taste but go early as the wait can be up to an hour."}
{"text":"I finally tried the Good Fork restaurant. Its good, but don't over hype it, because its not that good.
Great menu, and the food taste great. The place is clean, and servers friendly.
The meals are presented with full of colour from fresh fruit garnish. I had brunch, pulled pork eggs benny. Everything was worth it, but  I did have to subtract points for the standard Sysco/Strano frozen hashbrowns. With such a great kitchen, why cut corners on  the hashbrowns?
Prices are fair, and if you're lucky you'll have a fun seat overlooking the street upstairs.
Its great to have this addition to the neighbourhood.
Its not necesarily the best Brunch out there, but its definitely a great one.
UPDATE: I spoke with the owner, and I was informed that the hasbrowns are NOT sysco/Strano but fresh hand cut in the back ktichen daily. I'll also clarify, they taste great, I just couldn't tell the difference if it was a wholesale frozen or inhouse fresh."}
{"text":"The food is good, but managing the waiting list is done very poorly. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. Service was awful. 

The server was very unfriendly and inattentive. We had to flag her down for refills for coffee and tea. 

The food took more than twenty minutes to arrive (we had eggs), and didn't arrive until after we flagged down the server to ask if there was a problem. The food was then delivered by someone else. The server never checked in with us after our food was delivered. It was overall a very disjointed, disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for brunch and waited over an hour for a table for two.  The food was good but it's probably not a good place to go if you're hungry, as everyone else that walked in that morning seemed to be told that the wait would be about an hour.  What's weird is that after we were finally called and told our table was ready, half the restaurant was empty.  There were tons of empty tables but the host was still telling people to wait.  I doubt all the tables were reserved, so I'm not exactly sure what their reason is for telling people there's a wait when there are clearly tables available. 

Anyway, the spanish hash and red velvet pancakes were delicious.  Our food took a long time to come out, but after waiting for a table for over an hour, we got used to the waiting...kinda.

Our server was great - super friendly girl, very helpful, apologized many times for the long wait for our food."}
{"text":"Another great dinner at The Fork and Spoon! :)  We are very happy to see that they offer an All Day Breakfast.  This is definitely our new 'go to' restaurant in Bloor West Village."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. There was a 20-minute wait ... but they won't let you wait inside so we were forced to wander the streets in frigid winter temperatures.

I thought their coffee was awful, we didn't get spoons to stir our coffee with so I actually went and got spoons myself. They got my order wrong, took it away, scraped off what I did not order, added a slice of fruit and brought it back. By that time, it wasn't cold but it wasn't warm either. My companion's meal, however, was good, he said. The sausage was great.

Service was sluggish, even if it was friendly. Restaurant decor felt weird to me. Like eating in a cafeteria. Clinical. Way too open-space to feel comfortable.

Overall, these guys are not doing anything different from any other breakfast place. Menu is your average overcooked bacon and eggs, french toast, yadda, yadda. Prices are way too high for what you get."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way for this place. Came for the first time on Canada day, amazing experience from the moment I walked in and walked out.

Service gets a massive thumbs up for me -  before I even talked to the hostess, a server saw I had one adult and one kid with me and they got a table with a high chair ready without saying a word to anyone.

The food is great, very thoughtful menu and super good quality. I got the fried green tomatoes eggs benny dish with a side of mac and cheese, co-diner got a rice w/ hummas dish and a fresh baked pita that also had poached eggs. The food was great, very tasty. The pita was amazing, tasted fresh baked to order. Very good place for vegetarians too lots of options.

Also there is Green P parking right around the corner, big plus. All in all an amazing place, I can totally see why it's rated always up there for best breakfast places in Toronto."}
{"text":"We like Good Fork because it meets everyone's needs in our group ... celiac, vegetarian and paleo eaters.  It's a bit hipster and weekends they don't take reservations, which is a pain, so recommend going early.  Lots of choices on the menu.  The red velvet pancakes are delish, but so are the savoury dishes.   And the mimosas are nice.  Affordable for Bloor West Village and the staff are pleasant.  You also don't get rushed out, like some places."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. 
As a vegetarian, I would recommend:
Mac and cheese and the French toast
The veggie burger is bad. 
The service is 4/5."}
{"text":"IMO this is the best restaurant in Bloor West Village, and I've tried them all. 

It seems a lot of the poor reviews are based on service. If the restaurant is busy because its good what can they do? Brunch spots get busy! 

Chicken Pot Pie is excellent. Food is rich though I will say"}
{"text":"Food is nothing special. When I try new brunch places, I would usually order their basic brunch menu (egg, bacon, peameal, homefries, etc). I ordered that on my first visit, and I'd say i've tasted much better and much cheaper brunch.

My brother had \"Plain Jane\" omelette and i couldn't taste any cheese or cheddar in it (not as described).

It took almost 20 minutes for our food to be ready. So yes, it's slow.

I am not sure if I will try them again, maybe sometime in the future I will see if they improved.

I wish them good luck."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch at this cute and bright bistro. The service was excellent. I had the dude burger & my sister had the pot pie, both with salads. I think it was the best burger of my life. I had the crumble for dessert and it was homemade and delicious. 
This place was truly tasty & delightful, and will become a favourite brunch/dinner/lunch spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Looking to get a group of people together for brunch today and suggested The Good Fork. Having eaten there before with a group of 6-8 people I knew we could be accommodated upstairs with a bit of a wait. Would LOVE to rate the food but we couldn't get a table. 

Knowing they don't take reservations, I arrived 25 minutes earlier than the meeting time for others. Restaurant was busy but not packed. Was told that the earliest we could get a table was for 11:30. No worries, the group could grab coffee close by and be ready for 11:30. 

Our #s dropped by 1 so we informed the staff of the change and was told we are next on the list ... should be 10 min. In 10 minutes someone from our party popped their head in and were told another 15 minutes. At this point it was more than an hour after I had originally been added to the wait list. 

Finally got a call that our table was ready 95 minutes after my original request. I get that it is a beautiful day in Toronto but you are a brunch place and should be able to accommodate a table of 6 in under 95 minutes. 

Thankfully we found another place in the neighbourhood. Will think twice about a group larger than 4 to brunch at The Good Fork."}
{"text":"Awesome place and great service!! I had the \"Spanish Hash\" which was amazing. You could taste the chorizo and hash without anything overpowering each other. I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot but I think they need a bigger location as the wait time on weekend mornings are nuts! 
The food and drinks have always been top notch-- the red velvet pancakes are like dessert!! :) 
My only complaint is the person that greets/makes reservations. We've, along with friends, found him to be quite rude and impatient... Not the greatest way to start your day!!"}
{"text":"I've lived a few blocks away from this restaurant for about a year. Today, after packing up our moving truck, my girlfriend and I went to goodfork for the first time. Our only regret is that we didn't go sooner because we definitely would have been repeat customers.

The food is fantastic. I had the original burger, which was tangy, moist, and crunchy in all the right ways. The home cut fries were excellent as well. My girlfriend had an omelet with goat and feta cheese. Besides smiling between every bite, she thought the cheeses were a great touch.

We really liked the modern decor and the way it spilled into absolutely everything -- from the whole-dollar pricing on the menu to the metal platters that food was served on. The washroom also featured an interesting modern faucet and sink that didn't get water all over the counter. The thought put into goodfork really shows and they've managed to create a very upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Easily my favourite restaurant in BWV. Everything I've had there has been awesome, especially their brunch menu items. Their menu changes seasonally, and they are constantly adding new menu items for events (re: Burger Week) which gives me more reasons to go back! 

Unfortunately, their brunch is quite popular so you're in for at least a 30 minute wait... But I promise, it's worth it! 

++Recommend: Lemon poppyseed pancakes, Mac and Cheese, and Chicken Pot Pie"}
{"text":"Food was great, but wait time to be seated 20 min and food took more than 30 mins to arrive to the table."}
{"text":"Girls night out so we figured might as well check out this new restaurant around the neighbourhood. We arrived around 7:30 pm and there were items that were sold out or not available on the menu. For app, we ordered the daily flat bread and spinach puff. The spinach puff was blend.. For main, we ordered mac and cheese, sausage and mash potatoes and roast chicken. The food took a long time to arrive and it was blend! A repeat from the app. We were disappointed about the food... Zocalos or Bloordale pantry is way better food in the same price range."}
{"text":"Rude waitress. Simply asked for a table and literally given the hand \"I'm busy, you'll have to wait because you're interrupting me\"

Usually great food and staff have always been polite up to today

Burgers are flavourful. 
The oatmeal is a favourite of everyone I introduce it to. Tends to come on go from the menu. 

Ambiance is simple casual and clean."}
{"text":"Amazing Benedicts... Super fresh salmon, delicious fried green tomatoes, even a great salad.  Friendly service, cheery staff who seek to working together... Definitely will return.  [Fyi: SMS messaging system didn't work for us ... We didn't get the text to say other table was ready]"}
{"text":"Been there for 2 dinners and one brunch- very pleased all 3 times. Fontina/bacon burger fantastic, as was lamb+pomegranate....beef braise nice but too many beets. Liked the double down egg but the romesco sauce disn't mesh well. Great overall."}
{"text":"Rating 2.5
I wasn't a big fan, but maybe next time! We came here a little past noon and got seated on the second floor by the window. It would probably be smart to ask someone to pull down the window shades as it was really bright in that spot! 
The food was healthy feeling, but I personally didn't love it. I'll probably have to try the pancakes instead of egg/salad. 
Lovely service and modern setting"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by the lovely ladies at sugar moon, after a process of very justified torture lol enough about that.
The wait time was about 20mins to be seated for party of two.The host is a bit Stand offish, he could be more welcoming to the $$ walking through the door. After being seating I ordered the Huevos and my companion ordered the Fork scamble, we also got the red velvet pancakes- it took almost 30mins for our food to get to the table...Is that too long for brunch or is it just me? Our waitress was really nice though, she made up for the host and the excruciatingly long wait...The food finally gets to our table and the portions are generous, everything tasted great, ingredients were fresh and you can totally tell it's being made from scratch. My companion enjoyed my Huevos way more than their ordered Fork scramble though, the red velvet pancakes were just meh ...okay in my opinion, maybe I was too stuffed at that point. I would return to this spot to try out more things off their menu."}
{"text":"Originally planned to go here for brunch but the lineup was so long we had brunch somewhere else and came back later for red velvet pancakes as dessert. We did appreciate the wait list text so we could stroll around somewhere else while waiting. 

When we got the text that a table was available we were already full from brunch somewhere else, but we wanted to try the red velvet pancakes so we went with full stomachs. 

The service was friendly, but spread thin as the place was packed and bursting at the seams.


We ordered a regular size of the red velvet pancakes to share. When it came we were astounded by how large the portions were. We instantly regretted not getting the side version. But the pancakes were amazing. Exactly what I want red velvet to taste like. The chocolate flavour and aroma was rich, but not grossly overwhelming the senses. They were fluffy with a good amount of dense. The cream cheese icing was my favourite part. Rich and full of flavour without being numbingly sweet. The sweetness came from the syrup you pour over yourself which was nice because my bf likes a lot while I like just a hint of sweetness. 

Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the food was not disappointing. I could appreciate that even though I was full from brunch somewhere else, the pancakes were still delicious and the menu was appealing. Definitely want to go back and try other items on the menu esp the salad bowls."}
{"text":"There's nothing inherently wrong with the Good Fork, but there was nothing that made me say \"WOW\" about my experience either.

We went for Sunday brunch at 9:30 am-ish, and it was busy but not yet packed at that time (but filled up quickly while we were there).   We sat upstairs, and found that because of that, we occasionally couldn't find a server when we wanted one, and we also suspect that our somewhat-slow service was due to that as well.  

My croissant-bread-pudding-french-toast dish was tasty but too much of the same thing.  I couldn't enjoy it after about the halfway point.  A side dish of bacon or fruit might have broken it up nicely.  My husband says his steak & eggs were \"adequate and decent\".  He was generally content with that dish, but not wowed.  My toddler loved her plain pancakes from the kids' menu, and quite frankly, we did too.  An adult dish with plain pancakes would have been a nice option!!  That was served with a nice dish of fruit that she enjoyed. 

Neither of us loved our espresso-based coffee drinks.   My latte tasted a little off and I didn't finish it.  

We were comfortable with our kiddo there - they have highchairs, colouring books and crayons, nice kids' menu.  Didn't check out the washrooms.  Lots of other young families there too.  

Wouldn't rule this place out in future, but I won't be craving it either.   Seemed on the pricier side, at $57 including tip for 2 adults + 1 toddler."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch. Their red velvet pancakes are amazing! So soft and flavourful. Also had the pulled pork benny and the salmon omelette - so tasty and beautifully presented! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Visiting Canada this weekend and wanted Brunch. The food is amazing. I had the red velvet pancakes, pork eggs Benedict and grilled cheese. 

The Benedict was really good. Probably top 5. 

Service was good as well. I assume that if we had gotten there during peak time it would have been hard to get a table. At 2pm, it was quite easy. 

Solid place. Good food. Good service. Will be back next time."}
{"text":"Was denied access to this restaurant due to my Service Dog. Was told that animals are not allowed. 
Service Dogs have public access anywhere the public can go. Denying me was illegal and I will be filing a report to the police."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Saturday just after 9am, the place was already packed and we were lucky to get a table, so definitely try to show up early to avoid a long wait.
Service was fine, didn't feel rushed and the waitress topped up coffee pretty often which was appreciated.
We ordered an omelette with sausage, the classic grilled cheese with home fries, and a side of red velvet pancakes. Everything was really tasty, but the pancakes were amazing - order them and you won't be disappointed! Perfect red velvet flavour with syrup and cream cheese frosting - stuff dreams are made of. Delicious, pancake-filled dreams.
The menu has lots of yummy-sounding options so we will be back to try them soon!!
The only real downer was that the place was very loud, but the red velvet pancakes more than made up for that. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"When you live in Scarborough, the thought of trekking to the west end for brunch is a tad daunting. The only thought that kept running through my mind was \"This better be good, this better be good, this better be good...\"

AND IT WAS! In fact I would be so bold as to say, it's one of the best brunches I've had in the city.

My friend got the Fork Scramble composed of Smoked Salmon and Scrambled Eggs topped on a piece of Puff Pastry and drizzled with Creme Fraiche. They got the eggs perfect! They were light, and fluffy like clouds. I stole a bite, and the composition of all the elements was delicious.

I had the Toronto Eggs Benny with Peameal Bacon. Again, perfectly poached oozy egg. I was so happy. And the Hollandaise was top notch. So silky and luscious. Definitely nom-worthy!"}
{"text":"Long wait times if you have not made a reservation/drop in as most people do on wknds. No reservations taken on the weekend, so expect 30-45 min waits for a table- biggest detraction. Also, very sarcastic and unprofessional staff member manning the phones (Jade), which is unfortunate since servers waiting on tables are really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Good, consistent place for brunch that's always busy!  I've tried most of the brunch items on the list and they've all been solid choices. Their signature Caesar is also very good! One qualm is that service is always very slow, from the time it takes for the waitstaff to take your order to the time it takes the kitchen to prepare your meal."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here just this morning.  I ordered poached eggs with bacon and home fries.
I noticed in someone else's comments that there was a bitter taste to the poached eggs and that taste is vinegar.  It's a trick I've read about that is supposed to keep the egg whites firm when you put it in the water.  
This technique totally ruined the taste of my eggs.  The bacon was the cheap cut, the home fries nothing compared to the yummy ones you get next door at the Jane Diner.
After I was finished the bill never came so I had to go downstairs and pay at the cash.
The waitress was very nice but I pity her having to make the trek up and down those stairs.  It must be exhausting.  
This was my first visit here and first impressions mean everything.  I can't understand why people line up to get into this place on the week ends.   Sure they probably have their \"signature dish\" but as far as I'm concerned if you can't serve a top notch traditional eggs and bacon, then why would I want to try anything else on this menu.
My stomach is still turning from the vinegar. Yuck.
I'll be sticking with the Jane Diner thank you very much.

{"text":"This restaurant redeemed itself with the assistance of the manager. She took ownership of the bad experience we had, gave us a gift card and asked us to return and promised a better meal.  We went back today and she held up her end of the bargain. She remembered who we were, brought us free pancakes without asking and gave us great service. The food itself was excellent and my feelings toward the restaurant have completely switched and I will return"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this morning. There was a 1hr wait for a group of 4 at 11am. That speaks to the popularity of this place. We ended up waiting only 40 minutes.

I had the Huevos Rancheros which was amazing. I love me any dish with a bit of guacamole. It was a good portion that didn't leave me overwhelmed and my friends also enjoyed their food. Also to note we're the red velvet pancakes my friend ordered. They were moist and fluffy and not too sweet; which had been a potential concern.

I wasn't too impressed with the service though. Our waitress only came by to take our order/deliver the food/collect payment. We had to chase her down to get water.

I want to go back to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We wanted to try a few things because everything sounded so good. We got the Lox sandwich, the traditional breakfast with sausage and animal style home fries, a side of chorizo sausage, a side order of the red velvet pancakes (which was very generous). We also got the special juice which was tangerine raspberry, fresh squeezed OJ, and earl grey tea. Everything was so delicious, and even though we ordered too much we ate everything because it was so good! 

The atmosphere, decor and music were really cool too. This place is cool and trendy, but cozy and comfortable, and not pretentious at all. We will definitely be back! Best brunch we have ever had!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday at prime brunch time, so naturally we waited a LONG time (over an hour). BUT the host told us this when we arrived (party of 6) and estimated the wait time correctly, so no complaints there.

The food was amazing and plated super nicely. I got the Tome Green benny ($14) which was really good. Some menu items are a bit on the pricier side -- but the group I went with said it was worth it. They also make an amazing Caeser ($11). 

Will definitely go back, but maybe at an off-peak time."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for brunch and all I can say all the food in the menu is so good and portion is great. We ordered the 'Huevos Rancheros'..the guacamole is fresh... 'Red Velvet Pancake with cream cheese frosting & maple syrup.. it was big so we shared it.  It wasn't too sweet, fluffy & made it to perfection.  Also ordered, the 'Smoked Salmon Bendict w/ salad'.. it was made to perfection and salad is fresh.
For sure I'll come back to this place & try the other food in the menu."}
{"text":"Great food great service great value for money and hugeee portions!  We went there for brunch and I ordered the brunch burger substituting the ham for fried onions ( I don't eat anything ham related gives me the icks) and my friend got the veg burger.  She wanted to make sure that the burger was vegan and since the bun was laced with egg they accommodated her by switching it with some sort of flatbread. 

I noticed they didn't have a mocha but since they had hot chocolate I asked if they'd make me a mocha anyway and they did. It was lovely!  

Overall lovely experience. I've taken off the one star since they never informed me I'd be charged for hot chocolate and espresso both (to make my off the menu mocha) 

I was eying the croissant french toast. Shall get it next time. Would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The restaurant itself is very modern and inviting. The menu has many interesting items that are worth checking out. The lamb kofta was easily the best I've ever had... definitely a restaurant I'll be visiting often!"}
{"text":"My go-to brunch spot. Their food always hits the spot on mornings after I've had one too many shots of Jameson..

I've had their omelettes, Spanish hash, egg benny, huevos rancheros - it is all good. 

I've been there for dinner, too, which is almost as good. Almost because you can't really beat brunch. 

The only pitfall is that the service can be spotty. Some days it's great, other days you have to ask for water at your table, but honestly, I think that has to do with how busy it gets. That being said, if you want to go for brunch, it's best to go before 11am or so...when the rush of strollers arrive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on the weekend. There was a bit of a wait, but they texted us when our table was ready so we were able to walk around and grab a cup of coffee. The huevos rancheros was delicious. I just wish it came with refried beans! Nevertheless we'll be back for more as everything on the menu sounds tasty and the service was great."}
{"text":"This is about the 4-5th time coming here for breakfast and the food is absolutely amazing. The smoked salmon puff pastry is my go-to, it's an incredibly creative dish. They have an amazing side salad with lots of colours, with beets and a great and simple balsamic vinaigrette that doesn't over power the simplicity of the salad. 

This time, I ordered just plain eggs with a side of halloumi cheese and marinate peppers. I asked for the eggs over medium and they were inconsistent, one was runny and the other was completely hard. My boyfriend got the pulled pork eggs Benny, pork was succulent and sweet, hollandaise sauce was just perfect and eggs were cooked beautifully. 

The only reason this restaurant is not getting a five star is the wait time for food is a bit too long for being just a breakfast/lunch joint. The wait for a table varies depending on the day and time but almost every time I've had to wait 10-45 min, although I would never let that affect my ratings as that is beyond the restaurants control, but wait times for food are. Also, the washrooms were pretty messy with pee on the toilet seat and toilet paper everywhere. 

Aside from that, great restaurant with plenty of variety in choices and fantastic service staff. Just be prepared to wait a lengthy time for a table and your food."}
{"text":"Very good brunch place. And seems like everyone else agrees too since the wait for a table was 45min on a Saturday. (They texted us after only 30 min though).

I ordered the fork scramble and it was absolutely delicious. (See photo) and I was very full after. I'd love to come back and try a few more menu items.

The service is OK since the food took a long time to arrive but the waitress was good."}
{"text":"Good Fork is the reason that I got a Yelp account...THAT'S how impressed I was.

After living in the Bloor West Village area for almost a year, my room mates and I had been hurting to find some great breakfast joints to drag our hungover asses into. On a day we were feeling particularly adventurous, we stumbled across a rather nondescript looking place with very hip and trendy looking menus posted in the window. It had a vegetarian benny, so I was sold on trying the place out.

I was impressed by the clean and modern decor, although seating is somewhat limited. If you go over brunch on the weekend, expect waiting as long as 40 minutes for a table. Still, in my experience, the servers are friendly, efficient, and patient!

Trust me though, there is a REASON why this place is so popular: the food is really, really good and the presentation is just begging to be Instagram'd! The menu features fun twists on brunch classics, such as Red Velvet pancakes, and the Billy Goat Gruff grilled cheese (goat cheese, roasted red pepper, and basil, mmmm!!). I opted for the Deep Green benny which was a delicious alternative to the traditional eggs florentine. 

In additional to great food, you can wet your whistle with a variety of espresso drinks , smoothies, and fun twists on brunch cocktails. I consider myself to be somewhat of a caeser connoisseur and I'm not exaggerating when I say this was one of the best I've ever had! Served in a mason jar, and topped with pickled asparagus, pickle, hot peppers and more, it is a delicious work of art! 

I was really surprised that considering the overall trendy vibe, quality of the food, and diversity of the menu, that Good Fork is actually comparable in price to most generic brunch joints! So skip the boring greasy spoon- add a little character to your brunch! Good Fork has it in spades!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent food. It's been a while since my wife and I have eaten here and we were excited to try out the new menu. I had the Nova Scotia Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and it was delicious! The eggs were poached just right and salmon was sprinkled with a nice blend of pepper and black sesame seeds. 

The side salad is topped with cucumbers and shredded beets that made for a refreshing alternative to the hot fries. I had a bite of my wife's hummus bowl as well. If I was going to order something else, this would've been a contender. 

The service was pleasant but it took a while for the food to come to the table. They told us they were short staffed in the kitchen. It was a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things. 

Hale Coffee is the new source for the Good Fork's coffee needs. On the way out, Sage (a barista from Hale Coffee) prepared an espresso for me and it was amazing! The shot was topped with a rich, reddish-brown crema that complimented its fruity flavor. This was the perfect way to end a great brunch at one of our favorite Toronto eateries."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a lot time but am always hungry and the line ups are a deterrence.  Finally came here later and was able to get a seat.  Great service and food totally live up to the expectations. Can't wait to come back and try the other Items"}
{"text":"This place is one of my fave restaurants in Toronto, definitely worth the trek to Bloor St West. Red velvet pancakes are life and pretty much anything you order onn that menu is amazing! Atmosphere is gorgeous and staff are friendly. If you plan to go on a weekend go early cuz the wait can be almost an hour for a table. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is worth waiting in the rain for. Their food is phenomenal, especially the eggs Benedict and the Spanish hash. I went with a group of friends for my birthday brunch and we were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We don't mind waiting and they actually did get us in a little earlier when we told them it was a birthday. The only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the service was a little slow, we were ravenous by the time our meals arrived. Food is worth it but don't expect it to be fast."}
{"text":"I'm re writing my review because I had one kind of awkward experience last year but I went back and service and food were both great . A little too busy but that's not the worse thing for a business ."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the Village. They have so many great breakfast options and when I want to try something different than a regular \"bacon and eggs\" - this is where I go. The Spanish Hash, Red Velvet pancakes and the Anatolian Delight are excellent. The servers are polite and helpful. The only con is that they really don't have much of a waiting area. So, you end up standing in the middle of the restaurant in the way of the servers, the door and staring at patrons. I recommend that you wait outside - they will text you when your table is ready. There are many nice stores to browse while you wait!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous breakfast and lunch spot in the Bloor West Village!  I've heard of the Good Fork restaurant before, but have only had the chance to try it out this past weekend.  It's a great casual spot to dine for small groups of friends because the atmosphere is very cozy and the food is just YUM and unique.  

Although the restaurants has two floors of seating, there's always a huge queue of people waiting because seating is ONLY FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE on the weekend.  Be sure to arrive early and put your name on the waiting list and the restaurant will text you when your table is ready. 

Our party of 6 waited for nearly two hours before a table was available and we were starving by the time our food was in front of us . I'd probably never wait that long to eat here again (only reason I gave it 4 stars), but I would definitely go here during off hours to avoid the brunch/lunch crowd. 
_______

What We Ordered:

Fork Scram with two scrambled eggs with generous slices of smoked salmon, fresh dill, and whipped chive creme fraiche all on a super flaky puff pastry.  A colorful side salad was also included, but not pictured here.  You get quite a lot of food for $13.75. I only wish they added capers to the dish because it would pair really nicely with the smoked salmon and dill to add a salty bite. 

Pot pie with large chunks of pulled smoked chicken, bacon, veggies, gravy, a fluffy and light puff pastry crust, and a colorful side salad (not shown in picture) for $16.50.

Animal Style Homefries with crispy potatoes, bacon, tomatoes, fried shallots, mayo, BBQ sauce, and scallions for $6.  This is probably one of the tastiest and most interesting combination of homefries I've ever had. 

3 Red Velvet Pancakes with chocolate chips, cream cheese frosting, and maple syrup for $7.  Once we were done inhaling the homefries, the side order of red velvet pancakes made for a perfect dessert."}
{"text":"After a 45 minute wait, my mom and I were finally seated in a comfy booth amidst its too-modern-for-me decor. 

(Note: you're not allowed to bring outside food or drinks into this place (health code apparently?). I've never been told that before so that was news to me. Besides, what were we supposed to do for 45 minutes?)

Anyways, the service was kinda odd. It looked like there were 3 people cooking, 3 people hanging out beside or behind the bar seating people, and 1 person serving. Huhhhhh? But besides that oddity, our server was pretty good. I even saw her make my Caesar. You go, girl. Way to multitask!!

So you're probably wondering why I gave this place 4/5 stars? It's the food.

The food was so delicious: Caesar, huevos rancheros (with chorizo), Spanish hash, and a side of red velvet pancakes. The huevos included deliciousness layered between crispy nachos. I enjoyed the successful flavour and texture combos. The hash was a tad salty but still yummy. The pancakes and cream cheese frosting...wow! A tad crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. 

I highly recommend this resto. I was thoroughly impressed by the taste and quality of the food here. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was not disappointed.  The food was amazing and we'll priced and the  service was impeccable. A highly recommend brunch location."}
{"text":"I had brunch here once and it was pretty good but not sure if it worth the long wait. I'm the type of person who hates waiting for anything so that may have had an impact on my overall impression of the restaurant. The food was good and the service was ok. It's probably one of the better brunch spots around this area but I thought it was pretty average."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. Arrived around 1:25. Was told the wait would be about 25 - 30 minutes. Recevied a text at 1:45 saying our table was ready. Yay!

I ordered the Brûlée's Rules (a thick slab of challah french toast with a sweetened labneh sauce, stewed cherries, and pulled sugar) with a side of their breakfast sausage. Wow. One of the best french toasts I've ever had. Seriously.

To drink, I had iced coffee, which was sweetened with a cardamom infused syrup. It was a bit too sweet for my taste and correspondingly a bit heavy on the cardamom. A bit less syrup and I think it would have been perfect.

The staff were super friendly and cheerful and the service was efficient.

The decor is minimalistic and makes the place feel a bit ascetic... but who really cares as long as the food is good?

Love. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place, long waits, great food.

Came here for brunch several times with a friend from far West. While the waits are a bit nuts if you're looking for a good \"meeting a friend from Mississauga on the subway line\" type of place this is a good location with great food.

There is a tiny balcony patio that we have yet to be lucky enough to snag. 

The food - the reason why you are waiting? - amazing. Between the great mimosas, delicious pancakes, and actually very hearty egg breakfasts we walk away satisfied and happy.

I do second the suggestion that \"reserved\" signs would alleviate the feeling that you're being made to wait, for waiting's sake."}
{"text":"Amazing food but VERY pricey. If you want to splurge it's worth it. But I have to say that for a menu that is going to be almost $100 when it's people's first time you have to tell them you don't take credit card myself and quite a few patrons had to scramble. Other than that it's great and just know this is not a quick in and out place as they seem to be making each plate of food fresh the wait time to get the meal can take a while."}
{"text":"Unique and expertly prepared.  Local sausage, pancakes and smoothies were all excellent."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here with friends right when it opened on a weekday morning. The food came quickly and was served nice and fresh. 
I ordered the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting and chocolate milk (for coffee lovers out there, their coffee is bottomless and they offer coffee to go). It was divine!! The pancakes were nice and soft, the maple syrup was real Canadian syrup and the cream cheese frosting was delicious! Their pancakes were quite large and the order came with three. I had a hard the finishing them so if you're anything like me, I suggest you split them with someone.  
As for the service, the waitress asked us how we were doing and checked in on us.
Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Cash and debit only. 

Chicken pot pie quite good. Salad on the side was fresh. 

Would come back."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you need a good fork.
If you're in the Bloor West area, you can satisfy your desire for forking at this open-kitchen cozy diner.

We came here on a Wednesday night for dinner.
By 8pm they were sold out of gnocchi, so I went with my second choice, the 
brick flattened Cornish hen. 

When my main arrived, the presentation was surprisingly creative, colorful, and appetizing.  The chicken was moist and not too salty... but not quite piri piri more like regular oven-roasted-roasted.  The warm fingerling potato dill salad is just roasted potatoes with some dill.  Simple comfort food on a cold night.  Everything tasted fresh and the portions were huge!

The smoothies are made with real fruit and can be tart.  Good for me because I don't like sugary drinks but you may want to ask for sweetener.

Note: If you have a nut allergy, no dessert for you!  They couldn't guarantee the desserts were nut free.

Overall, I was pleased with my meal.  The service was fine.  
I would return again for some good forking and brunch!"}
{"text":"Definitely try their pulled pork bennies, red velvet pancake and mac and cheese. Great for brunch! Friendly staff and our food came on time."}
{"text":"Definitely the best brunch I had in the city. Refreshing and delicious ! I pick this place over    eggspectations near eaton center, because of the quality of food and the environment. The egg Benedict is what you would die for. Totally unconventional ! Recommended to go there not during the weekend (I heard there were always a huge line up). I went during a weekday when I worked from home."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious. Had the Salmon Eggs Benedict. Presentation and taste were great, nice atmosphere, but service was very slow."}
{"text":"Yelp Reviewers really are accurate! As someone mentioned, our wait was 20 minutes. That being said it was approximately 1:30pm, so it might be longer if you go closer to noon. You can give them your number and they'll text you when to come back, which is pretty helpful, while you walk around the street or go for a quick cup of coffee next door. 

I got an Eggs Benny (classic) with avocado and green tomato.  Not sure if they mentioned this in the description but the tomatoe's actually deep fried! I was confused when I first saw it but it was actually pretty good and very flavourful. 

You can get a full serving of Red Velvet Pancakes (~17) or you can get a side of it for ($10) in case you want to try it out but also want to save room for something more savoury. The pancakes were pretty good - not sure if I'd say they were the best I'd ever have but they were pretty fluffy and reminded me of eating cake. It comes with a frosted cream cheese which is extremely sweet and thick, but thankfully it comes on the side. 

I didn't see the upstairs but the downstairs actually pretty small. There's maybe 3-4 tables on both sides of the entrance (as shown in the photo) with a lot of space in the middle. There's a pretty great window seat right next to the door. 

The service was pretty good, no complaints!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, C and I and been wanting to visit here.  The last time we had attempted to go was last Saturday. It closed early so they could prepare for Burger Day at the Artscape.  

So this place has a newer decor and plenty of seating upstairs rather than downstairs.  I mean the view isn't that astonishing since across the street are the Dark Horse and an office tower.  You do get to people watch.  But would you want to do that with amazing company? 

Anyway so our server Brittany was pretty attentive at the start.  We weren't a fan of the appetizer choices so we went right for dinner.  Chicken Pot Pie and Mac n Cheese with Smoked Chicken and  both our plates had sweet potato fries. 

It took a very long time for our order to come to our table.  But to their credit, our dishes came very hot.  So they take their time in prepping the meals.  Kudos to the chefs for the outstanding meals. 

Next time I visit, I will actually try their out their brunch.  From a quick scope of their menu, it's worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try the good fork because of all the great reviews and it did not disappoint. The fork scramble was my favorite! The puff pastry was excellent, topped with the scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, dill and lemon creme friache was an awesome combination and a must try! 

The pancakes on the other hand was so so. The spiced pears and apple butter tasted good together but I did not like the ricotta on top of the pancakes, it did not pair well with the pancakes - a little too sour tasting. I like my pancakes sweet, so I may be a little bias. 

Overall I would go back again for the fork scramble and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Long wait times are normal here... Its a small place. Very busy. We sat at the front near the entrance and my feet were frozen the whole time...  The food was good, and drinks were pricey with little booze."}
{"text":"That was a pretty \"good forkin' brunch.\"  Nestled in swanky Bloor West Village, this is a well-liked joint for good reason. My wife and I went for the safe choices (Huevos Rancheros and the Bread Pudding French Toast) and one adventurous one - the 'Animal Style French Fries' which are made to the chef's discretion.  (I think he was feelin 'Mexican'.)  Overall, the food was yummy, ingredients were fresh and my French toast bread pudding was cooked well with the right consistency.  We went right at opening but the restaurant filled up bery quickly (Friday at 9am). One server was struggling to keep up with the emptying java cups, but she was friendly and accommodating.  I usually have no problem finishing my entrees but the portions were generous and I was able to pack some of  the bread pudding and sausage to enjoy later. :) This meal was definitely not light on the wallet, but it was worth it.  (The fries at 5 bucks, however, were a good deal.)"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and it never disappointed! Amazing food with a very unique selection.

RECOMMENDATIONS
For anyone that loves caesars, you should definitely try the bacon infused vodka caesar... one of the best caesars I've had.
The chicken pot pie is super meaty and also loaded with bacon with a light flakey delicate crust. The mac and cheese is really good also -- creamy, and just saucy enough. Chicken salad sandwich -- one would usually think is somewhat a bland choice, but they give a fresh twist.
One of my favourite things I've tried was their special today -- a grilled panini bacon wrapped meatloaf with bbq sauce and ranch coleslaw... to die for *drool*.
I also found their hand cut french fries (triple fried and very potato-ey for lack of a better description) and sweet potato fries are REALLY good. 

My only suggestion for improvement would be their homefries; nothing special compared to everything else.

The three times I went there the service was good and the wait time was very average -- nothing to complain about.
For the person complaining about smelling like food after they left --- DUH? It's an open concept kitchen. Some people are so uptight.

I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try. Everything I've eaten really feels like it was made with love. Simply delicious. Can't wait to go back and try everything else!"}
{"text":"The Good Fork is my number one for a consistently good brunch place to bring visiting friends to. I usually have to wait, but never for too long and they will text you when your table is ready so it's nice to be able to pop into the stores nearby while waiting.

Portions are good, service has always been great, and the food is amazing! Red velvet pancakes are insane, and if you don't want to go full sweet, you can get them as a side. I love their benedicts, buttt they recently took away my favorite pulled pork benny (hi Good Fork peeps please reinstate the Gordy stat). Anyways I will still come because everything else I've tried is delicious too but I will patiently wait for The Gordy."}
{"text":"Long wait- we waited about an hour before we got seated, and there were many people ahead of us.

I feel like this is a place where the expectation is to put your name on the waiting list and then come back when you get a text message. we waited at the restaurant on the little bench.

we were seated upstairs and given just the right amount of time to order what we wanted.

I got the salmon - it was delicious! but you have to be a fan of Dill to really enjoy it. 

my friends got the grilled cheese and the ranchero - both loved the flavours in their meals.

the reason I gave this place a 3 star over the 4 was because we were so hungry by the time we were seated. We ordered our food and a little while later a server came and dropped off a portion of what we ordered (pancakes and my salmon) and I almost dug into it only for our waitress to run over and say that's not your meal. for which we had to wait another 15 minutes before our food came out. no apologies, nothing small for us to munch on for the mistake, it was super frustrating - especially based on how hungry we were. 

aside from that incident - I would say the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place has a strong hipster vibe which I'm not a huge fan of. Other than that it was nice. The food was magnificent! I had the huevos rancheros... What a treat that was!!! The portion was so large i couldn't finish it. The service was great. Staff was very friendly. I will be back! Clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant many times and I've enjoyed the Mac & Cheese w side salad each time, except for yesterday. Given the fact I've never ordered anything else I can recognize when something is different. As soon as the dish arrived I could tell it looked different and after tasting it, it also tasted different and not in a good way. The waitress did not come by to see how we were doing or I would have said something. When she came to clear our plates she asked if I wanted mine wrapped up (I had about two bites) I asked her if the recipe had changed. She said it was the same recipe and I said well I've gotten this each time and this was definitely not the same. She just said different chefs cook it different possibly. Well clearly the chef yesterday didn't do a good job if I didn't eat any of it . But she didn't seem to care that I would be paying for a meal and only had two bites and clearly did not enjoy it at all. No apology, didn't ask if I wanted something else, just cleared the plates. She could have at least pretended to care I didn't enjoy it, I won't be going back or recommending Good Fork after that service."}
{"text":"Although I can see the appeal of the red velvet pancakes (oh don't worry, I plan to return for those at some point) I opted to get the Grown Up pancake, which were fluffy, laced with dried lavender, semi-sweet chocolate chips and sprinkles of sea salt. It was an amazing combination of floral, sweet and salty all in one. Topped off with the pure maple syrup and this is a winning dish. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a pancake but looking for something more complex.

My only complaint would be the portion size of the pancakes seems a bit large (I could barely get through two). I doubt most people would complain about that but for me I hate seeing food wasted.

My date had the smoked salmon eggs bennies (one of my personal favourite items to order at brunch) and they looked delish. If I wasn't so into my pancakes I probably would have stolen some. 

I also had an iced americano, which was perfect for the unusually hot day outside. Perfect pairing to counteract the sweetness of dessert for breakfast items.

I love their menu design (yes I'm a menu nerd) and the service was attentive without being intrusive. I did overhear the waitress say that although brunch is their main attraction, dinner is the chef's true baby so seems worth checking out even past brunch hours."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick and nutritious lunch. Burgers were juicy and tasty, the chicken pot pie has good eye appeal, delicious and the lox sandwich was delicious too. 

Bottled water provided to the table for self pour is greatly appreciated. 

Very kid friendly and service is fast and polite. 

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"A great kale Caesar salad.  Good healthy affordable tasty eating, with local beers on tap.  Hard to top for that.  Mac & cheese was very solid.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is always very good, small portion for the price, so don't go if you're looking for a big meal. There was only one waitress serving all the tables upstairs so service wasn't as fast as it could have been. Still my favourite brunch place at Bloor & Jane, and the waffles are amazing"}
{"text":"I popped over with a friend on Sunday morning - the wait was an hour for a table for 2 and the line kept growing! Even as late as 1 pm the wait was about 2 hours. What were all these people waiting for?!

Well after we patiently waited our turn (and visited the European bakery a few doors down for sustenance), we ordered the steak and eggs, spanish hash, and the bread pudding french toast.

The Spanish hash was good - needed more salt and i had to add hot sauce to it. My friend enjoyed the steak and eggs and said the chimichurri was delicious. The bread pudding french toast was this perfectly sweet and tart combination with pishmaniye on top - I had never had anything quite like that.

The menu is traditional brunch fare but with a twist. There is halloumi, sujak, zataar on the menu. I will definitely be back to try some more food!  But definitely coming early morning!"}
{"text":"The Good Fork has great brunch food. Unfortunately, I won't be returning due to bad experiences with the management and staff. When it opened, The Good Fork impressed me: the menu has interesting twists on brunch favorites (my usual was to get french-toast style croissant with bananas), and if you are lucky enough to get a table on the second floor at the window, the location is quite nice. Now for why I'm not returning...

I had a couple good friends from out of town staying with me for a weekend, and wanted to bring them somewhere good for brunch before they left on Sunday. We arrived and asked for a table for four, and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. We said ok, and the hostess suggested we wait just outside the front door and she would come find us (the front area is quite crowded, and there isn't any room for people to wait, especially since there was a quiet family behind us in line and another group). We decided one of us would stay right there, to make sure our group wasn't \"out of sight, out of mind\", and the rest would wait just outside as requested so we didn't get in the way. After 10 minutes, I asked how we were on the list, and they showed me there was a group of two ahead of us, then then us. At this point, a family of four arrived, whose children were loud, disruptive, climbing on the stairs, etc. The parents made no effort to control them. This group did *not* wait outside, and the mother repeatedly asked the hostess when they would be seated. After another 10 minutes, I wanted to check in with how we were doing on the list (sensitive to my friends' schedule). While speaking to the hostess, who assured me we were \"next\" and would be seated \"soon\", I saw our group first on the list. Despite this, a server tells the loud family they would be seated upstairs now, and led them up. I expressed my frustration that we had been waiting politely for over 20 minutes with out of town guests, only to have Good Fork seat a disruptive group who had been waiting half that time before us. The hostess, *and her manager*, said it was a \"judgement call\" and they wanted to decrease the disruption caused by their obnoxious behaviour. I said that was insulting: we waited patiently and politely, and expected to be served when our time came.

So: if you intend to be polite and wait your turn, know that a loud, disruptive group will be seated first, regardless of who arrived when. It's their management's explicit and defended policy. I disagree strongly with this attitude, and for that reason have told the manager I won't return. 

On previous trips, I'll note, my girlfriend and I were treated as an inconvenience when we requested to be seated upstairs (where we could see an empty table from the street). Multiple times they said \"well, we prefer not to seat people upstairs so we can clean up early and get ready for dinner\". Each time, it was ~1:30 - 2 in the afternoon, the upstairs was mostly full anyhow, there were only a couple tables left downstairs, and groups waiting behind us (requiring they either turn them away as customers or seat them upstairs!). This restaurant should have been thankful my girlfriend and I were becoming \"regulars\" and supporting their business. Instead, they refused to seat us upstairs (which was insulting given the circumstances I outlined) until I said I'd either sit upstairs or leave. It's always a fight with them, and I'm tired of it. I'd rather send a message that this type of attitude, coming straight from their managers, leads me to stop going to their restaurant. Which is unfortunate, because the food is great."}
{"text":"Went for a brunch and the food was DELICIOUS. My puff pastry with salmon and eggs was soooo good and they also make killer daily juices with natural ingredients if you feel like drinking something fresh and healthy. Service was very friendly and attentive, greeted us with a big smile. 

Goes straight to my \"nice places for brunching\" list. Ah, and if you on Saturday or Sunday, make a reservation or be prepared for a big waiting list!"}
{"text":"went for breakfast at 10:30 am on a Saturday.  followed a group of 5 into the place.  they were taken upstairs within a minute of arrival.  I was in line, no one infront or behind me.  a table for 2 and a table for 4 next to me.  the waiter tells me there is a 30 minute wait to be seated.  I point out two vacant tables.  he says oh well.  I leave.  I call to speak to the manager and am told he is busy, call back at 3 pm.  what a joke.  food looked good but I will NEVER know."}
{"text":"I never venture to this neck of the woods. I have no reason to ... but when a friend comes to town and says let's do brunch.. you head to where ever they'd like. 

We went to Good Fork and after I put our name down at 1134... we waited.. and waited... and waited.. and waited.. finally we were called up to bat and we headed in as quickly as possible... Our drinks were ordered right away and then when it came time to take our orders.. we waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.. well you get the point.. They seemed under staffed or something... Who knows...all this waiting though was forgotten as soon as the food arrived....

RED VELVET Pancakes... need I say more? Ok, Bacon Caesars.... or how about the cornmeal waffles.... the point is.. the food is absolutely incredible... and the prices are more than reasonable.

It's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Beautifully greeted at the door and despite a 20 minute wait, we were very happy about being there. 
Our server took us upstairs to a very airy setting where we were seated at a table by the window. The highchair and child menu was prepared for the screaming toddler and the table perfectly cleaned. 
Our server had an amazing smile which made us feel at home. She was very quick with things (seeing that the terrible two was getting very anxious). Took out order extremely quickly and fulfilled the drink side of the order almost right away. The orange juice must have calmed the litttle one a bit and we begin waiting for our meal, laughing and having fun with the sun shining. 
Our meal arrived fairly quickly, everything looking amazing and nothing missing. 
We had the one egg scrambled for the screaming one, one bacon benny and one avocado benny with a side of chorizo. 
Let me start with the chorizo; what an exquisite piece of meat. I would have finished the entire thing even if the wife hadn't said she didn't want to eat too much meat. 
The one egg scrambled was moist and perfectly cooked. The little girl almost snorted the whole thing in a minute. The fries were amazingly seasoned and the toast buttered to perfection. 
The wife was fairly happy with the avocado benny as it was light and tasty. 
My thick cut bacon benny was perfect. I was especially fond of the greens that was oiled and black peppered and the hollandaise that was smeared over the bread as well as the original coating of the eggs. 
Coffee was just how we like it, strong! When it's good, you really need only one cup. 
Service; excellent!
Atmosphere; excellent!
Food; beyond excellent!
So very happy to see my fellow Turks (represent!) running such an amazing establishment. I'm just sad that it took us this long to visit. Way to go!
I'm so happy and proud we have such spot in the city. 
Just because I like to repeat myself after such review; the effing chorizo, my tastebuds have been orgasmed."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. good food. reasonable prices.  They don't take credit cards and there is a bit of a wait on weekends for brunch but they will text you when the table is ready so that's convenient. Will be back."}
{"text":"Expect to wait if coming on the weekend! I have been to this restaurant several times for the past 2-3 years and the menu has changed a bit but it is a gem (there used to be an amazing Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict on the menu that they no longer have :(). 

Fresh ingredients. Current favourites are Huevos Rancheros, Animal Fries, and their insane Red Velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"Finally, I was able to enjoy some great food here as there always seems to be a line up. So try and make a reso. The food was delicious, service was great and I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to the Toronto blog, top breakfast places in T.O., and it certainly didn't disappoint.

First off I love the fact that they have a regular breakfast option simply called the No Meat. Just like the other regular breakfasts, but $3 cheaper! 

When I  walked in, I'll admit, the pancake section was what first caught my eye... In a perfect world, where I'm not diabetic, I'd have tried them all... But in the interest of having a product day (outside of a diabetic coma) I opted for the protein and a side order of the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting...

Let's just say, other foods in general were diminished for me today after eating these pancakes.

If I thought I could survive on them alone for my entire trip, I would.

Fair warning though, they only take cash and debit here! (But it's well, well worth it)"}
{"text":"Had a fun Friday brunch with friends at the good Fork. I would say that everything was exactly as expected, not mind-blowingly good, but very solid, as you would expect at their price point, and the servers did a good job. The three of us ordered in very different directions and everything was good. 

The hit of the day was probably the \"special of the day\", an omelet futuring sauteed brussel sprouts, shallots and feta cheese. 

The pulled pork eggs Benedict was a hit with my friend, and my Original Burger was solid, if a bit pedestrian, suffering only from being a tad overcooked (as is the tradition here in fearful Ontario) and the fact that it was missing any sort of interesting sauce, that would have put it over the top. A double check of the menu suggests that in addition to the gruyere cheese and big stack of buttermilk fried onions, a remoulade sauce was supposed to be present, but any evidence that it was on the burger was unfortunately absent from the slightly dry flavour profile. 

The fries that accompanied the burger were skinny, fresh cut, and excellent, and service was well done, even though they asked us to leave, when our friendly reminiscing ran into their Friday lunch rush.

All in all, The Good Fork was just what you would expect, no more, no less, which is not a bad thing at all."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here forever and finally my wish has come true. Came during my March break off away from the kids from a very long trek. We had reservations and I'm glad we did because it is fairly small. I can only imagine what weekends must be like. The man who helped us was not only nice eye candy, but nice enough to seat us upstairs. If you can get a table up there I'd recommend it in cold weather so the door isn't constantly opening with blasts of cold air while you eat. We had a nice table by the window and although the view isn't amazing, it gave off that nice city feel that I don't get living in the suburbs. I already knew what I wanted so I didn't waste anytime. Me and my girl both got the Mac and cheese. I got mine with a side salad and a side of red velvet pancakes to share. The mac and cheese was like heaven in my mouth. Nice and creamy with so much flavor. It was surprisingly very filling. The side salad would have been better if it wasn't drenched in their vinaigrette. The pancakes were a huge portion for a side. The same gentlemen that seated us even was surprised. He gave me a playful, disappointing look that I couldn't finish it. It was great with the cream cheese icing but I was so full and it was too dense and sweet to finish a whole one. It was a great experience and I'll definitely go back. 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Got the bennies and eggs with great middle eastern twists, get their bacon ceasar for the full ride. A little downgrade since last year. Expect a better than normal brunch place.

Let's start off with, WHY WOULD YOU REMOVE SUCH GOODNESS FROM THAT BURGER??? YES IM TALKING ABOUT THAT CHEDDAR AND MAPLE BACON JAM! The depth of flavours were phenominal and I WOULDVE PAID THAT 22 OR 23 PRICE TAG IF YOU GUYS UPPED IT FROM 16!!!!! 

But then I have to talk myself out of the anger and denial that maybe the neighbourhood I was in wasn't all swaggin as I was with the flavour palettes. Maybe it was just time to move on from the power fusions. sigh

Let Me Tell You My Guy I Was S H O O K. 

but anyways.

I highly recommend this brunch place as its ease of access right outside Jane Station and it's got two floors so don't let that entrance into a small room fool you. 

They've got great eggs (you can't really fuck up an egg otherwise you shouldn't be cooking or owning a restaurant) and they do it in many great ways just the way you want. You got your taters, ketchup already set up, all sorts of drinks at the bar delivered straight to your table. You name all the Toronto morning shenanigans and they've got it.

What I can recommend from this place is the Bacon Infused Vodka Ceasar and their Halloumi Side dish to pair with whatever you're feeling for the day, whether it be a sandwhich, bennies, eggs, or pancakes, order that goat cheese and watermelon refresher and enjoy.

R.I.P. to the Yall a Brunch of Burger's for it was a dream too good to be true and it had to go one day. Thanks for having me and happy brunch my friends. Hope to come again after another 10th menu change (as I've heard from the waitress)."}
{"text":"Side of the Red Velvet pancakes please!

Stopped in on Saturday around 11am for brunch based on the incredible Yelp reviews. We ended up waiting about 40 minutes for a table of two, but they were pretty accurate with the timing. Service is super friendly, the server took my name and number down, and when I checked in again for my table we were seated promptly. 

I ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benny which was good. My friend ordered the Huevos rancheros with chorizo which was much better. Nothing really stood out about the Eggs Benny, personally I would have like a little more hollandaise sauce. The red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting was truly the star of the brunch. We opted for the side, instead of the main (thank god, or we'd have to roll ourselves out of there). The side is also half the cost of the main, and a very good portion size.  

The only issue I had was the amount of time it took for the food to be served. I understand it was busy, but coupled with the already long wait time, my hanger was starting to spiral out of control. By the time we actually left Good Fork, it was already 2pm - so that's 3 hours just to grab brunch. 

Overall, good service, average food, long wait time.  If you've never been, you should check it out, but you may not be seated immediately so maybe grab a coffee and a muffin first."}
{"text":"This place not only has great brunch food, but totally wins at being a modern functioning restaurant. 

Their \"give us your number, we will text you when your table's ready\" system is so wonderful. You can walk around or grab a coffee or do some shopping while you wait, and unlike some places (*cough* Kao San Road *cough*), someone is there to take your phone number and put your name on the list the minute you walk into the door. I probably shouldn't go into details, but they have been MORE than reasonably accommodating for myself in the past, and they deserve a lot of credit for how they treat their customers. The service is fine, decor is clean and simple, and the food is definitely better than average. The spanish hash was extremely flavourful, and their mac and cheese and grilled cheeses just melt in your mouth. I have yet to try the red velvet pancakes - but I will definitely be coming back soon to do so."}
{"text":"Some interesting takes on breakfast / brunch fares.  Usually a long wait to get seated, but that speaks to how great this place is (also to the fact the next decent location of brunch spots is in the junction.

I've had huevos rancheros and the steak & eggs. Both were decent.  

5 stars if their coffee was decent, but it was burnt and stale.  Drink of the gods people - it's the basics.

Great staff, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here at 10 on a Friday morning. There was a 15-20 min wait time so they took our numbers and texted us when our table was ready... 

As we sat down at our table we were instantly greeted with a smile, felt welcomed,and given menus. It was small , almost cramped space but seated comfortably. Nicely lit and bright. We ordered the Nova Scotia with side of Red Velvet pancakes, Steak n Eggs, and the Daisy with a side of sujuk (beef sausage). For drinks we had iced coffee and their juice of the day (mango, turmeric and carrot). 

EVERYTHING TASTED GREAT! Food took pretty long but it might just be me spoiled to the fast NYC lifestyle lol.

Staff was great and overall we had a memorable time. Highly recommend and will definitely return when in Toronto.

P.S - Everything is organic and hormone free! their sugar is brown sugar!"}
{"text":"This came highly recommended.  We tried their specialty pancakes. It was dry and lacked flavor . The red velvet tasted burnt. They were friendly . We did like the sslmon.portions were big"}
{"text":"I saw wonderful food on the tables of this small restaurant, too bad that it doesn't accept credit card. So after I left my name for a table and waited half an hour to be seated I noticed a small writing on the menu saiyng \" we accept cash and debit cards\". Then I asked one waiter and she confirmed no credit cards. Well, very disappointing in 2015 still experience such situation."}
{"text":"Ok, so I admit I was not impressed with the no-reservation-1-hour wait for Sunday brunch. But that is the new trend in the city, and so I accepted it. After an hour of standing outside eyeing customer's breakfast through the window, which only fuelled my hanger, it was our turn! I promise you, this is worth the wait! We got the Huevos Rancheros and the Spanish Hash, with a side of the red velvet pancakes (the side comes with 3 pancakes). So. Delicious!!! I can't wait to go back and do it all over again! 

Reasonable prices, amazing food, long wait and a chance to wear your closet-favourite hipster outfit ;) 

Did I mention the red velvet pancakes? With cream cheese frosting? And maple syrup? Oh I did? Well I think you should order it. Just saying."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with our meal at The Good Fork, during a midweek city getaway. I had the Hummus Bowl with Halloumi and was impressed with the amount of flavour and how filling the bowl was! My boyfriend had the slow roasted brisket sandwich and the meat was wonderfully tender and delicious. I also had a latte and can honestly say it's one of the better coffees I've had in a long time!

Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Overall great service, food and atmosphere. Will definitely back soon. The restaurant seems small but there's an upstairs area too. We wait a couple mins before being seated, we had a reservation but it was just awkward because you stand in the middle while everyone's eating, not much of a designated spot to stand and would be worse if it was busy! We were lucky to come at a good time (1 pm). I forgot our servers name but she was super delightful! 

I ordered the lox (salmon and dill on buns) with sweet potato fries, the hulk smoothie (surprisingly really good for the very green ingredients), and the best dish... the red velvet pancakes. We didn't even touch them until we got home but they were delish! 

My boyfriend got the steak and eggs (steak medium, looked yummy), the tropic smoothie (not as good as mine ha), and mac and cheese on the side. The Mac and cheese stayed hot to warm throughout our entire meal which I was surprised because I find is very slow eaters lol."}
{"text":"I was excited to learn that a new brunch joint had opened in my neighbourhood, and even more excited to try it.  We arrived around noon and were seated right away - I always love that, due to my hatred of waiting in line.  We were taken to a table on the second floor, right by the window so we could watch the passersby.  Although, due to the location and the weather, not too many were there to be seen.  Nonetheless, it was nice to be able to look out the extra-large windows without feeling the extra-large wind that day.  

The menu has some unique items, and was an average price of brunch.  I selected the asparagus bennie, and my DC the waffle and bacon bennie.  Our server was a nice girl, but not the best server I've had.  She seemed a bit out of it.  For example, when she had delivered the bill to a table near us, she stood awkwardly nearby while they sorted it out, staring through the window right above my head.  It was a little strange.  After we'd ordered, she returned and asked my DC \"What did you order again?\"  When he repeated his order, she informed him that they were out of waffles and waited beside the table while he scanned the menu to make his second selection, a croissant French toast with banana and pecans.  It ended up being a great choice, but it was again rather awkward for him, and he felt rushed in his decision.  

For me, I didn't love my bennie.  I love eggs benedict, and I love asparagus, and in the past I've loved the combination.  But something about it here didn't quite work.  There was something almost slightly bitter about it.  The home fries I'm not convinced were made in house, they looked like the little frozen home fries you buy at the store - the ones the size of a pebble.  They were tasty, I'm just not sure if they were house made, and that's something I would expect.  The accompanying fruit I saved to the end of my meal as I usually do - it was a piece of orange and a slice of apple.  Not a lot of fruit.  Before I'd gotten to the apple, the server came around and started gathering our plates.  I had to snatch it off the plate before she took it.  

All in all, it wasn't the best brunch experience I've had.  They have some interesting options, so I would give it another shot, but only because it's so close to me.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"A wonderful breakfast spot and reasonably priced for all the delicious food you get. Not your average restaurant for sure. There menu options are inventive to say the least. We go mainly for brunch and their farmers sausage is AMAZING. Thick and plump and so, so good."}
{"text":"Took family here for brunch on Canada Day this year. It was pretty busy on the mid-week holiday so we waited for about 25 minutes to be seated. 

Our server was friendly and promptly took our drink orders while we perused the menu. I loved the variety and had a hard time deciding what to order because it all sounded so good! Two of us ordered different versions of the eggs Benedict. Another ordered huevos rancheros. Another ordered the spinach salad with grilled yellow beans. All of our dishes were phenomenal! 

The scene here is definitely geared towards younger people - stairs to the upper level and indie music on point (not good for someone hard of hearing but definitely not too loud for me). There was a small outdoor patio which I would love to check out next time I dine here. 

If you're looking for a tasty, well portioned $15 meal in a vibrant atmosphere AND locally sourced food, look no further! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the famous salmon and egg puff pastry with fresh dill. It's good but not amazing - a bit of bland to my taste and the overall flavour is just OK. My friend got the bread pudding which is nice."}
{"text":"Came here after a hike through high park! 

Very cute and very busy! Thankfully we got a table right away. Everything on the menu looked delicious! It was soo hard to decide! I almost got tempted to order the red velvet pancakes but I took a healthier option that day... but I will come back to try them!"}
{"text":"The food here is very filling...but not the greasy and nasty kind of of feeling that you get when you're full. Great place, located just right by Jane station. Cute little restaurant, friendly staff and great brunch food with affordable prices. 

I ordered the Hulk smoothie to start off and it was delicious. I'm a smoothie person in the morning and I always have smoothies for breakfast and this smoothie was delicious. I like the fact that they use honey instead of sugar. Great healthy substitute.

Then I ordered Huevos Rancheros with chorizo and potato fries. It was so good and so filling. Next time I want extra Guac though.  The server actually forgot to add my chorizo but was very quick to correct the error when I mentioned it to her. The chorizo was so good with the tortilla chips and the guac and eggs. This breakfast dish was delicious ans I finished it all. 

Last but not the least, my girlfriends and I ordered a side red velvet pancakes. The pancakes are huge and the order comes in 3 delicious pancakes with cheesecake creamy filling and maple syrup ( I believe). This is so yummy and actually not too heavy and oily. I've had pancakes in other places and I always feel so guilty and so heavy because of the grease and the oil, but this pancake is absolutely perfect. 

Love this place and I love how they have healthy options for those people who are looking after themselves. Will definitely come back for more pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"Had an eye on this restaurant for a while now and decided to go for lunch. Unfortunately the excellent food was over shadowed by slow and inexperienced service. Waited 45min for our order which was very frustrating but when the food finally arrived it was excellent. I ordered the chicken pot pie and enjoyed every bite.  The place has a lot of potential just needs to improve front of house."}
{"text":"Came in and had to wait in the middle aisle of the restaurant for a table with everyone eating around me on both my right and left sides. Someone that seemed to be a manager walked right past us completely disregarded us until my partner went and found someone to take our reso. We were texted after a good 30-45 mins for our table. 

Had the Hulk Smoothie; very yummy, over powering banana taste would have liked more mango.

After this point we waited quite a long time for our food. This was a disappointment especially since we had waited so long for our table. It had now been 1.5 hours since we first walked in this place. 

Had the FORK SCRAMBLE: Wow this was amazinggggg. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the puff pastry along with the salmon melted in my mouth.

My partner had the HUEVOS with chicken and this was even more delicious than the Fork Scramble. It was like you were eating a taco with a hard shell but for breakfast. Will be getting this when I had back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little brunch place. My friend and I shared the heuvos rancheros and the red velvet pancakes. Have you ever even heard of red velvet pancakes before?! It wasn't AS heavenly as it could have been, but it was still delicious! It's a bit out of my way, but it's worth going to. Decently priced, yummy, and good service. What more could you need??"}
{"text":"I am gluten free and I ordered the Nova Scotia eggs benners with gf bread. The bread seemed like it was made in house, it was amazing!!! The whole meal was delicious! My bf had the goat cheese omelette which he really enjoyed. He also ordered the side of red velvet pancakes which he didn't like very much at all. Overall a great brunch and we will return!"}
{"text":"Rare to find a brunch place with a constant line out the door North of the Bloor line, but worth it!

My party of two came here in New Years Day for breakfast, although we have been here a few times before, it was the first time we didn't wait in line. Pro Tip: you can swing by a bit earlier than you'd like to dine, leave your mobile number and they'll text you when your table is ready. Great service and the open kitchen adds a great vibe.

I had the hummus bowl that comes with House made pita - it was perfect with the runny poached egg and the mix of sweet, savory and healthy. I added Sunil a Mediterranean sausage that comes unlinked, found it a bit salty, but if you have a bit of everything on pita it's the perfect balance. Go with this if you want to fill up without feeling bad. 

If you sit on he main floor during the winter I recommend a sweater or some layers. There's a curtain between you and the front door but how busy this place e gets it can get a bit drafty."}
{"text":"With the great tool Yelp is, discovered this place near my neighbourhood. Typically this place will have a wait however, they'll take your name and number and text you once your table is ready. And in the Bloor West area, there's plenty of walking and shopping that can take place in the meantime.

Coffee was okay tasting, but the food and portion sizes were great. I had the pulled pork eggs benny. The server recommended the choice and at first I wasn't sure about the sweetest of the pulled pork mixed with hollandaise sauce however, that was all put to rest after the first bite. AMMMMAZING! 

Everyone knows my love for Huevos Gourmet on Lakeshore but I wouldn't be mad if this spot was added to brunching spots. I love to brunch!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite brunch places in Toronto. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations on weekends. After waiting 50 mins for a table for 2, we ordered the fork scramble, and the Nova Scotia benny, both with sweet potato fries.

Fork scramble was absolutely amazing! It was smoked salmon on scrambled eggs on a light as air puff pastry with some cream and dill on top. The flavours just blended together so well, and the portion size was pretty big. My companion had the Nova Scotia benny and said it was very tasty. The sweet potato fries were also very fresh and delicious. 

We also ordered fresh orange juice and juice of the week which happened to be a mango and tangerine juice. Both were absolutely amazing. A little pricey but still worth it. 

Service was great. Staff were very friendly and informative. Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes are amazing. I got the deep green benny, my friend got a burger, and we shared a side of the pancakes, all the food was great, but the pancakes were unreal. I was dreaming about them for weeks later. Long story short: get the pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Good food bad service. 
Party of two wanted to get couple of sandwiches for lunch at lunch time. 
Tall guy waiter asked if had reservations?
Nop don't have one, we are first in line and there is no one else waiting to be seated. He says wait.

then we waited then waited, waitresses walk by, server food, bills. One table becomes free, two feet away from where we are standing 
More waitresses walk by, we managed to stay invisible all this time.  
Finally several mins later tall guy comes back asks us to wait for few more min, then he walks away and go up stairs where he came from.

{"text":"One of my favourites!

The Good Fork has turned into one of my regular haunts. 

The food is consistently delicious, service is attentive and the environment is relaxing. And the menu is regularly updated. 

Highly recommended. 

Desserts are great but I would like them to bring back bread pudding. 

Note - Cash or debit only"}
{"text":"Like a true yuppie, I came here for weekend brunch and the place was packed by 11am. The wait was about 40 minutes, they'll take your number and text you when your table is available which is convenient because you can wander around until your table is ready. I decided to head to the coffee shop next door for a cup of joe making the wait much more bearable. 

The brunch menu is robust and has a variety of savoury and sweet options. I'd highly recommend sharing so you can try a variety of options. The hash is really good and great excuse to eat fries for breakfast. If you want to sample their red velvet pancakes, you can add it as a side that way you can satisfy your sweet and savoury cravings. 

Service was pretty quick and they seem to pay great attention to the quality of the food. Apparently one of my poached eggs burst when they topped the dish, so they made another one to replace it. I'd come back here to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"They have one of the best brunch in the city... I am so happy that I tried this place. And I will go there to try other options."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on recommendation from a friend. Had the Bacon Vodka Caesar and the Toronnah (classic eggs Benny). The Caesar was tasty, and presentation was excellent with a slice of bacon, pickled asparagus and olive garnishing it. Tastes like they used some sort of low-quality bacon flavouring in the drink though (perhaps bacon-flavoured vodka?) which makes this not so great of a deal at $10 IMO. The benedict was cooked perfectly, not too runny and not too hard. The home fries were a miss. No flavour to them at all, they could really use some seasoning or accompaniment. All in all everything was good, not great. At the prices they're charging for it though, I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about those Red Velvet Pancakes. We arrived on a Saturday morning at 9:10 AM, and the main floor was already full of seated guests. We were seated by 9:25 AM, in the upstairs seating area, which was bright, clean, with huge windows, and spacious. By the time we left at 10:30 AM, there was a line of people waiting for tables. Make sure you come early, or you'll be waiting!

First, parking. We found free street parking just a block east on Armadale Ave (a less than 2 minute walk to the restaurant). 

Second, the food. We ordered: a) a coffee (free refills), b) a tea (oolong), c) red velvet pancakes, d) a side of bacon (because, obviously), and e) huevos rancheros. Overall, a hearty, delicious meal. The huevos rancheros were average to decent - imagine gigantic nacho chips topped with minimal guacamole, and salsa, for $14. It definitely needed more guac (for the price, anyway). But... the red velvet pancakes made up for it. Fluffy, light, with the fresh scents of cocoa wafting through your nostrils, it was heavenly. We were expecting overtly sweet, dense pancakes after seeing pictures, but it was absolutely perfect. Wonderful, light, moist texture and just the right amount of sweetness. Combined with a side of crispy, fresh bacon, it was the perfect way to start off a Saturday. 

Lastly, service was wonderful and attentive. Thanks to Calla for making our first time at their restaurant a great one, and for excellent service!

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid $48.00."}
{"text":"You know those places you visit and the you actually remember the food you had there for a long time. Well this is the one for sure. Red velvet pancakes  live up to the hype and Bennys  are ahmazing!"}
{"text":"I've only been here weekdays so that might explain my slightly better experiences as though it was busy,  I've never had to wait for a table. 

This is probably my go-to brunch place and not just because it's close to home. Their menu is pretty extensive and actually interesting. Pancakes with lavender and salted chocolate chips? Never heard of that flavour combination but surprisingly incredible. Brioche french toast with captain crunch? Amazingly rich and unforgettable. They also have like 5 different types of Benedict, which I've found good but not incredible. Even the coffee here is delicious though. 

For what it is,  the prices are incredibly reasonable too. They could easily raise their prices and still be just as busy but don't. I ain't complaining."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambience and food here. The fork scramble and the cure burger were so good! Def will go back."}
{"text":"We used to love to go to this place for a special brunch in our neighbourhood. This time we saw the price hike and walked right back out. Brunch would have to be made of saffron and pearls to justify $18 $19 for most plates. I'd rather spend that on a reliably delicious dinner. This place was good, but the prices are a shameless gouge. Not going back."}
{"text":"Mi esposo y yo fuimos un domingo por la mañana sin hacer reserva y para nuestra buena suerte pudimos encontrar un sitio. Normalmente hay gente haciendo cola porque el lugar es altamente recomendable. 
La atención del personal fue amable y respetuosa. 
Ordenamos el chorizo y salchicha good fork y nos encanto! Al principio nos dio la apariencia que era muy poco, pero no fue así! Realmente la porción era grande. 
Es un lugar que definitivamente vamos a volver"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my friends M&H to catch up and get our brunch on.

Totally enjoyed it.  The wait was 30 min.  You get a text--kind of like the old fashioned dinner bell triangle thing.  \"Comeandgitityall!!!!\"

I guess the idea behind the menu is to update a lot of the old favourites.  It works.  I went with eggs benny, mostly because that is my standard for judging a new place.  Eggs seems well cooked, hollandaise was mild and not too zesty, pealmeal bacon was thick and generous and the muffins were toasted well.  

(I'm hardly a critical judge--life is too short, right?)

Potatoes were fine.  A little fruit was a nice touch.

The seasonal brew was wonderful.

Service was excellent.  I liked the new, clean decor.  The upstairs was a bit loud at times but hey, you didn't have to go downstairs for a washroom!  Prices are fair.

Would I rush back?  Probably not unless I was meeting up with somebody on the west end.  Do I recommend it if you are west and close to Bloor?  For sure!"}
{"text":"Extra star for the dope animal fries.

I love the vibe in there and would definitely come back. Our waitress was awesome.
I had a Porco Rosso benny which was tasty. Wish there was more bacon, and if it was a little less crispy too that would be nice. Great flavours overall with the bitter veggies underneath and then the salty piece of bacon along with their savoury version of the hollandaise sauce. 

Upgraded the home fries to be animal fries and it came in a nice little dish separately from my eggs. I'd come back and eat a larger bowl of those animal fries to my face next time please oh god I'm salivating right now. I live on the wrong end of town!! Damn it all"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch place. The combo of fresh orange juice with the fork scram is fantastic. The red velvet pancakes are absolutely fantastic as well. Definitely recommend. The wait was long though, but Coffee Tree was next to it which is an awesome coffee place"}
{"text":"I am only in Toronto every two or three months, but every visit, I make sure that I go to the Good Fork for their Mussels and Sweet Potato Fries and a glass of red Sibling Rivalry. Please never change the menu!  After 2 hours of hard Pilates, I run down the street, all by myself, and get a seat in the window. 
The servers, usually young, friendly women, don't bat an eyelash when I order without even looking at the menu. 
I sit and try not to make too much noise while slurping all of the delightful broth, infused with coconut milk (I think) and fennel out of the mussel shell.  The onions and tomatoes and something wonderful and green (sorry, I'm not a cook) add a surprising diversion from the meat of the mussel. It is always served hot and fresh. The sweet potato fries come with an oleo that I enjoy way too much!  The homemade bread is hard to resist...so I don't!  All this wonderful food  is enhanced by the earthy red that I enjoy more than I oughta! 
I never miss a visit at The Good Fork when in Toronto and neither should you!  Actually, this trip to Toronto, I might even go twice (calories be damned!)."}
{"text":"After reviewing the photos, we were excited to try this place out. As soon as we arrived, there was no waiting line and a table of 4 seats had just been cleaned. The host said it would be an hour wait and could not seat us at the table he just cleaned in front of us - we were the only ones standing by the door.

It's painful to be denied service when the supposed next person in line isn't even present to be seated.

One star for nice pictures 

We ended up having a wonderful experience next door at the Bloor Jane diner."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. I didn't see a 'no salt' policy on the menu but they definitely didn't use any.

Spanish Hash - Literally poached eggs on home fries.. No unique flavours

My sister said the lentil soup wasn't bad so I guess there's that..."}
{"text":"The good fork has never failed me - ever! And I have been about a million times (okay maybe I'm exaggerating a little but you get the idea). I have never been disappointed in an order. One time the bacon-vodka caesar had a bit too much vodka in it but that's not really a complaint, I'm just a pansy. 

My fail-safe orders include the fork scramble (with poached eggs instead of scramble) or the southerner sandwich with homefries obviously! I used to get salad as the side but then I realized if I'm already eating out, who cares about being healthy, amirite? The homefries are lightly seasoned and are perfection in your mouth with a dollop of ketchup and hot sauce. 

If I'm feeling really hungry I get the steak (med-rare) & eggs (overeasy). OK, so the southerner is a bit hefty as well but it's brunch, you don't come to eat like a little girl. The steaker sandwich also gets a mention. Basically, if you want steak for breakfast (or anything for breakfast, really), come here. 

Red velvet pancakes on the side are A MUST. It doesn't matter what I'm getting I always order these. It comes with a cream cheese frosting that's not too sweet and the perfect accompaniment. You don't even need the maple syrup!  

If you want something changed on an item they are very happy to oblige. I always change up the eggs as I like my eggs a certain way (i.e. not scrambled or sunny side up). They've got a huge array of hot sauces as well and ketchup in glass bottles. I don't know about you but stuff always tastes better coming from a glass bottle. 

Should you be so lucky, parking is found on Bloor St. There's also a big green P lot on Armadale Ave (first street East of Jane St off Bloor). If you come during regular brunch hours (11-1pm) be prepared to wait. Possibly an hour or more. But trust me it's worth it! There's lots of small shops that you can peruse to kill time or just chill at the coffee shop a few doors down. I was told that they increased the prices but I didn't notice. Honestly, just take all my money and gimme the food.

P.S. As I write this I've already made plans to go back today. Haha!"}
{"text":"Very good brunch food and cool vibes!

Came here for breakfast on a weekday with the bae. We sat on the second level in their sunny dining room. I had the good fork scramble and he had the pulled pork Benny.

My mouth is literally watering right now thinking about the scramble - it was so darn good. Scrambled eggs with smoked salmon,   fresh dill, and beet creme fraiche on top of puff pastry - OMG fave brunch item in a hot minute. Bae's egg Benny was delicious as well. Coffee was decent and plentiful. 

We also ordered a side order of the red velvet pancakes to share because.... red velvet pancakes - how could we say no?. Super duper tasty, served with real maple syrup and cream cheese frosting - a must try.

Would return here for brunch in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"was giving blood at swansea town hall and deliberating over where to indulge post donation.  the good fork was always meant to be visited.  fought the quaint yet insanely packed annual ukranian festival to get there.  so worth it!  

calla was exactly what i (realize the subjectivity here) like in a server.  no ego, helpful, knowledgeable, efficient and herself.  i'm always leary of a hipster dive (you're not doing me any favours by doing your job).  and while hipster-y, not accompanied by the (not-so-) stereotypical aloof hipster schtick.  

the fare:

1. bacon infused ceasar:  eye (& liver) porn for the lush.  $10 well spent with all of its accoutrement (strip o' bacon, gherkin, green bean, celery, olive all tightly crammed on one lone sword, bacon infused vodka, peppered rim, & straw), nice size, well seasoned. 9/10

2. watermelon lemonade with shot of vodka:  my own creation, sorta.  watermelon lemonade was juice of the week (f'ing delish).  i requested the booze to be added.  fresh, plentiful, real fruit pulp, cut-then-lemon garnish (i loathe the anemic lime wheel cut as prep the night before).  10/10

3. polenta cakes:  i'll take some of the blame here.  they were part of a brunch benny.  i'm a sucker for good polenta so i ordered a couple of the cakes on their own as an app.  they were garnished with pea shoots which are lovely but alas, don't go with polenta.  they were nothing more than sliced off a store bought tube of polenta.  no seasoning--just sliced, heated, & plated.  i'm sure under a perfectly poached egg, piping hot hollandaise and wilted spinach they do their job.  alone, no.  1/5

4. red f'ing velvet pancakes:  christ, where to begin? curse words to the creator for this alone i'll be back.  flavourful, hot, rich and light all at the same time.  dusted with powdered sugar and a perfect side of cream cheese frosting... (are they open now?).  i ordered these with 2 other entrees and calla, the sweetheart that she was, asked me if i wanted the full order or a side order (which wasn't on the menu).  could have easily let me unnecessarily get the full order (& i would have just as happily scarfed them down) but saved me a few bucks--thanks from my (what) waist and pocketbook! 10/10

5. spanish hash:  hearty, thoughtful bowl of spicy, breakfasty, goodness.  chorizo, poached eggs, hollandaise, potatoes, red pepps.  8/10

6. fork scramble:  perfect.  full stop.  puff pastry, chives, creme fraise, smoked salmon, scrambled free range eggs, lotsa fresh dill.  10/10

i'm 99% sure i'll be back next weekend.  and as a crazy person, pretty sure ordering a duplication of the above.  for portion size, ingredient quality, creative options and piping hot food temp, priced fairly.  they don't take credit cards or resos for brunch, which is annoying but outweighed by...everything else.  i hope, hope, hope my next experience is just as delightful.  

great food + great service = a rarity in t.o.  i heart you good fork."}
{"text":"The best in town . If you want a breakfast with style come here. I have been here many times already and every time I try something new. 
Every choice on the menu has a character.
They update the menu too."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the place and atmosphere! Super delicious breakfast, yummy yummy! Portion was so big, so we couldn't even finish ours, had to take to go.

Please note they don't accept credit card for some reason, only cash or debit."}
{"text":"Went for a brunch and ordered eggs and sausage with a side of home fries. I also ordered the pancakes with the chocolate mascarpone and cherries. My main dish was very dull. Nothing to write home about. The sausage wasn't my favorite, it was very bland and had a snappy texture to it. I was hoping the pancakes would redeem the situation but when she brought out the pancakes it was a visual nightmare. Looked like an animal took a poo on some pancakes. The cherries had pits still in them and the mascarpone chocolate topping wasn't very good. I figured that since it was a four star on yelp that I should maybe try another dish, so we also ordered the French toast with what looked like cotton candy on top. That dish was extremely dense and incredibly sweet. Our server totally missed my sisters order and was impossible to track down. To add insult to injury they only took Canadian cash or Canadian debit. As tourists, we had neither. So we had to walk outside to find an atm. I wouldn't recommend this place and won't be back."}
{"text":"Big fan of the haloumi cheese and spinach. Really tasty bread came with my plate of eggs. Food here is good! Staff were also quite friendly, which is appreciated. A bit disorganized though, so ended up waiting a decent while for my bill while staff were doing other stuff. They only take debit or cash. Overall positive, will visit again."}
{"text":"YUM - fresh and interesting brunch options...we were out in the West end running an errand and stumbled on this place - I had the veggie burger...really good and totally packed with flavour - my bf had the deep fried egg which was surprisingly light and came with a nice sauce.  

Didn't love the space - felt awkward...we sat downstairs and it felt like the staff were hovering / staring at us...no where for them to stand I guess...also felt the service was slow...by the time our food came we were running late and had almost no time to relax and enjoy...

Worth a try for sure - high quality fresh food and something different that your standard breakfast..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and will definitely be going back.  Great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know if the food was good or not but their customer service is garbage. I arrived and waited a few minutes for someone to greet us. During this wait a table opened up, there was know one behind us, know one in front of us. Yet the greeter told me there is a 40-45 minute wait for a table of 2... And asked about the table that was available and he just simple looked at me with a blank stare and repeated the wait time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been coming here since it opened, saw all of its variations (brunch & breakfast place, all-day, dinner, etc.) and it's all been incredible! I'm very sad that they only do dinner a couple of times a week now because there is nothing like their Anatolian Delight plate after a long work day."}
{"text":"If there was an option to give 0 stars, I'd love to do that right now. Service was HORRIBLE! Once we arrived, NO ONE even acknowledged our existence at the door. There wasn't even a line or anything! We stood there for a good 5 minutes with the waitress, cashier, waiters all passing us. No one even gave any sort of eye contact or whatnot. I actually thought I may have died getting here and was some sort of ghost or something. I got so pissed I actually had to stop the waitress to ask what the process was. She didn't even apologize and said that the host would get to us soon...... um.... hi, we've been here for 5 minutes and you couldn't just say hi or anything until I had to stop you from your job to get an acknowledgement? I heard the food was good but the customer service it self was ridiculous."}
{"text":"THANKSGIVING UPDATE: Oh, my! What an amazing meal. Lentil soup followed by Cornish game hen with chorizo stuffing on corn & parsnip puree and with butternut squash chips. Then churros with raspberry puree & chocolate sauce. We declined the included wine, so I can't tell you about that. Ali and Tolga have it all working."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now since they've changed the menu (I added pics of the new menu to the photo album on here) and it's just amazing.

Everything there is so good. Both of us have tried a bunch of different menu items and have been super delighted by each one. The pulled pork eggs benedict (added a pic), the chorizo hash, the regular breakfast, the huervos rancheros, you name it. 

Service is still a LITTLE slow but with such a unique menu and delicious dishes, it's totally worth the wait. Love the wait staff too, friendly and adorable.

A staple for us now at brunch."}
{"text":"The food is good and service is friendly.  But something must be inefficient in their kitchen processes, because it took almost half an hour for our food to arrive. Had the Spanish hash and the fork scram. Would come back again to try their pancakes but plan to budget at least 2 hours from when you first arrive, because you won't get a seat right away. From the time we put down our names and number until we were texted that a table opened up, almost a full hour had lapsed."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars for brunch despite ok coffee because the food is more than a 4 star experience when compared to other brunch experiences I've had. The wait at 10am on Saturday was 45 minutes. We got a text when our table upstairs was ready and from then on had fantastic, attentive service. One side dish in our group  took a long time to get but everything else was promptly delivered and we got non-stop water and coffee refills. I had the fork scrambled (perfectly scrambled eggs over a flaky, pastry crust and topped with a generous serving of smoked salmon that was garnished with dill and a some kind of yummy beet creme fraiche). What a beautiful combination of flavours and textures! I had this with a green salad because I had also ordered a side of pancakes and figured home fries would be too filling. I was right. Normally I would not order so much food but I heard so much about the red velvet pancakes, I had to try them. What a delight! Fluffy and delicate yet with the full red velvet chocolate flavour. This came with cream cheese topping and maple syrup which turned out to be the perfect combination of toppings. Although I shared this side with my dining companion who had and loved the Nova Scotia Eggs Benny, we were both stuffed. This side was quite generous with three or four pancakes included.  The coffee as I mentioned was the worst element of the whole experience-it was quite flavourless and weak tasting but other than that,  it was a fabulous meal and I regret I haven't eaten here the last few years. Needless to say, I'll be back for brunch again."}
{"text":"RED VELVET PANAKES and the sweet potato fries were AMAZING! I don't know anywhere else serving red velvet pancakes! It's so soft and fluffy! A definite must try if you're ever in the area. I think they roll the sweet potato fries in a batter, which makes it even more crunchy crispy and oh sooo delicious! 

I also tried the vegan burger. Was subpar to the first two items I mentioned."}
{"text":"Food was great, surly and inattentive host coupled with a friendly but overrun server made for a long and frustrating brunch."}
{"text":"Infamous red velvet pancakes is a must try with their animal fries & brunch burger. You need to come early on the weekends to line up for seats, there's no reservations. Expect 1 hour wait but walk around."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5/4 stars. I had the brunchin burger which was AMAZING, however the steak and eggs were very bland. The wait for 2 on a Sat at 11 am was about 30  mins and they text you when your table is ready. The service was mediocre. We had to wait for about 15 mins before having to ask a random person how we place our order in."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! Went for brunch and ordered freshly squeezed orange juice, red velvet pancakes, and a just the fixings burger with a side salad. We were told the wait would be 30 min for a table when we got there but I had wanted to try this place out for too long to pass it up. We ended up getting a table in 10 min and ordered as soon as possible. Nothing we ordered was a let down. The orange juice seriously was freshly squeezed and completely delicious. The red velvet pancakes as well were TO DIE FOR. I seriously contemplated ordering another plate- they were that good. Lastly, since it was brunch we decided to get a lunch meal to end it off  (we stayed for a while) and the burger was just phenomenal. Not the best burger in the world but pretty darn good.

The people there were very nice and service time was decent. I loved the upper dinning room and I would definitely go again. 

Must order: Red Velvet Pancakes"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, awsome and friendly staff .. prices are fair for the quality of food and service. One of our go to brunch locations."}
{"text":"I've had brunch at the Good Fork a few times. The Nova Scotia Bennie is pretty freaking tasty - and this is coming from someone who rarely likes eggs Benedict. The service on the weekends is chaotic and slow, which seems to be sometimes because the restaurant is busy and sometimes because they could be better organized or use an extra server. The servers I've met have always been friendly, which is not always the case at brunch establishments. The last time I had brunch, my food wasn't very warm and it took a really long time to get our coffee and water. However, the restaurant had a line out the door and it looked like the credit card machine was down.  

Bottom line: there's a line up during weekend brunch. The food is pretty good, but they need more servers."}
{"text":"THEY DONT ACCEPT CREDIT CARD. They made us to get cash from outside. Why there are so many restaurants in Toronto dont accept credit card."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and I was excited to order the fork scramb since I love pastries. Plus, I love smoked salmon. This combination was perfect for me. I absolutely loved this dish. The puff pastry was delicious and buttery. The salmon and dill went really well with it. My friend got eggs benny and it was delicious too. I love this place and I will definitely return whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, awesome rustic atmosphere, definite going to invite my friends here for brunch from now on. Waiting to get seated was an absolute pain, but our server was rad af and I loved his sweater so that was alright."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with my wife for the first time since they received favourable reviews on yelp. It was pretty busy so the host took down our number for waitlist and said the wait would be about 45min. After 1hr 15min, we still have not received any text message so I went back to check on the status. As I walked in, I noticed there were 3 empty tables. The host asked for my name and said he will seat us right away. He did not acknowledge the fact we didn't received a text and did not apologize for the delay. I think the host likely made a mistake with the scheduling because there were walk-ins not on the wait-list who got seated right away. The food was good & our server was great! The overall experience could have been excellent if it were not for the host's incompetence. Otherwise, I would have recommended this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my brunch here. Came on a weekday so there wasn't as much of a rush, but it was still packed! Really enjoyed the spanish hash!"}
{"text":"Pros:
A good variety of options
Great quality and ample quantity
Creative menu with very visually appealing food (its red velvet pancake is a must!)
Cozy and well-designed interior

Cons:
Long line ups (It took us 45min till we were seated! Be aware of extra waiting time for groups more than two!)
A bit pricy! 
 
Overall recommended for sure! You'll get a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"We had been meaning to check this place out since we moved to Etobicoke. Today just happened to be the day. I have to say I was kinda under whelmed. I'd heard such good things about the food but it was kinda ...ok.

I had the chicken pot pie. The portion was big. Puff pastry was good. The seasoning though? It had chicken and bacon in it but it was reminiscent of hot dog. Only way I can describe it.

Service was horrible. That wasn't a surprise as I'd heard it wasn't so good but they forgot juices and never really checked on us. It wasn't busy. I understand when it's busy you have to hustle and don't always have time  to checkup.

I'll probably try it again and get brunch next time as that is their speciality ( so I've heard anyways )"}
{"text":"I like the space, wait times are not crazy and you can get great food at this west west end establishment. 

I've been here twice so far, and it's been good. I've had the Red Velvet Pancakes, love the colour and the texture is that perfect fluffy pancake texture. The cream cheese spread on top is great with a little bit of maple syrup. 

When I first went there, they had a delicious Shakshuka with sujouk (sausage). Delicious. (I'll include the picture) 

Check them out!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

Came here on a Saturday around 1:30pm. There was still a 15 min wait but after 2pm, there were a lot of vacant tables. You give them your number and they text you when a table is ready. I love that cause there's so much to do on bloor west! The restaurant has two levels. The downstairs area has more two people seating and the upstairs has more booths and a small patio. Upstairs is also more modern and seems to be the preferred choice. We sat downstairs and that was fine. 

Food is pretty good!

We got the:

Spanish hash - nicely plated. Two Poached eggs on a bed of Spanish spiced potatoes/ hash. It wasn't heavily flavoured with salt so I liked that. A bit oily but it came with toast to soak it up. B+

Side of red velvet pancakes - three pancakes, which felt like a meal in its own. $9 compared to the regular menu item for $17. I felt this was good option cause I wanted to try other things. It's what other yelpers said. So good. Like a red velvet cake in a fluffy pancake! Loved it. A

Side of halloumi - it was fried nicely with spinach and sesame seeds, but way too oily and salty. While halloumi tends to be on the saltier side, I felt it was very  salty. It didn't come with bread or flat bread so I had to order it for $2 extra. A total of $10. Wasn't worth it to me. C

Drink of the week - I got a raspberry tangerine. It was freaky squeezed. Not bad. $6 ish 

Service was pretty slow. There's one bathroom on main level but you can access more washrooms upstairs. 

Cash or debit only! 

This was a good place to try. I liked most of the food. It was a bit on the pricey side for brunch though."}
{"text":"This place has been on my brunch list for a while and today I finally got to cross it off! Since we came on a weekday, the place wasn't busy at all and we got seated right away (such a good feeling for anyone who's ever experienced the craziness that is lining up for brunch in Toronto).

I ordered The Tome Green eggs benny while my friends had the Good Forkin' Morning with sausage, and we also got an order of red velvet pancakes to split. Needless to say, we were stuffed at the end. It was totally worth it though because the food was delicious; the fried green tomato on my eggs benny was perfectly crisp on the outside & fresh on the inside and my friends raved about the sausage and pancakes. Pretty solid brunch, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Initially attracted to the menu and bright windows, I popped in here for lunch today. I ordered the \"Anatolian Delight\" - lentil soup with sides of cucumber and tomato salad, feta cheese and olives. 

For what it was, a bowl of soup, some salad and ramekins of cheese and olives, it took about 25 minutes, which to me seemed very slow, however once delivered the food was fresh and the soup was hot. 

Sadly, the soup was incredibly bland. It had little flavour and no depth whatsoever. Adding salt, a squeeze of lemon and pouring my feta cheese into it made it edible, and even enjoyable! But for such a simple menu item, and a fixed one at that, I expected much better."}
{"text":"Somewhat overpriced but generally good:

- Service is slow, this point seems to be consistent across many reviews

- VERY BUSY during peak times (over an hour wait) wouldn't even bother for weekend brunch

- The food is generally impressive and creatively prepared and presented 

- Portion size is fairly small, you definitely won't be stuffed

Overall I would recommend trying once at some point though. Has a very modern vibe, if that's big for you"}
{"text":"I actually love coming here for Sunday brunch! The food there is good and the place itself is very cute. Love starting my day with their delicious mimosas !"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. There isn't one item that I didn't like. You must try the red velvet pancakes and the fork scramble! By far my most favourite brunch spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great brunch option on the west end. A lot of healthy options as well as less healthy options if you feel like binging. I really enjoy this place especially the butternut squash omelette and the Hulk smoothie. 

Tip: if you don't want to wait an hour to get in plan to get there around opening at 9-9:30am."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for breakfast during our honeymoon stay at the Old Mill Inn. It is such a delightful little place with incredibly friendly and helpful wait staff. I basically had the waitress decide my meal for me after telling her I'm vegetarian, I eat eggs and I was fairly hungry. She recommended them Tome Green Benedict with home fries, which was a fantastic choice. It was wonderful and a really decent price to boot. And any place than carries a good selection of hot sauce is on the right track. It did seem to get pretty busy, so I'm glad we got there right when they opened. It was a great experience and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great spot, expect to wait a while to be seated. Red velvet pancakes are great and the cream cheese dip goes well with them. Portions are big and will leave you satisfied. Would definitely return again.
Only issue is the breeze that comes in if youre seated downstairs that can get quite chilly. Otherwise great experience"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff are friendly! We waited for an hour...but it was also Sunday brunch. The heat was intense inside, we were sweating while eating! It would be much more comfortable with air conditioning, especially for these hot summers!"}
{"text":"Great place! Unique dishes here with Mediterranean theme. Very popular and great for brunch."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed with the eggs Benny. It came with a thimble of sauce on each egg. When I pointed this out, I was told that they measure it exactly and that if I wanted more I could buy more or just eat it as it was.  I upgraded, and received a small container which, had it been included would have been the standard of every other egg Benny in every other restaurant I've ever eaten in. The sauce, sadly lacked seasoning. I was disappointed with the too bad pay more attitude, even if the server was perfectly pleasant about it. I was disappointed that a sauce with three ingredients very basic ingredients,  plus seasoning would be handed out so sparingly, when it is actually the reason to order that dish and pay a higher price for it in the first place. 
I will say the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the hash browns had a lovely seasoning. But I doubt I would go back or recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Such a great local restaurant! First, they take reservations on weekdays and every time I have booked the table has been ready when I arrived!  The menu is so interesting, and you can choose from more breakfast or lunch options. We did one of each and they were both superb! Service is friendly and they do a good job of being laid back when you are having a \"catch up\" lunch or being fast when you need to get back to work!  I love Good Fork!  I just wish they would go back to doing some dinners too!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times over the past months. The favourite is the fork scramble. The most perfect scrambled eggs I have ever tasted, comes with a delicious creamy dill sauce within a light puff pastry, it is heaven."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Brunch restaurants and I've only been here once. I got the Spanish hash that was hearty and delightful, my best friend got the fork scram with smoked salmon that too, was delicious but took some time to come out. We hard the fancy shorts pancakes, and oh my god. I've never had pancakes like that and it was so good; so fluffy and sweet but tangy and creamy because of the cheese. Server was so sweet and recommended great stuff. I need to come back to try their red velvet pancakes and chicken pot pie!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place, food and decor is awesome. Only downside is too many people know about it so takes a while before you sit down."}
{"text":"Loved the pancakes, super unique. My \"French toast\" was ok, it was really sweet, and not really my version of French toast. I didn't like the apricot jam on top, too sour. The service was great, however it was an hour and a half wait. I wish they toke reservations... I'm not sure if it's worth the wait/ hype but I would be willing to try it again if it's a short line."}
{"text":"Unusual menu. We ordered hummus and it was the best I have ever tasted, not to mention warm and delicious. I got the smoked chicken pot pie and my mother had the fried chicken. Very unique, fresh and fantastic flavours. No surprise the place is almost always busy. And forget weekend brunch, it's a wait list."}
{"text":"Ventured back in here for another Sunday brunch. It seems they have hired new staff who are more attentive and nice! A much more pleasant experience all around.

I had a burger that was possibly one of the greatest I've ever had. It was so juicy and cooked perfectly. 

I'm glad I gave the restaurant a second chance and that the owner seems to have addressed the bad service problems. Good work! Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really great place for a get together or date .. My boyfriend and I went here and had the original burger and I order a side of red velvet pancakes
My boyfriend loved the burger way more than I did .. I thought it had a weird taste too it but what I can say is that I enjoyed those pancakes .. Red velvet pancakes are my favourite and if you had it at ihop don't expect them to beat it but best believe they got very close ! 
The pancakes do come very gooey in the middle .. I thought they didn't cook it well but that is how they do it so I can't complain .. But the icing is delicious and so is the syrup  

coming back for sure 

Ps. If you have plans after I suggest you go here an hour early for they might make you wait for 45 minutes too sit down due to the amount of people that go there !"}
{"text":"Delicious food, attentive staff and good prices range"}
{"text":"Went for brunch recently and thought this place was ok but not sure if it's worth the wait. Although I wanted to try the red velvet pancakes I ended up ordering eggs, hash browns and bacon. Hash browns were good and had some spicy seasoning. I guess I was expecting more for a 45 min wait but I'd give this place another shot if I was in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"I was perplexed leaving the Good Fork and it will not be a repeat visit.  The place was packed and it felt like a revolving door of new patrons coming in.  Which on the coldest day this year made it very unpleasant for those of us eating.  I was freezing which made the experience less then desirable.  

The food replicated the experience.  I had the pulled chicken panini.  It lacked flavour and it wasn't what I expected.  It wasn't a panini, it was a focaccia sandwich with chopped chicken, not pulled.  The meat on the flank steak was not prepared correctly for the cut of meat making it tough.  The only saving grace was the fries, and that isn't enough to get me back through the door.  This ones a pass for me."}
{"text":"This place lived up the the hype. 

The red velvet pancakes were delicious (fluffy and not overly sweet with delicious cream cheese icing). 

The pot pie was light and flaky, with ample amounts of delicious filling. 

The burger was hearty and well cooked with great toppings. Fries were good too, both regular and sweet potato. 

The fried chicken sandwich was underwhelming, it's a lot of the same flavours and desperately needed something tart, fresh and sweet or tangy to cut the salty. 

Service was great and friendly. The ambience is very minimalist and clean. They are BUSY! and they close at 4pm, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Cute little brunch spot. A little on the pricier side, if you aren't looking to drop $20 on an omelette this may not be the place for you! $7.50 side plain pancakes were a 10/10. The service was fast and also very friendly. If I was in the area I would come back but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Always come here for lunch or brunch, never disappointed by the food. Cheap and good quality food, pancakes are a staple!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is soooo good. I have been here about 10-15 times and have gotten something different each time (both brunch and lunch menus) and have loved each dish. 

I also really love their Mimosa's. So delicious with fresh fruit and once with edible flowers. Mmmmmmmmmm.

The price is reasonable. The food is great and their booze selection and fresh juices are great. Have never had the coffee. 

The wait is always long but they will take your number and call you when it's almost time to come back so you can take a walk while you wait. The space and seating can not accommodate a group of more than 6. Parking situation nearby is not ideal but we always walk anyways."}
{"text":"I ordered their Tome greens benny with animal style home fries. I loved the home fries but the bennies were ok. I have had better in past. Good, friendly service. Went there on Sunday morning, didn't take long to get a table. Heard great things about their red velvet pancakes. Will definitely give them and veggie burger a try the next time I am around."}
{"text":"Bring your patience and don't come hungry. We waited 1 hr to be seated and another 35mins to get our food. I dont believe that we will be coming back, on the pics the food looks delicious, that's what brought us here, but is not as good as it seems. A couple of mishaps with the orders, I wanted salad with my eggs, they brought potatoes, my husband asked for his steak medium rare and it was well done, mind you we didn't return anything because we were starving and didn't want to wait another 30 mins to get our food right. 
Not a good place to talk, very loud ambiance, the music is high so the people just start screaming to each other (wish I could record sounds with this review), I couldn't even hear my husband who was sitting in front of me!!!
Staff, on the other hand, is very polite and welcoming. 
Definitely won't come back but it was good to experience it first hand given the reviews."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. This place does not take reservations. Lineup are very long but worth the wait. The red velvet pancake is a must try."}
{"text":"Looking for a brunch spot in Bloor West Village. Check out The Good Fork. They done did breakfast right.
Already been a couple of times and seems as though they have the system to get the eggs cooked right.. scrambled, the eggs are fluffy.. benedict, the eggs are poached right.. eggs over medium - they even know to cook just enough so that some yolk should ooze out after being cut. 

Servers do a good job keeping coffee topped up. 

OHHH..  Cholula hot sauce when you ask for hot sauce - that's already a WIN right there!"}
{"text":"Brunch is delicious here. I've been a few times and finally completing a review on the restaurant. Service is great here, and I would have to say their waiting list is a good way of organizing all the walk ins. There isn't a designated waiting spot so when you arrive, they'll let you know how long it'll be and take down your phone number. On Boxing Day Monday, it was still a 20 minute wait. They also let you know they'll text you when the table is ready. My friend and I just decided to check out some stores along Bloor West while we waited which worked out. They texted me after 20 mins and we went back to the restaurant and got seated.

For food - my friend ordered the Spring Fling omelette and I ordered the Gordy Benny. My girlfriend enjoyed her omelette and my Gordy benny was delicious. I heard from our server the Gordy will be off the menu soon which is shocking...it was so good! The salad was nice as well with my eggs benny, didn't feel as heavy. Aside from this visit, I've also had red velvet pancakes, breakfast with chorizo, and tried the hash. Everything is pretty good on the menu. Solid brunch for the area. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seen a few friends post pictures and it looked amazing so i checked it out myself. The food is quite good and the portions are quite big as well that each one of us ordered a dish and shared it amongst each other. Would love to try the red velvet pancakes on my next visit soon."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and it sure shows the wait for brunch when we walked up was a little over an hour. Tons to do on the street to keep busy. The menu totally hits the spot for brunch for sure. And I took a peak at their lunch/dinner looks good too. Food was made fresh at order, and I feasted with my friends. I ordered the steak and eggs; came win potatoes and veggies, was made perfect medium rare but my plate forgot the sauce. It was still good! Friend ordered chicken pot pie was made to order and was hot out the oven delivered she loved it. The hummus egg bowl was also ordered at the table was delicious. It would of been 5 stars but the place was hot like no AC upstairs, waited a little over an hour for the food to come but kept busy with conversation and drinks. Still would return for sure the food was awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and the staff is willing to accommodate you as much as they can. You really feel comfortable here. It does get busy at times with a good wait but there's a clear reason for this. 

Ive been to the good fork about 4 times and will be back for sure. Red Velvet Pancakes all the way."}
{"text":"Red velvet pancakes. Seriously..... can't take picture. They are devoured. I come from Muskoka specifically for this! Oh, and the eggs Benedict. Wow... just wow!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place! The setting is interesting and the food delicious!
We ventured in while walking around Bloor West Village. I had the homemade gnocchi and my guy had the veggie burger. The gnocchi was incredibly yummy and rich. I would recommend though splitting with someone and sharing a salad to offset the richness. My guy had the veggie burger and it was unique and suprerb. I don't like veggie burgers usually because they are made to replicate meat taste (which I am not a fan). But this one tasted like veggies (esp  sweet potato mmmmm) and it was perfect. I asked the waitress if I could buy them at any stores and she said that no it was their restaurant recipe. Too bad :) 
The rich food was perfect on the rainy day we stopped in. Not recommended if you're on your way to a soccer game."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place as the dishes are more unique than your typical brunch places.  They have breakfast and lunch items and portion sizes are quite generous.  Prices are on the higher side for brunch but is somewhat justified by the food being quite good.  Service was great and prompt.  Try to get a seat upstairs as they fill the main floor with tables so if there is a crowd waiting in line, they are literally waiting right beside you.  Parking can be a hassle but not too bad.  Will come again."}
{"text":"We had brunch here today and I must say it was a great little spot. We don't head over to Bloor West very often but glad we did.
We had the Benny with brisket: the eggs are poached to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was tangy and creamy. The brisket was a little over cooked as you can tell they had to re hear it. But it had a nice smoked taste.
The Burger: it was big! The beef was flavourful and came with crisp onion rings and the perfect burger pickle.
The staff was friendly and made you feel welcome."}
{"text":"This place has food so good I wish they opened all day so I could have their food for dinner too...

Service: Been here multiple times, always had friendly and helpful staff, no complain

Food: I've tried many things on their menu, including Huevos Rancheros, Spanish Hash, Menemen (no longer on the menu), their famous Red Velvet Pancakes, Challah French Toast (no longer on their menu), Pro Bowler, and Hummus Bowl, and I always leave satisfied on the tongue and in the stomach EVERY TIME. I highly recommend their pancakes and hummus bowl, especially that grilled everything pita bread included in the hummus bowl, OMG never have I loved bread SO MUCH, I'm tempted to ask them next time if I can just get the grilled pita bread to go...I only have maybe one little complain is that if you order the Spanish Hash, it tends to get really greasy and oily in the bottom in which I'm not a fan of, else no complains.

Note: I've only been here on the weekends for their brunch/lunch and it ranged from no wait - 40mins wait"}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot, I went there for a breakfast meeting on a week day. I had the Salmon Bennie ( I believe they call it the Nova Scotian ). The service, food and everything else that I can remember was good ... I can only remember the events that occurred after I finished my morning coffee."}
{"text":"We had a delicious breakfast that wasn't marred by the unfortunate people seated next to us (not the fault of the restaurant). 

We were seated upstairs and our server was super nice and attentive and able to explain everything on the menu. They had a lot of items taken right from their garden in the back! I got an omelette and my husband got the good forkin morning with some bacon. The breakfast was delicious. I love that they have you a piece of melon was your breakfast! The sour dough toast was delicious as well, perfectly toasted. 

Why do I bring up the people seated next to us? I believe her name was Aimee. Well Aimee seemed fine, although rude to everyone, ate her bread that came with the soup... had a FaceTime conversation with her friend (which is how I found out her name), asked her friend to go shopping and mentioned she knew how to get things,  heavily discounted.. then her salad and eggs came. As soon as the server came to check in on the table, the Aimee flipped out, yelling and carrying on, said her toast (same bread that I had) tasted like bleach. The server handled the situation very well. Apologized, went to get the manager, while the Aimee ate her friend's soup... and her friend's bread. 

After waiting for a couple minutes, Aimee said to her friend, 'let's go, we've been here for two hours.' Her friend disagreed with her. I disagreed with her. They were seated right before we were, they ordered around the same time, and their food came out around the same time, and we weren't there for two hours. Normally, I wouldn't post about situations likes this, but the way Aimee treated the staff was inappropriate. We observed both our server (for both tables) and the manager handle the situation beautifully. Between the food and the service, we will definitely be going back. Hopefully, Aimee won't be there, although we might have overheard that she comes in about once a week and pulls this stunt. 

The two things I do wish they would change is one, the wifi. We're from the states and unfortunately my phone, which I thought would work in Canada, has not been working (I do have an international plan). Two, the credit card machines... we had a debit card, but because it was a US card, their machine read it as a credit card. So we paid in cash... US cash. Sorry about that!"}
{"text":"This is my go to brunch spot on the west end. Every time me and my brunch buddy say we should \"try somewhere new\" but we always end up back here. Be careful about what time you go because this place fills up pretty fast, sometimes its best to call ahead to scope out the crowd or make a reservation (but remember reservations are only for weekdays)!

I 95% of the time would end up ordering the \"Gordy\" benny which was loaded with saucy pulled pork and crispy shallots which was such an awesome replacement for your typical peameal. 

They've recently revamped their menu and have swapped it for the \"Daisy\" which swapped out the pulled pork for 24 hr brisket so when my heart gets over the betrayal I'll be ready to give a try.

The Red Velvet Pancakes with cream cheese frosting are amazing when your sweet tooth starts nagging for a fix. 

I'm excited to explore their new menu next time I head on over!"}
{"text":"Went there today with family for breakfast.  Overall it was very good.  If there seven of us, we all enjoyed our dishes.   The only complaint is that the 4.75$ for a glass of fresh squeezed OJ did not taste fresh squeezed.  I would pass on that next time.  

The ingredients were of good quality, the service was very good, the kitchen was able to accommodate the vegan requirements that my cousin has.  

Good reliable breakfast place.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for brunch. Service was very slow, with tables being seated after us getting faster service.

I ordered the Frizzy Pig. The bacon was burned on the outside and dry on the inside. They did replace it, though the style of bacon and the inconsistency of the sauce spread was still disappointing.

Overall, this higher-end restaurant was not worth visiting."}
{"text":"I don't think I've had a better brunch in Toronto. The food is amazing, the portions are enormous, the space is very cozy & welcoming and the staff offers outstanding customer service. Be sure to get there before 9AM on weekends - the wait can get long."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had! We had Ordered an omelette with fresh  fruit and a side of pancakes, and the Peameal eggs Benedict. the egg was cooked so perfectly and the pancakes were fluffy and absolutely delicious. I think I could have eaten a whole loaf of their toast bread. Just Amazing! Will be back again !"}
{"text":"I would've given four stars but upon walking into the establishment, my first impression was altered by the host. He was not pleasant at all, very impersonal, unresponsive and his overall demeanour was unfriendly.  Luckily the food and Ella quickly redeemed the initial shortcoming of the uninterested face of the restaurant.

We had the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese icing and the fork scramble. The pancakes were fluffy and just the right density.  The fork scramble was a nice play on a traditional breakfast.  The puff pastry was a nice addition to the dish. The lemon infused crème fraîche was a nice addition as well.  Overall the fresh dill made the dish.

Would definitely return sans the sulky host - half of the dining experience is about atmosphere."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice brunch, we decided to try out The Good Fork in our 'hood.  We arrived around 2pm and were seated at a booth on the ground floor.

We ordered 2 panini specials - veggie and flank steak with frites and a drink ($12 each), Spanish Hash ($9.45), French Toast ($9.50) and coffee.  There was a 20-25 min. wait for our food to arrive.  The flank steak in my panini was tough and cut into chunks instead of sliced which made it hard to eat without all the contents of the panini falling out.

Leaving the restaurant, I noticed that our clothes and hair reeked of deep fry.  Not really a scent I wanted on me for the rest of the day .

Overall, a mediocre experience at The Good Fork.  For the pricing, I feel a better brunch can be had at Dr. Generosity or Bloor-Jane Diner."}
{"text":"What started as a 4 star food experience turned quickly to the disappointing 2 star as the time ticked away waiting at the table for service, food, and the cheque.  All the while there was a constant line up of 14++ people out the door.  

The Good Fork is a puzzle... how could food be so good and yet be so disappointing in service.  How could people wait over an hour before sitting for this type of experience?  This is not a exaggeration.  If you're trying to find a table for more than 2 on a Sunday after 10:30 am... good luck.  The table of 3 beside us waited 1 hour and 10 minutes.  For us, we waited 30 minutes but we arrived at 10 am.  

Good Fork is on the very west end of Bloor St.  It's popularity is easily seen by the constant line up out the door on a Sunday morning.  Normally they allow you to put your name down but on the Sunday I went, their 'system' is down and you had to stand in line.  I'm not sure how taking names and number on a paper isn't an option.  

The space itself is 2 story with the tables a bit close to the neighbouring table but not to the point where you feel it's too intrusive.  Then again, a few people had to move the tables out into the aisle to get into the seats so maybe it is too close.  The restaurant is clean and it has one super busy open kitchen.  I easily counted 8 people working behind the counter and with the huge wait, it's badly needed.

The menu is brunch focused with a Mediterranean spin and a few fun dishes thrown in.  I personally think the menu is inventive and very interesting.  I think there are many options for everyone ... to choose is kinda hard as you may find at least 4 things on there that are interesting.  I noticed the prices of the dishes higher than Toronto brunch places.  Compared to other places like Figo, Hexagon, or Oretta, Good Fork is unbelievably more expensive.  BUT I will say that Good Fork portions are huge.  So maybe you do get what you pay for but I still think it's on the pricey side.  

Service... so this is where it failed badly.  I dont think staff here is malicious or rude.  They're just not paying attention or attentive and thats why you have 16 people waiting at noon for tables that could have been cleared out 30 minutes earlier.  We waited for 15 minutes sitting at our table before we were greeted and our drink order taken.  We waited another 40 minutes before we got our dishes.  And we waited 25 minutes after asking for our bill before we had to flag down someone to grab the card machine.  We could have easily left more than an hour earlier.  It's unreasonable to run a 'busy' place and not to try to turn tables faster.  I think the wait is artificial... its not that their busy, they can't run the place efficiently.

French Toast (F#*$ch Toast) -  This is a dish that takes a long time to make but honestly, it's delicious.  More similar to bread pudding, a date and molasses cake is baked into cute cakelets and then topped with apricot preserves, vanilla labneh (a creamy soft cheese), cotton candy, and a gingerbread crumble.  You can see huge chunks of dates in the super tender and moist dense cake.  You have an overwhelming sweetness but its a rich deep sweet bite that's very good.  Dessert for breakfast and just one of the more interesting french toast in Toronto 4.5/5

Pro Bowler - A large plate arrived at the table and it was very full of great interesting vegetables.  Baby Kale, avocado, pickled cabbage, cucumber, falafels, and topped with a creamy vinaigrette.  I found this salad to be filled with a lot of good crunch and flavours.  I liked this because it had a nice sour and fresh taste from everything mixed in.  For $19, I did find it expensive for a salad.  I've had large meal salads that are equally great but for a fraction of the cost.  It's still a good salad. 4/5

Home Fries - They actually forgot to give us this.  We got the mains and this was left out.  We thought they may come back with this ... nope.  We saw other tables get theirs with their meal.  We told them that we didn't need the dish anymore and they took it off the bill but gave us a small dish of it on the house.  It was a nice move on their part but still ... service is just not attentive and paying attention.  The home fries themselves were served hot and fresh.  They're decent but nothing outstanding.  3/5

Between abnormally high prices for outside downtown Toronto and poor service, I find it sad to give downgrade the rating from a 4 to a 2 but I honestly could not recommend this spot to anyone who values their time."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for lunch on a Thursday, it wasn't busy at that time so we got seated very quickly and the weather was so nice that day we sat in the small back patio. I ordered the Frenchy grilled cheese which had steak, onions and cheese with a side of sweet potato fries, WOW! It's been a while since I've reacted that way towards a sandwich. My bf ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was very tender and flavourful. We also tried Beau's Kissmeyer beer, which we both enjoyed a lot. Service was quick and friendly, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good Fork replaced a short-lived and ghastly orange restaurant, Felicious. It is unclear whether they had a make-over and re-opened but either way, Good Fork has a much nicer aesthetic - clean and bright, black banquets, diner-feel with good signage and menu design. I had a good feeling about my lunch at the new brunch spot in Bloor West Village. 

The staff was very keen and friendly, filling up my bottomless cup of quite tasty coffee ($2.90!) several times. I ordered 'the original' burger with salad - it came within 10 minutes. The burger looked better than it tasted - they serve it on a pretzel bun, with gruyere, remoulade and those strange american crispy onions (are they called fun'ions?). The patty was nothing special, and had a distinct shamrock frozen patty shape - not the worst burger - but certainly nothing to travel across town for.  The salad was standard fare - mixed greens, overdressed with a raspberry vinaigrette and piled so high that no regular human being could possibly finish it.  

Would I return to Good Fork? Yes, indeed, but probably for brunch instead."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in the west end! Food is spectacular, service is excellent and they have Caesars that are to die for. They are busy but if there is a wait, you can take a walk about and they'll text you when your table is ready. It's never more that 15 minutes. I recommend the Gordy, but there's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch. Had the spanish hash and loved it. Almost as legit as the best brunches in Seattle."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch place in the west end of Toronto. We arrived little after nine but the place was already getting full, which is a good sign. We tried spaniah hash, green tomato eggs benny, and side order of red velvet pancake. They were all very delicious. Spanish hash has good mix of chorizo, red peppers, and some sauce that went well together. You get two poached eggs on top of your hash as well and it is quite filling. Eggs benny..its twist was on fried green tomato. The tanginess of the tomato made their benny special. And as everyone else says, get red velvet pancake! It's almost like ree velvet cake except in the form of pancake. The cream cheese icing goes so well together with pancake. We would love to come back to try more of their bfast items on their menu! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try this place aft walking by lots times . To my surprise I was disappointed the one dish i have tried its not so satisfying . 

I tried the potato hash. It looked delicious but the potato was cut into so small u dont taste much of it. Becusse they were finely chopped , u get A LOT that DRY STUFF from the outside vs the soft moist pitato from inside. Plus its made with ground meats which is also chewy. So each bite u r fighing with dry sand paper like texture that tumbles on yr tongue.  It is interesting dish, who doesnt like potatos n ground meat? N why no one else mixed ground meat with fries? ---- simple the texture sucks to yr tongue! Dry n crunch meats fry n rough. It doesnt even have much taste to it . (Ground meats usually r bland unless slow cooked jn sauce) . They r just prickly in your mouth cuz all tiny cubes have lots dried corners stab ur mouth. Id rather ear fried instead. I wonder if i had bad luck that day that batch of potsto was over done,  but from the looks they were not burnt . I jjst think bad attempt to creat a dish by making potatos too small n dry n pair them with over cooked ground meat! I think if the potato was semi soft or soft in the middle i would have enjoyed the dish. 

---- not mention the dish comes with thin n toasted brown colored bread which is completely dry like very scratchy.  I think this dish is made for someone loves crispy things and like to chew . Cuz i know some ppl like that. 

I might have ordered a small coffee. Aft tax n tip(not really good  service) its $20 its def not worth it lol ;) for simple potato n ground meat tossed with some sauce . Def not worth it. Rather have butter croissant  somewhere in the area."}
{"text":"The pancakes were amazing, couldn't finish them entirely but I would if my stomach allowed it. I ordered the granola and blueberry pancakes, they were so delicious and fluffy. Didn't have to wait for a seat either, we were seated to a table right away (we came on a Tuesday afternoon). I'd definitely come back again to try the hyped up red velvet pancakes."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite brunch place. There is quite a bit of a wait on the weekends. I usually get the Toronnah but have tried and loved the pulled pork eggs benny as well. My boyfriend usually gets the regular breakfast. The crispy home fries are probably the best part though. The coffee isn't that great though, but if it comes free with your meal then why not."}
{"text":"I would've given this place a 4* had the service not been lacking and slow. Took 35 min to get our food and 15 min to get a coffee. Prices are kinda steep too. Despite the price, the red velvet pancakes were very good and fluffy. And more than enough serving size. Maybe save this place for a treat if ever craving those pancakes."}
{"text":"Great food. However be prepared to wait as the kitchen does take a while. Over 30 min to get your food from ordering and add the 20 min wait to get a table.   Server only checked on us after we got our food, not once since our drinks came.   If service and time of food came faster would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch, and both times I was not impressed.  There was a 20 minute wait, where they take your phone number and you have to walk the streets. This would be fine, except for the fact that both times I went, there were a large number of tables available of varying sizes. The first time, when I asked for the empty two person table near the window (there were two of us), I was told no (with no reason given). 20 minutes later, that table was STILL empty, and they finally gave it to us! Totally ridiculous. In addition, the hostess was pretty rude. 

However, I decided to give the place a second chance. The exact same thing happened - although there were tons of tables free, we had to wait 20 minutes before finally being seated. I am not impressed with whatever rules the hostesses seem to be following, nor with their attitude, and will not be returning. Which is a shame because I love the huge windows and two levels, and I live nearby. 

The food is ok - just standard breakfast, nothing exciting. However the potatoes are extremely salty (even my boyfriend who loves salt was unable to eat them). The smoothies are very large and seemed like pure fruit, so they're probably great for people who can't eat dairy."}
{"text":"Delicious food made with a lot of care, caring and relaxed staff, conscious owner AND very accessible. They have automatic doors and a wheelchair accessible washroom. Having a physical disability, sometimes I have to wait until I get home to use the bathroom. It was nice to be able to sit down, eat good food, get good service, order alcoholic drinks and not have to worry about my bladder lol also, the owner told me that he and his partners specifically designed the restaurant with accessibility in mind. This is a very rare thing in Toronto! Definitely come to this restaurant:-)"}
{"text":"My cousin and I decided to have brunch here at 11:00am on Monday June 26th. We had her daughter with us, whom is 2 and they had a kid's menu which was great! 

The place itself has plenty of seating (two floors) which is great for a Toronto establishment. Lots of natural lighting and the place is nicely decorated, clean and newly updated which makes it a pleasant stay.  

My cousin arrived right after 11:00am and I arrived like a tardy pants at 11:15am. At that point she was already seated...so the wait was not that long- but again, it was a Monday (but fairly busy may I add).

The menu selection is great because it is not overwhelming and they have great humour in the wording of menu items which adds a little bit of personality to the place. We both ended up getting the \"Good forkin' morning\" which comes with two eggs, toast, home fries (or salad) and your choice of side- we both went with sausage. We ordered my goddaughter just something off the kid's menu which was only $8- so reasonably priced.

The service was VERY slow but the servers were very polite and accommodating...it just took forever for them to get to us to take our order and then forever again to bring our food....and forever again to bring our bill. We left the place at 1:00pm...2 hours later- which is fine because we were chatting and enjoying the window seat but, 2 hours- seriously?

The food was OK. I wouldn't say they are filling either. The breakfast sausages are HUGE. They are NOT and I repeat are NOT breakfast sausage links or even remotely close- they are closer to full sausages on steroids. I wouldn't have a problem with the sausages being that big if they gave you more than 1 slice of toast, and not even a scoop of homefries to enjoy with it. I literally had 1 entire sauszilla left and I had nothing to eat it with *small tear*. I was very disappointed with the side of homefries. I could not believe that it honestly was like two scoops....it looked like it was leftovers from someone else's plates.

Regardless, I was full (enough to eat an early dinner at 5) and didn't mind the quality and taste of the overall food. I will probably come back again (not in a rush though) to try it out and taste something else off the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and it was amazing! I got to sit on the top floor, so I was enjoying my view looking over bloor west village.  I had the \"Fun Guy\" omelette since I love eggs, and it was delicious. My cousin had the \"Fork Scramble\" with smoked salmon which is served on a puff pastry, and it was the greatest thing I have ever tried.  We also shared the red velvet pancakes, which were obviously mouth watering.  For drinks we had the tropics smoothie which was decent, but nothing special.  By the end of it we were stuffed, and I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday but didn't have a chance to try the food because the waiting time was one and a half hours and they don't take reservations on weekends. What a disservice to customers. Don't waste your time go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at but extremely busy and during the winter is not comfortable to eat on the first floor because there's a very cold draft every time someone opens or closes the door. The food and service are fantastic, though. Also, if you plan to go there on a weekend, expect to wait at least an hour for a table and have a walk or go to a nearby coffee shop to pass the time because it gets really crowded there and they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but very nice environment waitress we had was very welcoming I got some fries and soup it was"}
{"text":"The place was ok and the food was very good but the staff specially the girl who was the greeter she was the worse unacceptably rude and unfair, we were there and we got seated to the only table left in the restaurant which was very small right by the window and in a sunny day it was very hot couldn't feel the A.C. so we asked to get another seat if available and she said no there is no seat then after she seated 3 other couples and some empty seat beside us that we saw and we asked again and she said no you already got a seat and  its for other people who may come by And she argued with us and ruined our mood and caused us not to come by ever again WTF if I was the owner I fire her if she can't learn customer's are always right so fir this you get no vote or my business as far food I will find other place with better services, better staff and better food."}
{"text":"Loved it! Shared spanish hash and blueberry pancakes, both were fantastic. There is a cute little coffee spot nearby just east of restaurant while you wait for a table which didn't take too long.
Going back for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch with my family including small toddler 3 times. They seat us upstairs cause of the child. If you get there before 10am you can get seated quickly. So far the food has been amazing but service is not consistently good."}
{"text":"Extremely long waits on the weekend for brunch. You get so hungry and just expect a little bit more for the prices you pay. Very decent food. Interesting options. Freshly squeeze juices. I definitely would give it another try."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch I've ever had! The waiting time was 20mins,which is ok, just walked about the neighbourhood. The food is super delicious . Especially I like tomato! Haha"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Toronto for a good brunch. I love going with friends and family. Been going for 5+ years with friends for brunch. 

Things I have tried: 

Pumpkin Pancakes (they had them the first time I went, and never seen.. i dream of these delicious things!)

Red Velvet Pancakes (super sweet, order this with friends to share as a dessert, this is NOT breakfast food---- but super yummy!)

Plain pancakes (pretty good!)

(I really like pancakes)

My favourite has been the goat cheese sandwich (that now seems to be mysteriously gone from the menu (maybe they have a  new menu??)

Mac and cheese is very filling, come with a big appetite if ordering. It is good but probably least favourite of the foods.

Today I tried the Gin Smash and it was wonderful.

Tips:
- Go rights when it opens or expect long waits (you give number and they text you when tables ready). These waits can be more than an hour on weekends
-On weekdays you can make reservations"}
{"text":"A bustling and noisy brunch spot.  We had burgers which were tasty but not as wow-tastic as the waiting list would suggest."}
{"text":"Third time in to this place for brunch and I just love the spot! Service is always excellent and the food is absolutely amazing! I'll be back soon!"}
