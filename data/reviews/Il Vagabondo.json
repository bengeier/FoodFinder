{"text":"This visit was a Groupon mistake. When we got there, they told us steak wasn't included as an option in our meals even though the Groupon voucher had indicated it was. Luckily, neither of us had wanted steak so we didn't have to fight this, but this is in really poor taste and not acceptable. Our appetizer was the worst calamari I've ever had (my date said it tasted like \"rubber bands\"), and the portion was extremely small - much smaller than I've received at any other restaurant for a similar price value. We both ordered a sausage pasta entree. Portion was good, but the sauce tasted worse than canned grocery store sauce (is it possible?) and something was really off about the sausage taste. Dessert was tiramisu, which was good, but I'm guessing they ordered it in from a bakery. This place wasn't even worth the $29+tax we paid for our voucher. Wish we had spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch whilst doing work visits.   I ordered a chicken parm sandwich to-go so I could eat it in the car. For $8, I thought it was a little expensive considering it was an okay size and it tasted okay as well. My work cafeteria (not subsidized in any way and is quite overpriced) charges $4.50 for the same thing.  My experience here was 'meh.' I think I prefer the place down the street for breaded chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"The lasagna and salad signature lunch is good, the service is not -- odd given that it is cafeteria style.  They are really stingy there with the bread and butter -- go figure, who would have thought?  One of the service staff (male) acts as the bread and butter police, he watches the bread basket like a hawk and is very aggressive and rude about it.   You're not missing much if you decide to skip this place."}
