{"text":"Green tea in a can.  Solid sushi.  Unique atmosphere.  The person who brought out my  sushi cared that I'd liked everything.  Good experience."}
{"text":"I personally rank this place as the best sushi restaurant in town. They don't use msg and its safe for pregnant woman like me. I've tried muramoto, takara, but sushibox was the only place that i could finish my plate."}
{"text":"Best sushi and Japanese foods in Madison! I am not Japanese, but I consider myself a Japanese food lover, and I've tasted some authentic Japanese foods in Japan and around the continent.

(+):
Fresh raw sushi (salmon, hokkigai, tuna) 
Good teriyaki sauce and great tasting beef (USDA??) 
Delishhh shrimp tempura
Perfect sushi rice (they are sweet and sour and they stick together like what sushi rice should be, unlike on some other Jap restaurants in Madison).
Cute place, with free shows of how they make your sushi on the sushi bar.

(-):
Self-serve, though considering the price it should be full-service
The lady, who greets and takes your order, is not very nice or friendly
Small portions (I ordered the beef teriyaki, and the portion was tiny)

PS: I am a meat eater, so this review may not apply to vegetarians :)

Note to the next reviewer (Grace N): I never said that this place was owned by a Japanese, I simply said that the owner is not very friendly, a quality that usually you see from Japanese people. I know that they are Korean, since the certificate said the name was Kim something.
Nonetheless, the quality is still superb and I personally prefer this place than Muramoto."}
{"text":"We lived in Miami Beach for six years and have spent the last 8 years in Los Angeles and we eat a lot of sushi.  I'm no foodie expert but IMHO this place is great.  We were visiting my sister in Madison and she took us there.  I had a few pieces of sushi, tuna and yellow tail, and they were both fresh and had a lovely flavor.  The rice was maybe a touch hard and could be al ittle \"stickyer\" but again had good flavor.  We had a Rainbow Roll that was just lovely.  Same fresh fish on top including very nice salmon.  The roll was maybe a little less \"exiting\" of flavor than some I've had but it was very good and the nori was not chewey which is one of my personal peeves when it does happen.  My sister had a teryaki bowl that she just loves but I didn't taste it.

We also had some gyoza which were average at best.  And we ordered some shrimp termpura that was very light and nicely battered.  

The owners were very nice and obviously remembered my sister and greeted us warmly and she brought over a deep fried california roll for \"very special customers\" which made me remember I was in Wisconsin ;-)

All in all a very nice experience and I'll go there again next time I'm in town.  The restaurant itself is not trendy or fancy but that's not important to me.  As for cost... just let me say to the people who think it's expensive - dont' come to LA  ;-()"}
{"text":"Good portions, appropriate price, and prompt service. They had some varieties of sushi that I had never had before putting one of a pickled vegetable that was absolutely delicious. Their menu is very extensive and has a lot of different options. 

They also had some ethnic sweets that are difficult to find another places. This place is a very good stop if you're in need of some sushi and you're in the Madison area.

The five star review is mostly about bringing their overall score up to about a four star review which is where it belongs."}
{"text":"hmm, the other reviews are puzzling to me, because I am a huge fan of the sushi box. I really like everything about it, to their selection of sushi rolls to their bento boxes and their decor (you can watch the dude make your sushi on tape on a monitor in the front of the restaurant). I am a vegetarian so I always get one of the noodle dishes and a vegetarian sushi plate. In my humble opinion the food tastes authentically japanese, but I have never been to Japan. Nor am I one to venture out and try sushi with odd sea-life in it."}
{"text":"No bueno!

1. Tough, chewy Hamachi with not so fresh flavor

2. Salty and otherwise bland udon soup wih limp, flavorless tempura

3. Salmon-skin handroll completely overpowered by way too much shizo leaf.

4. Salad with no character and bitter ginger dressing

Blech!  Maybe I should have known better than to seek out sushi in Wisconsin?  For the sake of Madison, I hope there's better out there."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh and delicious, as others have posted. I first came in 2004 (right before  I left Madison) and liked it very much every time I visited.

When I moved back to Madison after a decade in the bad-sushi Mecca of Phoenix, AZ, I was eager to go back. I did, and the sushi is still quite good.

But the woman who runs the restaurant with her husband blew my mind. I noticed she was re-using sushi order sheets with the old orders scratched out. \"Hmm...cheap. And a little weird,\" I thought. 

The weirdness was only beginning. The proprietress ran my credit card for ~$21, and it came back as declined. This is enormously weird, as I pay down my balance religiously. Since the restaurant was nearly empty and no one was behind me in line, I called my bank to straighten things out. It turns out that they had no record of the attempted transaction and suggested a communication error with Sushi Box's credit card processor (Heartland Payment Systems).

At this point I shrugged and took out some cash. The proprietress was visibly irritated and said that the credit card point-of-sale unit was brand new and the problem couldn't possibly be hers. \"Uh, OK,\" I thought to myself as I handed her the cash.

Then she said \"They charge me every time I swipe a card, and I swiped your card three times.\" Then she just stared at me. I realized she wanted me to give her money for having my card declined. I explained that whatever her arrangement with her credit card processor, things like that were just part of the cost of doing business and I wasn't going to pay her for swiping my card.

At this point, it was like a smashup on the side of the road: I just couldn't look away. So I asked: how much do they charge you to swipe a card?

I wanted to know how much money she was halfheartedly trying to extort from me. But she couldn't tell me, because she didn't know. At least, that's what she said. Evidently, she wanted me to slip her an indeterminate sum for her trouble.

Really: the sushi is good. I will go back, and so should you. But I recommend paying with a credit card for maximum entertainment.

In all seriousness, if the proprietress is so hung up on credit card fees, she should try Square or something along those lines. The fees are reasonable and customers generally like using it. This sort of penny-wise, pound-foolish management approach inspires longtime loyal customers to join Yelp specifically to complain about your restaurant, just as I've done. I wish Sushi Box well, and I hope someone helps the proprietress get over her unhealthy obsession with the cost of doing business: credit card fees and even non-reused sushi order forms are simply part of what happens in the American economy these days."}
{"text":"Absolutely appalling. We got an assortment of sushi (takeout) and every single piece was old, falling apart, and tasted fishy. We actually threw out most of it. I eat a lot of sushi, and I've been to dozens of places in Toronto. This is by far the worst."}
{"text":"Well made sushi, not expensive; always fresh.  Very friendly people and I actually like the casual decor.  They make orders out up quickly too!  Not a great place for a fancy date, but one of my favorites in Madison for the true sushi lover who isn't looking to make a big deal of their sushi dinner - they just crave solidly well done sushi."}
{"text":"The small little restaurant is always busy at lunch time.    But the service is always quick and done with a smile.    The sushi is reasonable priced.   They have ready boxes for customers to grab but also have made to order bento boxes     The food portions are decent.    I keep coming back"}
{"text":"Quick and reliable. 
Fair prices and also has great other options on the menu aside from the sushi - my favorite is the Tonkatsu with the stir fried veggies - reminds me of my mom's!"}
{"text":"I used to come regularly because of their good service and resonantly priced food. But after they changed their service staff, the service quality went downhill. The new staffs work slowly and regularly messed up the orders. There was one time the new staff charged me $20 more and she didn't notice until I pointed it out. The food still tastes okay, but I am really disappointed with their current service quality."}
{"text":"We have ate at the sushi box since it opened. The sushi is as good or better as the many other sushi restaurants we have eaten at in town. The owners are delightful. I highly recommend their jalapeno specialty roll -yum!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place downtown. The fish is fresh and you can choose from a large variety Already made. The line ups can be long but worth it due the neighbourhood. 

It's slightly expensive so it's not an everyday lunch place. 
Typical lunch costs about $14.

Still in my top ten lunch places"}
{"text":"Very very limited seating, especially during lunch hour.  Not suitable for group lunches. The food is descent, always have some kind of sale going on after 5PM. Compare to other sushi sources, this one's price is reasonable since you do get a fair portion of meat, salad, rice and sushi in the bento box combo."}
{"text":"Love the food. Very tasty.

Only problem I have is, sometimes it is not full-filling.
I sometimes have to get another sushi box to go with my meal.

Besides that, very good and fresh!

I come here more than once a week."}
{"text":"Besides serving freshly prepared to go sushi packages (with cute decorations), I like ordering bento box lunches from this place ($10 with tax). You get soup, salad, rice, two veggie rolls and a pile of meat of your choosing. 

On Fridays you get a little chocolate. And if you come here well after lunch hour, the friendly lady (owner?) will give you one of the sushi boxes for free.

Just a note - ask them to not drench your spicy chicken in ketchup or whatever sauce they pour on top."}
{"text":"Great family owned business.  Love the family - very nice and helpful.  Very reasonably priced.  You can watch your food being prepared on a TV.  My favorite is the Vegetable Tempura Don lunch special.  It is only $7 for a huge bowl of rice with a lightly sweet/savory sauce, a huge pile of thinly sliced vege tempura, and 2 pieces of avocado sushi. The calm, friendly atmosphere, delicious food, and prices brought me back again and again."}
{"text":"The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the ambience. This is not Takara or Muramoto, and it's not meant to be. I go here for take out when I want sushi that is better than the usual gas-station grade sushi you find at Copps. This is much fresher sushi than you find at the grocery store, on par with the more expensive restaurants in town, but at more reasonable take out prices. I highly recommend the Philadelphia rolls, they're delicious.

One thing that is very cool is that you can see your sushi being made on a flat screen TV."}
{"text":"Ever since we moved to Madison we have gone many times to Sushi Box and I though it was time for me to right a review. The atmosphere/ ambience is nice! I really like how you are able to see the chef prepare the sushi! The service is fine! The food really good the sushi is very and fresh and taste full there are also many options of deffrent types of sushi witch I like! If you are a sushi lover you should go to Sushi Box!"}
{"text":"Small homey restaurant. 
I love the unadon. The eel was tender and juicy. The rice was covered with soft scrambled eggs. Very fulfilling. 
Yellow tail roll was umami. The spring onions brought out the yellow tail's flavor. 
Tuna rolls were simple, but fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"We rolled into town during a snow storm and ended up across the street at a hotel.  What a bonus to have The Sushi Box across the street! My wife and I decided to stroll across the street. It was slow due to the snow which only made the experience better.  We had the entire restaurant to ourselves. Food was amazing. We had 5 rolls and a few pieces of sashimi.  None of the food disappointed us. We couldn't get enough!  Would definitely recommend and will visit again when back in Madison!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian sushi dinner last night. My family loves the avocado, cream cheese, and egg roll. My favorite is the asparagus roll. The green tea really hit the spot last night too."}
{"text":"I live just around the block so I grab sushi from this place often. What I noticed is that the sushi is more fresh in the morning and noon hours, afterwards it gets a little bit mushy but they do have a \"happy hour special\" in the evenings to get rid of the older sushi. I guess you get what you pay for. The owners are also super friendly.

My favourite is the salmon avocado roll and the free miso soup!! Overall this is a good place for a quick fix take out but not really a sit-down place to dine at."}
{"text":"Best Japanese in town. Having lived in Japan for two years, I know what great Japanese is. This is it!  Have the katsudon!!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand the negative reviews of this place.

It is super clean, tasty, cheap and the service is always friendly. On a side note, the lady at the front (owner?) doesn't speak fluent English, but unless you wanna go in here and talk about your future life plans, everything will be fine. She is lovely and gives additional freebies from time to time!

I've tried both their pre-made sushi and hot food for ordering (Vegetable Udon and Spicy Chicken Bento). Their sushi is really fresh, and the hot food is made quick which makes this a great spot for quick lunch grabs. Prices are reasonable and the quality exceeds expectations when considering the price. 

The only downside is that seating is very minimal. But I've heard that there will be outdoor seating once the weather warms up, which will double the seating capacity. Hooray!"}
{"text":"Came here while in town visiting a relative and wanting to get some sushi together.  This place was a huge disappointment.  The place was overpriced and left me with a not so fresh feeling.  I dont recall everything that I had, but when you spend money on sushi, which I have no problem doing, you expect to get what you paid for.  At this place I felt I would have been better off going to a local grocery store and getting some of their crap sushi, because at least then I would have wasted less money."}
{"text":"Was glad to see a sushi place right across the street from my hotel.  I had the tuna roll, tuna avocado  roll, and shrimp tempura and avocado roll.  The shrimp one was a little bland but okay.  The tuna ones were good, definitely a step above \"grocery store\" rolls.  I thought the rice they used was very good.  So I haven't tried a lot of menu items, but the ones I had were good.  And that was all I was really looking for!"}
{"text":"The sushi and the bento boxes are really good. I really like the chicken katsu-- it's crispy and not greasy at all. I got the katsu to go and I really appreciated that the katsu sauce was packed seperately. The takeout boxes are very convenient. Service is always great and friendly."}
{"text":"My top choice for take-out! Their Pork Katsu Bento box is my favourite that I have definitely ordered more then 10 times. It's $10 after tax, and really fast service when you call in to order 5 minutes ahead of time.

The Bento box comes with a large portion of Fried pork which is almost double the size of where other places offer and also a lot crispier, along with rice, salad, 2pc of veggie sushi, miso soup, and  some Korean clear noodles, it really is a big portion for the price you pay. Sometimes it comes with 2pc of Costco swiss chocolate too : )  

This review is solely on the Pork Katsu Bento Box, I haven't really tried their ready made sushis as I think it's a bit over-priced for the portions you get, but they do have the 20% off for those in the afternoon-night."}
{"text":"We traveled to Madison for a wedding and lucky for us, Sushi Box was right across the street from our hotel.  What a great find.  The food was excellent.  Several of us ordered different meals to include sushi, teriyaki chicken, fried rice and chicken yakisoba.  Large portions that allowed us to share meals.  The service was excellent and staff was very friendly.  Sure hope we have the opportunity to return to Madison again and to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their chirashi, bento boxes (get the stirfried veggies), and rolls. Way better than Sushi Muramoto! At lunch you can ask them to make you a seafood okonomiyaki (not the veggie version that is on the menu -- it is a type of savory pancake), which is delicious. The couple that run this place are super nice and friendly to the point that I feel like I'm visiting a relative's home."}
{"text":"UPDATE: As other reviews may have stated, the owners/management have changed and the quality and quantity of food has also gone down. If you're looking for decent priced sushi in the area, I'd recommend sushi shop in women's college hospital or places along Yonge St.


I come here for lunch when I don't pack one. The food and the portion you get for a bento box is worth the price. It's about $10-12~ for lunch for either a bento or two sushi boxes (depending on what you get). The quality is great and the service is fast."}
{"text":"This is a very casual, relatively quick sushi place. All made to order and very fresh. Not the fanciest but very reliable. We've been coming for years. Some of our favorites are the rainbow roll and jalapeño roll."}
{"text":"Very good sushi for an affordable price. I ate tofu with rice but my family had rolls and they said they were remarkable. The place itself could  be improved."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad review. The chirashi don and hamachi;salmon sashimi were the worst quality in my sushi experience. The cut of hamachi was odd including bloody part which usually got cut off when serving sashimi. The salmon sashimi had no shine; no sign of freshness, the texture were bad. So disappointed. We have not yet visit the restaurant and it was the first time ordered takeout from here."}
{"text":"first time here and had the tempura udon. very delicious and great portion size. service is super quick and definitely a great place to grab lunch"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my girlfriend, her sister, and a work buddy.  Had a good time overall!

Environment: 
I would say that the Sushi Box is somewhat like the Subway or Quiznos of Sushi. It's much more like a \"deli\" than a standard sitdown restaurant. I was a bit surprised for the first few seconds, but liked this feel after a few more moments here. The place grew one me. I will also mention, there is a cam aimed at the chef's station so you can watch your sushi being prepared on a TV in the dining area!

Food: 
BAE, BAE's sis, and I split a big order of sushi: a \"Sushi C\" combo (12pcs sushi, a tekka  roll, and a California roll), an additional scallop roll, a Fire Mountain roll, an Ebi-Maki  roll, and 2 pcs Tako sashimi.
- First off, the fish chunks on the nigiri sushi were generously sized! very pleased.5/5
- The sushi rice was good, not phenomenal, but pretty good. 4/5
- Best Ginger I've had! (I know its just a small part of the meal, but stood out) 5/5
- maki was so-so, but inexpensive. 3/5
- The egg on the egg nigiri seemed sweet. perfect texture too. 5/5
WorkBro ordered Chicken Ramen. He didn't leave positive or negative comment with the group though. :P

Service: 
One lady ran all the front-end stuff, took orders, did money handling, and ran out our orders. She was cordial, but not a micro-manager. :)

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Our go-to lunch spot when you need something quick and delicious.

All sushi boxes come with miso soup, with a range in prices from $6.95-$9.95. They have great daily specials ~ bento boxes for $9.95. The Chicken Katsu is delicious.

It gets very busy around 12:00pm so try to avoid the rush. Line usually moves very quickly."}
{"text":"The food is beautifully presented, and prepared with care. I would return with friends if we were in the area for lunch. 

The establishment is set up like self-service dining, where you order at a register, fill your own drinks at the fountain, and then bus your own table. However, both times I ate here the owner seemed to be proactive about clearing our table, and making sure we had a menu.

I would give 4 stars if the food was priced lower, the prices don't really match your dining experience (i.e. fast food / self-service). The food can also be over salted at times. I wouldn't order sushi here, but the bentos and entrees are occasionally worth the splurge if you're craving fried pork cutlet or a set meal ($12-15 per person, see uploaded photos) - you'll get a good portion of food, and it will be tasty."}
{"text":"A very nice little sushi joint on Bay Street. It has half priced sushi half price happy hour between 5-7 and the product always seems super fresh. Only catch is it is cash only."}
{"text":"I actually know the family that owns this restaurant. The family is one of the few long-standing Korean families in Madison and their daughter is a childhood friend. I remember I used to be really scared of her father (actually still am a litte). 

But memories aside. I love sushi and have become sort of sushi snob over the years (granted... this snobby attitude spills over to a lot of other areas in my life... ha). And in Madison, I won't willingly go anywhere for sushi except the 2 Muramotos. However, I will say that that my friend's father started this place after taking sushi classes and that he has improved his sushi rolling skills a LOT over the years. Anywho. I had sushi from this place b/c a bf brought some over once (I used to live like half a block away from here). So the verdict? I've had worse and I've definitely had better. But honestly, their sushi is nothing memorable and Muramoto is still #1 in my Madison book."}
{"text":"Miso soup was lousy and appears to be made from a powder. Soda fountain is obnoxiously labeled 'one free refill only,' even though the soda is extremely watered down. But I can't complain too much because the food was otherwise great all around. The donburi had a flavorful kick of spices and generous portions of beef (except maybe just a tiny bit too much ginger), while the sushi was surrounded by sticky but separate grains of soft and starchy rice. I especially enjoyed the eel, which was slightly sweet and not rubbery at all, and highly recommend the pickled radish. As an added bonus they keep Hello Panda cookies and Botan rice candy behind the counter, which are basically the best thing to come out of Japan since video games."}
{"text":"It is such a hidden gem with authentic Japanese food!

They have a pretty nice paitan ramen, even okonomiyaki from time to time! 

Also their donburis are alright, but it is one of the few places in town that serves donburi

***Bonus that they sell some Japanese beverages and snacks (??? Japanese sweets) as well by the counter!"}
{"text":"It's a take-out sushi type of place, great quality and authentic cozy atmosphere. I really enjoyed my experience there along with taking my partner for their first time having sushi. Vegetarian options are more than most sushi places and were really good. The kelp is a bit chewier and not as dry as most of the other places I've been in Madison. Its price-to-quality is excellent. Expect to pay less than most of the other places of similar quality. Great for takeout it seems, a lot of orders were waiting for pickup while we were there. The dining space is a bit limited but most people order take-out (delivery?) from here it seems so there is space available. Will definitely be taking my dad here some time."}
{"text":"This is a real nice sushi shop. Reminds me of places in Japan. Sauces are the best. Teriyaki chicken dish is well done. Presentation is excellent. They really want you to have a good meal and they take care of the details."}
{"text":"Our go to Japanese. The food's always fresh. We have visited this place several times over many years. Never have had a bad meal. The lady who serves is attentive, the chef is clean and u can actually watch him make your sushi!!!! Parking is difficult on the street but they have private parking in the back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I wish I could get here more often, but something always comes up when they are open.

I love their vegetarian/vegan sushi options, it's quite impressive when compared to all the other places in Madison...Sushi Box has more than the standard choices that every place in Madison has. This is the best place in town for sushi."}
{"text":"I almost walked out when I saw it was a self-serve type of restaurant. There were four of us and our bill came to $120. I guess we got a little carried away with all of the items on the menu.
Everything was incredibly fresh and delicious. I love the television screen where you can watch your sushi being made. Presentation was impressive and taste was even better! The owners were wonderful, helpful and hard working. I will be back, often!"}
{"text":"This is small, 3-4 table, Japanese takeout establishment. The sushi they serve here are mainly non-authentic (but tasty) sushi. The bento boxes here are about $10 after tax and has enough food to fill anyone! 

I tried the pork cutlet bento box. The cutlet didn't taste too oily. It was served over a bed of rice and a small portion of Korean noodles. There was also a small salad and three vegetable rolls that came with the bento. I really like the fact they put the salad dressing in a seperate container. Nothing ruins a salad than drenching it with dressing!

Overall, a great place to pick up a quick lunch on the go!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to take out sushi when I'm downtown or westside bound in Madison. The sushi has a perfect rice to non-rice ratio and the fish is always so fresh.  I love all of their Tuna rolls.

Don't be afraid of the location and decor, this place can compete with others in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Such great customer service and so fast too. Lots of different kinds of sushi and sides to choose from and they always give you miso. Great place to go when you're on a lunch time crunch!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner for the first time.., very quit I was the only customer which I don't mind and hey it's a Tuesday at 6pm. Ordered a Godzilla roll two pieces of shrimp tempura and a sweet potato tempura... Very good quality just a wee expensive but I don't mind I did just eat very fresh sushi in the Midwest... Ordering was kinda strange made it feel like fast food... Not a sit down kinda restaurant... Overall it was a good experience I will be going back"}
{"text":"My new favorite Japanese place in Madison! The sushi is fresh, service is fast, and prices are reasonable as well. 

I got a chirashi for 19.99 and it was so pretty and had a good and quantity of fish, and the amount of rice was just right - some places have too high of a rice to fish ratio. The chirashi included salmon, smoked salmon, red and white tuna, yellowtail, snapper, and octopus. My friend's order of chefs choice - 6 pieces of sushi and spicy tuna roll- also looked delicious. The spicy tuna roll isn't your average ground up tuna and rice either, it had whole pieces of fish, and cucumbers, scallions, and spicy sauce that was actually spicy. 

If you're looking for a more traditional, non-fusiony and no-frills Japanese restaurant with great food and service, this is the place to go. They have a menu with a lot of special rolls and hot entree options, so I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a long time. Highly recommend stoping for some excellent sushi and udon. The sushi was very fresh!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of sushi and was not impressed by anything here. I'm surprised by all the good reviews it received. I was here for dinner and tried the seaweed salad, 2 rolls, and hot sake. The seaweed salad was fine and the hot sake was average. The rolls left for more to be desired. You also order and pay before eating, cafeteria style. I left feeling hungry and disappointed. If you want good sushi in Madison you must check out Red Sushi on King st."}
{"text":"Cheap after work sushi!  20 percent off what's left after 5pm.

Sushi is made fresh, and most likely hadn't been sitting around much.

Their bento box is pretty darn good, and really enjoy their chicken katsu.

It's above discount Chinese sushi places but not quite better Japanese places.. but you're getting good value."}
{"text":"Cute little place - not amazing, trendy atmosphere but perfect sushi date spot. Sushi was good, not amazing but fresh, fast and definitely friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow I am a sushi expert and this was VERY FRESH and SUPER TASTY!
Choice of smoked or raw Salmon was nice.. VERY AUTHENTIC tasting!
YUMMMMMMMY Can I go everyday. It is worth the money to have a good meal that energizes your soul! 
THE BEST GREEN TEA EVER! If you are a tea freak like me it is worth it to get the Japanese Green Tea they serve here! 
The woman at the counter was very friendly to me and very talkative made me feel very at home not just at a restaurant. VERY helpful and attentive for serving yourself place!  
When you are coming off University Street make a right at the light that is at the corner where the place is and that is how you park in the back. I thought it was the back of where the sign was posted on the sidewalk. 
I want some more of that tea! She kept giving me hot water and I filled my cup 5 times it was such fine densely packed tea! 
GOOO NOW! Treat Yourself !"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for take-out, as it is quick and good. They have ready-made sushi boxes you can grab and go, and there's even 20% off after 5pm if you pay with cash. It also comes with free miso soup every time and sometimes a little piece of chocolate.

The bento boxes are $10 (including tax) and made to order too. The portion is pretty big and everything is fresh. The chicken teriyaki bento box is one of my favorites, as the meat is not dried out like many other Japanese restaurants. The katsu is also nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Good food. Relatively quick service. I visited twice and the owner(?) /cashier had a frown on her face the entire time. She might have cracked a smile after my second visit because I bussed my table myself. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Food is high quality and decently priced for a downtown location. The miso soup is amazing and is great that it is included with the price of a box of sushi. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place worth trying. I'm vegetarian so I can only speak for the vegetarian dishes but its tasty, fresh, and easy."}
{"text":"This is hands-down not only my favorite sushi spot, but my favorite restaurant anywhere. I live in Eau Claire, but came here all the time when I lived in Madison, and continue to stop by every chance I get (1-2x per month). I stop by enough that the couple knows me and my usual order. Service is always great, food is always fresh. I've never been dissatisfied with an order. Though I do not have any experience with dining in Japan, I do have several friends who have lived there tell me that Sushi Box is about as authentic as it gets for sushi in America (certainly in Madison, Wisconsin).

I am so sad that this coming Friday will be their last day before they retire. Do yourself a favor and stop by while you can!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Box's sushi; it is much fresher than a lot of other places' (say... Edo) and it is CHEAP.  $2.50 for a roll that would cost you $5 at Takara.  There are lots of vegetarian choices, including a make-your-own list of checkboxes, and the proprietor is the nicest lady.  I also really like their seaweed salad.  I used to get Sushi Box's food all the time, but I don't live in the neighborhood anymore, so it's been awhile."}
{"text":"This place is a sushi gem in Madison and is as close as you'll get to authentic sushi in the Midwest. For starters, it is actually owned and staffed by Japanese people. The rolls are not flashy and there aren't fancy sauces-it is just well done fresh fish. Prices tend to be a bit higher than other places in Madison but you get what you pay for and portions are larger. For good cheap sushi, Takara is good, for flashy rolls, go to Sushi Red, for upscale sushi, check out Sushi Muramoto but for a nice splurge on large cuts of \"Japanese style\" sushi, Sushi Box is your place!"}
{"text":"Ok. Expect little in the way of ambience. Expect a lot in the way of flavor. Yummy goodness in every bite. *she lies, they inhaled their sushi* Truly a gem of a find."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Madison.

I like the atmosphere, and I like the staff.  They are nice, and the sushi isn't too expensive.  Plus you get to watch them make it on a plasma screen tv."}
{"text":"Delightful staff. Great service and pleasant atmosphere. Excellent salmon and accompaniments in the bento box. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This place is FAST. Much of their food is laid out before you in large quantities (people just pick one out, pay, and leave in under 5 minutes). I love their bento box, especially the katsu one. Best of all, it is affordable. I would not recommend coming to sit down as space is limited sitting space. The quality of the sushi isnt the greatest but not the worst either. However, since they put so much out on display, you have to wonder how long the sushi was out there. Therefore what I like to do and would recommend is to come earlier for lunch (11am) if you want the freshest pick at the sushi :)"}
{"text":"We are regulars at Sushi Box. What our family loves about it is the wide variety of creative vegetarian options. Beyond the usual avocado and kampyo rolls, they have ACE (avocado-cream cheese-egg [tamago]), asparagus, mushroom, etc., and any combination thereof. Tofu Don is also wonderful, and the Oshonokanomiyaki (not sure if I got that name quite right) is super-delicious at weekday lunch--with interesting sauce(s?) over the top. We're not the ones to report on the actual seafood sushi, but for vegetarians, this is hands down the best sushi option in Madison."}
{"text":"Holy Value! Sushi is very well done and LARGE. A lunch with appetizer and bottled water cost around 10 bones. Very clean and comfortable. Elegant and simple in the Japanese tradition."}
{"text":"Cozy little place! Love the food here - it's consistently great. Fast, friendly service. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a Japanese food snob. This place wasn't exactly Japanese but it was pretty close. My only complaint was that it was expensive for what you get. Didn't realize there were lunch specials so i spent about $50 for lunch for three people. Mori soba, their version of Zaru soba, wasn't bad. Dragon roll was pretty good. Best thing was something they called tofudon. Never had that in Japan but it was tasty. If you go there for lunch, save a bunch of money and order from Their lunch special board out front."}
{"text":"GREAT quality, especially for the price! I choose sushi box over Muramoto any day because of the price, quick and friendly service, and great entree options. Not to mention great sushi! Highly recommend everything and anything on the menu, eat your fill of whatever Japanese food you fancy."}
{"text":"I've been coming this place about six years every time when I visit Madison because my hotel is across the street.
Their sushi is okay but price is bit high for this tiny and plastic dish sushi restaurant.
Some rolls amazed me as different way, it is not typical style. You will disappoint some rolls like Fire Mountain.
Their soda machine works weird, taste sweeter than regular products.
Their ramen was not great. I think people like their lunch menu because of the price."}
{"text":"The food is just wonderful. I've tried a lot of their items and not once was I disappointed. Sometimes at the end of the day they'll give you a side salad for free with other purchases. Side note: there's no AC (or at least they don't turn it on)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday since the regular prices seem a bit pricey. Tried a beef and chicken with rice dish. Portions were small and there was nothing special about either dish. Flavors were alright and we felt the beef was a little chewy. I would not come back for the rice dishes but the owners seemed nice and their sushi looked decent."}
{"text":"Who comes to Madison for Asian food? Wow! This find across the street from my hotel was a wonderful find! We all know that despite the reviews, the food in random places while traveling is \"iffy\" at best. Not this time! Super good and authentic! I got the chicken udon and it was absolutely delicious. I think the last review I submitted on Yelp involved an overly rich, sweet sauce over udon. Well this was not the case here! The portion of fresh vegetables in this dish was very generous. I asked for hot sauce and soy sauce just in case the flavor needed sprucing up, and the woman behind the counter had to scramble to get me a tiny little cup of hot sauce, and the soy sauce was in the back! Well, I know why they don't have the sauces handy- no one needs them! The original flavor is just perfect!"}
{"text":"I adore sushi box. The owners are so friendly and they have the freshest sushi rolls I've had in Madison. Philadelphia rolls are my favorite, I typically order a Philly roll whenever I get sushi. I have yet to find a Philly roll that is fresher or more delicious than Sushi Box's. I am seriously addicted!!! Sushi Box also has a unique roll called the Packer roll that I often order. It has string cheese, avocado, and egg. The restaurant is small but very clean and cozy. I love how they have a screen so you can watch the chef make your sushi. Cute idea!! Parking is kind of rough, but there is often ample street parking. I usually take my food to go and it is always ready and waiting for me when I arrive. I will keep returning again and again."}
{"text":"This cozy Japanese restaurant recently opened, and is a welcome addition to my lunchtime rotation.

Advertising its \"Grab 'N Go\" lunch (though they also seem to offer sit-down lunch and dinner), this establishment offers a variety of pre-packaged sushi (nigiri or maki) and california rolls, generally six pieces per tray. I ordered the spicy california rolls, and tuna maki, priced very reasonably at $4.50 each. I was happy with the size of the maki, and the flavour was good. Treated myself to a delicious wakame salad, too.

Miso soup is provided gratis, and the service was friendly and warm.

I'm always reluctant to buy pre-packaged sushi from places like Bento Nouveau, perhaps due to perceived lack of freshness/authenticity. Don't have that problem with this place, with two or three chefs buzzing behind the counter.

There's a lot of competition for Japanese food on Yonge St., but hopefully this place makes it on an otherwise dead strip of Bay. Not open on the weekends, so perhaps they're focusing on the office crowd."}
{"text":"As a regular customer, since I live in the condo upstairs, come to buy some sushi or order a Bibibang. The Sushi is the best in this area and 20% off after 5:00PM is a great deal. The owner is very friendly and generous. 

I definitely recommend this restaurant if you want to have lunch or dinner. Eat outside at noon is also enjoyable."}
{"text":"I stepped in for lunch and got yellowfin tuna nigiri sushi. That's the individual bites, not a roll. I took a chance on them, ordering two because they were a bit pricey at $3.30 per one piece, but each piece came with twice the amount of fish you would normally get. Very generous portions for nigiri sushi and high quality.

I also got the katsu don, a rice bowl topped with breaded and fried pork cutlet. It was excellent. It had a lot of veggies on top to give it more flavour. 

I got a complimentary bowl of white miso soup which was welcome.

While pricey, it is a good value and very tasty. My order was ready quickly."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing and I went there for years. Recently they changed suppliers and the fish is no longer as fresh. The quality has dropped and I hope they go back to their old supplier."}
{"text":"Just tired this place out recently, I absolutely loved it!! Amazing value for the price."}
{"text":"I actually think that their sushi is pretty decent...few recommendations....the eel sushi is awesome...so is the maki with green onions, shrimp and the spicy sauce. I think their teriyaki as well as the noodles are pretty good. I agree that their priced a little higher than what tey shd be.
I actually think that the owner lady seems not so friendly. I'd go here for lunch....def not dinner!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great food, easy going setting. Come as you are! Owner is super sweet. Been here nearly a dozen times, and it is consistently good. Yum!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls here are the average, but I highly admire their great service! I'm always greeted by the nice lady at the counter with her smile and politeness. One time she even offered me some chocolate! I would go there when I'm around and craving some affordable, daily sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I used to regularly come here because I work across the street, and the food had always been tasty, good portions and reasonably priced. Two weeks ago I was surprised to find new staff working the kitchen and cash register, and to learn that the portions for the chicken katsu (the item I normally get), had shrunk. The prices have not changed, and the food is still tasty and priced alright, but seeing new people (not a fan of change) and a smaller portion left me feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall good. Had pork ramen. Decent flavors. Not much meat. Hard boiled egg was just standard hard boiled egg... No fancy juices. 

Had musubi roll, which was what u expect and the fancier Cali which I dunno is worth the few dollars more than the regular Cali. Edamame were taken out directly from fridge and put on a plate for us. So it was cold and saltless. 

Three ramens. Two rolls. A couple drinks. And our bill was around $75, so that didn't feel worth it either, esp since it was just two adults and two little kiddos."}
{"text":"Good and cheap sushi.  Not the best, but if you're looking for a snack after work you can't beat their prices.  The chicken katsu is tasty and a very generous portion if you're hungry.  Was prepared fresh and quickly.  Their bento boxes are also a good value.

It's pretty small inside (could probably only seat about 10 or 12 people in total) with room for 8 more outside on the patio, so i'm guessing it's mostly a take-out place."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place. It's simple and satisfies your sushi cravings. Everything is very affordable and the owners are very nice."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful mom & pop sushi shop.  When they first opened I only lived a block away and I was there all the time.  This place may look unassuming, but they have good quality food at reasonable prices.  Their American Dream roll is still one of my favorite rolls.  

Eat there enough and they'll get to know you.  They're located near the UW hospital and get a fair number of customers who are visiting patients.  I remember number of years ago they added a menu item just for a family whose child was being treated at the hospital -  a little bit of home for a family who had been uprooted by disease.  

There are a couple of parking spots in back, but street parking isn't hard to find.  Stop in for something to go, or pull up a chair and watch the sushi being made on a TV screen in restaurant area."}
{"text":"I always ask for more salad dressing from this place. I really hope they sell their salad dressing in those 2L water bottles.


oh wait, it's a sushi place? Ok...I will come back for more reviews about their sushi later, promise."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have been there for countless times and their food is always great.
I enjoyed their lunch tonkatsu bento, which comes with freshly deep fried Katsu, salad, miso soup, and rice for less than $10.
Already packed sushi and many kind of appetizers are available with reasonable prices.
Very fast and friendly service, establishment is very clean, but limited seatings."}
{"text":"I stopped back at Sushi Box for a proper sushi dinner last night and I was thoroughly impressed. 

I sampled the unagi, inari, tuna and salmon sushi. They were all fantastic - great texture, temperature, color, and flavor. The Tuna was seriously dreamy. I also tried the shrimp and avocado roll and it was very tasty.

My one and only complaint would be the rice - it was sticking to the plate and falling apart, making it difficult to eat sometimes. But it really wasn't a big deal.

One thing I love about this place is that it isn't pretentious or super busy - many other sushi shops in town seem rather stuffy in comparison.

Overall this was probably the best sushi I have had in Madison to date and I will definitely be going back for more. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This is the McDonalds of Sushi.

AND YOU DO KNOW you like those McDonalds fries, right?  RIGHT?  So don't y'all get all hoity toighty on me.

The place is owned by THE SWEETEST couple, and if you introduce yourself to them (ok, they're my neighbours) they'll always remember you, and treat you like family.  

For me, I love their sushi, but I do have to disclose that I'm a veggie head, so give me spicy veggie tempura (there's something about deep fried food... aah) and I'm in heaven.  And a regular veggie roll is always good.    But if you want something complicated like unagi whatever (Ok, I like saying Unagi 'cause it reminds me of that Ross episode with the \"forseeing danger\" whatever, and I laugh), then I am not the person to review this.  I have heard that it's not the best (not bad, but not Ginza...) 

I do have a slight issue with their cost, I find it's a wee bit high given their food.  i.e.  I pay $8 for a veggie roll, when everywhere else (Ginza, etc) it's no more than $5.  But alas, that SVT is REALLY yummy, and given that I live less than a block away, well... its' a great place when I don't want to cook and want to just walk and get take out...."}
{"text":"Convenient, reasonably priced to-go sushi and korean food. The menu isn't expansive but they will make items on request if there isn't any left in the front case. The owners and really friendly."}
{"text":"I am by no means a sushi expert and I don't even like the stuff but my fiancee does.  She liked the sushi and I even had a California roll that tasted ok.  The beef teriyaki don was very good though.  The place was very clean and he emphasizes that by having a camera and tv that shows you when he makes the sushi."}
{"text":"While the TV thing was cool, and the sushi presentation was quite nice, it was probably some of the worst sushi I've ever eaten. The soda and water had a different taste to them, than what it's supposed to taste like, and they had no napkins. I was very disappointed."}
