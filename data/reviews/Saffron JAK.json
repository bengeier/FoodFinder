{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch to take home last week. I loved it. I had the chicken \"taco\" and a small salad and really enjoyed both. Bonus- they were playing the soundtrack to Guardians of the Galaxy which was perfect. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful comfortable restaurant for any age with a great selection of Persian food...loved the hummus platter and the tri-tip \"taco\"!  Brothers are friendly and helpful in explaining any dishes you wonder about, and it's just great in every way!!  Very happy to find it via Yelp!!"}
{"text":"absolutely awesome.  best burger. staff friendly and gave the table of 3 little boys a tour of the bread oven and brief history of the baking process. wonderful, already planning next trip back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect until I sunk my teeth into a slice of the Loaded Baked potato (LBP). Potato, bacon that was more like diced ham, chives, ranch, crispy crust, delicious food truck heaven! These guys know what good food is and their passion shows in the pizzas. Crispy sesame adds a toasty flavor to the sourdough crust. Amazing! Go find them. GO FIND THEM RIGHT NOW!! You're welcome."}
{"text":"I'd give them 10 stars if I could!  They recently catered an amazing evening for our son's rehersal dinner for 50 in Prescott, AZ.  From the first phonecall, Christina handled our event with such ease and confidence, putting all my worries and concerns to rest.    On the day of the event, Jayson and Christina arrived with the smaller truck and oven and magically created and displayed the most amazing food.   First, they put together a feast with the Chacurterie Platter which was filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, and handmade pickled and canned delights!   Then the deviled eggs (both varieties).....OMG, they disappeared in minutes!!!    Next, the pizza's started to appear and each creation was more amazing than the last!   The food was outstanding and our guests were delighted.   Jayson and Christina were so professional and worked effortlessly around our guests creating a beautiful, and casually elegant evening for the bride and groom.   This is an outstanding operation and my only regret is that we live on the East Coast and can now only dream of their wonderful pizzas!   We had a terrific experience.  Those of you in the Phoenix area have a real gem wth Saffron JAK!!!"}
{"text":"OK, let me just say that these pizza's are to die for. We had an LBP and a Margherita and oooooooh boy, am I happy to see their storefront location is literally 5 minutes from me because these pizza's are an absolute necessity!! The guys working the food truck are awesome; welcoming and attentive to each person. THANK YOU GUYS! We will definitely be back time and time again."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas! They were honestly the best pizza's I've ever had!! Highly recommend the baked potato you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Saffron JAK rocks my world!  Their unique pizzas are to die for. I love the creativity of their menus and freshness of their ingredients. Their one of a kind Persian sourdough flatbread is so delicious. I never feel guilty scarfing down an entire pizza!! In addition to the amazing food, the brothers who own it are such gems. Super friendly, accommodating and passionate about their food. Keep your eye out for their yellow food truck.....once you try it you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim and the whim turned into a WOW! The food was healthy, fresh, unique and delicious, not to mention reasonably priced yet oh so special. We had chicken \"tacos, a salad and a pizza and all were big hits. Think past the strip mall and you're in for a treat.  The giant oven is unique to our city. Saw the booth at Phx Public Market on Saturday and bought a scarf of the bread. The seller told us that it freezes well but one day later there was nothing left! It's good with peanut butter, hummus and to make wraps or sammies. Chewy yet a bit crisp when toasted, it's the perfect vehicle for anything yummy."}
{"text":"Food Truck FANTASTIC.   This truck stopped by my office today and I am so grateful. Awesome friendly people doing what they love!   $9 - 1/2 pizza and salad   Pizza - 5 star Salad - 10 star ... Simple salad but so much flavor. Spinach, cherry tomatoes, peppercinis, goat cheese with homemade spicy greek ranch dressing!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite small business in N Phoenix, Jayson and James are extremely friendly and definitely know how to welcome you to there bakery. The pizzas are simple but extraordinarily good. The best part is that any of their pizzas are offered frozen to take home and enjoy. I just picked up eight of them the other day to keep a stock in my freezer."}
{"text":"I went for the pizza. I decided on a meatball pizza they have listed on the wall. But they are out. They make them in the morning so if they are out, I am out of luck. How about the garlic. Also out. There may not be any more tomorrow so they will leave a note to make some. They recommended that I call before I go next time to see what's available. Nice people, but I'm sad I could not try the food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!!  My husband and I saw the reviews on line and wanted to try it.  You will not be disappointed in the least.  The flavors are fresh and for the most part, made from local and organic ingredients whenever possible.  I had the hummus platter.  Very yummy and filling.  My husband had the Tri Tip bowl.  I am not a huge beef eater but I wanted to lick the bowl after just one bite.  Also had the lentil soup.  Delish!!!!!!  Can't wait to go back.  My mouth waters with the thought"}
{"text":"On point.  Service is great. Food is quality. I don't ask for much more than that! I had the pizza and the hummus. Both as good as I've had here in the valley."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of experiencing all that is Saffron Jak a few weeks ago at a food truck Friday event. My 4 year old and I went up to order, and the gentleman working inside was very friendly and helpful. He took the time to offer kid's size options, and even engage with my daughter a bit. The pizzas came out hot, thin (yet still filling), and right at the perfect combination of cheesy and crunchy. I was very impressed with the quality and taste. I even love the personal touch of star-cut pepperoni.   I will definitely be looking out for this gourmet pizza kitchen on wheels at future food truck events!!"}
{"text":"Just wrapped up an amazing catered event by Saffron Jaks. We've eaten Persian food from many restaurants in many countries and I'm honored to have been served such an authentic meal and dessert. Their hospitality was incredible too. The presentation was super professional. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity last night to visit this new neighborhood spot with a girlfriend.  We were greeted by Charlie whom was extremely knowledgeable and assisted us in ordering. My girlfriend and I had never had Persian food before. We ended up spitting the Braised Herb Tri Tips which were excellent. The fresh spices and tender meat with the beans and saffron rice was so tender it melted in our mouths. We also split a veggie flatbread pizza which was amazing. The Sangak bread was delicious. Moe the chef surfaced and was a delight. Don't be turned off by the strip mall setting, because the food and price are well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best food truck in Arizona if you ask me! The owners are genuinely the nicest people on the planet! I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes pizza but wants to try a new twist on it!"}
{"text":"The only TRUE traditional sangak bakery in Arizona. The sangak is epic. The Ghoremeh Sabzi taco is amazing, you have to try the feta whip. Their hummus is the best in the valley. Now they haven't taken it even further and added a tomatillo hummus. These guys are top notch."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas. Get the Jumbojack or the BBQ chicken. You can taste the fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The attention to detail focusing on the food is unsurpassed. The most favorable burger I've had in ages. It was super moist and juicy. The chicken bowl was a perfect combination of tenderness, flavor, textures, protein, carbs, colors, and all that comes with your choice of a side. We chose the hummus as our side and it was thick, classic and perfectly textured. This is not a smooth runny hummus. Oh no. Instead it's an authentic, \"old school\" textured hummus. But without question the best part is the manager/owner (I neglected to get his name but he parks his Harley on the sidewalk). He clearly has a passion for his craft. I enjoyed his interaction with another customer as he offered her a side of truffle oil for her pizza; he explained this earthy condiment with such passion. I can't wait to try the pizzas."}
{"text":"We have tried here numerous times. Each time there is an issue but their customer service helps smooth it. The wrong item (2 times), missing items (3 times) not being ready in the quoted time (every time). Finally after spending $50 plus tip for take out for 2 people. It is very frustrating to say the least. We received the driest saddest pizza I have seen since a roommates left out Domino's thin crust pizza all weekend on the counter tonight. We are done making excuses for them. It was inedible and a complete waste of $9. The food can be awesome when your order is right...the people try to take care of you but if the order is correct this never comes into play."}
{"text":"What a place!! The food is AMAZING! The owners are the absolute nicest people. It was my first time so I tried a few different things, everything exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Super thin crust and very fresh. I love the Super Greeky. They put just the right amount of toppings and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Great new find. Excellent food, reasonable prices and the staff is extremely friendly. Can't wait to go back. A fun twist on Persian food. Casual counter service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything was delicious and fresh... literally from their garden. Highly highly recommend this friendly little place!!"}
{"text":"We used this food truck for catering a few weeks ago. They arrived early (after asking permission), set up quick, managed food between indoors and outdoors, had everything ready to go when guests arrived. The brothers were social with the guests when approached but not overly, the food was fantastic!!! Every time I got near a flat bread, it had already been picked clean by the guests. They cleaned everything up, disappeared without a trace. Thanks for making the evening a success! I can't wait to try your restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is awesome, and the staff is cool, too! I'll be back here again and again."}
{"text":"There are not very many family owned restaurants around this part of town and these two brothers definitely have this place a rockin'. Great tasting fresh and fun food with friendly service and their top secret delicious Persian Sangak Flatbread pulling it all together.  My wife and I both stopped in here after hearing about this place from a good Yelp friend Pepper T. She has really good reviews so we knew what to expect. Plus our Grandkids live right around the corner and they have been here a few times as well. Nice!  These guys are known for their yummy Food Truck in town and they decided to set up a base camp at this location. We had a fun talk with Jayson who is one of the owners on our first trip here and he was so excited about what they are doing.   Ordered two Koobideh Tacos and a Pepperoni Pizza on our first visit. The layers of flavors and the freshness of all the ingredients were amazing. On our next visit we tried the Braised Tri-tip Taco and a Roasted Garlic and Shroom Pizza. The Tri-tip was so tender and juicy and just melted in our mouths. The Pizzas on their Sangak Bread are to die for and we recommend trying one.   The menu here is very simple and very fresh. Everything we tried was delicious and got us both already thinking about what we would get next time. They also have Persian Rice Bowls, Saffron Chicken Salads, Veggie Dishes, Persian Burgers as well as several sides and Appetizers. You can also just buy the bread they make and bring it home for later.  This places is so good that it will be added to our rotation of really tasty and super friendly restaurants near our house. It is always nice to see family owned local establishments that can create some new energy in the area and with the passion these dudes have there is no doubt that will be quite successful.  See ya there on Saturdays for an early lunch. PARTY IN MY MOUTH!  5 STARS"}
{"text":"Pizza just doesn't feel like the right word to describe the thin and crispy deliciousity of these flatbreads.  The focus here isn't on some big hunk of bread -- rather, it's on the creative combination and liberal application of their toppings.  The prices are perfect for what we're getting.  And the owners are super cool guys.  My fave so far is the Super Greeky -- a little spicy, a little salty ,and just a tad bit of sweet.  Score!"}
{"text":"I didn't have them today- but I have had them in the past. They serve a decent pizza for a food truck and the price is solid. Not really much else to say beyond that. A few friends had some of their other varieties and said they were ok but the pepperoni shaped as \"stars\" which is unique? I guess?  They also serve a BLT wrap which I was advised was pretty good."}
{"text":"Lentil soup yummy. Whipped feta delish. GRAM pizza very good. Excellent and friendly service. Stubborn soda options very good."}
{"text":"What an amazing concept! When you top the Persian Sangak bread with fresh quality ingredients and turn it to heavenly pizza! I just saw the food truck and figured I needed to try. Clean kitchen, quick service and friendly staff; exceeded my expectations! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I often end up sharing a pepperoni pizza w/my SO while drinking at Sidebar. While I may or may not be intoxicated while eating said pizza, I swear, it is so dang delicious every time. There's something magical about the flatbread they use. I once asked the bartender to leave it uncut so I could just roll it up & eat it like a burrito.  I didn't regret it."}
{"text":"The owners are friendly and eager to inform customers about the items on the menu. We have enjoyed everything we've eaten. I really love the bread they bake."}
{"text":"We are fairly new to the area and coming from a different state, quality of food in Phoenix is different.  This place is hands down #1 in quality of food and customer service. I'm so happy we ate here today.  We were able to meet and get to know the owner. Very friendly and helpful with telling us about what we can do to modify our food, telling us his family story and memories.   We had the hummus platter, Persian Taco, our own individual pizzas. All fresh, delicious and filling. The watermelon water was amazing.  We will order/dine here often!!!"}
{"text":"2 things I like about this place: the quality and the hospitality. I have been to this place, multiple times, since I moved here in August, 2017. Although, the restaurant was a bit remodeled, but the food quality has been always good. Their prices are great for their portions. I do like their beef plates more their chicken ones. But, overall, 0% disappointment. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Persian food! Ordered take out and was very satisfied! The service was great and food is full of flavor!"}
{"text":"We love to have the sangak bread in our freezer at home. It's great to top and make a quick home made pizza...fast, easy and delish! And the restaurant food is delish too. I just had a Persian Burger and it was SUPER juicy! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I googled for restaurants in this area and of the many that popped up Saffron JAK looked the most original and the cleanest (I looked up their inspections and they got two A ratings in within the last four months) so I decided to give them a try. I couldn't be happier with my decision. Despite being extremely busy and short staffed due to illness, the cook was super helpful, friendly and answered my questions. The food came out quickly and it was nothing short of amazing. The kebab was moist but not undercooked and well seasoned. The Shiraz salad was made of fresh veggies and was a perfect complement to the rice. A row of grilled cherry tomatoes was an unexpected surprise and a nice touch.   I'm not a serial reviewer so it takes a lot to get me to write a review but Saffron JAK was too good not to."}
{"text":"If they ran a double blind control study using the bread from here and from Iran, nobody would be able to taste the difference.   Well worth the drive to grab some of the bread.  Food is great, not the most authentic Persian cuisine but it has all the perks that make it great.  Staff and service is great,  you get that genuine Persian Taroff gestures when you walk in."}
{"text":"I've had Saffron JAK approximately 8 times in the last 2 weeks. No joke. The buffalo chicken, the hatch green chili and potato, the throw down, bread pudding...I swear, my body runs on this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down best food in the north valley. Everything we have tried has been beyond delicious. My husband loves the Persian burger!"}
{"text":"I am so impressed. I moved into a new neighborhood and have been trying restaurants to find the gems. This is the #1, I will be craving the food constantly. The Sangak bread is light, chewy, and has wonderful stone ground whole wheat flavor. Perfect! I ordered the Koobideh bowl and it was delicious, the saffron rice what light and fluffy and grilled vegetables pulled it all together. I am so impressed and will be eating here as much as possible. I can't wait to try the pizza on Sangak!"}
{"text":"Saffron Jak is all about the love and respect. Love of family and respect for food traditions, love of flavor, love of experimentation and definitely love and respect for the customer. So many businesses forget that one. Not here.   The menu is small and I like that. Big menus scare me. I never feel like a place can do everything right when the menu is too ambitious. Each dish here is special. From the lightly charred cherry tomatoes that pop in your mouth to the creamy salty feta whip that goes with everything on the menu. And there is something for everyone in the group. Pizza, chicken, beef, and veggies.   Now they don't have a secret menu but they do have a \"in the know\" menu. So now I'm telling you and you too are in the know. Ask them what they are pickiling or jamming that week and they will be sure to have some tasty treat for you. On the day we were there we got to try some killer pickles and grape dust yes grape dust. The pickles were my idea of perfection. Crunchy and alive with dill. Not too sour yet not sweet. And the grape dust well lets just say if Phoenix Haboobs were made of this dust we would welcome them. These guys took the grape skins leftover from making jam and turned them into dust. They have a waste not want not philosophy that in this day of horrific food waste soothes my soul. Jaymes you made my day! I had come all the way from Prescott to see what this Stonebread Cafe was all about. I came for the food and left with so much more. I left with the love of two brothers and their staff dishing it out in style. So do yourself a favor and go get yourself some love on a stonebread. Oh and they cater too. Just ask them for ideas they are bursting with them"}
{"text":"Had the chance to drop in and check out saffron Jak. Quaint little location in super busy strip mall, not a lot of seating and the seating is cramped so you may want to order out versus dining in. I ordered the lamb burger and it was pretty delicious, I would say yes to ordering it again next time I am in the north part of town."}
{"text":"Soooooo good!! I've eaten at the restaurant and food truck and both are delicious. The flat bread tacos are so good and the pizza is super tasty. If they have the watermelon lemonade available, try it for sure! The flavor combinations leave your mouth watering, so so good!!"}
{"text":"**************************Gem Alert*********************************  A new favorite that's very unique and special!  Saffron Jak is a small casual not too fancy order-at-the-counter cafe that prepares Persian Food and Persian Stone or Pebble Flat Bread (known as Sangak Bread) with a sort of American Twist. You have your choice of ordering your food as a rice bowl, a taco or a Pizza.  I ordered the Saffron Chicken Rice Bowl. It wasn't actually in a bowl but on a plate...The thigh meat was DELICIOUS flavorful and moist. My plate was nicely detailed with fluffy rice, grilled onions, sweet red pepper, delicious Persian Stone Bread and one side that I picked that was really awesome unique FETA WHIP. The flavors were really off the charts here. The chicken was great on it's own but as I ate I hit treasure of a creamy tehini sauce that really made the chicken burst with flavor. The creamy FETA WHIP was not tangy but almost like Feta whipped butter. It was really special and very VERY YUM!!!!!!!  Prices are low and my husband couldn't decide between the Tri Tip Bowl and the Koobideh Taco so he got them BOTH!  The Tri Tip was moist flavorful Persian Spiced Beef with herbs and Beans over fluffy rice, a side of delicious Shirazi Salad and Persian Stone Bread. The Koobideh Taco is served on Persian Stone Bread and the main filling is a beef Koobideh that is basically an elongated beef meatball with Persian Seasonings.  All the food we tried was extremely delicious. The people working there couldn't be any nicer and were very friendly and hospitable.  I am having lots of trouble deciding on 4-5 stars....as I couldn't be more pleased... (the 4 would be for being a casual eatery)  Prices are low. Portions are large. Food couldn't be more delicious and the people working there couldn't be more hospitable.  4.5 stars  Local Gem"}
{"text":"Coming out of New York, I've tasted a wide range of pizza styles.  I know good pizza when I eat it.  I've come late to the Saffron Jak party, but this is one gourmet food truck that you should seek out.  They serve up a whole slew of thin-crust gourmet pies, with non-standard spices, sauces, and toppings.  One of my favorites is the Super Greeky, which features (among other things) feta cheese and black olives, which I tend to avoid.  HOWEVER, on this pizza, they were part of a mosaic of tastes that really excited my palate.    Saffron Jak is one of the food trucks that - if the universe is fair - will stay around for a very long time.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"MY TASTE BUDS WANT MORE... I was just at the Grand Opening of Salon D'Shayn in which Saffron JAK catered. MY GAWD, everything was utterly divine and it was such a great collection of flavors for every taste bud. The smokey butternut squash arancini rolled in coconut dust, topped with coconut curry sauce and cilantro melted in my mouth with such a an artistic taste of flavors. The Creme Brulee Stuffed Eggs...who knew I would be craving such a delicious treat. There was so much goodness! I want to go to parties catered by such savory, luscious and choice food. Anyone who needs expert catering with a friendly smile should consider this tasty morsel we are lucky enough to have in the valley! CONGRATS, Saffron JAK...I am now a follower and fan!"}
{"text":"Love the food trucks here in AZ and always try to support local business. Have wanted to try Saffron JAK, and was so happy when they were in my area. Awesome cool vibe from the guys. They know their food stuff!  Great menu selection. They even made something for me off their menu for the night, the SAM. Let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS!  Will definitely track these guys down again, and you should too!"}
{"text":"Celebrating my husbands retirement party / birthday.  Saffron JAK was the very best in customer service! I hired two food trucks, one cancelled the day before the party for \"mechanical\" issues and Saffron Jak said not to worry, they could handle my crowed. I did end up getting another last minute truck that was a total disaster and was stressing me out. Saffron JAK staff was amazing and they kept making sure me and my guest were doing good.  They communicated with me all night and the pizza's were fantastic!!  I was so pleased with them.  I had a nightmare with the other truck and with Saffron JAX the party would not have turned out as successful as it did.  I would HIGHLY recommend going with a truck that has a back up plan should anything go wrong with the truck and this company does have a back up plan as well.  Go with them, they are great!!!!"}
{"text":"Exciting to have a cafe like this near my mother's home. Wonderful fresh flat bread, hummus, grilled chicken etc etc. Saw lots of people happily picking up the bread. Very attentive, energized owners/operators made it even better. If I lived here I'd be a regular patron."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today and enjoyed a 1/2lb burger. It was amazing. So juicy and plump. Plus it included onions cooked into the burger and delicious feta whip on a bun. The flavor was superb. I also enjoyed giant order of sangak persian bread, which my friend and I couldn't finish it was so huge! Love the food at this place. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I cannot express how amazing this place is.  It is so nice to finally eat REALY FRESH food in this city!!!  I am from NYC and my hubby is from Italy and the food experience in Phoenix has been less than pleasurable until we found Saffron Jack's!! Thank you thank you thank you.  We for sure will be back!"}
{"text":"The hummus is the best I've ever tasted in the states! And the bread they make in house is not to be missed! The employees are super sweet and very friendly. It's in the weirdest, dirtiest strip mall but don't let that deter you from going in. The decor leaves a lot to be desired but honestly who cares? It's the food and staff that makes a restaurant great. I've only gotten take out or delivery and every time it's great. Tip: the bread is huge and doesn't stay good for long so eat up- plan to eat it was and for every meal for as long as you can. Carb up!"}
{"text":"You had me at try this bread! We went to Phoenix Open Air Market and tried their amazing sangam bread. It is so well textured and chewy. With a dollop of hummus it's perfect. We couldn't buy a loaf because we were traveling out of town, but that didn't keep us from visiting their new cafe for dinner! The bread is amazing as a pizza base. We had the saffron chicken pizza and Bill Murray meatball with some watermelon water. The Bill Murray like he man himself was awesome. I plan to eat here all.the.time!!!"}
{"text":"They Have the Best Pizza   this place  is  a home aways from Home  special  Place  love everything abt it...  The Brothers  are very nice and they take time to each tell you  stories  of their adventure   where they started and how they got  here .  My Husband and I  have to eat here at least once a week    If you havent been  your missing a special place    for me id start with the Pizza and go from their  ENJOY"}
{"text":"Super flavorful! Had the burger, even my kids loved it. Teri tip bowl was super good. Cuke yogurt was yummy. Got a pizza to go!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and was SO happy with the whole experience! Fast friendly service, and the food was absolutely phenomenal. Had the koobideh taco, which was flawless. Hubby had the pepperoni pizza and really enjoyed it. Was too full to try dessert but was especially tempted by the macaroons and the bread pudding. Will make this a regular stop for sure!"}
{"text":"A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!!  Kicking myself for taking so long to try out Saffron JAK restaurant. I live a couple miles away, and kept seeing the sign for it. Finally stopped by to grab lunch (to-go) since I had to go home on my lunch break. Ordered the Persian New Year flatbread pizza, and then baklava for dessert. While waiting for my food, the gentleman at the restaurant was telling me more about the restaurant history and food favorites. He even let me sample the Feta Whip and Hummus. OMG...will be ordering those on future trips! The hummus had just the right amount of garlic/onion flavors. The feta whip was so good!   Even though I ordered the food to-go, I saw that the restaurant was very clean. They take great care to provide a wonderful experience for their customers. When I got home to enjoy my lunch, it was still piping hot and so good! The saffron chicken on my pizza had such a great flavor. Perfect combination with the red bell peppers and feta cheese. Now my mission is to find their food truck and enjoy some more pizza!  This will be my new go to restaurant when I have friends/family visiting me. Thank you for a delicious meal and great hospitality!"}
{"text":"Unreal. Amazing service and the food was incredible. I can't wait to come back. The saffron chicken was to die for."}
{"text":"The food and service here is the best. My wife and I dine here regularly and always very much enjoy the food. They obviously use very fresh veggies and spices that makes the various dishes just incredible. I eat primarily vegetarian and my wife likes both chicken and beef dishes so we have tried a variety of items on their menu. Very healthy style cooking. The pizza they make on the Sangak bread, which we have taken home, is also great. The owners and staff are all always friendly and professional, and the dining area is very comfortable.. This is one restaurant where i always take any leftovers home, the food is that great."}
{"text":"L.B.P (Loaded Baked Potato pizza)....you have revived my faith in food truck fare. I can honestly say this is the best food truck I've visited.   After having several unpleasant lunchtime excursions to the parking lot (my office building has started having Food Truck Wednesdays) today I announced that I would go to NO MORE FOOD TRUCKS if this one didn't work out.   Saffron JAK's Loaded Baked Potato flatbread has *virtually* erased all of those bad memories...It was perfection.   The yoghurt sour cream, thick cut bacon ends, chives, cheese, and delectably soft potato pieces on top of that oh-so-slightly-yet-perfectly charred pizza stone fired sangak flatbread makes me really regret only getting a 1/2 order. I washed it down with a bottle of mexiCoke and now I'm on my way to polishing off hump day with a smile on my face...  Yes, seriously, a Coke and a smile."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim yesterday and I cannot say enough good things about it! Such friendly service and great food! I absolutely love the fact that they experiment with ZERO waste ideas. It is such a fresh idea for new foods. I had the hummus platter that came with FRESH grown veggies and also had the new year pizza. Definitely recommend this gem to anyone looking to try something new!"}
{"text":"One word...Fresh. Fresh, fresh, fresh. And flavorful. And affordable. This is a special find, tucked back in a strip mall off of 7th st and Union Hills. I have tried a pizza and a taco and I'm excited to come back again and try something new. The Bill Murray pizza is delicious. And the Koobideh taco is not to be missed. One thing to note...there isn't a soda machine. There's bottled soda and watermelon water in a refrigerated case if you want to purchase. Otherwise, water is made available for free. Not a deal breaker at all. Oh...I almost forgot the hummus and sangak chips. Mmmmm. Give this a try and you will be back for more."}
{"text":"I've used Saffron Jak twice now and been at events with them as well and it's time I write a review!  This past weekend, they catered an event for just over 170 people and it was amazing! From the preliminary work with their catering manager, Christina, to the clean up, it was flawless. The food setup and decor is beautiful. The mason jars filled with whatever colorful fruits and veggies they bring to the displays on long wood cutting boards, it's all beautiful.   Jayson  and Jaymes are amazing! Their passion for what they do is evident!  The food is almost indescribable! The homemade hummus, jams, salad dressings and yogurt dips are are like nothing I've ever tasted. You can tell it is all fresh and homemade. The pizzas are to die for! We had super Greeky a margarita and a mushroom (can't remember name), as it was a veggie  affair. They couldn't place it out fast enough!   Thank you for helping me put on an amazing event! Check these guys out, you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"Seriously these guys are the best. Love all of them. They have an extremely love of food and it shows. Everything they make is amazing. The Persian burger may be the best burger I've ever had.  Gotta be in my top 5 restaurants in AZ and definitely my favorite people. They will have something you will love I guarantee it."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! I crave the veggie bowls, love the veggie tacos and pizza is amazing as well."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed lunch here and its my new favorite! I had the veggie taco, house salad and watermelon water. I also had a taste of my co-worker's mushroom/garlic pizza and feta whip and it was also great! Best lunch we've had in a long time! We'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place from yelp reviews . Maybe the food truck location is amazing but the restaurant not so hot . Bread was hard , koobideh dry lacking flavor . Bowl was not good portion size . Nothing I would recommend or frequent again ."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try this place since it opened near my neighborhood and I was not disappointed! The pepperoni pizza was yummy, the bread it's on is light and soft but firm enough to hold up the toppings. I also tried the saffron chicken bowl. The chicken was grilled perfectly, flavorful and moist. I ordered the salad as the side and it was delicious! The portions are generous and I'll definitely be back to try more!!!   Ok, UPDATE! I have been back twice since my first order and SO good! The pizzas are craveworthy! Oh and the lentil soup is flavorful, smooth and hits the spot - despite the 100+ degree heat outside!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING PIZZA!!!! Warning; Once you visit Saffron Jaks you will have cravings for them so be careful!!!!  We will be having them at our wedding and we cannot be more thrilled!!!!"}
{"text":"I have pretty much stopped doing food trucks because I constantly feel like I'm getting ripped off.  $13 grilled cheese sandwiches that I could duplicate with 2 slices of white bread and Velveeta?  $15 mediocre burgers that look only marginally more robust than a fast food $1 menu item?  Forget it.    But not on the Saffron Jak pizza truck!   I was hesitant to try pizza from a food truck (or a food truck at all), but I am really glad I did.   This is the first food truck I have patronized where I really felt like I got my money's worth.  The \"Super Greeky\", which is Kalamata olives, mild banana type peppers, cherry tomato, dates and bulgarian feta is about 12\" x 6\".   That's ample for me.   On Saffron Jak's Persian wheat sourdough crust, the Super Greeky was frankly amazing.   Really popping with flavor and that thin crust gave it a nice crunch.  The service was quick, friendly and the truck was clean.    As food trucks go, I would highly recommend Saffron Jak's Pizza Truck.  If you happen to see them around, give them a try!  Now that I know there's a brick and mortar restaurant too, I'm also looking forward to stopping by."}
{"text":"This food truck is one of my favorites in town. They know how to make a darn good pizza.   I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. It was basically chicken and cheese with BBQ sauce instead of tomato sauce. Simple but the flavor was there. The crust is cracker-crispy but not too hard, just the right amount of crisp. I would have liked just a touch more sauce on my pizza though, or maybe a little extra on the side for dipping? Regardless, I managed to eat the whole thing.  The guys working in the truck were super nice too. My friends order got messed up so we ended up waiting a long time but they made him a new pizza and even gave him a card to get a free pizza next time which was cool.   I'll definitely get another pizza the next time this truck cruises by my work."}
{"text":"I just visited for the first time and will go back soon.    The food and service is excellent! And the owner is a pleasure to talk to.  He is so excited and passionate about his food, restaurant and his food truck.  The restaurant serves Persian staples and pizza.  An interesting combination but it works.    It is a fast casual restaurant where you order at the counter and served at the tables.  We had the grilled chicken rice bowl which was flavored with middle eastern spices.  It comes with a small side and is served on a bed of saffron flavored basmati rice.  We also ordered the Bill Murray pizza that has sliced meatballs on top of their unique sangak that is baked in-house.    As we were leaving we could not resist and bought several macaroons to take home to eat later.  Several flavors to choose from but I can attest that the Bavarian chocolate cream is delicious.  Nice restaurant to try if your are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! I have only had the stone ground pizzas which I cannot get enough of! My 10 year old daughter agrees, she loves how crispy the crust is. Not to mention they have take and bakes!! I've also enjoyed their hummus which is the best I've ever had. I can't wait to try one of their other plates. The staff is so friendly and give great options and substitution recommendations. You have to come out and try this place!!"}
{"text":"Friendly amazing service with arguably the best Persian food in the valley. Koobideh was flavorful and cooked perfectly along with the rice that was fluffy and tender. It was served with a side of bread that had great flavor. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This was the best place for Sangak bread i've ever seen in states. Food is fairly good I had a bowl of chicken with rice and greek salad. I did like their service better, the guy was very friendly and caring. Overall recommended for first try!"}
{"text":"I've known these dudes forever but they deserve their five star rating. Crunchy, delicious and creative pizzas with options for everyone. Catering is very legit as well. Thanks boys!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the last 6 weeks(and I usually eat out twice a week...) and I have yet to be disappointed by anything. I would give a recommendation but I'm pretty confident whatever you get here you'll be happy with. And their bread is some of the best bread I've ever had in my life. Takes flatbread to a new level"}
{"text":"Every time I get pizza from Saffron Jak I tell myself I won't eat the whole thing, that I'm going to just eat a few pieces and save the rest for another time but I have yet to be able to accomplish that goal... I have so far tried the Pepperoni, BBQ Chicken and the Buffalo Chicken pizzas and all of them have been delicious.  You can definitely tell the quality of ingredients is excellent and that they work hard to come up with new and interesting flavor combinations.  They also change up their specialty menu frequently so they could have a new offering each time you go.  I myself will definitely be returning to try and sample all of the amazing options they have!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and close by, my husband and I have made multiple visits. The Persian version of chicken tacos are great; moist flavorful chicken in an interesting sauce. The beef is also an excellent choice. On my last visit, I ordered the burger, something fairly ordinary and not something I would normally choose when not at home. It was a decent burger (it's hard to ruin a burger) but the feta spread was to die for. My only complaint was it was too big and I had to leave some of the meat. I did, however, scrape up every tiny bit of the feta whip. They sell it separately so  I may just have to bring some home and eat it with a spoon when no one is looking. :)"}
{"text":"This truck stopped by my office, and the piping hot pizza was perfect for a chilly rainy day!  I got the oversized pepperoni pizza and they were shaped like hearts and stars - cute touch! :) Loved the thin crust and the cheese tasted super fresh. I obviously ate the whole thing and I'm not even ashamed to admit it! :P  5/5 - Hope to see this truck again soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely mind blowing fresh, delicious food! The old family recipes add flair to traditional dishes."}
{"text":"This on of the best food trucks I have been too! I like it because it is unique. It not your come get a slice. They actually put time into configuring awesome ingredients and flavors. Also, Phoenix is huge but they travel to all different location. Honestly though it is not just the food, it's the service. They are all very friendly and always very appreciative  of all their customers. Anyways, I high suggest them."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Had to opportunity to meet them at the Berridge Nursery \"Art int he Garden\". The guys are so fun and nice and passionate about their food - its really exciting when they are excited about their ingredients. I even got to try a piece of their fried cheese while I was just standing around.   All of the pizzas are creative, original and fun. I wish I tried the eggs benny pizza but we had the one with the ham and strawberry pepper jam (can't remember the exact names). I cannot wait to come across this truck on another day and try everything.   It would be a blast to get a bunch of people together and share everything so I can try everything at once...any takers? Either way I am excited for this truck to be around for a while and hope to see other creations coming out of their kitchen. Do they cater -how awesome would that be!"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos are amazing!   I crave it weekly.  You have to a whole bite that gets the bread rice meat and veggies all in one mouthful."}
{"text":"Check this place out the bread is amazing! Hummus is really good also! This place is a twist on Mediterranean and glad they make their own bread!"}
{"text":"If your looking for one of those great  neighborhood hole in the wall places, this is it. It a family run place and everything I've had so far is delicious. I can't wait for my next visit so I can try the Lamb Burger."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my local CVS manager. He said they have amazing hummus and a huge bread for like $4. Being that I am a sucker for good hummus and great prices my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out. We specifically made a point to go Tuesday after work (they are closed Sunday and Monday). Customer service was great, bought a large hummus and a huge flat bread, I think the total was less than $9. The gentleman helping us even allowed us to sample the sodas they have, which were also really good. I must say this loud and clear, THIS HUMMUS IS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD!! My fridge will remain consistently stocked with this stuff."}
{"text":"Tried them today at the Tempe Farmer's Sunday market (under the bridge) - amazing, and I love the bread - I talked to one of the brothers for a bit today, about their long term plans and right now they are doing the food truck and then stage 2 is opening a bakery to make the Persian flat bread they use for the pizzas - it has to be made in a special oven and right now they have to go to California to get it - wonderful consistency and it contains sesame seed flour which you can taste a hint of in the bread. Much of their ingredients are straight from the vendors at the market - for example, my market (vegi) pizza had fresh basil on it right from one of the vendors - it was amazing!   I think we will see big things from these guys so make it out to the Tempe Community Sunday market and support your local producers and try their pizza for a late breakfast or an early lunch!"}
{"text":"I was to 15 min for my pizza... 30 min later they call my name and tell me they can't fill my order. Goodbye lunch hour."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! I ordered the hummus platter to go as a quick snack and was pleasantly surprised when I got home to see the beautiful spread of veggies. Great presentation with a wide array of vegetable options. It included their bread, Persian cucumbers, fresh carrots, two varieties of radishes, olives, almonds, and apples along with hummus of course; simply delicious. Very fresh!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor profile and the signature flat bread (sangnak) is great with the house made pizzas as well as the Persian 'tacos' full of saffron rice, vegetables and several meat filling options.  We were eating in so they surprised us with a little taste of lentil soup that was not even on the menu, it came with a slice of lemon to squeeze on and bread cracker for dipping. The soup was very flavorful with good texture, would be great in the winter for cold desert day, something we are still dreaming about as the temps are still in the high 90's at the end of September.  Will definitely be back to try the hummus as well as well as some other menu items.  The two brothers also operate a food truck and I had originally been exposed to them from seeing them selling their wares at the downtown PHX farms market on Saturday."}
{"text":"Love this truck! Everyone is so friendly! I encourage calling the phone number to find out their schedule!"}
{"text":"These brothers own the ONLY mobile flatbread pizza truck in Phoenix. They do pizza right boasting local ingredients and creative menus to tempt the tastebuds of everyone around. Think local pork belly bacon from The Meat Shop, Saffron JAK house turkey sausage, local cheese and uncured pepperoni from California-based company Zoe's Meats.   Some of my favorite menu items are the Mexican squash, black bean, potato, feta and cheddar cheese with tapatio and the Basil, mozzrella and beef steak tomato. Then of course there is the jalapeno, bacon, pineapple chutney or perhaps the pear, gorgonzola, prosciutto, apricot jam and mozzarella.... Are you getting the picture, there are too many great options to love just one.   You can find these guys slinging their deliciousness all over Phoenix, in the morning at  3rd ave and Osborn and some evenings at Kobalt Bar at Park Central Mall.   If your mouth isn't watering wait until you get 20 feet from their truck.. The smells alone will get you running.   I can't wait to see what these guys come up with next."}
{"text":"Awesome experience dinning in and eating a delicious Braised Herb Tri Tip bowl and hummus plate. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, and a mix up caused my order not to get passed to the kitchen.  Without me complaining, they discovered it, apologized, refunded my money and quickly brought my food.  The food was fantastic (chicken kabob). The manager (owner?) engaged the customers and took obvious pride in the quality of the food and the customer's satisfaction.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had some of this scrumptious pizza on Saturday! I was so impressed.  Not only are the guys hot, the pizza rules! Double whammy. Follow them on IG for their schedule. Try The Pam, so good!"}
{"text":"Bill Murray Meatball Flatbread and Feta Whip are our go to order!  They never fail us... wooooo yum!  We are also pretty stoked they carry fountain PURE CANE SUGAR sodas for an extra treat. Stubborn sodas... pretty cool!  Saw this time that they have quite the macaroon selection among many other sweet treats in their bakery case... haven't tried any yet but don't you worry... I will *wink*.  Just go - try it - they are super nice, will answer questions and bring you yummy food."}
{"text":"Really good persian food at a great price. I brought my mom and family here for her birthday, and we tried a lot of the menu. Everything was very good... although some if the items, like the veggie and hummus tray is pretty straightforward and uninteresting.   The bread (sagnak) is amazing. I got tacos with 2 different fillings. My favorite was definitely the tri-tip. Lots of flavor. The chicken taco with the yogurt sauce (borrowed from my wife's dinner) was outstanding, too.   But, by far, the best part of this place is the service. It was the best. So good that I left a $50 tip on a $75 bill. So nice. Talked us through menu. And so great to my mom on her birthday. Not the fake kind of nice because they're getting paid... but the kind where I felt like he was genuinely interested in me and my family. I can't say enough about that."}
{"text":"Great flavors in the braised tri tip. Went great with the sangak and rice. Jayson was energetic and passionate about the food and it shows in the product they serve. I will be back to try their spin on tacos and pizza."}
{"text":"I hired this company to supplement the food being served at my daughter's wedding in Sedona. Chef Jaymes did an incredible job. He arrived early to set up and all my guests raved about the gourmet pizzas. I would hire them again in the future for any event I am hosting."}
{"text":"I had the bread and hummus from the farmers market. I can't get enough of both. I want to try the food truck or their restaurant ( or both). My kids like it too."}
{"text":"My fiancé Shiraz and I came in today. He's tried the food but I haven't so it was my first time. We had the Koobideh bowl and it was so delicious. The meat was sooooooooo yummy!! The owner is super friendly and so is the staff. The prices are amazing for what you get. So excited to have some amazing Persian food so close to our house. We'll be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I did not eat at the food truck so this rating is for my purchase from the farmer's market where I first heard of Saffron Jak. I bought an amazing rice pudding type of thing which I wish I would've bought more, it was so good! I am still thinking about it and it's been a few weeks since I had it. Also, their hummus is out of this world. I love hummus and enjoy trying it in every way possible from different places and theirs is absolutely fantastic! If you find them at the farmer's market on the weekends by Phoenix Public Market please do yourself a favor and buy more than you think you want at that moment. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I saw the 5 star reviews and the one $ rate and knew we needed to try this place out. We were not disappointed, and you won't be ether."}
{"text":"This review is for the food truck. Our work brings in food trucks often and these guys are one of our favorites. I love love love their pizza/flatbread and the service is always super friendly and fast. I lived in New England for 10 years so I'm picky about my pizza and their really hits the spot. (It's a square flatbread shape with a thin crust and just the right amount of cheese and sauce). I like a touch of garlic so they'll add some garlic infused oil on it for me. YUMMMMM!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. Cheaper alternative to the Persian Room in Scottsdale. For some reason I hadn't heard about this place for quite a while even though Persian cuisine is one of my favorites, but once I did, I was excited to try it out. The menu is not as varied as a traditional restaurant, but given that this place started as a food truck, and that the dishes they do have are excellent, that wasn't really a problem. I tried the koobideh taco, and my girlfriend the chicken/rice dish. Both were great and came with Sangak bread - mine in the form of the \"taco\", and my girlfriends was lining the plate under the food. We liked the bread a lot and decided to get a piece to go as well (disclaimer: it's HUGE if you've never had this Persian bread). The location is ok - in a strip mall next to a daycare and a shady-looking Russian market, but it's nice that they have a physical location now. Would definitely recommend it to others, especially as a cheaper, most casual alternative to a place such as the Persian room."}
{"text":"Neighborhood place. Very accommodating to special orders, ingredient requests. Fresh food made by real chefs. I wish it had later hours.  They certainly took a risk by opening an interesting Persian cafe in a neighborhood dominated by fried chicken fingers and alcohol.  As far as I know they don't serve beer, and I like that they don't.   Skip the new mega fast food hellhole across the street and come here instead. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Delicious food, informative and friendly staff, authentic sangak made on site! fresh ingredients! Awesome experience, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have had the Saffron Chicken Salad twice and really enjoyed it. The homemade dressing is delicious, and the chicken portion and toppings are very generous. The Lamb Taco was a bit odd, with rice inside. The side salad was pretty plain.  I'm afraid Saffron Jak is going to be a victim of its own success. The restaurant was very busy for lunch, and there is no where for patrons to wait in line to place their orders except standing right next to your table while you dine. Having the register in the back and the line running all the way through the restaurant out the door, is not the best decision. The condiment and drink stations are also located very close to the registers so it is quite the traffic jam.  Perhaps a little reconfiguring would help them with atmosphere and traffic flow.  I am really pleased to see this restaurant prosper!"}
{"text":"What a delight. From the friendly waiter to the excellent food, this was a terrific place. However, I do have to start with a warning, this is Persian, not the standard Middle Eastern fare. If you're looking for gyros, this isn't the place for you. But, allow yourself a bit of adventure and you can eat like a shah. I must admit that we pigged out a bit, I had the tri-tip dish, which was basically a delicious and subtly seasoned pot roast. My wife had the lamb kibbeh, also delicious. We tried a number of sides and found them outstanding. The desserts looked good, but enough was enough. Our friends went with a chicken dish that they loved. We hadn't ordered soup but were given some lentil soup to try. Ok, that was divine. Also, our friends ordered some humus, which I don't usually bother eating. It was way better than the usual. In summation, I have only one negative; while the French press coffee was good, there was only almond milk to go with it. Sorry, but that doesn't work for me. Next time, and there will be one soon, I may just bring a small vial of milk or perhaps I'll try one of the Persian teas. Now, why does that immediately say, \"and baklava\" in my mind?"}
{"text":"Wow, really surprised by how fresh and healthy he food is . Absolutely delicious. Restraunt is very clean and cozy. Great service and presentation with food."}
{"text":"All I can say is O M G! So delicious I had the LBP and salad combo, it was absolutely delicious.  I wish I had taken a picture.  The bacon potato combination was heavenly. I will definitely watch for this truck to come back to Food Truck Friday at the Capitol."}
{"text":"Awesome flat bread pizza. I don't know what they make the crust out of but it's delicious. My favorite is The Super Greeky. To be honest, I haven't tried the others yet because it's so good. Don't pass this food truck by if you see it."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional and the hummus taste like yo mama made it with love. The owner took the time to walk us through the history of the company, this family owned spot is super dope!"}
{"text":"I just had the Super Greeky pizza. It was amazing. Definitely unique and very tasty. Service was quick and very friendly too.  I'm from Los Angeles and food trucks are a dime a dozen so I don't usually pay attention to them. This food truck would stand head and shoulders above 99% of the food trucks anywhere. Hands down."}
{"text":"Nice little find in a strip mall standard mom and pop tables and chairs.  Really flavorful tender tri tip with basmati rice and beans."}
{"text":"Dudes and Dudettes.... try this pizza. It is pretty fabulous. I tried this food truck outside of Cobra Arcade Bar.... yes, I had had some beverages before eating so my opinion may be slightly skewed. This place got mad props for allowing my friend and I to get one pizza with half and half toppings. For one half, we had a fairly plain pizza and the other we had their potato pizza. It's all about the potato!!! Sounds weird, but it isn't. Also, the staff in the truck were very nice and helpful and the prices were decent. Anyway, if I were to see this truck again, I probably could not help but get another pizza, and I feel you should follow suit."}
{"text":"Amazing flatbread is all I can say, the food truck was out in North Scottsdale since im a Pizza fiend, talked the owner about the many foods trucks that come here and his comp is Buddyz for the deep dish, but after tasting this amazing flatbread I honestly think there is no comp from Buddyz since each pizza has flavoring. Crispy, tasty and how a flatbread should be, this pizza rawks!! Update I said I was only going to eat 4 pieces and I eat all 8 and im still craving more!!! Amazing flatbread"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place and finally got the opportunity. Have been here twice in the past week.  Dine in facility was clean and friendly.   First visit had the local lamb burger special with greens, grilled onions, tomato, cucumber yogurt. They also provided a  small container of feta whip which I also put on the burger.  The  feta whip  mixed with the cucumber yogart became  rather messy but all was good. Just used a knife and fork to finish the burger.   Second visit was take out. Ordered the cheese  and meatball sangak pizzas. Also took home  a feta whip with a \"loaf\" of sangak bread. Pizzas were very good.   Sangak is a whole wheat flatbread that has a  great texture and taste just by itself. You may miss that with the sangak pizza crust; however, you end up with other pleasant textures and taste.They make the sangak onsite in their bakery.   Will be back for a visit to their bakery. Many other selections to try on the menu. Will save those for another day!"}
{"text":"We discovered SJ's truck at the Cardinals game a few games back. OMG - we now show up early and head straight for the truck before every game, this stuff is truly AWESOME! And of course it's a better buy than the Papa John's tiny wheel of despair that they sell inside the stadium, not to mention 1000x better product. Makes arriving at the games early something to look forward to. SJ pizza and NFL Sunday Ticket on the Flight Deck - doesn't get any better than that. 1,000,000 stars!"}
{"text":"I caught this food truck when they were outside the Four Peaks Tasting Room.  I like that they offer a 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad combo -- because sometimes you need vegetables!  The salad was great.  I ordered it with the sweet mustard vinaigrette and thought it was excellent.  The greens were fresh and I liked the sliced pickled jalapenos on top.  It came with a LOT of jalapenos, so I saved a few of those to eat on top of my pizza, delicious.  I really liked my pizza!  I'm not usually a fan of thin crusts, but this one was alright.  I still would've preferred a thicker crust.  The baked potato toppings were so good.   The only con of this place is that if you are pretty hungry to very hungry, one pizza will probably not fill you up.  My boyfriend ordered the pepperoni and mushroom piiza -- but he had to go home and eat more food afterward bc he was still hungry!  So you are looking at about a $20/person bill if you really want to feel full afterwards."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Saffron JAK for the first time last week and all I can say: Amazing experience!!! Food was great, relaxed atmosphere, affordable price and quick service. We had delicious pizza, hummus, salad and the watermelon water (fun bonus-you get to keep the jar). Will definitely be back! Thanks for the awesome meal!"}
{"text":"We don't even need to post, because it's obvious how much everyone else loves them, but we have to!  We discovered them when they did an awesome demo at the Food Truck Caravan in Scottsdale.  We saw, not only how delicious their pizza is, but also how much passion and effort they put into it.  Their story behind their food is so cool and we've been obsessed ever since!  We were chatting with them tonight and they gave us a huge sample of their dough.  They are the real deal and I love supporting such great people.  GO!!"}
{"text":"I have never rated a place but this place deserved 5stars. Every bite was amazing! Super nice owner. Braised herb tri-tip was to die for!"}
{"text":"Wow! Really fresh amazing food. Had the large house salad and the saffron chicken taco. Really amazing. Plus the owners love what they do. Only 4 miles from home, this will be a weekly stop for me."}
{"text":"Great food fun atmosphere nice owners and great service. The bread is amazing and the hummus is great. We really enjoyed the history lesson of how the bread was originally even made. Highly recommend this place if you enjoy hummus and the like."}
{"text":"This was place has recently opened up so me and wife thought we would try it for a day date lunch spot. The customer service is amazing. We were greeted and ordered our food and then sat and waited. The food was brought out fast. The only thing I would suggest is to get fountain drinks. I love the vintage feel of drinking my come out of a glass bottle but fountain drinks would have been more ideal. Will come back again!"}
