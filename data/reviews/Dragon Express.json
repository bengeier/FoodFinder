{"text":"Friendly staff that speaks English clearly, quick service and very yummy food. Prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"First time here. The menu is pretty basic for a chinese resturant. I got peppered steak with pot stickers. Prices were good. Staff was not overly friendly but not rude or anything that really expresses great customer service. I would recommend. Especially if you like local businesses rather than panda. Soo good too. Fresh."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here twice & had great service both times. We had a hard time finding somewhere that would deliver to us & then we found Dragon Express. They keep your address on file so when you order you don't have to repeat all of your information. Takes them about 40 minutes to deliver. The food tastes great & you will have leftovers for days. You get so much food for your money. The delivery drivers are super friendly! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Been going since 2010 and the food is great! A bit pricey but it's worth it. Must try the crispy pot stickers!"}
{"text":"I come here once in awhile, the few times the food was disappointing. But this recent time it was very good pork mei fun and shrimp vegetables combo. Who ever prepared the food did a delish job."}
{"text":"The food here was good and fresh. Also the restaurant was very clean! Employees were friendly. We would return."}
{"text":"Food is decent, glad they deliver, however... rice is down right awful.  I've ordered from this place a few times and each time I've ran into really really really undercooked / dry rice.  The food itself wasnt bad but this is chinese food, so you know, bad rice is a deal breaker... plus I'm asian so poorly made rice is sort of big deal :).  i almost wonder if the rice is some sort of instant rice or something but it is definitely not fresh or quality."}
{"text":"Friendly service, fast, and good food plenty of it. Definitely not the best Chinese I've had but certainly great food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and had the general tso's chicken and beef lo mein. The food itself tasted great and I thought we found a new Chinese take out place. Unfortunately I was extremely sick that night and the next day with food poisoning and my fianc√© was as well. The service was very friendly maybe it was just a fluke?"}
{"text":"We live just down the street from Dragon Express and have been meaning to try them for months when we had a golden opportunity for some Chinese delivery this evening.

Long review short: It was solid. Nothing that wowed me, per se, but solid food. We got kung pao chicken and cashew chicken (admittedly, in retrospect, two very similar dishes) with brown and fried rice. Everything was just...good. The brown rice was ok, the fried rice is fluffy, both entrees had their own distinct flavors (for two similar dishes, the differences between them were pronounced), and the food was delivered if not rapidly, then very hot considering the time. I was content. I'm not wowed or impressed, and to be frank, I don't think it's enough to convince me to switch over from my standard Chinese delivery in the area. But it was commendable. I'll keep it in mind.

Serious note: Our meals came delivered in flimsy styrofoam leftovers cartons, which is fine for limited portions, but quakes under the weight of hot, dense Chinese food. The reliable plastic Tupperware-esque containers are definitely preferable for delivery."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review anywhere but this place is so gross. The chicken fried rice was so nasty, the eggs in it were burned. The rice was burned. It seemed like old food that was being thrown onto a pan to fry. The orange chicken was soggy and the sauce was tasteless. The teriyaki chicken was gross. The cheesecake was yellow! The food made my husband and I so sick to our stomachs the next day. I usually love Chinese food. I will never waste money on this place again."}
{"text":"I ordered from them despite the crappy reviews on Yelp. Neighbors said it was decent Chinese food. Wrong. It took forever to get here. Won ton soup was flavorless and had an odd after taste. Fried rice was hard and crunchy. They charged me extra for white sauce and didn't deliver it. Chicken broccoli was less than average and vegetable low Mein was sub par as well. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I've been getting Dragon Express for a couple years now and they are almost always good. My friend had moved into the apartments that are RIGHT next to it and we fell in love. I have only had one time where there was something slightly off about the dish, but that is one time in a least 25 or more visits.

I always get the Kung Pao, Beef and Broccoli, Pork Fried Rice(it's awesome!) and the egg drop soup is delish also. Recently my sister ordered the Pad Thai and it was amazing. I will be ordering it next time I go.

They're always quick, polite, and the restaurant is always clean. Definitely recommend for anyone who hasn't tried."}
{"text":"No flavor,  rice was dry,  and the soup was so thick I didn't even think it was soup, yuck!"}
{"text":"My hubs and I LOVE this place! 

We drove all the way from Maricopa just to eat here yesterday and the food was, and   always is, Amazing!  The staff is super nice and they give you some watermelon with your fortune cookie at the end.  

We will be going there every other week to get a different dish everytime. I am going to be trying the spiciest dishes near the end of my pregnancy to hopefully get the baby going.. can't wait!! 

Love Dragon Express! :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley. Their honey walnut shrimp is the best. I order or at least once a month.  A little pricey but this isn't your standard Chinese restaurant that you usually order take out from. It's a little more upscale but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Will never go there again because of the rude lady who took my order named Neptune!  I left Katie, the owner, a message to call me back and she never did!  Also, found out the sanitation grade is C!"}
{"text":"Ate here several months ago and thought the food was just OK. Granted, I do not need to eat a lot of food, but I thought the portion sizes were too small. Much better Chinese restaurants in the immediate area. Maybe on a second visit my experience would be better."}
{"text":"Dragon Express is my go-to Chinese delivery place. They are always fast, friendly, and the food is great. My favorites are their Kung Pao Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork, and Fried Rice. The crab puffs and beef skewers are also amazing."}
{"text":"Look no further, you have found it excellent, food, service what can i say try it and you will agree.......thank you Dragon express....Customers forever"}
{"text":"It's nice place! Whenever i found chance, i go there for dinner or lunch. Tasty food quality. I recommend it to all my group friend."}
{"text":"it was good food but the pics are not exactly what is expected the fried rise looks nothing like the one they present on the pics"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!! We were looking for a good Chinese place other than your typical 'fast food' Chinese and Dragon Express came up on my Google search, so we thought we'd give it a try. They didn't disappoint! The food was absolutely delicious and they give you enough to take home for leftovers! Their prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is very clean and cozy. We've gone on a week night, as well as on a weekend, and never had to wait more than 10 - 15 minutes for our meal to arrive. Their Orange Peal Chicken & Teriyaki chicken are the best!! If you're ever in the Dobson Ranch area of Mesa and looking for some delicious food, I highly recommend Dragon Express."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite place to buy Chinese food, especially the sweet and sour chicken!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese fast-food restaurant I have come across in the valley. Have tried many, but keep coming back to this one. The place is on the small side, but always find an open table. The dinning area is always spotless, the staff is very friendly and the food is pretty good. The portions are big; my wife and I always end up eating one main entree with two soups and a few appetizers."}
{"text":"Thai Basil Fried Rice and Korean Noodle Soup were Fantastic!  This was our 3rd time here and it's been consistently yummy!  Friendly Staff and fair prices.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write a review but this place is amazing. I got the lettuce wrap and it was better than P.F. Chang's and it's way cheaper. My wife got the Lo Mein which was way good.  We got so much food we could have shared one item."}
{"text":"Great food and super nice staff!! Dining room is modern looking, and very clean. I eat here often."}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki chicken with beef lo mein and it was amazing. It measured up to some of the best Chinese food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Really good chinese food...best place in the area for chinese delivery. The delivery times could be faster though."}
{"text":"Sometimes you get really lucky trying that little hole in the wall place.  My pad Thai is delicious, and Andy has the General Tso 's chicken.  Yummy."}
{"text":"This place cannot disappoint!  
Their portions are HUGE, my husband and teen son can share one meal.  Everything on the menu is great, the service is fast, and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"We came about this place after a yelp search for some nearby Chinese food. What we have tried so far has been very good! I am a fan of PeiWei Kung Pao and the. Kung Pao here was fantastic. The hot and sour soup also great. So far we've had the Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Thai Basil Fried Rice, Hot and Sour Soup, Kung Pao chicken and of the kids Teriyaki Chicken. We've got a pretty picky kid. She makes eating out miserable sometimes and she loved the  kids Teriyaki and even gave the Sweet and Sour a thumbs up. So happy to have found this place. Only downside....we live 12 miles away."}
{"text":"Although the food was decent I would not go back.  I walked in ordered our food, a table of three was sat after I placed my order and two more walk ins. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. 1/2 hour later everyone that came after me was served and gone. The kitchen staff and the girl at the front counter were playing around and eating ice cream while I wait. The girl comes from the back after playing around with the kitchen staff and looks at me and says \"oh sorry\".  ''This place was extremely unprofessional and I would not come back for that reason. It's a shame cuz the food actually wasn't half bad however there at plenty more restaurants that want business."}
{"text":"Yummy! Close to my house so we go all the time! Very affordable and quick. I always head here when I'm craving some good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Ordered dinner for pickup for myself and 3 hungry teenagers. It was ready fast and portion sizes are great for the price. That's the best thing I can say. The spicy dishes weren't spicy at all and had very little flavor. The orange chicken was mushy and the only flavor was sweet. The crab puffs (angels) were large and pretty, but they were just cream cheese in a wonton. The beef skewers were as bland as the meals, and the egg rolls, although large, were too heavily seasoned with some Asian seasoning. 2 kids had lo mein with their meals and it was awful. It tasted like maybe some of the greens in the stir fry had started to turn. I had brown rice, and the flavor stood out noticeably against Hunan Chicken. We were so hopeful about this place, and it was such a huge disappointment. We threw away at least half of the food because it was awful. The value for the price isn't very good if you can't eat what you ordered. We'll take the advice of another reviewer and never order from here again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit today but will definitely not be my last!  I was very pleasantly surprised when I walked through the doors in a non-descript strip mall.  The dining area was immaculate and featured plenty of comfortable seating.  The three employees with whom I interacted were all exceptionally friendly and efficient.   I ordered the General Tso's chicken. It was delicious! The vegetables were very fresh, and the sauce had just the right amount of heat.  They use all white-meat chicken here which is a bonus.  I look forward to trying more dishes when I return."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on a Saturday night. They were polite over the phone and the price was about average for appetizers and dinner for two. Their portions were bigger than I expected and the food overall looked and held up well for a delivery. I ordered the potstickers and chicken egg rolls for apps, chicken egg rolls were delicious however the potstickers didn't hold up during delivery as they were barely room temp. The Cashew Chicken was delicious. Shrimp fried rice as well. Food reheated well also the next day which is a big deal for me not all delivery Chinese does. Nothing really stood out but everything was good. I would order again."}
{"text":"I typically eat here once a week with coworkers. We have an hour lunch and easily have time to sit down and relax.  The food is fast, delicious, and reasonably priced. The customer service is great and the place is always clean. Great Asian food for a great price."}
{"text":"Been here many times. I would've given four stars but it isn't the same anymore. The portions are smaller, the food isn't prepared the same, and the chicken tastes fake now. 
The spring rolls are very good. The restaurant, although small, is always clean and has a courteous staff. 
Very good food six months ago, I hope they return to proper form."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are my cup of tea- which unfortunately is not included.  For $5.99 ($6.99 for shrimp entrees) you get your choice from 22 entrees, brown or white rice and a small spring roll.  They are a comparative alternative to Pei  Wei's.  Been there twice and plan to visit again soon."}
{"text":"One of the few places I can go where I have several items I love. I have tried so much off their menu, love every one of them, so I stand there when I go in, staring at the menu, trying to decide! It's made as you order it, no sitting under heat lamps and not at all greasy."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and they were here within 20 min. You definitely get your money's worth-- big portions, the food is fresh and it is delicious! A+"}
{"text":"That's right-a CHINESE place! I don't eat pizza EVERY day...
I love this place-their chicken fried rice is fabulous-big pieces of honest-to-God white meat chicken and a pretty big portion. They have the kind of egg rolls I like (I'm an egg roll snob, and very few places will do), and their lunch special is a lot of food for the price.

A la carte items are more pricey than other Chinese places-but their delivery is very prompt, their staff is unfailingly polite, and the restaurant is extremely clean.

One of my faves!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty. Not amazing, but not horrible. Worth ordering when I want Chinese again."}
{"text":"Just happened to be driving by and thought is stop for lunch. Got the Kung Pao chicken and asked them for extra spicy. Amazing!!!! So good and my mouth is on fire!!! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My wife called this place for us to pick up lunch. They kept arguing with her and told her that we are too far away. My wife kept telling the server that we wanted to PICK UP! As in, \"We will drive to the restaurant and pick up the food!\" But they kept arguing and told her that they wouldn't serve us because we are just too far away. Yeah... 20 minutes away... Too far. 

Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"This is Chinese takeout people and this restaurant is very good for it's class. It isn't gourmet and they aren't trying to be...we are talking about budget Chinese food here (you can get a lunch for a little over $5.00). If you are looking for good food, good portions and a great price with very friendly service then Dragon Express is your place. I would suggest the Hot & Sour soup, Sa Cha Chicken with Shrimp, House Lo Mein and Mu Shu Chicken. All of the food here is good - again it's not gourmet Chinese,  it is - Budget Chinese Takeout. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is good, AMERICAN Chinese food. Exactly like what you would get from a buffet style Chinese restaurant. If your a yuppie looking for chinese food, cooked in china with organic chinese produce, then go somewhere else. I've ordered delivery for my family twice from here. Both times the food arrived hot and fresh. Our dishes were crammed full of food, almost to the bursting point. Sweet and sour chicken dinner entree, Sesame chicken dinner entree, Orange chicken dinner entree and egg drop soup, everything was DELICIOUS!!! All the chicken was fully cooked, and not dry at all like others have said. The delivery time was 45 min, but its because we are pretty far from the restaurant, so its reasonable for us. Our dinners usually run $30 for 3 people, including delivery and tip."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese restaurant for dinner delivery at least twice a month. The food always arrives quickly, piping hot, and in generous portions. They have the most AMAZING chili oil, but you need to be sure to ask for it.  The owner and delivery people have always been professional and friendly. 

I stay away from the sweet side of the menu (sweet and sour/orange chicken/general tso) as a personal preference (but my kids love it)  and order more on the savory side, they do it well."}
{"text":"Idk what it is but every Chinese food place that I've been to out here is just blah they don't put the love in or it's just they don't care. The chow mein not lo mein lol is greasy and you can taste the old oil from the wok. The eggrolls were ok and the hot and sour soup is one of the worst I've ever had and it's like that every place around here in Arizona.  They should be ashamed to serve such terrible tasting food ordered this today."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN,my wife went yesterday to pickup some dinner for us,the egg rolls were  burned  ,the mongilian beef was  with lots of onions and no beef,the only good thing was the white rice.no more chines fast food."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered delivery and the food has been pretty good. The orange chicken was soggy, but it had been steaming in a styrofoam box for the duration of the delivery. I suggest ordering non breaded items for delivery. The food always arrives hot though!! Delivery time is average to long."}
{"text":"First time, called, very polite lady, got my order quickly and correctly and total delivery time was 32 minutes. Everything was AMAZING the chicken egg rolls are awesome, and I highly recommend this restaurant!!! 
10 ***** 
Laurie, Mesa"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, delivery was on time, average portions, very minimal veggies taking up space in anything we ordered, the specialty lo mein is the most delicious I've ever had, i will be ordering the lo mein again but the shrimp had no flavor, the orange chicken could have been better, cheaply breaded dry fried chicken in a very basic orange sauce, I would skip it, the fried rice was okay but on the lower end, the crab angels and sauce are definitely good but different and not all the reviews made them out to be, overall it is pretty good place to eat if you know what to order. Chicken and pork lo mein are a good choice."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese place in the area! Love their fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. Also you get so much food for your money."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered take out tonight. When the delivery guy showed up the stereo in his car was so loud. He didn't even bother to turn it down when he came up to the door to deliver our food. I got the dragon wonton soup and veggies with brown rice. And my boyfriend got the Asian curry chicken. The food was just alright. Could have been better but I've also had worse."}
{"text":"Love Dragon Express! Superb service, clean restaurant and delicious food that never disappoints! Bonus that it's very close to our house. My kids get the teriyaki chicken and orange chicken and love it. I usually get the ginger chicken w/ broccoli and have tried the general tsao's chicken which are great every time! Hubby gets the edamame and either shrimp w/ lobster sauce or dragon wonton soup. He's never left hungry or disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love that you can order online through Yelp. These guys are quick and their pad thai is remarkably delicious. I had them deliver twice. It takes about an hour for them to send you the food, though. That's fine with me!

I had chicken in mine but realized that I can totally go vegetarian, so I did. The tofu is marinated just right and very tasty. It's not every day that you'd pick out the chicken and toss it to your dog in favor for the tofu bites!"}
{"text":"Love this place the food is consistently good and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  We usually get the orange tofu and it's delicious.  Very firm crispy tofu.  My go to Chinese comfort food spot."}
{"text":"The price is right not to mention the taste of there meals. I have been here for 4 times with my wife. If u want a different taste of ur regular panda express craving u have to come here. The place is always clean and gives u an assurance that u won't be getting a stomach ache when ur done with ur meal. The last 4 times that I have here I am never dispointed thanks this place I can kill my Chinese food cravings with having to go to a fast food place."}
{"text":"I would suggest you guys change your recipe for chow mein or at least state clearly that your chow mein contains 0 noodles, even though chow mein directly translates to \"fried noodles\""}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for another great restaurant pick.

After her swimming lessons a few blocks away, my daughter wanted to go for Chinese food.  We arrived and approached the counter to order our lunch.  My daughter wanted noodles so I ordered her the Chicken Lo Mein from the kids menu.  I wanted something spicy (and not deep fried), so I decided on the Spicy Korean Pork and upgraded to fried rice (white or brown steamed rice are the standard options).

Our lunch arrived in about 5 minutes.  My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her noodles and had enough to take home for supper because of the large portion.  The only complaint I had was the total lack of vegetables (it even says \"no vegetables\" on the kids menu, which I noticed later).  The Korean Pork dish was absolutely delicious. There was a small, crisp bean in my dish that was so yummy and fresh.  I asked the clerk what it was and she told me it was a certain kind of bean (not a string bean) that they get from the Asian Market on Main and Dobson.  I traveled to China in 1998 and remembered this vegetable in several dishes then.

Will definitely go again!  Great place for a quick lunch!  This time I'll ask them to add veggies to my daughters meal. I want to try the chicken lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"Still excellent food. Still have great prices. Still extremely consistent in temperature and flavor. Still loving this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and always get great customer service and amazing food! Price is about par for the course with other Chinese food quick service, but the quality is much much better. My go to order is sweet and sour chicken with pork fried rice. The inside of the restaurant is very clean and organized, the employees here take pride in their work and it shows. Hands down my favorite Chinese food restaurant in Arizona. Although I don't live close anymore, anytime I am near this place and hungry it is my 1st choice. 

Great tea as well!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food for a cheap price. I just tried this yesterday and loved it. Just wishit came with more food lol. I definitely recommend trying this place. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food isn't the issue. Being exhausted and too tired to drive I opted to order delivery. After an hour and a half I called the restaurant to ask about my order and was told it was out for delivery. I said something about the length of time and was told the driver has allot of delivery orders and then quickly said good bye and hung up. The food arrived 15 minutes after my call do 1 hr 45minutes for my order seems excessive to me. Needless to say the food was slightly warm not hot but Luckily I don't mind room temperature food. The most annoying thing was my order was not correct and I was missing my egg rolls which I really wanted more than the rest of the food. This happened once before so I'm done here.... moving on to a new Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Really yummy place! I'd order from here again. I got the broccoli in garlic sauce, it was spicy but delicious. I also got the Thai basil fried rice and it was great! I wish they had more vegetarian options and that's why I am giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"I get the Cashew Nut Chicken here regularly for lunch. The portion size for the price is great and food is always delicious. In the world of express Dragon is greater than Panda."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and good tasting food. Just the way you want take out, this place was referred from a friend-great job DE."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened. A year ago the food was very good with lots of Flavor. I Walked in and ordered carry out and waited for them to cook the food. Had a 5 minute drive home. While the food was hot it definitely wasn't fresh. Everything was bland and mushy (orange chicken, pepper steak, lo mein). The noodles were like canned Campbell's soup noodles and the chicken was like a sponge. As if they had reheated it in the microwave with the sauce on it. My kids ended up adding sriracha sauce to give everything some flavor. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this little place...the people r very friendly and professional and the food is quite good. The lettuce wraps r better than P.F's.....chicken, all white and lots of earthy minced mushrooms (which I love). It's an appetizer but, the portion is entree size.
      Egg drop is can't miss and every time I pick up they always offer a beverage. Like I said, nice people. Can't speak for their delivery as I always pick mine up.oh...forgot to mention, it's always spotless which for me is important!!"}
{"text":"Not your typical greasy spoon Chinese restaurant. Today I ordered delivery from here for the first time. It showed up pretty quickly and was hot and tasty. No complaints here! I will definitely be a return customer."}
{"text":"We got hunan chicken extra spicy, thai basil beef, side of fried rice and crispy potstickers.
All awesome but i think they put too much oil in the fried rice personally. igredient were all fresh and veggies still crisp not overcooked.
Order got here within half an hour and they do have a $2 delivery fee which is nothing compared to other people's $3. 
will definitely ordr here again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent the local restaurants in Mesa and stumbled upon Dragon Express. I always wondered why I never spotted this place before, but it was because it is tucked in the very back corner of a busy plaza on Baseline and Alma School Rd. The exterior seemed quite humble minus the bird droppings layereing the cement floor, but if you ignore that everything is fine. We both walked in and was surprised to find the most clean and organized looking restaurant. It is a small room but it seats at least  30+ people. All of the furniture was like-new and the decorations made you feel like you were in a quaint oriental joint. 
Now it was time to see if the patrons were humble or humbug. I approached the counter and was greeted by a very friendly, petite asian woman in her mid-twenties? I can't remember her name but she gladly took our order of orange peel chicken with fried rice and a bowl of their dragon wonton soup. We ordered one drink to share and the waitress gave us a large cup to selve-serve at the drink dispenser. There was a blend of exotic iced tea that sounded delicious and the usual sodas and sports drink. I choose the tea. 
The place was self seating so my bf and I took a booth and boy was it comfortable! It wasn't the type of booths where you sat down and it would bounce you right back up. We got comfortable and sipped on the tea while we waited. In less than 7 minutes our food had started to arrive. First came the soup that I had ordered. It contained cucumber slices, wontons filled with pork, chopped cabbage, green onion, and shrimp. It smelled just as good as it looked. So I took the sirst sip, and BAM! My tastebuds were overwhelmed with utter pleasure. The light salty soysauce taste combined with the broth of the wontons and shrimp was so fantastic! It was light, yet hearty from all of the veggies. The soup came with some tasty fried wonton strips and those made the soup even more delectable. Then came the orange peel chicken. It smell of the food overwhelmed me yet again! The chicken pieces were very crisp and the orange peel sauce was sweet without taking away from the juicy meat. It had hints of orange asince they used real peels in the batch. One thing you must keep in mind when ordering this dish, is to watch out for the peels. If you bite into one, it takes away from the flavor a bit. If you like that, be my guest! the fried rice was to DIE for! They include many diced veggies and egg with just the right amount of spice and flavoring.
All in all, my bf and I walked out there stuffed out of our minds from the frenzy of deliciousness. The portions were so big that the both of us couldn't finish, so we had to take to-go boxes home. They also bring out fortune cookies for a small dessert and (when in season) slices of honey oranges/tangerines to enjoy. 
I was very impressed with the place and have since gone back countless times, once a week. I HIGHLY reccommend this location, it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Like others said, \"typical\" Arizona Chinese take out. I do return because the food is good and not covered in sauce and oil like some places, visually appealing. I must say I do LOVE their hot&sour soup. So far I think it's the best I've had. What pisses me off is that tiny spring roll they give you, it's like a slap in the face. The portions are smaller than most places, but quality seems a little higher."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome lunch specials! Came here on my lunch break, the place is very clean and wasn't empty. Ordered shrimp with lobster sauce, by far my favorite in the valley and I've tried quite a few Chinese places. So yummy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Good cheap chinese food. Love the chicken and broccoli. Also the garlic sauce is a hit if you like a flavorful sauce with some spicy. Not a big fan of the egg rolls but the spring rolls and crab rangoons are a good replacement. I come here often."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I didn't know that food could be this disgusting. I had the \"fresh\" scallops with Shrimp and Garlic Sauce labeled under *Chefs Specialties*. The menu stated this was a spicy dish. I got nothing that was fresh, spicy or special. It tasted like dirty seafood candy. 
My husband got Orange Chicken which unfortunately was much much worse. They were gelatinous lumps of soggy fried mush. He couldn't even find the chicken!
Last but not least, our egg rolls were burnt to a crisp and flattened bc they piled all of our food on top of them in the bag.
If you're craving Chinese food...do not go here. If this is your last resort and you decide to forgo the reviews and give it a chance like we did, go without."}
{"text":"Satisfied as always. Chicken fried rice is always deelish! Chicken was cooked a little long today but they added bean sprouts as I asked and it's always more than enough for 2! Egg rolls came out after my rice though:("}
{"text":"So delicious! Got the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice for the side. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the very best chinese restaurant I have ever been to in the entire state of Arizona. I've tried several different ones and this is the only one that makes General Tso's Tofu the way they make it in New York City. They charged under $9 (Tax Included) for crispy tofu, broccoli and brown rice. The portion was pretty good for the price. The taste was just perfect in every way. I will be coming back and getting my favorite dish each time I come. I can see myself eating here everyday. Maybe next time I'll try one of their desserts, a couple of them sounded really good. I love this place. Chinese food the way I like it. Rare gem in Arizona."}
{"text":"I love this place! My kids love this place! My friends live this place!

Dragon Express the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona. When we lived in Chandler, we ordered from Dragon Express delivery at least once or twice a month. The food was always fresh and delicious. The manager was super sweet and was always the driver when we ordered. Now that we live in Mesa, we are out of their delivery area so we eat in the dining room when we venture over in that area. It's such an awesome feeling being remembered by the staff since visits are few and far between these days. 

Hot n Sour Soup, Crab Rangoon, Lettuce Wraps, Mongolian Beef.... Honestly, I don't think we've tried one thing that we haven't loved!"}
{"text":"I was craving chicken egg rolls and saw the reviews so I thought I would try the Dragon Express.  Ordered 2 egg rolls and an order of crab angels.  The egg rolls were huge, but something about them did not work well for me.  I tasted no chicken and basically saw all of the cabbage and other things they put on the inside.  I didn't like it.  There was something off about it to me and it left weird taste in my mouth afterwards.  The crab angels were not all that either.  I tasted more cream cheese than I did crab or scallions.  I don't know what all the talk is about, but what is yummy to many was no yummy to me."}
{"text":"So hard to find good Asian/Chinese food in the valley, but dragon express has definitely become one of our favorites. The lo mein is so flavorful and all the chicken dishes are Wonderful. You can actually tell what it is you are eating. They only use white meat, and the veggies are always crisp and perfectly sauced. Has not dissapointed yet!!"}
{"text":"My General Tso's chicken was a saucy, goopy mess. It would've been a lot better, had the chicken been unbreaded. Unless eaten immediately in-house the breading soaks up the sauce, which creates a mealy texture. The lo mein noodles were overcooked, almost to the point of mushiness. On the plus side, the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Location isn't super or anything fancy but the inside is clean and appealing. Photos adjacent to the menu helps if your a first time visitor. And food isn't that bad :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would without hesitation.  The food was beyond disgusting.  We didn't touch 3/4 of it after opening it on the table.  We both feel ill after trying just a few pieces of chicken.  So 50$ on Chinese food isn't too awful bit 50$ for disgusting Chinese food is not ok. Please please heed my advice and under no circumstances try to eat a single thing from this place.  Oh and on top of that the service was horrific as well!"}
{"text":"I read through the reviews before my wife and I decided to have dinner here.  Let me say all of the great reviews were spot on! Awesome fresh food done right! Not one thing we tasted could I have wanted to be better than it already was! Portions are pretty large and the pricing is great as well. Very clean place too. The service was excelent as well. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had in Az try it for yourself great food good service good prices !!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. They have a great menu,fresh ingredients, great service,easy going environment,smaller place but inside and outside eating. I've brought many friends here so to me that means a lot. I'll be back."}
{"text":"this place is awesome i dont understand all the hate.  been eating here for years ive never had an issue with wait time on delivery and im not even that close to them.  food is always hot and delicious.  seriously...i for the life of me cant figure out the bad reviews."}
{"text":"My wife loves loves loves most Asian cuisine. I, on the other hand , just find it to be okay.  My best Friend introduced us to Dragon Express & I gotta say it's fantastic.  The portions are huge, and the food is delicious.  It's out of the way for us to go, but definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Service wasn't bad but food tasted rancid. took two bites of the egg roll and spit it out. crab rangoon looked rotten and after tasting the egg roll I was nervous to try it. I'm not hard to please when it comes to greasy chinese food but I was worried I would get sick. Tried to give it a shot despite the reviews because they offer delivery."}
{"text":"Chicken Egg Rolls were enormous and tasty. Asian Shrimp lunch (Rice/Spring Roll) were standard fare. Asian Shrimp sauce was too bland."}
{"text":"Really good, I'll definitely be back. One critique though, the Mongolian beef should be renamed \"Mongolian mushrooms with beef\" because there wasn't much beef in the dish. Still good though, just probably won't order that specific dish again as I don't like mushrooms"}
{"text":"Love this place to death! Total thumbs up.... Great food, always clean, and nice staff. Definitely a go-to during my lunch break :)"}
{"text":"I would give this more like a 3.5 but it's good enough to round up.

I was starving and being in the middle of a move, I wasn't keen to start cooking.  I am so tired of pizza, so I decided to hop on Yelp and find some Chinese delivery.  Dragon Express is not too far from home, so delivery should be fairly quick and they have a large menu.  I ordered the Crab Angels, and two lunch specials, the Teriyaki Chicken with fried rice, and Ginger Beef with brown rice.

The Crab Angels were only okay, not quite crispy enough, but with lots of filling and decent flavor.

The Teriyaki Chicken was definitely my favorite, the sauce is tasty and not overly sweet and there are actually VEGETABLES in it!  I like getting some veggies in my meals instead of just meat and rice.  The fried rice was pretty standard, not overly greasy though.

The Ginger Beef is pretty good, but the broccoli was a little soggy, but overall the flavor was good.  The brown rice is fine, but a little soft for my preferences.

The best part is the price and the delivery, the lunch specials were both under $7 and it's a generous portion (especially for a lunch special!).  They each came with a little spring roll which were nothing to write home about, but a nice touch.  The delivery was pretty quick, about 30 minutes.  The three items, delivery, and a 20% tip came out to about $25 and I have enough for at least 4 meals.

I'd definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, big serving. Its worth every penny! I've read a lot of bad review for the pad Thai and I did ordered it. I've taste a lot of pad Thai. To be honest it's not bad. I've had way worst pad Thai before. The specialty friend rice need more flavor. But overall I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but customer service is terrible. I ordered online at 3:30pm to be delivered at 5:30pm for a scheduled family dinner, the food was an hour late. When I called to find out where my food was and complain, they would not even apologize, just made lame excuses and basically told me they didn't need my business. Not sure why anyone still orders from here, if anyone else in Huntersville started delivering they would put this place out of business."}
{"text":"Very nice people that work here, very clean. Food was only mediocre at best. It wasn't bad, it was just very basic. Had the fried rice, and lomain. Was really hoping for what the previous reviews had said."}
{"text":"We thought we would try another dinner from Dragon Express. This time we ordered sweet & sour chicken and general Tao and crab angels.  The order arrived on time but was the only plus about this order.

They offer a two entree and side item for $15. But then up charge if you end up ordering fried rice instead of white, plus delivery. In the end it was over $21 but that wasn't the worst, it was a meal mostly of breaded coating and very little chicken. As well the crab angels came with chilly oil sauce instead of the sweet and sour sauce that was asked if included and confirmed. I will not be ordering again and need a good recommendation for a new location."}
{"text":"Can I give this place a 6-star review?!!!   This was the first time I actually placed an order using Yelp.   (BTW Yelp should also get a 6-star rating as well!). Anyway, how convenient is that?!! I was able to peruse the menu from bed, place my order, and process my payment without even picking my head up!!! That is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!!   I was able to check on my order status to perfectly time my pickup at the minute my food was ready!  As for the restaurant, the cashier greeted me with a smile, the cooks were friendly and most importantly the food was hands down, the BEST Chinese food I have had in ages!!!! We ordered their general chicken, beef lo mein, crab puffs and won ton soup!  Every bit of it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came here from previous comments. I'm real confused how this place got that many stars. Ordered the beef and broccoli- the meat is what I would think cat food tastes like and it was all broccoli.  Literally 5 pieces of meat. The fried rice and chow mein we payed extra for is disgusting.  The breaded chicken is all soggy breading with hardly any meat inside. The egg rolls tasted like fried cinnamon.  Paid $40 for a meal we will not be eating. Horrible food!!!!"}
{"text":"I love their \"white meat only\" chicken dishes... they are all good but my favorites are sweet and sour chicken (sauce is mixed on it already) and the hunan chicken. Love, love, love the spring rolls. Great soup as well. Not crazy about the lo mein, and one time (out of about 20) the food just wasn't that great. I still continued to order from them and have been pleased... very pleased! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered their orange chicken based on another yelpers review. I wasn't impressed. The orange chicken that came out was not the same orange chicken that I have  grown accustomed  to. It was sad, in the way that it was over cooked, and way too much flour was used. After taking the first bite, i had hope to have sunken my teeth into what was supposed to be chicken, what i got was just flour. I decided to open a couple more of these \"orange chicken balls\" up to see if the first was just a fluke. Nope. To my surprise, they were all just like that. What I got was orange flour balls instead of the orange chicken that i had been craving for. I would of been happier going to tsing tsao or golden valley just a couple more blocks down the road."}
{"text":"I really like this spot. My boyfriend and I get food delivered from here all the time. The food never takes too long to be delivered. They are always friendly, and most importantly the food is delicious:)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed our meal here. The Crab Rangoon was delicious. I had the specialty lo mein as an entree, I found the meat to be somewhat overdone but it was still tasty. The price was definitely right and fair for what it is. It's right down the block from me so I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was one the best Chinese places I have gone by far. The food was amazing, fried rice is not boiled like most Chinese restaurant. It was hot and good. I highly recommend it. The service was good as well. The cashier was very friendly. I went there almost at closing time they didn't rush us to eat or get out. Honestly by far amazing service and Food !!"}
{"text":"The beef skewers were charred and fatty and the \"chicken\" egg rolls had very little chicken in them if any at all, they were mainly stuffed with cabbage. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"A few months ago our favorite Chinese food restaurant went out of business [sniff]. My husband and I were devastated! Ok, that's a little dramatic... but we needed to find a place from where we could get our Chinese food fix! We got online, ran a search on Yelp for \"Chinese food,\" read countless reviews on various restaurants, and finally settled on Dragon Express. It was out of our way to drive to Alma School/Baseline but we were willing to make the sacrifice. Upon arriving to the restaurant I was immediately impressed. The atmosphere was so welcoming and unlike any Chinese food restaurant I had been to! There were pictures of all the food making it simple to choose what you wanted, the dining area was clean, and the cashier/waitress was SO FRIENDLY! She immediately brought my kids snacks to eat while we waited. It's my opinion you can tell the quality of a good Chinese food restaurant by their egg roll, so needless to say we ordered egg rolls. Not only was the presentation appetizing, their freshness and taste is unmatched to any other egg roll I've ever tasted. AND to top it off the Sweet & Sour Chili dipping sauce is incredible! I ordered Beef Lo Mein and my husband ordered the Orange Chicken; both were absolutely delish! We were so impressed by our first experience that we've been back twice! Each time we try something different and have yet to try something we don't like! Keep this place in business and eat there often! You won't be disappointed! Thank you Yelp for helping us find our new FAVORITE Chinese food restaurant!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! MISREPRESENTATION and COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL! GO TO GOLDEN DRAGON. Amazing food, service and space to enjoy the experience. We've all been going there for 20 years!   We make a large mistake, in DRAGON EXPRESS...

There are so many things that happened, the best way is to list the differences and go from there. 
1) First Impressions are everything. The pictures on the windows clearly misrepresented how you order.  Many pictures illustrating meal combos, but when at the counter, it was by the entree.  Further more, it was priced excessively--for the food was barely warm when we received in a plate.  

2)  Teriyaki Chicken was fried by  Japanese coating.  It looks like popcorn chicken , but it's like over cooked, dry and DANGEROUS for anyone with a gluten allergy any other medical condition.  This was NOT the traditional dish that everyone has seen.  Only referenced in a take out menu...

3)The other entree that we ordered was not hot and did not taste as other similar dishes.  It's like the just used different sauce to cover the items. 

4) I was severely ill after only eating 2 minor pieces of chicken coating in the mysterious \"crunch\".  As my husband has a very accurate palate, even he trouble figuring out why the placed teriyaki sauce on this type of chicken.  

5)  The person that took our order ASSUMED that I WANTED a soda that same MASSIVE size as my husband.  We didn't even finish the first glass, making free refills an invisible \"+\".  In addition they had a fridge for juices and other drinks.  There's no where to wait without feeling uncomfortalbe, like someone is joining you or watching you eat. 

6) This environment was very crowded. You can see why they have increased prices. They have to pay for the two tvs, paint, decor and new tables.  The aluminium settings outside were not acceptable given the heat. There wasn't a fan, but there again, with a few customers, thought we didn't need it. inside there was a large family, which is a good thing, but they were rather loud.  They were seated in the center of the room, under a television.  Combine boisterous family of all ages and televisions, it felt extremely overcrowded

7)  WATCHOUT!  Tip included.. Since we sat close to the kitchen, the only place that seemed relatively quiet, they barely took  one step from the  kitchen.  The attendant was kind and very accommodating, but with ll the confusion, we nearly walked out.  

A definite live and learn moment... definitely don't   feel pressured to order, while you are looking and figuring out the menu. If they are going to post pictures, that doesn't align with prices.  I wouldn't even pay half for this.  It was very rude to add a \"tip\" for a fast food/sit down place.  They aren't even close to a REAL chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the sweet-and-sour chicken with fried rice with fried rice was overcooked and dry as opposed to the sweet-and-sour chicken that was soggy expected it to be a crunchy outer coating. A lot of food for the money but not tasty"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Fast service. Great lunch specials. I decided to try something new and got the sesame chicken."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on Yelp and was looking for good food at reasonable prices. My friend and I had never been to Dragon Express and I have to say was I very impressed withe the service and extremely delighted with meal. 
Wait staff was friendly, courteous and very accommodating. Interior was clean and loved the overall atmosphere. 
We tried 6 different dishes and I have to say it was by far some of the best Asian cooking I've had in a while. Especially the Wonton soup and Crab Angels.....delicious!
This is my new favorite! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"It's okay for a dirty hole. But, if you are looking for a good dining experience - this isn't the place. The food is cheap and cheaply made - the service is okay and they give you a free drink if you eat in. Although eating in in a dump like this? They'd have to give me more than a free drink..."}
{"text":"This is far and away the best Chinese restaurant in the area. We've been coming here for years, and you won't find a better, cleaner or faster Chinese restaurant. The food is always fresh and they only use the best ingredients. It's seems like all of their chicken dishes are made with white meat. Plus, the staff is always friendly. Say hi to Jessi for me. It feels like she is always behind the counter :-)"}
{"text":"The food is great. I've only ever gotten delivery from them, but it's always quick and super hot when I get it. The prices are really decent and their delivery staff is very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. :) The pepper steak is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love, love this place. Friendly staff, great food, reasonable prices. The Thai Basil Fried Rice, chicken lo mein and chicken egg roll can't be beat. My favorite Chinese place."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving carry out Chinese food and ran into this place on the way home. This place is \"VERY CLEAN\" and the workers are very nice. I informed the cashier that this was my first time here. She was very helpful pointing out the different menu options. They have a great lunch offer or you can order the dinner size portions. I ordered the Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao. The egg roll that came with the meal is nothing special. I actually didn't finish it. It was a cabbage roll and very bland. The rest of the meal was great. I did like the option of getting brown rice with no added charge. I also liked that the chicken is all \"white\" meat...no dark meat used. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yelp reviewers save the day once again with this Chinese delivery gem!!

Best damn crab puffs I've had in a long time!  This place has quality food, made fresh and they actually care about the presentation!  I didn't think Chinese delivery like this existed.  No more ordering from the other guys!

General Tso's chicken on fried rice was awesome.  Next time ill ask them to make it extra spicy because it wasn't very spicy or hot at all.  Nonetheless it was freshly cooked and still crispy unlike every other time I've ordered delivery from the other guys.

Mongolian Beef on fried rice was good as well.  The meat didn't taste like it had been sitting around in sauce for several hours like most Chinese fast food.

The even have great service and fast delivery!  The guy who takes my order calls me, 'sir.'  I like this place!"}
{"text":"The Service - 5 Stars
The Food - 3 Stars

Came here last minute with my family of 12 for lunch. The staff was super friendly and accommodating despite our last minute show up. They moved most of their dining room tables to form one long table so we could all sit together as a family. They were extremely patient with us while we all took turns to order. 
The bathrooms were clean and the entire restaurant as well. 

The food was very similar to Pei Wei, as well as other Chinese-American dishes, like shrimp with lobster sauce and general tso's chicken. All of the dishes came with a white or brown rice option. As well as a fried rice or lo mein substitute option for $1. Personally, I thought the food was pretty average and standard. Like a cheaper quality of Pei Wei, but the same price range. Since the menu is very similar to Pei Wei, I would much prefer Pei Wei if given the option."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom nom... 

Oh, what's that? 

That's the sound of me stuffing my face full of food from Dragon Express. The food here is super fresh, perfectly cook (that zucchini - flawless) and has fabulous flavor! Service was friendly and patient as we hummed and hawed deciding what to order and the food came out fast in under 10 minutes. 

Couldn't be happier with the experience!"}
{"text":"My pan fried dumplings were burnt and the \"sauce\" was just sit sauce and rice vinegar. The orange chicken was awful. Overcooked, too much better, and the sauce was like marmalade."}
{"text":"I've been twice now. Today I ordered the twice cooked pork with lo mein instead of rice. The thing I like most about this place is the amount of fresh veggies in their dishes! The pork was brimming with zucchini, carrots, onions (and probably something else I'm forgetting)... And the lo mein was loaded with bean sprouts, onion, green onions... Lunch specials are 5.99 and come with a mini spring roll.

The spring rolls were not anything to write home about either for taste or price at 2.99 for 2."}
{"text":"Really like this place! It stunk because they were closing in 10 minutes when we got there so we ate outside for a bit. Anyways! We got the fried rice, egg drop soup ( not the best.. has corn in it which I'm not a fan of but if you are by all means enjoy!) I got the Mongolian beef and my boyfriend got General Tso's Chicken. Both were completely amazing! I will defiantly be back and try more things! Please check this place out! It is defiantly worth it!"}
{"text":"General Tso Chicken. My favorite dish, not made here the way Im used too. Claims to add steamed broccoli but the last 2 times I've ordered I have yet to see Broccoli. Also use these cheap styrofoam containers that ruin the meal for take out. The steam waters everything down and ruins the flavor. I suggest going elsewhere. Also a place that doesn't appreciate a to go tip, can't even get a \"bye\" outta these people when I thank them for their service with a generous tip."}
{"text":"We eat here about once every two weeks. Service is great and the restaurant is very clean. This is one of those places where one of the owners is always on site and you can see into the kitchen. 

Love the Hunan Chicken, Kung Pao, Spicy Korean Noodle Soup, egg rolls & Brown rice. Food is very consistent, hot, and tasty. Good value as well. We most often order take out and an entree means i get one and a half or two meals. 

Eating in is fine, i like the sports on the screens."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. I have a family of four and we all got an entree along with some egg rolls and Crab Angels. I am really happy with this place the Crab Angels were the best I have ever had. The Egg rolls were fabulous. All of our entrees were on par with or better than any Chinese food I have eaten in years. 

I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived to see that it was very clean and they have a window right into the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and clean and so so yummy! It's a prefect spot for a quick lunch or dinner or to take all the family. We love the general cho's chicken and the pad Thai and the spring roles best. Everything we have tried has been great tho!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese delivery I've ever had! Normally, I'm scared to order from Chinese take-out places because they can be kind of sketchy, but since I read so many good reviews of this place on here I decided to take a chance. Took less than a half an hour from the time of delivery to get to my house (27 minutes total!). I ordered online which I had never done before and it was extremely convenient. I got the dragon rolls, shrimp lo mein, shrimp fried rice, and a raspberry mango cheesecake. The portions at this place are HUGE! I ordered two days ago and I still have leftovers. The raspberry mango cheesecake is very unique and original and I loved it because raspberry and mango are my two favorite fruits! The shrimp lo mein is good, but after eating it for three days straight I'm kind of getting sick of it. The shrimp fried rice is probably my favorite main dish, and the dragon rolls are really good, too. The shrimp dishes come with A LOT of shrimp. Definitely worth your money! I will be ordering from Dragon Express the next time I want Chinese takeout and look forward to trying many more things from this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from this place when don't have time to prepare dinner. I can pretty much tell you everything on the menu is awesome!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to Dragon express. 
I really enjoy the food. 
They have a big enough menu. The food is flavorful. 
All around a very pleasant place to carry out. 
And they deliver!!"}
{"text":"OK so I order Asian  food take out a lot from different  place.. some well most of the time theirs no food just a bunch of white  rice!!!  But at dragon  express  I just have to say wow!!  They give you your money   worth by far and the food was great I will order here again!!!"}
{"text":"Life saver - gotta love good options - great Chinese food and good service - guys were super friendly, food taste really good a the egg rolls are awesome"}
{"text":"Tried Dragon Express for the first time tonight. We ordered take out and it was ready in 10 minutes. We had the Dragon Sampler, General's, and Kung Pao chicken. Delicious and huge portions. Husband loved the beef skewers. This will be our go to Chinese place from now on."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and it's not too bad. It's clean and the server is always friendly and has our foods out fairly quick. 
    I just wish they'd ease up on the sauce, I mean seriously they do a really great job in frying their dishes in the woks, but then all that great fried chicken or fried pork flavor is just ruined with some sort of drowning glaze sauce but the fried rice I'd have to say, they've got a killer fried rice, it's just the orange, sweet and sour and general tso sauces kill it, drowning whatever meat you ordered it with. 
    Now if you ain't really looking to chow down big time, their appetizers are really good. Crab puffs are delicious as well as the egg rolls, spring rolls and fried dumplings. The only killer is the drowning sauce, next time I'm just gonna ask for the sauce on the side, you should do the same."}
{"text":"Customer service is a joke!!!  I called gave my cross streets asked if they delivered she said yes.  Called back 2 minutes later to place my order was told no they don't deliver I'm to far.  I said I just talked to you 2 minutes ago and you said you did deliver, she says, ya I don't drive and I was to busy to map it and your just to far.  WTF!!!  Not cool!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and at a good price point. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. As for the customer service, they were super friendly. I would recommend it and will be eating here again."}
{"text":"The orange chicken was good. About like every other Chinese place. Very quick delivery."}
{"text":"This is a must try! The food was beyond EXCELLENT and the service was so courtious!

I highly recommend the the Dragon Wonton soup! It was the best I have ever had.

Also keep in mind the eggrolls they have, are not only delicious, but huge as well! 

To end with, there beef skewers are perfect for any picky eater.

Explore and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always clean awesome food and awesome staff. I come at least once a week. Best salad and salsa in town!!!! Lettuce wraps are also amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered crab angels, pot stickers, fried rice, orange peel chicken and chicken lo mien. The food was good but it didn't blow me away, I've had better. I wasn't a fan of how sweet the crab angels were and the rest of the food was just average. So far we have yet to find a good Chinese place since moving here to Tempe. We probably won't be returning, but the prices are really good nonetheless."}
{"text":"I got the general tso chicken and egg drop soup. The customer service was good and the soup was also good. The generals chicken was decent but nothing i would go back for again."}
{"text":"Usually this place is my go to for quick simple Chinese food. I really enjoy the Kung Pao chicken and the girlfriend enjoys the Garlic Beef. The last time we ordered we went through EAT24 app on the smartphone. I ordered mine spicy but it was lacking the spice I thought it should have whereas hers was spicier then normal. I'll continue to order there. I like this place and the prices are good."}
{"text":"I'd been down with a flu bug or something for about a day and a half and had a very delicate tummy. I got out the door so I could go to the Rubber Stamp Show they have here in Mesa twice a year and when the show was over I figured I should get something to eat since I hadn't had anything for 2 days. I searched Yelp for a Jewish delicatessen thinking chicken soup would be the best thing but there wasn't anything close.   I tried searching different categories including soup and wasn't satisfied with what I saw. Then I thought, well what the heck, and started searching for pho places. I think this is one of the places that popped up and since it was a place that I had passed by many times and wanted to try, I decided to stop in here.

 I told the young man behind the counter that I was interested in soup but I wasn't sure if the choices listed on the menu would be enough food for me and he let me know they have the larger 32 ounce size available so I said that's the ticket and ordered the egg drop soup, after debating between it and the won ton soup.  

The soup came out fairly quickly and while it was piping hot it was edible pretty quickly.  It had good flavor and lots of good egg in it which I figured would give me some nutrition and protein.  It wasn't overly salty like so many soups are and I had absolutely no tummy reactions to it later, for which I was very grateful. I felt much better by the time I left and I think it helped me get back on my feet the next day . 

I found the atmosphere to be very friendly and welcoming and the soup to be good quality.  I will definitely be coming back here to try other items that looked good on the menu. Oh, and did I mention the soup was only about five dollars? Score."}
{"text":"Our food took forever to come out and when it finally did, half of our order was missing. To make up for this mistake, they rushed our other half of the dinner. That too, took quite some time. The four of us ended up splitting the two meals already served. Come to find out, they forgot to add an entree to the bill in the first place, so that wasn't even being served with the second half. To make up for that, they offered to ring it in & discount it 10%. 

My chicken fried rice & egg drop soup was delicious. The egg rolls, not so much."}
{"text":"Their food is good n good size portions. Just dislike how they don't do half n half n they charge an extra dollar for fried rice."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Restaurant is clean.  The hot and sour soup is bit bland."}
{"text":"Portions were huge! Which I liked, but the only downside was it was very bland. The chicken seemed soggy and the noodles were somewhat watered down. Delivery was on point though!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS delicious! I have NEVER had a bad experience here. I use their delivery service quite often and they never disappoint. The food is delectable, the price is right and it is a clean establishment. 
I highly recommend this place. The only thing I do wish they did was deliver their green tea ice cream dessert.
That is the only thing not available for delivery."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese take out or delivery. This is our go to place when we are tired and do not want to cook. Great crab puffs and pork fried rice. Like that all the chicken dishes are white meat. Great portions, friendly service, and fast delivery. So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm usually not a fan of take-out Chinese food (It all tastes like greasy crap in my opinion)...unless however we're talking about Thai. Gotta love Thai! So anyways, my husband and I have pretty much tried all of the Chinese delivery places in our delivery zone (mostly to prove to him that they all suck)...that is until we came across this little gem last night. As a health conscience person, I try not to order greasy crap when I can avoid it, so I was pleasantly surprised with what we got. 
The food arrived quickly (45 minutes) and we had no problems/issues ordering through the Grub Hub site. 
We ordered Hot & Sour Soup, Ginger Chicken & Broccoli, Chicken Lo Mein, and Orange Peel Chicken. The Hot & Sour Soup as one reviewer put it left little to be desired. It was pretty bland and not at all spicy. The Lo Mein wasn't very greasy which I liked, the Orange Peel Chicken was flavorful, but heavy on the breading. Not something I'd eat again, and the Ginger Chicken was awesome! I requested that they add mushrooms and make it spicy and it was perfect. Light and flavorful. I got the fried rice instead of the white (I know, I know...but it's sooo much better) and it was very good! Didn't even need any soy sauce and wasn't dripping in oil. 

This will be our go-to Chinese food place from now on and have already recommended it. Seriously, before you try yet another so-so place, give this one a try. Hopefully you'll be as impressed as we were!"}
{"text":"Place was clean staff was very friendly.  I didn't find the food was that great had hot and sour soup and Mongolian beef.  Soup was okay beef dish, the meat was big chunks and dry with not much flavor. Order was to go was nice they give you a free drink while waiting but was surprised the rice amount was more than double of the amount of meat.  Angel wings were good."}
{"text":"I tried to order delivery from this place a few weeks ago but unfortunately I was out of their range, which made me sad because I had to eat DQ instead.  Anyway, I ate here this week and it was all good.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken and Dragon Spring Rolls.  After I ate, I met up with some friends for beers.  The leftovers were still in my car for quite some time.  Thanks to the AZ heat they were still pretty okay when my cousin ate them about 3 hours later.  LOL!  Anyway, this place was good and fairly priced.  I think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to grab some quick chinese food. Everything is fresh and simply well cooked. You also get a great amount of food for a very decent price. I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp with lo mein and it was simply delicious and has great flavor. I will come again and again whenever I am in the area. The crab Angels were soooo good; that's definitely a must order for everyone. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Standard Arizona \"Chinese\" fare. I ordered takeout from this place and both dishes were soggy and bland.  The service was great and the food was ready for pickup within ten minutes, my only problem was that the food wasn't very good."}
{"text":"The best in the neighborhood. The entr√©es are better than average using all white meat chicken without an up charge. Now the appetizers on the other hand are simply the best I've ever had. I'm addicted to those crab angels!!! Customer service is great too. If they run a little behind they always throw in some free drinks which is very cool."}
{"text":"I believe you should always give something a second chance, and I am so glad I decided to give Dragon Exrpress one!  I couldn't stop thinking about those perfect crab angels so I called up and ordered those creamy appetizers plus the kung pao again (Monica likes her chicken spicy).  I was crossing my fingers.  Turns out I must have gotten the wrong order last time I ate there.  This time the kung pao tasted like it was supposed to. It had some heat, not sweet. So I'm changing my rating to 4 stars.  I plan on ordering take out from them again."}
{"text":"Have ordered online 3 times and each delivery was on time and delicious. 
Kids enjoy the fried rice. 
I enjoy the mei fun & egg rolls."}
{"text":"Jessi and her husband came here to america to live the dream and they have. They make the best freaking chinese I have had in about 15- 20 STATES. I love 2 things cookies and Chinese Food. I have had crappy ones on both ends. These are the nicest people and the best food I have had. I have eaten there more than 20 times no lie , I had my birthday dinner there. I have had my own businesses for over 10 years and have about a hundred employees. I say this to impress upon you the future eater of awesomeness, this is the real deal great people great family and Y2K generation place. They are in their late twentys and just got their duaghter from china thats three and been away from them for almost as long. They are really the BOMB people. I have made business deals, have great laughs and stuffed my face here. I can't say enough but go go go go and eat here. Thanks guys I feel so happy and welcome everytime I come here."}
{"text":"I have been craving Chinese for a long time and Yelp directed me towards this place. The interior is very bright and clean and the small staff all seemed friendly enough. 
I got an entree of sweet and sour chicken with lo mein (an extra $1 if you want that instead of rice) for under $9. I also got a side of crab angels/ragoons/puffs (5 for under $4). The lo mein was very thick and a lot was stuffed in the box. The chicken was breaded and fluffy, with plenty of S&S sauce. There was also a few vegetables thrown in (but not a TON to take up space which is a definite bonus for me). The ragoons were a good size and the stuffing was very flavourful - cheese, chives and (what I assume is) fake crab balanced just right not to overpower each other in the flavour department.
It seems a little more Panda Express than I was hoping for when I went searching Yelp, though it wasn't set up like Panda where the food's been sitting out for who knows how long so that's definitely a bonus; everything seemed really fresh. The food itself was pretty good but, again, pretty standard for a Chinese fast food place.
I'll just have to keep looking for a less Westernized non-buffet Chinese food restaurant around these parts."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place!!!! We have been searching and searching for the perfect place to get Asian food bc we like to eat it once a week.  
They have great food and there is a bit of every taste of Asia. I had Pad Thai which was better than I've had at Thai specific places!!!!! We tried the egg drop soup and it was good, hot, fresh, and a big bowl with crunchies too. Lo Mein was yummy as was Kung Pao chicken.
U serve ur own drink which we love especially with spicy dishes.  I always get tea and it was freshly made and purified water as was the soda which were Coke products.
It is super clean and fun decor inside too. Sort of mood lighting and dim which is really nice and relaxing. Seating is comfortable and there is tv but it is turned on mute with CC so it doesn't bother but u can look at it. 

And the workers are very very nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Super big five stars and we will be back!!!!! Yay!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Four people from my family ate takeout from there on 10/26.  Two of us had stomach issues and diarrhea that night and the next day."}
{"text":"I normally look at Yelp for good restaurants because I have never been stirred wrong. Unfortunately this time I was very very very much disappointed. I'm not sure if the other people that gave this review have any sort of taste buds, but the food was horrific. The pictures made it appear fairly delicious but that's as far as it went. I had the wonton soup and it tasted as if was defrosted, boiled, and served with large quantities of bland. It didn't stop there. The vegetable delight had no taste and lacked bean sprout. I swear the picture had more bean sprout. Specialty noodle had nothing special about it and neither did the fried rice. It's like someone who has never eaten chinese food before, looked at a picture of what it should look like and guessed on what it would taste like...gross! Other than the food being a zero, the customer service was outstanding! At least 6 star customer service!  Sadly, I would rather take horrible service with amazing food. Please, if you respect your taste buds, avoid there food, but come for the nice people!"}
{"text":"This is now my go-to Chinese takeout place. It was Tott's but they relocated too far away from me. I like that all of the chicken dishes at Dragon Express are made with white meat only. I've tried several varieties, all good. I love the lo mein noodles here. I almost always sub noodles for rice. The veggies that come in the main dishes are always fresh and perfectly cooked. The portions are pretty huge. One entree with noodles always last me at least two meals. Service is super fast and the cashiers are always friendly. On the rare occasion that I arrive before my order is ready, they've offered me a fountain drink while I wait, free of charge. My only complaint would be that they close at 9pm on weekends. It's almost always too late when I get my craving for lo mein!"}
{"text":"Great food awesome delivery service , the wonton soup is always piping hot and really flavourful"}
{"text":"It's OK for some quick tai food but it's def not the best! Under seasoned and not very traditional is the biggest problems here. But there isn't much Tai Food in the area so they make ok Pad Tai... if your looking for quick though they definitely deliver in that sense."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place in the valley! They're very consistent, they travel far for delivery, the food is delicious, and they're real nice if you eat in. Sesame chicken is my favorite, not too sweet, though last time the breading was a little heavy. Fried rice is also the best I've had in east valley."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with the food I ordered from here.  It kind of reminded me of Panda Express or worse, at a higher price."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken egg rolls, potstickers, and spicy Kung pao chicken with lo mein. Everything was delicious, it definitely took care of my Chinese food fix at the moment. The egg rolls again country but I felt it lacked chicken in the pot stickers the flu. Lo mein was all right and the chicken was not half bad as well. i would try again but i don't eat asian foods often"}
{"text":"They keep orders on file with your telephone number which makes it super easy to order and to get your order fast. This is my go-to after a long day and when I'm super hangry. The crab wontons and chicken lettuce wraps have great flavor and I'm basically addicted. So happy I found this place."}
{"text":"We ordered from here on a whim because our usual spot wasn't offering delivery. Wow! Food was so tasty! We got the egg drop soup (so good), sweet and sour chicken, and the chicken egg rolls. Everything was so good that this might become our new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out I have had so far in the area! Food quality is consistently good. Not your typical strip mall take out place either, the restaurant inside is pretty nice too. Very clean, nice environment actually. The quality of the meat is good, which I am picky about. I don't do food reviews but our order is always right, food is always fresh, and the delivery always comes early even though we're technically a mile outside their delivery zone. Last time 40 minutes sooner than they anticipated!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute go to! I love their Dragon wonton soup, it's always great when I'm not feeling well. My second fave has to be their lettuce wraps, they are great! I've never had anything bad from this place. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this after stopping in for a menu on my way home from Applebee's a few weeks ago.  Took my 2 young daughters ages 6 & 8.  The food is delicious.  All 3 of us enjoyed our food.  We ate in and had plenty to take home for leftovers.  I ordered the Hunan Chicken with white rice.  Very spicy just the way I like it.  Veggies cooked perfectly, still crisp, not mushy at all.  Kids Teriyaki chicken and a kids chicken lo mein.  I will definitely go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place tonight.  It took over 90 minutes (estimated 45-60).  The food wasn't hot, the rice was just blah, they didn't bring our eggrolls.  So - on their delivery service NO stars - on the food itself - hard to tell honestly - it didn't seem to be what we ordered as was described on the online menu.  Maybe they were just having a bad night but it'll be a while before we try again."}
{"text":"If you're in the Mesa area and looking for an affordable, but high quality Chinese take out, delivery, or casual dine-in, I highly recommend checking out Dragon Express!

Their menu features all your Oriental favorites, and maybe a few entrees you've yet to try!  The veggies definitely seem \"cut today\" fresh, and all the rice types I tried were cooked to perfection.  

There are some unconventional twists on old favorites as well-- the General Tso's for example, has little caramelized orange peel slices which, while surprising and very strong in flavor, were a pleasant addition.  

There are also some non-Chinese options, such as the Raspberry Mango Cheesecake dessert.   From what I was told by my partner, it was stellar, but she didn't give me a chance to taste it!

Although prices are almost entirely under $10 per entree, I would happily pay at least 12.00 for a plate of  food of this quality- and the portion sizes are easily share-able, or if you're inclined to leftovers, would make 3 modest sized lunches!

The dining room and restroom is clean, tasteful, and pleasantly lighted, so a sit-in lunch or dinner would be very enjoyable,  though delivery and take-out are also great options.  Try it!"}
{"text":"My go to Chinese delivery place. The crab Angels, hot and sour soup and chicken egg rolls are always wonderful! The only thing I haven't loved from here is the Pad Thai...but it's not a Thai restaurant so I'll let that slide."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Have been a faithful customer for 3 years, specifically love the eggrolls. I just placed my regular order, picked it up, got home, and am very disappointed. The eggrolls are completely different. They're barely edible, and taste like burnt plastic. My beef lo mein has almost no beef in it. When I called the restaurant to inquire what changed, I was told the eggrolls are no longer homemade, but are frozen. I was told it was the owner's decision to save money. I hope he enjoys the fifty cents he saved for the eggroll, because he lost a faithful customer. If I wanted frozen chinese, I'd go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Lo mein was too soft and over cooked. Orange chicken tasted good but soggy. Beef fried rice was the bomb! It was the best thing I got."}
{"text":"Not gourmet eat in Chinese food. However ALWAYS an amazing delivery option. Great portions, fast friendly drivers. Food always as promised and hot. Really enjoy Pork fried rice it's enough for meal and leftovers."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant. The service is fantastic and the food is always delicious. The moo goo gai pan is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I have been dying for a good place that delivers that isn't pizza, and DE didn't disappoint! I gave them a call to see if I was in their delivery boundaries, and luckily I was, and I had a few people over so we ordered kung pao, chicken teriyaki, lo mein, fried rice, and pad thai. They said it would take about an hour, and I believe the food arrived in about 50 minutes. It was bagged up nicely and the gent who dropped it off was very polite. I was really surprised at the amount of food and the quality just opening all of the boxes, and I was very glad that everything tasted so good :)

I tried them again for delivery two nights ago and got orange chicken, brown rice, and  pot stickers, all of which were delicious. Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised once again! Ordered via GruHub at 7:30PM which said to expect delivery by 8:30-8:45PM. What a pleasant surprise to have piping hot, perfectly prepared delivery at 8:08!!! Crunchy food was crunchy, noodles cooked perfectly, vegs fresh & vibrant, proteins tender & succulent!! Why eat anywhere else !!!  I've ordered from them numerous times in the past and NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"The place is great I love it so so much!! Although my last visit wasn't too enjoyable. The workers in the kitchen just stare at me and my daughter as if we are ghosts. I swear their mouths are on the floor! Insane, have some respect for a woman! I am not here for you to Gauck at! We wear shorts and a tank top, it's summer in Arizona I shouldn't be stared at like a piece of meat though. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place. They truly have great food for a great price. As far as standard \"fast\" Chinese food goes I have never had better. 

The decor and environment is awesome and the food is better, plus.. they have two flat screens on ESPN all the time. They staff is super friendly and it only takes once or twice to become a regular where they already know your order when you walk in. 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2010 and is one of my favorite places in the valley to eat Asian food. Always fresh and delicious, you gotta check this place out. My favorite dishes are the Kung Pao Chicken, Moo Goo Gai Pan and the Spicy Korean. 

These guys are best."}
{"text":"Smelled great on the way home. They had 3 entree for 20 as a deal, so I got s/s pork, beef and broccoli, and combo lo mein. First time trying them so we got the dragon sampler as well. 

Sweet and sour pork- not bad, good pieces of pork. Very stereotypical store bought, dangerously sweet, dangerously red sauce. Paid $1 more for bland fried rice.

Beef and broccoli- decent, but I have to question if this sauce is store bought as well. Paid $1 extra for bland noodles.

Combo lo mein- this one is odd. Each meat seemed to have been cooked separately. The noodles are very bland. Overall, disappointed with each bite.

Dragon sampler- saving the best for last. Potstickers had freezer burn on them. Once seeing the inside it was very clear they were the same you get at Costco... 100 for $8. Same with the spring rolls. The beef skewers were made hours ago and probably just heated up real quick. Crab puffs were just cream cheese. 

The food is pretty much all bought at Costco and Smart and Final. At $8-10 an entr√©e, that is crazy. I got the deal and still spent $34 for all of this. WAY TOO MUCH! From the reviews I thought it would be worth the money. Duped by Yelp again! Grrrrr!!

They get two stars because the establishment was clean and had a nice ambience and the staff was very attentive when I was being helped."}
{"text":"I just reviewed Kwan's Sampan, and also just gave it 5 stars, but these places are quite different than each other. Experience fresh, crispy, tasty modern Asian fare at mall food court prices. This is a much more modern take on Chinese/Asian food. If you don't like your food fried, battered, and swimming in a sea of Sweet & Sour sauce, or gravy, then you've hit the jackpot with Dragon Express."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with their service, food, or prices. I recommend ordering the crab angel! Who doesn't love deep fried cream cheese?! I've tried several items on their menu and I loved each one."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best I have been to in a long time and the service was great. Me and my husband have been looking for a good spot to eat in Mesa and this is by far the best. The food taste great and came out very quickly. Crab Angels are FABULOUS. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch based on posted sign (big one up on the wall). Guy took my card and charged me a lot more. I  complained. He pulled out a menu, showed me small print and said sign was old. So, I refused to complete transaction. He said, \"okay.\" I never signed credit slip and left without food. They charged my credit card the overcharge amount. DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR CREDIT CARD!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am impressed. Quick delivery. Hot food. Easy on the wallet prices. Had the sweet/sour pork entr√©e, pot stickers, and soup. All of which was delicious. I would take a picture but its all gone. :-)"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service! All around great experience ! They accommodate  your special requests and are always super friendly."}
{"text":"It it 2 am? Are you hungry ? Like chicken? Been enjoying their delivery for a couple months now.

Food is good and consistent, love their crab puffs !

Try it !"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years this place is AWSOME good delicious you just need to come in and enjoy the food.So clean and fresh from the restaurant to the food. Everything comes out so quick.Service is off the hook AWSOME service come on in and 5 star this place."}
{"text":"In 120 degree weather dragon express definitely delivered our take out in record time. Very impressed by their speed and the ease of ordering through Yelp's Eat24! 

We ordered lunch specials, sweet and sour pork and general tsos chicken. Plus some egg drop soup and pork fried rice. Servings were large and food arrived piping hot. We loved their fried rice and egg drop soup. Were not as in love with their lo mein. 

I would highly recommend them if you want some solid Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"We have never been here, but received a flyer on our door with some coupons. We actually didn't end up using the coupons (yet) because we decided to have lunch here. It was definitely the best Chinese we have had in the southeast valley. I don't know what's going on with the quality of Chinese restaurants in Tempe/Mesa/Chandler (seems like every place I try is terrible), but Dragon Express is a shining star in the area. We ordered the chicken fried rice (not traditional, but tasty), and the vegetable dish with tofu (it was so delicious! Will definitely order again!). We also got some crab angels that were yummy and the best I have had in a while. The only disappointment was the chicken egg rolls; they seemed dry and didn't really have any flavor, but they were pretty large. Portions were great, prices were great. We ordered online and food was ready for pick up on time. The person who helped us at the counter was nice and friendly. The restaurant was clean and smelled good! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Do not get delivery!!! Service is terrible. Waited more than 2 hours for the food when they told me 45 minutes. I had to call 3 times and got nothing but lip service and excuses. Never again. So we have no Asian food delivery in Huntersville and need to deal with this!! Outrageous."}
{"text":"Great food with awesome portions, definitely leave full. Took the family there, five people and some sides still was very reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"If you like flavor with your food,  avoid this place.  I'm just letting the world know if I'm not at work tomorrow, I'm probably dead from food poisoning.  Tell my mother I love her.   Hard to continue by saying all jokes aside, because this place is the joke.  No but seriously though,  the absolute worst Chinese food I've ever had in my life.  As much as I loath yelp, and how much I do not care about anyone else's opinion of food, AT ALL, this time I so wish I did take a look."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!! The portions are HUGE--which was awesome because it was just as delicious for lunch the next day. We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Beef with Garlic Sauce, and Pad Thai. And the Dragon Sampler. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. Not just okay, not just edible, but absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS. I wish I would have known about this place a long time ago!!! My husband LOVED IT, which is saying a lot because he has never liked any Asian food other than sushi. This is definitely our go to place for an easy weeknight meal--who wants pizza when you can have heaven delivered to your door?! **I would also like to mention their brown rice, since I saw a bad review on it--we had the brown rice and it was the beautiful chewy texture you expect from brown rice. It was PERFECT!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite quick meal Asian food spot. My expectations have always been met.  Plenty of options.  Food arrives hot, flavorful,  proportational.  I'm a fiend for vegetables that retain their textures.  Dragon Express chefs succeed.  Service staff is eager to enhance experience, and provide knowledgeable assistance with explanation and recommendations.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is great. I normally walk in and order to go and it is ready within 10 min. Very clean inside"}
{"text":"Love this place for its straight forward reliable and really well done Chinese take out. Price and speed are perfect, sort of my go2 choice when I want something good and fast. Its exactly what I want and expect from the niche it inhabits, so 5*****! Well earned!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's 2 minutes from our office, so we get takeout at least once a week.  This place has been GREAT 5/5 the last 10+ times we've been there.  Must've been their B squad today.  Got like a pound of snow peas and like 4 shrimp.  No worries, we'll be back."}
{"text":"First time here excellent food !  One of the best I have tried in Arizona.  I even placed an online order on Yelp within 25 mins they were knocking at my door ! Good prices and a lot of food."}
{"text":"Ordered one of my favorite veggie dishes. 5 star is par except this time I had bits of chicken mixed in. I guess that's the price you pay when ordering veggie dishes in restaurants the serve meat."}
{"text":"Cons - Not spice, there  was no range.. AND NO THAI TEA?!

Pros - Food came out fast, the price was great and props on teh taste.
I got the Pad Thai and there was enough for me to take some home and enjoy it again. I love Thai left overs.

I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Man oh man... they deliver, and that's awesome, but I moved and now I'm right outside their delivery range, and that makes me really REALLY sad. They have the best fast asian cuisine I think I've ever had. Their portions are just crazy big for what they charge, and the food is delicious! I go to Dragon Express almost every time I'm craving Chinese food and it's always amazing. I've introduced quite a few friends to Dragon Express and the consensus is the same: YUMMMM!! Can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"Good overall quality, a nice selection, and they deliver to my office. I tried the crab puffs and the sampler platter for my last order. The egg drop soup is especially good with a side of crispy noodles. You can order via Grub-hub."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and the portions are enough for at least 2 people! Fast service and a nice menu!"}
{"text":"All time favorite, hands down Chinese food, and they deliver which is a plus! So you obviously need to be within their delivery range, but they always get here before their quoted time, food is always hot an fresh, and best of all delicious! We have tried several different plates, their fried rice is delicious, and is even great the next day as left overs. We always have left overs because their portions are HUGE! I love the chicken egg rolls as well, perfectly fried on the outside, and tender veggies and chicken on the inside!"}
{"text":"Subpar at best. Food is mediocre.  The service is good but the food is why I would go."}
{"text":"This place is just ok, not bad, not great. We ordered the Mongolian beef, orange peel chicken, pork fried rice, spring rolls, pot stickers and the crab angels. The beef was good, husband actually liked it better than some others in the area. I had the orange peel chicken and it lacked any real flavor, absolutely no heat. Chicken and breading were cooked well. The pot stickers were cold in the center and again, lacked flavor, but were crispy on the outside and the dipping sauce was good. The spring rolls were crispy on the outside but too mushy on the inside and as seems to be the trend, lacked flavor. The crab angels were perfectly cooked. That star of the show was the pork fried rice, it had great flavor and while it lacked the traditional egg component it held up to other fried rices I've had. We ordered for delivery and it took a little under an hour and a half, but being as it's Valentine's day, we gave leeway for that. Not sure we'll be re-ordering, as overall, it was just ok."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place and compared to Panda Express, you get more for your buck! I love that they have rice chips! Reminds me of \"CHINA CHINA\" old Mesa joint that burnt down years ago, near stapley and main. (Really miss it) Anyone who is a local knows what I'm talking about. Live for those chips.  They're only 0.50/bag"}
{"text":"We were back again tonight and food, service and atmosphere was outstanding as always.  Good Chinese food is sometimes hard to find."}
{"text":"I used to come here often back in 2008-2009 when I was in beauty school since both buildings are in the same plaza. I decided to stop by after work today for a quick appetizer and it was just as yummy if not yummier than I remember! 

I ordered the lettuce wraps, and for $5.99+ tax, I was super impressed by not only the taste but the amount of food! This is basically enough food for 2 people to share and not have to order anything else! I feel like I got almost half a lettuce! ;) I ended up eating about 5 wraps, and my brother still had another 3, and I still have lots of the chicken mix to take to work tomorrow for lunch but just need my own lettuce! 


I will definitely be coming back more often for more lettuce wraps, and also to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food place hands down. Food is always great and the staff is always welcoming. Whether you get delivery or stop by the restaurant, the food is always fantastic."}
{"text":"My girl friend ordered the Twice Cooked Pork and I had the Moo Goo Gai Pan and both were super scrumptious! We also shared Edamame and Crispy Potstickers as appetizers. They were out very quick and everything was tasty. 
The atmosphere was also nice. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I wanted Chinese delivery and had forgotten how horrible this place is so I ordered once more for the first time in 2 years. I literally wrote myself a note on a post it and stuck it on my wall to remind myself never to order again after this. Everything I I ordered tasted the same:   hot. I like my food very spicy but it would appear that  hot is the only flavor they know. And it is not a flavorful hot. They just make everything spicy and everything tastes exactly the same. Absolutely the worst hot and sour soup I have ever had. Threw out most of my meal. Everything was completely tasteless and gelatinous and simply burned my mouth. No offense to all the people who love it, but find a real Chinese food place so you can taste food the way it is supposed to taste. There have got to be dozens of places better than this including greasy corner spots that are primarily for takeout. I don't know where they got their recipes  but they sure as heck aren't from the old country! Almost more like they opened some cans of pre-made Chinese food and reheated them, and just added chili pepper. They are seriously that awful."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! All the meals are tasty, solid healthy options like subbing steamed veggies for rice & the restaurant is clean & updated. I usually get the kung Pao chicken which you can never go wrong with."}
{"text":"Dragon Express is your typical little strip mall Chinese joint, nothing special.  I do prefer their Hunan Chicken over similar restaurants in the Davis Lake / Northlake area.  

KUDOS FOR:
+  Lunch combos average around $5.50 and dinner combos around $7-$10.
+  For the most part employees are friendly, if not indifferent, and accommodating with special requests.
+  Convenient location, behind Target off I-77 exit 25.  Easy to grab a bite if you're shopping in the Northcross area.

THEY NEED TO WORK ON:
-  Tend to be a tad slow, even when the place is empty (and they don't have THAT many deliveries!).
-  Can be VERRRY VERY HOT inside, especially in spring & summer.  My God I don't know how they work in that.  It's as if they have no a/c.
-  They bring their kids to work.  If they were quieter & well behaved it'd be ok, but I loathe having little kids running around me and into me while waiting on my food.  I didn't order from a daycare center!  They also run in and out of the kitchen constantly.  Aren't there rules against that??
-  Need to repair or replace most of their tables & chairs.  Just pitiful."}

{"text":"Excellent food! Top notch service!  Wish you would open location in Power Ranch!  Consistently delicious food every time we dine here."}

{"text":"Went back today......ordered chicken moo goo gai pan, ah-MAZE-ing!!!! 

I am hence upgrading my review to 5 stars, because, YUM! (I have never had such fresh and perfectly cooked veggies from a Chinese restaurant....and WOW, that wine sauce was SOOOOOO GOOD!!)

oh, and service was much better today :)"}
