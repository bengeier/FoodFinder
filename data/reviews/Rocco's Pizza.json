{"text":"On a whim we decided to try Rocco's for the first time. They were really busy and there were only 2 guys working but they managed. We ordered an Italian sub, chicken and jojos - these were ok but I probably won't get them again. We also had a pizza, the pizza was tasty although I thought the pizza was a little greasy. We would have preferred more sauce on the pizza because we could barely taste the sauce but the toppings were adequate. If we go back, we'll definitely order extra sauce. Overall, it was good and I am glad we tried Rocco's."}
{"text":"We ordered two large pizzas, chicken and Jo Jo's on our last visit. The pizza was good but the chicken and Jo Jo's were the best part. The Jo Jo's were just how I like them - not too big. I never like it when restaurants give you a full quarter cut potatoes as a Jo Jo. These were thinner with a very good breading. The service over the phone was very good and accommodating. We ordered 1/2 toppings on the pizzas and they came out just as we asked. One suggestion to first-timers though, be sure you know which Rocco's you called. There is this one on Portage and there is one on Graham Rd.  Not too far apart but when your hungry, that's precious time lost. I speak from experience."}
{"text":"This place has a cult following. Friends in Cleveland are always envious that I am right around the corner from Roccos. If you want a great, greasy, covered in cheese pizza by all means, this is the best! If you want an overpriced, taste like cardboard, disappointment order from Donatos or any other number of chains. Btw the chicken is really good too!"}
{"text":"One good ass pizza. You know a pizza it's good if just a plain cheese pizza makes you melt. It is definitely greasy but I think it's necessary. Very cheesy. So good. Worth the price!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and hadn't unpacked our kitchen yet, so we grabbed a pizza from here. It was seriously the most salty pizza I've ever had. So bizzare!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is fantastic. My office orders sheet pizzas from Rocco's several times a year and there are never any leftovers! Their sauce is excellent as are their topping. When ordering for ourselves my wife and I prefer to order extra cheese and pepperoni. The pizza is seasoned perfectly and I would challenge any true pizza lover to try it. For me you can't get much better than Rocco's. I have it tied with Luigi's for the best pizza in Akron. 

Enough about the pizza let's now talk about dining in. They are primarily a delivery/take out joint. They have a quaint little dining room with a handful of booths to eat in. Service is done from the counter and they do have a soda fountain. It isn't by any means fancy but the dining room is cozy and the staff is friendly. Check it out sometime on your way to or from a movie. It's casual, unassuming, and you can't beat the smells that come from the oven. You may just want to order something else before you leave."}
{"text":"Great tasting  pizza.  Crust crisp.   Nice sauce and flavorful pepperoni  and sausage."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot again since i havent been back in a year. 
Our food was delish nice and hot and fairly quick. Everything seemed great the woman who waited on us was super pleasant and attentive, came around and refilled our sodas asked how everything was our daughter asked for a water and I was going to tell her to go to the drinking fountain but this woman went out of her way to go get ice in a big cup and fill it for us. Which is awesome never had that experience before when visting this place. Despite all the good things that perked us up on our visit I only gave 3 stars. This is because the other taller woman who has been there for a while, (as we have been waited on by her before a few times) was slamming stuff around and was acting very unprofessional. She had the our server go do some stuff in the back while she waited on new customers. She was fairly friendly towards them but she seemed to rush their order along. They were older and had trouble getting the words out or explaining it. She gets more frustrated almost yelling at them trying to verify their order. As another new customer comes in she greats them and is friendly, after they order she starts talking to them instead of going to make the couple's food as they're standing waiting. She yells towards them to have a seat, it'll be out when it's out. I don't mean to eavesdrop but this woman is pretty loud. As she's talking to the other customers she brings up her coworker that served us. She tells them to never come in if she's there by herself and to only come on days she is there. And pretty much continues to say anything she can to devalue this woman. (Which might I add she said some pretty untrue things as our service was awesome.) I should not have to hear things like this in a family restaurant. I believe it is childish and would only hurt your business to have these things said about other employees. It's not like they are highschoolers I wouldn't expect something like that from my teenager. I left a 10$ tip on the table for the lady that waited on us. As we are leaving we stop to talk to the older couple. She runs over and starts cleaning up our table. Then I see her put it in her back pocket I hope it got to our server because this woman didn't talk to us once except a \"have a great day\" as we leave. Overall was good but those things should be fixed, I do not wish to come in when that employee is there. She's flat out rude."}
{"text":"I havent been here for years because of moving out of town. Had one of their pizzas today and it was great! The pizza guy was very nice and the place appears nice and clean. I just got a job right down the street from there and this will definitely be a regular lunch stop, letting my coworkers drool while I enjoy this, sorry next time I will get a large to share, but saving my leftovers for dinner. This is just like I remember! Thanks for not changing!"}
{"text":"I love a pizza place with a little Italian family history and generations of pizza making passion. The pizza is perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of sauce. The food is never rushed, messy, or under cooked. My personal favorite is the white cheese garlic sauce pizza with a side salad. The subs are delicious too! 

Rocco's doesn't deliver, but carry out will do just fine. I ordered 4 sheets for my backyard wedding bbq and the pizza was gone in minutes. The Portage Trail Rocco's is a great spot for a mini life celebration.  

The staff is always friendly and never fails to stop by the table and ask how everything taste. Cheers to many more orders at Rocco's Pizza!"}
{"text":"Good quality pizza. We always order inside and dine in. The pizza is pretty greasy but if you dab it with a napkin it's all good. The subs are so delicious! If you live in the Falls and dont order your pizza from here you're messing up in life."}
{"text":"Rocco's has the best pizza in Ohio. Hands down. 

I recently was heading over to a friends house to watch a football game. I used to live in the Falls so while I was on my way I called in an order for pickup. 

I ordered my usual. A large meat pizza with onions and triple cheese. I showed up about 5min before the pizza was done. The owner realized that he had forgotten to put the onions on the pizza. I told him it wasn't a big deal and he insisted I take a 2 liter of pop on the house for the mistake. It's the 1st time they ever got my order wrong. I've ordered from them a lot so I wasn't upset. But it's little gestures like this that keep people coming back. 

I miss being able to get Rocco's whenever I want. I wish they'd open up a shop here in Parma. Parma is known for their mom and pop pizza joints. Rocco's would instantly jump to the top here."}
{"text":"Loved this place tried it for the first time bout a week ago and it has been my favorite pizza joint in town and I have tried all the other pizza places at least once. I had a big family gathering ordered a sheet pizza and 2 xl speciality pizzas. Everything turned out exceptionally well, good quality good taste and reasonably priced. I will be back for sure and always recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Reminds me of Nunzios that used to be at Grant St and Thornton St. Other than the large being somewhat small, in my opinion, no complaints. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Rocco's Pizza will always hold a special place in my heart. I have eaten a lot of pizza in my day, and this place just can't be beat. 

I have literally grown up eating Rocco's. My mom used to take my sister and I here as a little girl, have parties in their game room, and I still, to this day, try to go at least once or twice a month! The pizzas are fresh and hot, have just the right amount of greasy goodness, and the owner Rocco is a very kind man. 

Definitely a staple in Cuyahoga Falls. I just wish they delivered!!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Brooklyn. I am picky with pizza.

can it be? good pizza in Ohio? yes, indeed. you can thank the waves of Italian immigrants who put roots down in northeast Ohio (one branch of my family included) for this.

my cousin recommended this place for us to grab lunch at, and I was certainly not let down. classic pizzeria menu (oh, dat dimly-lit menu) with just the basics, no fancy-shmancy insane toppings. some other options like sandwiches, wings, garlic knots, and salads on the menu too. prices seemed fair. 

the white pizza totally hit the spot. olive oil, tomatoes, garlic, and onions. the veggies were fresh, the cheese was plentiful without being overbearing, and the dough was crisp without being too thin or too thick. interestingly, they cut it into a lot of smaller slices versus the usual 8. pretty good if you just need one more tiny piece to knock out the hunger!

I also sampled a bottle of their own brand of vanilla cream soda. nice and refreshing on a hot muggy day!

friendly staff and plenty of seating too. definitely worth it if in the area!"}
{"text":"For Pizza it is ok. Had it twice but get pizza regularly elsewhere. Very greasy. A friend of mine thinks it is better than sex!
Great for birthday parties! Conditioned space with video games! Kids love it & the staff is very friendly and were spot-on during our party. You can bring your own cake!"}
{"text":"Classic mom and pop pizza joint. Nice and cheesy, appropriately (but not too) greasy with a decent crust. Gave me extra pizza sauce and heavy on cheese without extra charge. Fast and convenient. Will definitely be back to try their version of jos jos and chicken. Good when you don't want any pretentious high end pizza just something to hit the spot"}
{"text":"I've been eating pizza at Rocco's since they opened the first one in the early 60's on Portage Trail. I go to the one on Graham Rd now because it's more convenient.  If you're worried about cholesterol, you may have problems because the sausage and pepperoni they use has fat in it, and will grease up your pizza. BUT the flavor comes from the fat, and that is what makes Rocco's pizza so flavorful. The staff is always friendly and when I call in for a pickup, it's always ready a couple of minutes ahead of time. It the best pizza place in the area bar none!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Akron, without a doubt. Reasonably priced, which is good because it is absolutely addicting! It's a family-owned business, and everyone who works here provides fast, friendly service. 

You can either call ahead and pick up your pizza or eat in the little dining room; which, in typical pizzeria style, is lined with cozy booths with checkered table cloths, and pictures and maps of Italy hang on the wall. 

There's no delivery, but trust me when I assure you that this pizza is worth it. My lady and I have driven from Lakewood several times to pick up a pie (which may or may not have been completely gone by the time we got back...). I regret nothing. 

I had several off the hook birthday parties in the party room here. Granted, I was probably 8 or 9. BUT THERE IS DONKEY KONG. Mortal Kombat. Frogger. And all kinds of classic arcade games. Add pizza to that equation and it is a blissful utopia of happiness and joy. I'm totally having my next birthday party here. All of you awesome Yelpers are invited."}
{"text":"The best super greasy comfort pizza around, and a local restaurant to boot! They always have coupons, so be on the lookout for them in the mail. The pizza doesn't quite heat up all that well in the microwave the next day, though. If you have a toaster oven, it's fine."}
{"text":"Anyone who has grown up or lived in Cuyahoga Falls knows about Rocco's pizza....The original is on Portage Trail, the 2nd opened on Graham, both places have been making pies for local residents since I remember eating pizza in the 70's....I'm just gonna review the Pizza, but there is nothing on the menu that will disappoint....Personally have had meatball subs (awesome), italian subs(again awesome) but I always order the pizza when I visit because it brings me back to my childhood....I ordered a large sausage ($10.75)....price is reasonable, we ordered the pizza for our drive home to Columbus, the pizza was gone before we were out of Akron!! Rocco's cheese and sauce is very good, I grew up on it and still consider it one of the best pizza places I've visited...The cheese sauce ratio is on point, just a bit of grease - don't let that scare you away, if you are health conscious just pat it with a napkin, those of you that don't mind the grease...Enjoy....Crust is excellent, thinner crust, definitely not Chicago style, closer to East Coast...If you like to fold your pizza when you devour it than you will enjoy the Rocco's slices......Not sure how long Rocco's has been in business but I'm guessing at least 50 years...visited the Portage Trail location regularly when I was a teenager and the quality of the pizza has remained excellent over the years...Also want to mention Rocco's sheet pizza's which have been regular at birthday parties, holiday's and Cuyahoga Falls High School banquet's as long as I can remember....The sheet pizza's are excellent....easily feed 6-10 people....cost is about $22....If you are in Cuyahoga Falls please visit Rocco's Pizza, the place is a local institution, no frills just great food....Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Last night I decided to get a pizza from a local place and not a crappy chain. I read reviews on here first before deciding where to go. I got a large pepperoni and it was great. I'll agree with other reviews on here about it being very salty though. The very saltiness was the only downfall or I would've eaten the whole pizza in one sitting haha."}
{"text":"My dad would pick up pizza from the Thornton Street address in the mid 1950's moved away in 1957..Every trip to Akron Rocco's is a must stop. Was there in September of 2014 and the pizza is the same as it was in the 1950's. Its well worth a trip from Florida, Rocco's is the best ..."}
{"text":"Was just ok could be better"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Got a x-large and it was tasty. Friendly staff who seem like great guys. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"Highlight was salad because of the creamy mozzarella and how cold the lettuce tasted. Pizza was extremely salty. Love to patronize local businesses but this place has to be getting killed by chains. I would rather eat pizza anywhere else. Staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"Didn't try their pizza but saw outside that they had a deal for fish and chips so I had to come in.  They have crinkle fries which were delicious and crispy. I haven't seen them for years so it was nice to see some places still supply them.  The deal included some Cod and boy were they delicious! A combination of crispy and fluffy and the portion they give you was definitely enough for two people.  I am so pleased and satisfied! The only thing that was my downfall for this place was it didn't look busy and there were 3 workers and some of the tables were still dirty. Overall, food was good and I definitely want to try their pizza next time."}
{"text":"Arguably the best pizza in town.  The chicken and jojos are amazing.  The hotwings are good too.  I recommend spending the extra $1.50 and getting extra cheese on the pizza.  They don't deliver, but oh well."}
{"text":"Ordered:
- X-Large pizza - pepperoni, sausage, onion - crust was just the right thickness, had a great yeasty taste/smell, sausage just the right amount of spicy
- 8 piece chicken / rocky potatoes - the breading was very fine and perfectly seasoned

After living in Stow for 10 years, I can't believe this was my 1st order from Rocco's.
Will be my #1 go-to from now on."}
{"text":"This was my favorite pizza around Kent. It is exceptional, one of the best in the Cleveland/Akron area. I am thinking about driving down from Cleveland to get some because I remember it being that good. My friend and I got lit up one day and had a pizza eating contest. I don't remember who won it though."}
{"text":"Great local pizza. Fast friendly staff and service. We love checking out local pizza places while traveling & would go back."}
{"text":"Love Rocco's  I am simple with the cheese pizza and my son enjoys the pepperoni   great salads"}
