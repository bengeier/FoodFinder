{"text":"I love this bar, just a little dive in the outskirts of town. They have an outdoor patio that is nice in the summer months as well. I visit this bar frequently."}
{"text":"We came in one day on a dice run stop. When we walked in the door, people greeted us like we had been long time customers and friends. We had a couple of beers and watched the food come out. The burger was so perfect looking, it almost looked fake. We made it a point to return for a burger. On return, we received the same treatment when we entered. We ordered the burger and it was amazing. One of the best we have had in our travels. We found out the buy their meat straight from a butcher, not a grocery store. Well worth the trip for a burger and beer."}
{"text":"Amazing food made from scratch. Even the bean burger was delicious and hand made. Fries are a little too good!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this dive bar.   We have been driving by this place for years, every time we come to visit the in-laws. They always said it was a dangerous biker bar and the worst spot in town.   Drove by yesterday and noticed Corvettes and a Ferrari in the parking lot, pretty upscale for a biker bar. Also, there seems to have been some recent renovations with a front porch and large back deck additions. I think the place is under new ownership.   We stopped in around 10 and the place was pretty crowded. I think it was the friendliest place I've visited in the Cleveland area, with a hello from just about everyone we saw.   Drink prices are amazing and pours are generous. Jack & Ginger plus a beer: $6.50.   Food: they have it, but we didn't order. From the looks, it appeared to be basic greasy bar eats, burgers and fries and such. Good enough for late night drunken chow, but not a sober dinner selection.   In summary: great atmosphere, people, drinks, history and jukebox. If this place were in my neighborhood, I'd be there once a week. Not ideal for a first date dinner though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink.  Had long island and my friend had a margarita. Both very good.  Had tuna stuffed heirloom tomato that was excellent. Nice atmosphere and staff"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great burger and fries in Brecksville then look no further than The County Line. Our friendly server Sue took our order for burgers and beer promptly and their chef prepped a 1/2 lb masterpiece and crispy fresh cut fries just as timely.  My meal choice now rates VERY high on my list of favorite NE Ohio burgs.  DO NOT pass this place up for the rumors of unfriendly bikers and cash only service. Nope, this place is friendly, tasty and my credit card worked just fine."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here one time while out on a motorcycle ride.  It was the perfect place to grab a beer and some food and conveniently located by the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.  We were very pleased with the service, really nice bartender.  The food was so much better than regular bar fare and priced right.  Can't wait for bike weather to return, definitely heading back to Dante's!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday for a quick lunch. Don't let the looks discourage you from going in. We were greeted with a warm reception. Lisa was very friendly. We had a drink while looking over the menu.  We decided to start with the brined chicken wings. We couldn't decide on a flavor, so Lisa quickly suggested splitting in two flavors.  Great idea.  Wings were almost too big. While they were good, they did not live up to the description on the menu. The real star was the burger we had. The gentleman running the grill sure knew his stuff. It was perfectly cooked to order.  The bacon onion jam was killer.  We will happily go back again to try some other things."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some burgers and boy were we surprised .The place was packed ,the beers were cold the service was great and our Burgers and Fries were very good !! definitely coming back."}
{"text":"OK one review mentions this bar is cash only he mentions a band and sewer smell and I'm thinking maybe he's getting the wrong restaurant. I have used my credit card there several times and I have yet to see a band and never once smelled anything close to a sewer smell.  That being said it is a dive bar but that's what's so great about it because I can go in sweats and not give a damn. Everybody there is so extremely nice and friendly. The food is awesome, no holds barred, down-home good cooking. Tuesdays is prime rib night check it out!"}
{"text":"Whoa whoa whoa... 5 stars.  I don't think so.  Some of their food is ok.  The best being their pulled pork.  Tacos Sah-uck!  Owner and patrons are very friendly, and they are very welcoming.  Except one of the bartender, who acts annoyed with you till she gets a couple in her.  They once in a while have bands, and some fun and games.  Knife throwing for example. They have a great enclosed patio area.  Also cash only.  Horrible beer selection (no draft, and you better like bud light, miller lite, and the other similar beers).  Fun place, but just like about any other dive.  And yes they have the same sewer smell all good dives have.  You know that sewer smell.  Any home owners, who have had their sewer backup, know what I am saying."}
{"text":"I had the special the strip steak and my boyfriend had the juicy loosey....BOTH AMAZING!!! Sue the bartender was a sweet heart and the chefs made sure everything tasted good! It was GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"I think there must be two restaurants that have similar names or something because some of the pictures look like the place I was at and some of them don't.  The menu pictures that are on here are not the same menus that I had yesterday.  That being said, it is a great little joint.  Definitely a cowboy/biker looking place - very small dining room, the waitress was so sweet, the cook had to leave for 20 minutes for some reason and she let us know but we were just sitting talking so it didn't bother us.  I had the bacon cheeseburger with the hand cut fries and it was awesome.  My sister had the pulled pork sandwich which was very large and she loved it.  The salads are a little on the skimpy side but they were super cheap.  Cook came out to make sure we liked our food. It was a yummy, filling meal - I would definitely go back maybe to watch the Tribe and have a burger again!"}
{"text":"Good little dive bar with excellent food burger was really good huge cooked well comes with homemade fries they have a hot brown sandwich on the menu I will have to try that next time have only seen that sandwich on menu's in Kentucky it's I think there state sandwich."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!  First off, I almost don't want to leave a review for fear this place will get too crowded.  I love this little bar and the great people who work here/own it.  It's like an old-time beer joint with a vintage wood bar and jukebox playing.  But to top it all off....the food is outstanding!!!  Burgers to die for, homemade coleslaw, crazy good fries and a whole lot more.  Casual place with a nice little outdoor patio to enjoy the warmer months.  Everyone is super friendly....but the food.  WOW!   Daily specials, open for lunch with something for everyone.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We just stopped in this bar for a burger based on the reviews on here and from the employees of Clippity Clop across the street.  It it definitely a \"dive\" bar so don't expect anything fancy.  But the food was amazing!   Burger was delicious,  fries were yummy and service was friendly and attentive.  And the ladies room was super clean - that's a huge plus in my book.    We'll be coming back.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. No frills. Great local bar, beware nothing is on draft all bottles which range from$2.50-$4. All menu items are under $10 and the County Line Burger Boy burger is fantastic.  Great little spot."}
{"text":"Great food. Young new chef who studied under Emril in Vegas. Great burgers and sandwiches. He's expanding the menu, adding brunch soon and does high end catering also. We'll be back."}
