{"text":"I've lived in the area for 20 years and just went in today. Pissed off at myself for not eating here while growing up. Great chicken sandwich and because I skipped lunch I bought a Hungarian salami sandwich (I Mean you're not going t buy Genoa salami at a Hungarian joint right? Chicken was a cutlet and hot and delicious. the mustard was different and definitely of European style.  I also bought a raspberry flavoured soda drink called Marka which was nice. Ibought a salad with two full eggs on it and enjoyed that too. I'll definitely go back to try some other hot table options and I like how they carry European chocolates that you don't see except in Roncesvalles or Polish Mississauga."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this used to be my favourite shop to go to for a little taste of the old country. They have all sorts of Hungarian (and European) goodies and delicious prepared meals for you to take home. My last trip to this store found me full of surprise when I saw the one type of coffee, which I love and have shipped from Europe, sitting on the display shelf behind the counter. It was a bag of Nescafe 3in1 Hungarian coffee (15-20 pouches I think). I asked how much the whole bag was not that I really cared since I was going to buy it at any cost but it was something like $8-$10.  Almost ready to pay, the fat owner comes out from the back and sees the friendly girl who served my about to ring up this fantastic coffee (did I mention I love it?). He grabs the bag with his fat greasy fingers and says that the price is wrong, that's the old price. Then he proceeds to tack on an additional $6! WTF?! I was desperate since this coffee was only available in Europe and I used to drink it all the time. I reluctantly bought knowing that they had seen me for the last time. Typical Hungarian mentality. This was one of the reasons that Hungary completely lost most of it's tourism for decades. Screw the customer. Well, my coffee is now readily available in almost every supermarket so greasy slim can change his prices all he wants!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know there were Hungarian groceries in the City! What a nice surprise to find the Hungarian Honey Bear right in my hood! The tiny weeny shop is in a strip plaza on Sheppard. It's really tiny, but it's between Bayview and Yonge on the South side of Sheppard.    The shop consists of mainly a larger counter/display that spans the entire length of the store.  There's a small selection of Hungarian pre-package groceries, but the main attraction (at least for me) was the dessert display! They have a good selection of Hungarian desserts. All the prices are written on the display glass, so even if you don't know what it is and want to try, you won't be surprised when it hits the register!   We tried some coffee liquor dessert. It tasted like the Italian Tiramisu. But the Hungarian version has nuts and raisins and was surrounded by whipped cream. It was actually really good and rich, one small container, which I think costs less than $4, was more than enough for two people!"}
{"text":"This place is all right.  They do have lots of chocolates/drinks/canned goods from Hungary that are great. However the actual food there isn't so good, and fresh.  Dont get me wrong the food tastes great, but dont be surprised if you get diarrhea . And make sure you look at the expire date on the products. (This store is known for buying older products from the better hungarian stores in Toronto).   I do recommend this place if your dropping by for a quick snack, or if your craving some hungarian candy or if you want to get some of the traditional egg noodles, but there are definitely better hungarian stores in Toronto."}
{"text":"The cabbage rolls are great! Assortments of chocolates, pantry items, sausages and meats, but check the dates as some items may have sat on the shelf for too long!  Nice place to pop in and check out."}
{"text":"This is a Hungarian grocery/deli store that serves hot meals (except for Sundays I think). I usually get the schnitzel sandwiches here, but the last time I came, I found the schnitzel to be quite salty.  In the sandwich, they add lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard on a kaiser bun.  The store is quite small. They have a small section for desserts as well. I primarily go there if I'm grabbing a quick snack or need a Hungarian item, such as authentic Hungarian paprika. The service is okay, but most people who go there speak primarily Hungarian and same goes for the people who work there. I've noticed that sometimes they close early, or sometimes they run out of hot meals after a certain time, so if you're looking for something specific, it may be best to call ahead of time to find out."}
