{"text":"I hope someone who owns this joint listen to the people, your spot is amazing decor is nice very very clean i was quite impressed for a local place that has class and style but lets talk food, the hakka menu sucked you cant call that hakka food unless the food was hacked to death then cooked, it was bland and some dishes were under seasoned and watery, chilli chicken was way to runny, black pepper corn beef had more pepper corns than beef very strong taste, the fried rice was far from fried it tasted like uncle bens rice and the chowmein was very bland overall the hakka style of cooking was not there and after spending 65 bucks on thoes items it was overpriced and not worth it... little advice if the food is good people will pay to eat from a classy joint... get smart and do it right. Cheers ill be back if u change."}
{"text":"First time there and was pretty impressed. From the outside, it looked like a horrible place (it's in a plaza...), but once you go inside you'll be impressed by the decor.

Sat out on the patio and it was better than expected. Although you're facing Bovaird, it's inside enough that you are not troubled much by the passing cars.

I got the Manchurian and jerk-flavoured chicken wings, the Manchurian ones were great but didn't enjoy the jerk ones.

Definitely coming back for the patio!"}
{"text":"The food was alright. Chilli beef not at all what I was expecting. The 5 cheese lobster dip was amazing which would have increased my rating for this place. 

What really brought my rating down for this place was the mandatory gratuity. It was only my girlfriend and I, not a party of 6 or more where I would actually find that acceptable. And they charged gratuity on the after tax amount. Didn't even do it properly."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until I came across it on yelp. This restaurant is located in the corner of a plaza strip, not hard to find. There is a lounge side with loud music and a bar and a dining side which is more quiet and pretty empty when we were dining in. The food was fairly good, the poutine which was excellent, the nacho's were okay and forgot what kind of dip we had accompanied by pita's was good. There menu was pretty odd with a mixture of hakka food and Italian, I guess they are still figuring out what will be their specialty dish since they are new. The only reason this place kind of thrown us off when the manager or boss kept  sneaking behind our server every time she was taking too long to place our order on the ipad. She was on training but he was making so awkward and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Do have to say, I was a little spectacle, but wings we actually very good, the menu is interesting if you like to try something different.  I had a chicken burger which was very good.  Owners have to stop hanging out at the bar, looks a little cheesy, they need to take an example from their competitors across the street, Jack Astors, Moxies, Shoeless etc and keep it corporate!  Staff still a little new but they are trying.  I will be going back for sure.   I will update if anything changes the second time around."}
{"text":"I ordered lobster and spinach dip, chicken tacos, calamari and beef sliders. The food was absolutely terrible! Calamari was rubbery and barely battered.  The beef slider was awful. It was like eating hard beef with jam. 

If you want to come here for drinks then that's fine. Venue isn't bad to watch sports. 

Wouldn't come back here. 

Server was nice but also busy. Not their fault. Management should perhaps hire more staff. They were the only person working."}
{"text":"Bunch of thugs always hanging around the plaza. Maybe it's because it's located near brisdale. The environment is pretty crappy and staff very rude. Not a place for an average decent person."}
{"text":"Came for shisha. Ordered drinks, took 15 minutes to come. Shisha took another ten.

Tried the pineapple, absolutely horrible. Not only was it falling apart nor pulling, the customer service was awful. The manager came out and instead of listening to my kind request, she spoke down to me and my friends. Personally not a fan of being talked down to.

Can't imagine this place to be good."}
{"text":"Last minute decision for where to go for drinks and a bite with friends...Slumdog?? Sure, the name fit the mood. Haha!

This is your typical sports bar/restaurant, large TV screens playing all the local sports team games.... In one long glance I saw basketball, hockey, and soccer....OH MY!

The crowd this Friday night was heavy on testosterone as I walked in with my guy friends and heard cheering from the bellows of a manly octave. 

It was the restaurants anniversary so the place and staff were dressed up pretty fancy.. Not sure what the norm is here as this was my first time...

I like that the seating had options of couches around a table, booths and free standing tables and chairs in the middle of the room. 

Fridays are Mojito night so I indulged myself to three of those yummy puppies!

Trying to be a little more health conscious, i picked a spinach, strawberry, goat cheese salad. It was a little heavy on the dressing but my fault for not asking for it on the side. My friend had the hot wings, doused in Frank's red hot! Yum! I had two to taste! If I wasn't feeling so glutton-guilty I would have ordered the Jamaican Jerk wings! 

The strange thing we all noticed at 10pm, the lights went way down and the lazer lights came out, the music got louder and it turned my rating from a 4/5 to a 3/5. It felt like they were going for more of a club atmosphere then. I had to raise the volume of my voice to talk to my friends and almost take out a flashlight to finish my food. LOL. A nice touch would have been to take out some little candles for the tables. All of us looked a little confused, I'm guessing this is something they did just because it was a special night for them. But if I'm coming here again after 10pm i'll call ahead to see if i'm coming to a club or a restaurant atmosphere. 

Overall I'm a fan, I just preferred to be able to see and hear this time around :D"}
{"text":"Had my first experience here at few days ago. The place itself is nice, lots of televisions to watch the various sports games on and a decent amount of seating. However, I felt that the food was overpriced for the quality that I was given. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. This also came with a small portion of coleslaw. The toppings in the sandwich were used sparingly and the fries were not cooked all the way through. I think this place has a lot of potential to be a great place to wait any sports game with some improvements to their food."}
{"text":"Came here twice for the chicken BLT poutine and have enjoyed it the two times.

The poutines seem to be the thing to order, at this place.  Don't deviate poutine will not dissapoint."}
{"text":"We got to try this place out after the movies on Tuesday. It had good music playing and the atmosphere was nice. As we got in the place wasn't busy, also it was a Tuesday night. We were able to get a booth and we were greeted with the menu and some water. The waitress was really nice and gave some recommendations on customer favorites and her favorite dishes. We all ended up getting chow mein, two chicken and one veggie. The chicken one was spicy but it was manageable. We also tried some dessert, The Trio which was Indian style Kulfi (Popsicle), like the name they gave us three favors. Perfect for us, cause there were three of us. The favors we got were Mango, Pistachios, and Pina Colada. All three favors tasted amazing. Overall the food and service was amazing, and the prices were decent. I would definitely recommend this place for Hakka food."}
{"text":"Just picked up takeout from this place. Paid almost $15 bucks for an order of chilli beef and received about a quarter of the container filled with beef the rest was all gravy. Are you kidding me? Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Modern and upscale decor and environment; bright and lots of room to circulate without that typical tight and congested feeling at bars and restaurants. The food is great, lots of selection and many specials to choose from. I found it easy to feed my son although he's usually extremely picky when it comes to food. Overall great place, I'm sure it will become very popular once the word starts to spread."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try as it is the only walkable neighbourhood bar. It is a decent enough space to hang out , interiors are designed to give a sports like feel.
Not too highly priced for drinks and food. The crowd is a little let down which doesnt give you a pub/sports bar feel!"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago tried the Hakka food (green curry chicken)  was actually very good.. 
And the fish and chips were too.. 
Then I came back today and had the nachos, tandoori fajitas and kids had the grill cheese and cheese pasta.. 
The food was way below average the nachos were dry barely any cheese and it was mozzarella and not nacho cheese barely any toppings.. 
The grill cheese was just flat bread with some mozzarella shredded on top like a side of garlic bread very bland tasting.. 
The fajitas weren't that great either.. 
Raw hard veggies covered in a sauce that was burning on the sizzling griddle.. 
Tasted burnt and again not much flavor.. The pasta was good as was the sweet potato fries.. 
I do love the ambiance and the Hakka food and maybe the Chinese is good too.. 
But as of what I ate today not at all pretty disappointed.."}
{"text":"There's a reason the parking lot was empty.

Come here if you want dry, BUT half raw, overpriced wings, accompanied by a side of carrot and celery sticks, on top of a bed of beautifully softened and black rotting veggie dotted 5-day old Costco garden salad. The butter chicken poutine was equally unimpressive: composed of package powder sauce on shoestring fries and four pieces of cheese.

Mmmm the taste of mediocrity.

Come here for drinks... but don't get the 9 oz. rosé because that's a rip off. Math is hard, I guess.

Maybe they should have spent less money and attention on the decor and more on the quality of the food.

At least the waitresses are hot/nice. Extra star for that."}
{"text":"Ok this probably is the classiest place in Brampton.  I was completely surprised how the inside was compared to the outside.  2 notes:
1. this is a great place for locals.  Do not waste your time just to check this place out if you live far away.
2. If i was reviewing the hakka, this probably would be 2 star, but keep in mind its called Slumdog BAR AND GRILL.  (keywords...it does not ever say hakka)  Stay away from the hakka.  this is the negative thing only.

Now i been here a few times, sometimes for a beer, sometimes to watch UFC as they do show it.  UFC does get packed so come early.

I really did enjoy there hamburgers, and wings.  Pretty damn good and very filling.  Beers are decently priced, and very cold :)  Once again..stick to the normal menu and avoid Hakka.   

The staff is great, never had an issue.  Very polite from the manager/door man or whatever he does (seems like a lot) to the waitresses that always make sure the beer is full :)

Lots of T.Vs to watch the game.  Sometimes the music does get to loud on a weekend, but meh...your at a bar.  And you can get the stereotypical brampton wannabe thugs in here.  but they are harmless.

Once again, this is a place i would not say you have to come visit from all over.  But for people who are local to here, great place for a drink or watch the game."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. Food on the other hand was unfortunately not my favourite. We ordered from the Hakka side of the menu. It was nothing amazing. Pretty plain and lacked the classic Hakka flavour. I will probably give it another chance and order some non-Hakka items."}
{"text":"It's a very clean place with an amazing atmosphere especially on big game nights and on the weekend when the DJ spins the music. The menu consists of bar food and hakka food. I tried the hakka selection and it was extremely flavorful. My friend is a vegetarian, so we tried their veggie spring rolls  and they were amazing! If you're looking for a local chill spot on big game nights and a place to let loose this is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"Clean place, friendly staff and overpriced drinks... Just your run of the mill bar, which attempts to change itself into a club/lounge on Friday and Saturday by cranking the music with no dance floor...um. We got there at nine and were done screaming over the music to try and have a conversation by eleven. It is fine to play music but upping the volume so high that people beside each other cannot speak to each other is just disrespectful. 
As for the food, meh...I ordered the spinach and lobster dip, it was incredibly cheesy which was not specified in the menu and just didn't go well with the lobster. A big disappointment. 
The drinks? I ordered the Blue margarita and it tasted like it was made with rum instead of tequila. Not impressed. 
I really wish my friends and I did not choose to come here to catch up because it was just a night of let downs. My friends were awesome though."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner. Service was very good and the food was nice too. The interior of the restaurant is well done. I plan on coming back to watch a UFC fight and some drinks on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Had a few drinks here and a order of chicken wings. 

The ambiance and decor was very good and it felt like I was in a much better restaurant then the location suggest. 

The wings were big and juicy.  A lot better then most wings I've had. I had the dry rub jerk if I recall correctly.  My sister ordered take out once and it was the worst Hakka food I've ever tasted. So I'd say the menu is hit or miss. 

The service was really lacking. Took a while to get a order in and once it was in it took a while to get our beer and food. Oh well. 

I would try it again just for the fact it's close to home."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out. The food choices and drink choices are really good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place used to be good when it first opened, since then no one is at the font to seat you, the calamari is okay, the jerk chicken is great. 

Don't bother with the hakka menu, or dessert, you wil be heavily disappointed.

The only thing worth ordering is the jerk chicken wings and calamari on a skillet. 

Previously, I went weekly just for the wings, but I can only eat jerk wings so many times. They need to fix up the service and menu to suit items the can cook well"}
{"text":"it's a good place for some drinks(limited choice) and pub and Chinese food options. Not all the listed tap  beer options are available.  place is mostly filled with men. Service was good except the owner( older lady) seems to be always after the servers. sort of make you feel uncomfortable to see  how she talks her employees."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere were good, food was very very bland and over priced. Drinks were very expensive! A regular cocktail for $8.50!?! Not going back...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday. Still fairly new so most people don't know it's there. But it looks awesome inside. Cool pub/bar feel and really nice decor inside. The service was decent and the food was good. If your looking for a place to watch a game i'd recommend this place. They have a lot of tv's inside!"}
{"text":"First impression was good, fun atmosphere with good tunes, friendly & smiling staff.   

Drinks looked great but not boozy, very watered down.  

Menu had promise but such a wide range of variation that is very hard to cover well in a small kitchen.  

Last but not least, the amount of cleavage among the staff was scandalous.  It even distracted my female friends who are all curvy and mature.  

I wouldn't go back on purpose unless there was a change in menu focus or a better bar program."}
