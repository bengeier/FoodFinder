{"text":"I live in The san francisco bay area.  I know good german food - especially sasuages!!
This place is GREAT!!  I found some old favorites as well as some I had not experienced.  while my friend had her nails done in the same strip mall, I really enjoyed myself at tina;s !!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service and wonderful products. We bought some smoked salmon and smoked mackerel. I should have taken pictures before wolfing everything down!

The prices might seem high, but you get what you paid for. The salmon especially had a nice flavor, and the smokiness wasn't overwhelming. The quality is much better than what you'd find at local grocery stores."}
{"text":"We ate lunch next door at the Mediterranean place and my husband was pretty disappointed, and as we drove to get out of the plaza, he saw this place and said, \"I would have MUCH rather eaten at a sausage house!\" So I told him we should go check it out, and boy am I glad I did. There were so many smoked fish, sausages, salami, pickles, sweets, etc etc that it was almost overwhelming. My husband didn't really know where to start, but the ladies at the counter were so helpful, offering samples of everything so we could taste before buying. While literally everything in that store looked delicious, we ended up with a piece of smoked pork (our car smelled of bacon the drive home, it smelled AMAZING), some sort of coffee cake with nuts that was also incredible, and something that I don't know what to call it other than a chicken fritter (or maybe chicken pancake?), and that was amazing too. We also almost bought a piece of smoked salmon, but I think we'll come back for that. My husband would have bought everything in the store if we could have. Can't wait to come back next time. We've been living in Vegas for 8 months now, and this is by far our favorite place, and we just found it by accident. Why are you still reading this? Go there. Now."}
{"text":"Excellent product with superior service. While in the store, I was offered a taste of all smoked and cooked products I was interested in. Of course, you should not taste raw meat. 

Tonight I prepared
2 types of sausage. Polish smoked and Polish fresh.  Fresh was simmered first then put on top of potatoes and sauerkraut along with the smoked. Baked at 350 for one hour. 

Both had amazing flavor. But then I realized, there was almost no fat. How nice to find a place that sells a more healthy sausage. 

Also purchased smoked Hungarian sausage and that was dried. Surprisingly beautiful flavor with the right amount of chew. Great for appetizers. 

Finally purchased some rice sausage that had to hit the freezer. Too much for one person 

I was offered fresh European bread baked in the store. 

I had forgotten my ice block for my insulated bag, and they were happy to give me a small bag of ice to get the products home fresh. This may seem like a small thing, but the temperature was about 110   degrees. I am certainly happy with both the products and service."}
{"text":"Wow! My family had the best mixed grill meal thanks to Tina's. We had the bratwurst, Hungarian sausage, and the German loaf meat. The kraut and German potato salad were also excellent. The owner talked to us for a while and gave us samples to taste things when we asked. My Hungarian mother was excited to read the labels and see the products from Hungary."}
{"text":"Recently, my German friends had a party and served very tasty LeberKass from Tina's Gourmet Sausage House & Deli. The following day I headed to Tina's European style deli to take home some of their scratch made food offerings myself. 

From the moment I walked in, I was offered free samples of lightly house smoked meats including pork belly, ribs, and various smoked fish. These meats weren't smoked using typical American heavy smoke BBQ smoking methods. Instead these meats and fish were delicately smoked in Tina's kitchen, which gave their smoked meats a light golden, almost orange, color. YUM!

Tina's homemade sausages are incredible. Bratwurst, both regular & spicy, knockwurst, frankfurters, Hungarian, and Polish kielbasa, are all Tina's special recipes. For a change of pace they offer chicken bratwurst as well. 

Fresh homemade cabbage rolls are sold in meat, vegetarian, and vegan versions. House made schnitzel, chicken soup, German potato salad, slaw's, European style breads, and a nice variety of European cheeses, round out the deli counter offerings at Tina's. This is all GOOD STUFF! 

Break away from the typical mass produced, overly process, meats and foods sold at most Vegas deli's. Stop by Tina's, next to Trader J's on Decatur, and take home fresh made European style food, made with the love and passion of its owners. Tina's Gourmet Sausage House and Deli is a \"REAL DEAL FOODIE EXPERIENCE\", and has earned them my support, and the support of the Las Vegas \"Good Tasting Community\". ......Taste Tina's for yourself, YOU WILL BE AMAZED!"}
{"text":"This shoppe is right next to Trader Joe's and it's freaking delicious!  Try a sample of anything before you buy it?  Amazing.  All their sausages are made on premises and it's super fresh.  I LOVE the German sausage the best.  The Portuguese Hawaiian style sausage is another favourite.  The staff is super friendly, the prices are very reasonable.  I got four huge links for about $15.  Be sure to try their European groceries and the cheese counter as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time after shopping at Trader Joe's. Very friendly. Tried sample of smoked salmon, sausage, homemade bread, chicken cutlet and ended up buying everything I tried.lol. Soooooo good."}
{"text":"New international market specializing in Eastern European delicacies.  Loads of sausages and other processed meats and pickled specials made on premises and a wide selection of imported meats and cheeses from Germany, Poland, Hungary and Romania. There are also ready to eat hot food specials available (wienerschnitzel, blintzes, etc.).  Food and accents are extremely authentic.  I am told they will stay carrying European style breads soon as well.  If you miss Eastern Europe, you need to get here soon!"}
{"text":"I have previously ordered the German Leberkasse (liver cheese famous in Munich Germany, but lately I have seen only olive or meat infused in the leberkasse. On several occasions they said they would prepare more. The third time I returned, and the owner said \"he didn't have time.\" I have decided not to return after this rude comment."}
{"text":"Very KUHL samples... The staff will let you try most of the items and even warm it up for you. Selected a few different sausages for the home Chef days.. Had mostly all of the ones purchased, they're all pretty good.. Will go back when the area for sure... J K Tasty KUHL!"}
{"text":"Awesome little store bunch of goodies in there fresh meats Deli fish, all the sausages are made in-house smoked salmon is off the hook also have butterfish ahi tuna and various other meats.."}
{"text":"First time here, we were impressed by the selection of Eastern European goods and a large selection of homemade sausages. We bought a lot! The pretty blonde gal at the counter was very charming and sweetly devious, giving us samples that convinced Hubby to buy more (despite my warning him that he was buying more than we could possibly eat).

First, the pork schnitzels. Hubby warmed one up in a pan for us to share (they're big). Definitely impressed by the flavor and quality, probably the best schnitzel I've ever had. Growing up in Iowa, those are more common than burgers, and Iowa is the pork headquarters of the USA. And yet, from a small shop in Las Vegas, the best! 

We bought both German and Russian potato salads. I've only sampled them so far, but both are excellent. I was a bit afraid of the Russian one, it looked like it was a heavy mayonnaise base but happily it was light.

We sampled the smoked salmons at the shop, looking forward to getting that on the next visit.

Layered chocolate creme cake - huge piece, not overpoweringly sweet, very good.

Blood sausage - I'll admit to getting this info 2nd hand from Hubby, but he says the sausage is very authentic and minerally (apparently that's a good thing).

Meat Patties - no clue what all is in them, but they look like fat hamburger patties but they taste more like meatloaf. They're very good, and apparently they're \"Just like Oma used to make!\"

Lieberkaese - sampled that in the store but haven't gotten into the stuff we bought yet. It's very good, rather like a high quality deli bologna.

We still haven't tried the cabbage rolls, those will be eaten today. Based on their store popularity, I'm sure they'll be good.  Same with the brats.

Do I think we bought more than we can handle? Yep. Do we regret any of it? Nope. :D"}
{"text":"Best Schnitzel in town.
Great German bread.
Very friendly, very helpful,
Great sausage to.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The products in Tina's bring me back good memories from home, specially when I was growing up. They offer a great variety of home made sausages and specialty deli style meats. 
Besides, you can find European cheeses, salads, frozen items that are hard to find in your regular grocery stores, pickles of all kinds and my favorite sweets and chocolates.
The owners are very nice and they'll most likely let you try some of their yummy samples. 
Def recommended"}
{"text":"Fresh made sausage and fresh made bread.  It's like an old time butcher shop and it's delightful.  In fact we ran into two people we knew while we were there and they both gave us rave reviews on this place and gave us personal tips on their favorite foods here.  We loaded up on sausage,  breaded pork loin,  chicken blintzes,  havarti cheese and an assortment of cookies, and left with a promise to be back this week for more goodies. We brought the food home and had an extravaganza!!  The only thing we wanted to add to this place is we thought they should offer to make sandwiches there on the spot, but it's all good."}
{"text":"I sampled their Portuguese sausage, smoked bacon, and smoked butterfish, and I'd have to say that they were the best homemade meats I've ever tasted. I ordered and paid for four pounds of the bacon, which they vac packed for me to take home to Hawaii. Unfortunately when I went to pick it up before heading to the airport, they closed a little earlier than normal and I couldn't bring home the bacon.

Fortunately, Zoya, the owner, is responsible and responsive and resolved it quickly. I'd give them four or five stars if I could have enjoyed a full meal with the bacon. It's more like 3.5 stars for the good samples and Zoya's great customer service. I'll give them more stars when I get to enjoy a full purchase."}
{"text":"I been smoking fish in Hawaii for the last 5 years, i was attracted to the sign that say smoked ahi so we go in and explore and tasted some samples. We found out the owner has been smoking meat and fish for over 30 years. Skeptical at.first but We bought smoked mackarel, trout and chicken.

We just ate for dinner the smoked fish and my reaction was WOW ! that was onolicious, not salty,  balance flavor and you can taste a slight hint of the mesquite wood. We're coming back to buy some more different items  this week and maybe give some as a gift
Great find in vegas!!"}
{"text":"My husband doesnt eat meat, but I do, so we paid this place a visit. It was certainly a large selection of sausages, so I had a few samples, and then settled on a few to take home with me. They were all good - just nothing outstanding, so I dont think I would go back here, unless I was really in the mood for some more sausage! :)"}
{"text":"We totally lucked out finding this gem.  Best food, great selection of food, super suggestions and help."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place while exploring the area as I just moved here. What a fantastic little place... Great food and excellent customer service... This will for sure be a place I will frequent.

Highly recommend you try it"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name, this isn't a sausage-based restaurant but more of a Eastern European grocery with a large deli stocked with plenty of sausage. Deli area also has ready-made items like fresh pickles, salads, schnitzel, and stuffed cabbage rolls. 

Pricing is pretty fair and the selection of meats and cheeses is good, but I'm hoping they add more items as the settle in. I would specifically like to see olivier salad and a selection of breads- as it is, I need to stop next door at TJ's if I want to make a sandwich with the deli goods purchased here. Staff is friendly and happy to offer samples- ask for the salmon!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. It's German and Russian owned from what I could gander and the sausage, salads and smoked fishes are all homemade right there at the store. You can get take out where they heat the offerings up for you and make a little lunch plate. In fact, I saw quite a few locals come in for lunch and do just that. 

I wanted to buy one of everything. I was cautioned that these are not loaded with preservatives and that they all were fresh, so ordering smaller quantities, but stopping by more frequently would be a wise decision. 

The star of the show was the smoked butterfish. I intended to eat it cold with crackers, but I ended up baking it for dinner for my husband and me. It was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic and delicate. I will absolutely be back and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I work across the street, so when this place opened up I was pretty excited to try something new. They actually came and served some food at my work, which is when I first gave it a try. The food was great and got me to go in and get more. My second visit, the food just tasted kind of off. I was a little disappointed, but I didn't want to let that ruin it because the first time was amazing! I went in a third time and got something similar. Again, it just tasted off. 4 hours later I couldn't get up off of the toilet and was also puking my guts up. I won't ever go back there again."}
{"text":"This place is very good..! It reminds me of my childhood growing up in New Jersey. My grandfather was a chef from Germany and this taste just as I remember. The owner and the women helping us were very friendly and offered up plenty of samples. I highly recommend this place.....thanks guys for the awesome sausages. Quality and passion are hard to find these days..!"}
{"text":"I had lunch nearby at Amena Deli and I stopped in here to check the place out.  So glad I did because this place definitely merits a return visit.

If you like smoked foods, this place is Heaven!  All kinds of smoked meats and fish.  Pickled vegetables, too.  

I'm definitely going back for a little Polish Ham.  At $7.99/lb they're practically giving the stuff away.  

I definitely need some smoked Ahi.  It's $24.99/lb.  I'm probably going to have to save my allowance a couple weeks to afford some of that, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  Because, Ahi!

Mikey C says: I'm coming back for you, my little Polish Ham!"}
{"text":"I've stared in the windows for months leading up to the opening of Tina's,  trying to imagine what sort of restaurant it would be...  I'd been busy,  but today I got locked out of my car while shopping at Trader's and I couldn't be more glad because I finally got to check it out and Amazing!!!  

It may not be a restaurant,  but it's the even rarer treat of a specialty grocer/deli.  Not only does it have lots of packaged  Eastern Europe/Russian goodies and pickled tastiest and cheeses and soda curiosities and a feast for a curious mind but the meat counter is heaven.  According to the counter gal,  the owner had stocked Whole Foods for years before starting the store and the quality of their wares is such,  I don't doubt her pitch.  

Everything is made in house: from the baked goods, to the hand cured meats and sausages, to the flavorful 'salad' items. And they encourage you to try everything!  Their pride in their work was infectious and even as the lovely sales lady was up selling us on all the things we tried I didn't feel pressured,  just swept away with the delightful turn of an unexpected evening. 

Husband man and I had an easy delicious dinner at home thanks to them and the money we spent on our total purchase (full of additional items for our week) cost only as much as a semi decent dinner out. I will be back and I hope you will take a chance to wander in to their charming home -  so they can stay in business for years to come.  

Ps: They respond well to the suggestions of their customers. Fresh in house bread has already been added to their stock and sandwiches are next to come,  according to the storeman."}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli in vegas to pick up sausages and all kinds of smoked fish!   Generous samples and excellent quality"}
{"text":"The people behind the counter were really nice. They let me and my friend try out a bunch of samples of their home made products and all were pretty delicious. The chicken patty one was the best though."}
{"text":"I had been putting off coming here because I'm not much of a sausage eater and it's kinda out of my way. Well, I happened to be in the area so I stopped in. 

I was the only person in the store and I took my time and looked at everything. There are all kinds of fun things to try from Caviar to cookies. I wanted some of everything but I resisted. I was hungry and there for the bratwurst. So, I made my way to the back deli counter. There are many kinds of sausage to choose from as well as various sides. Everything looked good. I had some questions about bratwurst and the woman behind the counter let me try them so that I could tell which one I liked. I loved them both. She had also just brought out some schnitzel and gave me a sample of that as well. It was absolutely incredible. I bought one bratwurst and some sauerkraut for a quick dinner in my car. 

Let me just say this, I went to my car, realized I didn't have a fork, didn't care, ate every bit of it with my fingers and immediately regretted that I didn't buy at least 2 of everything she had. 

I dug around for a napkin, picked the kraut out of my hair and went back to get more. By then there were several people waiting in line and I was out of time and had to leave. I went home sad, very, very sad. 

I think I made a rookie mistake: I hadn't been there before, I didn't know what a lot of it was, I was just there to try it, I can only eat so much, blah blah... When you go, don't be me.

It's like this, EVERYTHING was good. Next time, I'll be getting as much as I can afford and just eat on it for days and I am not kidding. Once you try her schnitzel or sausages you will NOT be the same and I'm not even all that in to sausage. Even her sauerkraut beats any I have ever had anywhere in my life including Munich Germany.  

You do realize that the only reason I am writing this review is because I am fantasizing about the food and absolutely obsessing about when I'll be able to make it back over there again, right?"}
{"text":"On my second visit , to my new Favorite Deli on planet Earth, was happily surprised not only had the varieties of sausages expanded , with seafood sausage that was Excellent ; in taste , texture, and quality. 
 As we were ordering , the Chef came and told me he would be making LAMB Sausage also soon! To the Mediterranean , middle Eastern Folks I beg you to come sample and keep a Honest Man going. 

  I'm on a limited Diet due to Crohn's, and this place is solid Good ! Do what I do , order 3 Things from each case, and you will be over joyed ! 

 Even the next day before setting out with my family guests, we ate the left over Seaweed Salad, Butter Fish, and Smoked salmon, which we honestly think is the best ever!
And The Prettiest Sales Lady too
Thank You For Food Made With Love"}
{"text":"Oh wow this is good. We just moved to Spring Valley and have had to pass this plaza a few times but for company this weekend we stopped in for some delicacies.
I just paced and paced and enjoyed the view of Bulgarian feta, sour cherries, blintzes, sausages, salmons, seasoned cooked chickens, noodles of all kinds, hams, salamis, pickles, Armenian eggplant sauce, pickled mushrooms, breads, pretzels, Russian and international cookies, chocolate treats, cheeses, unique beverages, pastas with fillings, grape leaves, German plum and berry cake, apple pie, and on and on and everything so delicious.
We got 6 lbs of sausage, some apricot filled chocolate covered gingerbread, herring, and some of the cooked chicken and onions.  Of course while we were shopping the very helpful young woman at the counter fed us more samples than all aproned people serving treats at the Costcos in New Jersey all at once. We tried ham, chicken, sausage and then she pulled out a little plate of different foods: including the best potato salad. We had left our dinner marinating at home while we shopped. I have no right to eat anything now til Midnight!
We just moved here from LA and missed Schreiner's German deli in Montrose near Glendale. The woman at the counter told us that they had just opened this shop 2 months previously. 
Well we think we have found most of what we need for my dear Bulgarian chef who misses his Westfalian ham from Schreiner's.  We shall return. What a treat and also a great spot for those lovely little Christmas surprises you would want to put under the tree as well.
I have not really covered all the amazing treasures here so you should really check out Tina's."}
{"text":"I just happened by this place, located in a strip mall.

Earlier this day, I was on the hunt for some Fois gras de Canard. I just came back from a vacation in France and was craving pâté.

I entered in this little shop and found so many crackers, sweets, canned goods, wines, sauces, cakes, cheeses, sausages, smoked fish, and many , many other items that I had seen in Europe.

I thought, what a great place! 

I continued to check out all the wonderful items until - \"Boom!\", right in my face, I found my Fois gras!!

Of course, this place is far from where I actually live, so I had bought a couple of packages!

If you've been to Europe, or you just love sausages, this is the place to go to!

:)"}
{"text":"Found this by accident--after shopping at Trader Joes!  What a find!  Got a few free samples, got hooked and now make it a regular stop before heading home to Hawaii.  The butterfish is to die for!  Sausages and bacon, bacon, bacon!  They cut it and freeze it for you to take home!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you.  This is way more than just a gourmet sausage house.  The owner Mike is fantastic.  We just purchased smoked Ahi tuna, Greek sheep cheese, fish sausage, spiced Hungarian head cheese, dry hang spiced Hungarian land jagger sausage, yogurt soda and sprats in oil.

If you haven't shopped here you are missing out on one of the gems of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My beloved Russian grandmother made stuffed cabbage, blintz, and many Eastern European dishes for her family.  After eating the stuffed cabbage and unbelievable Napoleons from Tina's I want to call it My Grandma's Kitchen! Soooo goooood!!!

The filing in the cabbage was firm and moist, the cabbage melted in my mouth, and the tomato based sauce was smooth and without that acid aftertaste.  Unexpected was the creamy light Napoleon.  Unlike most American bakery Napoleons, it did not have the powdered sugar and chocolate drizzle on top.  It looked dense, almost like cheesecake; in the display case, but the moment I put a fork in it, the flakey pastry started deflating and the creamy filling oozed out. My moans of delight made my dogs come running over.

Also worth mentioning is the diverse selection of groceries that are hard to find outside of Europe. And the pricing is comparable to American products.  For example a jar of rose hip preserves was under $4. 

Finally, I must mention the owner/butcher/chef and his niece understand customer service.  FREE SAMPLES ARE ENCOURAGED....YAY...."}
{"text":"Came here about two years ago when the first open  and now we're back they're super nice people da kine you know busting out all kine samples for make your taste buds all krazy then you end up buying all kine smoke fish, sausage, cookies from U.K, Russia I think all over Europe. Go try'um out"}
{"text":"First visit there and WOW! They have various items from Europe, must for all to visit! German good selections of sausages and selections of good european cheeses. More like a store then restaurant but that good food is good food no matter where you get it from! and yes they do deliver - EAT and Online Restaurants fast as usual!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, as a Pescatarian, at first I even didn't wanna enter to this place. But my meat eater husband insisted to stop by right after the shopping trip to Trader Joe's. OMG They have the best smoked salmon ever! Their items are little bit pricey... I believe smoked salmon was $20 per pound, but it's totally worth it!! Their other fish items, such as ahi poke, fish sausage were great too. Even after Trader Joe's next door got out of business, we still go to this place and end up spending $40 for their gourmet items per visit lol If you're not sure spending that much money for sausages, you should try their items first. The guy works there always generously give us a lot of samples"}
{"text":"3rd trip in 3 years never disappointed.
Got a visit to the back operations.
Always willingly sharing samples before you buy.

Personal favorite smoked butterfish and portuguese sausage.
Always have new items today we tried smoked sturgeon & ahi. Also 3 varieties of beef tougne sausage."}
{"text":"Did the usual Trader Joe's run in Vegas as most Hawaii residents do. The shop next door had a sign that said smoked butterfish ( butter fish) so I went to investigate. It's a European deli with smoked meats and fish. I sampled the butterfish which was to die for as well as the tako (squid) salad and Portuguese sausage. They even sell a hard pear flavored candy from Ukraine which is very tasty. All in all, the service was as good as the food which was fantastic."}
{"text":"The smoke Portuguese sausage broke the mouth, Smoke ham, Smoke Bacon, Smoke Ahi, Fresh Japanese style tako and so much more yummies I love this store you can sample everything the sales girl is super friendly and amazingly nice, knows her products and always helpful will be shopping here offend"}
{"text":"This is a German grocery/deli store located next to Traders Joe. We entered because we saw German sausage sign. Counter lady was eager to help us. She offered few samples of sausages and salami. Good customer service. The sausages are homemade with no preservatives and msg. They were very good. 

They also sell candies and other German groceries that I'm not too familiar with. I wished the store was little bit more organized so I could understand what I was looking at. 

If you're in mood for German homemade sausage this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The offering has the tastes from Eastern Europe that is unique. Every trip to Trader Joes' includes a visit to Tina's.

Andy"}
{"text":"Well, we were disappointed.
First, their website said \"in the Trader Joe's center;\" TJ is no longer there. Second time by we found the address.
Second, for some reason reading the website seemed to imply a possible dining area. We were tasting schnitzel; they had - but for carry out only!
Since we live in Henderson, not really a thing we'd do.
BUT we would return for the sausages!"}
{"text":"Tina's Gourmet Sausages is a European Deli that serves cold cuts, sausages, fish, pasta, and of course pierogis! This place reminds me of a mom and pop deli in the east coast. Definitely brought back memories when I used to live in NY. :) The customer service is really cool. There was a young lady who offered us many samples to try like their smoked fish. It is amaziiiing! The fish just melts in your mouth. If you go, you have to try it! We bought a few of their cold cuts and their pierogis. They carry other brands of pierogis but if you ask, they make their own in the back. Really tasty! Will go back :)"}
{"text":"Ordered Stroganoff, Stuffed Cabbage, and hummis w free puff pastry, delivery.  Food came on time.  Stroganoff was chicken, I'd never heard of chicken stroganoff, I was expecting beef.  I'm German so I would never have guessed it wouldn't be beef.  The chicken was cheap dark meat, chewy, fatty, gristle and had to throw out.  For $16 it should be lean white meat chicken if not a beef stroganoff.  Bottom of pastry was very hard and chewy.  Hummis came without any bread or toast, noting to eat with. I now have to go out to get something to eat it with. Stuff cabbage was great, it was all I had from my order that I could eat."}
{"text":"Finding Tina's newspaper ad in the local RJ, I suddenly felt the need for some international sausage.
Most reviews have gone into great detail about the various meats: well, they are fresh, natural with no preservatives. 

But I want to mention Michael and Zoya, owner and manager, respectively.
Their courteous service and willingness to engage clients in friendly banter creates an ambience that no chain store in Las Vegas can match. 

My wife is an Asian foodie with high standards... she was very content with today's selections. Myself being Scots-Irish/German, I loaded up with a copious quantity of fresh sausage for the weekend.

Tina's Gourmet Sausage House resembles a small European grocery store, with packaged and frozen goods from several countries located at the front, and the meat department at the rear.  The ambiance I mentioned makes for a very pleasurable experience. Michael's positive attitude made us feel right at home. No more buying smoked meats and sausages from a chain store."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE. it's a market as well, With lots of goodies. Everything we tried was delicious, fresh, homemade. It's a small store so you can feel the love put into this gem. I would only send you here if you want gourmet. 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Friendly service. I got the Polish sausage meal with potatoes and cucumber salad. Very tangy and simple. Nothing fancy but comforting like someone's grandma made it. I also grabbed some kraut to eat through the week. It was dry and a bit greasy (from the bacon I'm assuming) but still pretty good. I personally prefer juicy kraut but it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"The owner is super helpful and gives you tastes of lots of goodies! The sausages are terrific and tasty as is the fish. My husband said the fish reminded him of his childhood (high praise from the hubby). Stop in and grab some of the fresh items for your next meal. You will be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"A little odd place with a little Russian person working that had a somewhat of hard time understanding us. She was nice and offered a sample but still not real comfortable answering questions, etc. We asked if she was \"Tina\" and she said no. So, just a part time helper that was left alone but she seems nervous and unknowledgeable about the products. As we do... we went through the whole store... shelves were pretty bare and the products they do have, were very spread out to make it look fuller. We picked up several things from the floor and freezer, picked out some fresh sausage for the meat counter, a couple of things from the fresh salads case and 2 desserts. Everything was pretty good that we got... Sadly, not everything made it to our bags. My only guess, is when she was relocation all of our choices from the back of the store, to the check out area at the front of the store, a few things clearly didn't make it, sadly. We were not a big fan of the carrot cake... I'm guessing a good service provides this but the Baklava was wonderful. The cucumber, tomato and onion blend was fantastic. The sausage was good but would have purchased more if we had a clearer understanding of the different types from the person waiting on us. Unfortunately, she was the only one there and we were on our own, for the most part. And disappointed that not all of our choices actually made it to check out. 
Maybe, we will give it another try when
\"Tina\" is there, herself."}
{"text":"Located right next to Trader Joe's this little shop is a must stop!  The lady inside is extremely nice and offers samples of all the smoked sausages and fish (Saba, ahi, salmon, butterfish). Everything we tried was delicious! For us traveling back to Hawaii she offered to vacuum seal our purchase and even freeze it for us since we pre ordered it. Can't wait to share what we bought back home. This will definitely be a stop for us when coming to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great deli! They have a wide selection of sausages, deli meats and prepared foods such as stuffed cabbage and soup. They also stock a lot of Eastern European groceries. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I plan to make this a regular stop on my weekly trips to Trader Joe's next door."}

Located on South Decatur, in the same plaza as Mochiko Chicken, Amena Bakery and Trader Joes, Tina's Gourmet Sausage House is one of those places potential patrons pass by without giving a second thought while individuals opting to take a step inside are in for something quite uncommon in society of commoditized Fast Food.

Owned by Michael Ray and managed by a young woman named Zoya, Tina's is one part artisan Sausage maker and one part importer/purveyor of European specialty goods, a quick look at shelves displaying everything from Breads and Candies to Jams and Pickles, the refrigerator against the wall loaded with imported Dumplings while deli cases sport everything from Organic Sliced Meats to Smoked Fish, Salads and Sausages, at least eight varieties available daily with more depending on special requests or the Chef's choice.

Moving the business from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in 2015, but originally learning the art of encased Meats when growing up in Ukraine, a brief talk with Michael quickly displays his passion for the craft and after discussing the subtle nuances differentiating several products the decision was made to compose an order of six items, Imported German Bread hot from the oven added last minute and split with another patron at $2.50 per half-loaf.

Unfortunately told that few of the desserts are made in-house, the majority actually frozen imports that are either ready when thawed or requiring of little heating time, it was with a bite of Sourdough that the tasting got started and with a robust crust overlying a soft crumb with gentle sours the flavor was everything one might expect from Rye, though a bit of butter may have helped in areas near the heel where the center was dried out.

Finding samples of the Portuguese Sausage less spicy than expected, the texture snappy and proper but not nearly as complex and well-composed as the Hungarian Kielbasa that compared favorably to memories from my youth, it was onward to a chilly Cod and Catfish link that was a bit *too* fishy that the tasting moved forward, only half eaten and really no better once it was warmed up.

Far more affordable than one might anticipate, the whole lot of food only $22.54, Chicken Schnitzel was an interesting dish in that it featured an amalgam of dark and light meat fried together with Bread Crumbs, the Stuffed Cabbage featuring a lot more filler and less meat than my Grandmother's with no favors done to it by the watery pink Sauce.

Passing on Brownies, Blondies and outsourced Pies, instead selecting two Cakes imported from overseas and finished in Tina's oven, dessert proved to be as mixed an experience as the savories before it, the Apple Cake almost like Angelfood with less sugar beneath slices of Fruit while the Brown Sugar may as well have needed a chisel to be chipped away from Coffee Cake.

Certainly a unique store worthy of a look for the attention to detail and a true Artisan's touch, Tina's Gourmet Sausage House is best accessed for exactly what the name indicates of it, though the imported goods may offer a bit of additional intrigue to Eastern European immigrants looking for specifics or locals more interested in novelty packaged goods."}
{"text":"This is a rather new Eastern European market that popped up in the a Trader Joe's shopping center. Until now, Jones market was my to go spot. 
 Here are the good points- they do have fresh baked bread, prepared food and bakery goods, and house made sausage, (very reasonably priced). Their biggest plus, however, is service. The owner is incredibly friendly and accommodating, he goes out of his way by offering you samples, chatting, explaining food. I am Russian and interacted with him in Russian and didn't need any explanations, but he engaged my English only speaking spouse, called him by name and chatted him up. Such a nice change from the rays of sunshine behind the deli counter at the Jones market. 
 The opportunity- selection of product is very modest. If you are looking for a one stop shop Eastern European market, this isn't it. But I love the fact that's it's in TJ's parking lot and service is amazing. 
 Word of warning, having read other reviews- this isn't by any means a restaurant. Come here to grab some pre-made Russian and German foods or a few familiar staples like holodez, pelmeni or buckwheat (for my Russian peeps), but this isn't a \"I'll take combo #5\" place."}
{"text":"Was here on a whim. Waiting for some food to be prepared at another shop in this square and thought I should stop by. 

First half of the store is set up to be like a European market. Don't know much about it but they seem to have a lot of British stuff. 

The back half is what brought me in. Very traditional butcher. Lots of different sausages and fish. A lot of it is already smoked. I wasn't going to buy anything but the guy working the counter gave me some samples and I was hooked. I got the spicy sausage, chicken andouille sausage, and octopus salad. The chicken andouille was good but the spicy one had so much flavor. And because both were smoked I didn't have to worry about cooking it before throwing it in a pot or sauce. 

Definitely will be back to try some of the other meats and fish."}
{"text":"I only learned about Tina's a couple weeks ago and am now hooked!  I've got their smoked Chlilian sea bass, smoked salmon, smoked salmon bellies, smoked butter fish, (I obviously like smoke fish), several sausages including Portuguese, kielbasa, and Fresh baked German bread!  Today I brought my wife and she got some Challah bread with raisins!   Next time I'll have to try some of their brats and sour pickles!  Good prices too.... this deli has it all!"}
{"text":"Love the sausage and meats! Always get the smoked salmon. My kids love them. The smoked butter fish is to die for. I eat them with a glass of bourbon and that is how I close my night. All the Eastern European dishes you can find.. well, almost.. I got there every time I shop next door at TJ's."}
{"text":"The name is deceiving. This is not so much a specialty sausage store as it is a small Eastern European grocery store with a low quality deli meat counter in the rear. Some of the gourmet sausages are still in their plastic package casing from Costco and Smart and Final! The Turkey Breast was Jennie-O! Seriously! We waited for over 10 minutes behind a single customer who was obviously a family member or friend of the clerk talking up a storm and visiting. Another gentleman came out of the back to converse with the woman and the clerk. Never once did they acknowledge our presence. This gave us plenty of time to browse the small store. Observed lots of processed and packaged dry goods with interesting looking labels. The pastry items in the deli case looked old and stale. After waiting an additional 5 minutes and getting nobody to assist us with our potential sausage purchase we left and went to Trader Joes next door where we purchased some fresh brats and went home. This place won't last a year if this is the best they can do. Which is sad because I really prefer to support small mom and pops. But this one didn't even try."}
{"text":"If this place does not have a cult following they will!  Sausages for all, they got your chicken, your turkey, obligatory pork.  Amazing selection, I really hope they crank this out of the park!

I am going to be the biggest cheerleader for them."}
