{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. There were a handful of regulars who all knew each other and interacted openly. Welcoming little bar... The burger was prepared as ordered, the fries were hot and fresh, and service was prompt. May add this place to the rotation."}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to this place when we found a coupon for it in the enjoy book. In the past, he raved about how good the food quality was for the price. He was not wrong! We walked in and were instantly greeted by Kelly, the bartender. She was nice, attentive, informative, and called regulars by name. From my understanding, this restaurant use to allow smoking in the building; however, they have redone the inside, added on, and have implemented a no smoking policy - there was no trace of smoke! The bar sits in center of the room as it is visibly the place to be in this establishment.   I was instantly reminded of a sports bar back home. They had a juke box and an area to play darts, making the environment more interactive than in most restaurants.   I have been here twice: the first time I got the special, Turkey Bacon Cheddar Wrap (under $6!!!). It was SO GOOD! Loaded with all three ingredients, hot from the panini grill, and an exceptional portion size. The fries! My goodness, they were homemade and perfectly seasoned. I was so impressed. On my second trip, I ordered a burger, another menu item highly recommended by my husband (and Kelly). It was the BBQ burger and ended up being delicious. Besides the food, they have drink specials every night and live music a couple nights a week to bring people through their doors.   Do not be fooled by the outside appearance of this place - a little drab but it has a lot to offer! Outdoor seating available during the summer, wonderful drink and food specials, very cheaply priced menu and wonderful staff! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Pub burger is excellent. Fries are very good too. Rumors is a great place for locals. It is a smoking bar."}
{"text":"I went here in October 2014. The burgers and fries were excellent but the atmosphere was a bit shady for non-locals. As it was a smoking bar, the smoky smell hit you square in the face as soon as you open the door. It was very dark inside despite it being a sunny day and the windows were a bit dusty too but the food sure did make up for that. Overall it's off the beaten path, nice and quiet at lunchtime (at least when I went there) and quaint for locals."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday for lunch with 3 other coworkers.  I had been prepped ahead of time by my coworkers that smoking was allowed inside of the bar and so I should not wear anything that I didn't want to smell smoky.  Whenever we got into the bar though there was only one other person sitting at the bar and he was not smoking.  The smell that I did notice was a perfumed type smell that was not thoroughly unpleasant.  The bar is mainly built around a u shaped bar with seating on all sides of it.  For lunch I decided to go with two of the items on the specials board and so I ordered the pierogies (4 for $1, what a deal!) and then the fish sandwich that came a choice of two sides for which I chose mac and cheese and fries.  Normally I would not have gone so heavy on the starch/carbs but I had a large trail race the next day and appreciated that I was able to.  The pierogies ended up coming out first and there were four decent sized pierogies on a plate with the right amount of onions and what I imagine was a half a stick of butter.  You can't really have pierogies in the Pittsburgh area without the onions and butter and so I was happy to see them.  The pierogies had a good potato filling that was still hot as I was eating them and I really enjoyed them with the onions and butter.  After I had finished that my fish sandwich and sides came out.  The fish sandwich was almost comically place upon a hamburger bun as it was at least three times the size of it.  So I ended up eating the two ends of it first before eating the middle part as a sandwich with the bun.  The fish was cooked nice and flaky and had a breading on that while not bad, did not do too much to enhance the flavor.  As such I ended up putting some hot sauce on it.  The same went for the Mac N Cheese which while looking like it came directly out of the Kraft box ended up thankfully not tasting like it.  It was pretty cheesy but needed the extra kick that the hot sauce provided.  Finally my fries were also good.  Even though it may not have sounded like it from my above description I really did enjoy my meal.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  The one thing that would give me pause is that they do allow smoking but the food is good and you can certainly get a lot of it for your money here!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here again recently with my wife for some good cheap food. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the inside is completely redone, and there is no longer a lingering smoke smell inside. The bar itself is now non-smoking, and the newly tiled floor looks great!    We sat at the bar and had a server I had not met before Kelly.  She, like the most of the staff I have interacted with here, have all been very pleasant and attentive.  I ended up ordering a burger and my wife had a turkey bacon cheddar wrap.  Both came with some awesome fresh cut fries and the entire meal was very filling!    The bar still has its crazy cheap food and drink specials and has a much nicer look and feel to it.  With the smoke gone, this has gone from a 3 star to a 4 for me.  What an incredible difference that makes. I will definitely be back here outside of lunch, maybe for a couple of drinks and will bring some friends along with me."}
{"text":"This place had great service. It is a bar with a few tables around the room for seating. I had a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. The fries were your typical frozen fries and there was nothing special about the sandwich, but it wasn't bad. The buffalo sauce was pretty good. I would go back to try other sauces. They had wings with many sauce options. I also liked that you could get macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, or cottage cheese as a side instead of French fries."}
{"text":"My local bar.. great food,,great service and since they went non smoking half my neighborhood is there in a weekend night."}
