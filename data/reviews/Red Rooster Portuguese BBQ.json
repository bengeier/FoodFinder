{"text":"Uninspiring to say the least. Chicken was tasty but dry and about as special as a pre cooked grocery store chicken. The rice was pretty plane nothing to write home about. This place definitely didn't remind me of anything Portuguese."}
{"text":"First off, I LOVE Portuguese chicken. Went here to get some food before a movie. Thought we'd have time, since it was still 1 hour before show time. Unfortunately not.  Only 1 server with 6 tables (not including us).  The server was nice, but so overwhelmed that it brought down the level of service.  This is sad because the food wasn't bad.  They do offer take out, which might be the only option if I ever decide to come back."}
{"text":"We often come to this restaurant - best Portuguese sauce you can get. Today these guys were super under-staffed, there was a huge rush of people and only one server. I felt so bad for her.   When the food came out, my soup was cold.. The chicken was way over cooked, it was basically a piece of dust. Our rice was so undercooked, it was practically raw.   We have been coming here for so many years with no complaints, this was a very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Food is a little bland.  Ordered the other day for pick-up .. asked for a chicken dinner with rice and potatoes + sandwich. When I went to pick it up they only gave me the sandwich (with toppings I asked for not to be on). Asked where the chicken dinner was .. they never took that order down."}
{"text":"Came in here to grab some dinner to go tonight and really wish I didn't. I got the pork loin combo with rice and potatoes and chicken soup.The quality of the food was way below what it should be.  First off the rice and potatoes were the same type that you can bulk buy at any supermarket hot counter. Nothing Special. The pork loin itself was so tough I could not bite through it. (My boot is more tender than that meat they served me.) Yet they try to claim on their website \"best meat in town.\" Yeah right don't kid yourselves.  Even with a steak knife it was hard to cut and it ended up in the trash.   The soup was just broth and noodles with a couple very small chunks of chicken in it. It sad to say but across the parking lot is a Tim Hortons that has much better soup and that stuff gets shipped to the stores frozen.   The only good thing about this place was the woman that served me was very polite and nice to deal with.   This one place I would not go back to."}
{"text":"While the food is alright, they have a thing or two to learn about customer service.  I placed an order for pick up in approx 30 mins, and when I get there, am told that because I was about 5-10 mins late, they gave my order away to someone else because they were super busy and needed the order.  Excuse me?  What's the point of placing an order ahead of time?  It's not like this is a reservation!  I ended up having to wait another 15-20 mins for my order.  If I weren't so hungry I would have left.  And if it was because my order was lost or something, just man up and apologize.  Pathetic!"}
{"text":"Never dine-in only take out a few times. Place looks bland, kind of coffee shop like. Place is small and service is slow. Good BBQ chicken - must eat with sauce though, awesome Perisienne (sp?) potatoes."}
{"text":"Despite my four stars I have mixed feelings about this place.   Pros - tasty and moist rotisserie chicken  -potatoes are well seasoned and nicely done  - best fries ever!! - great value for hosting parties   Cons - service is dependent on who works there. - grilled chicken is dry  - rice often undercooked and dry  Tip - when picking up large orders for fries informed them when you will leave the house to pick up fries or else be expected to wait there while they fry it up fresh. This place takes great pride in their fries but means customers can wait a long time before they are ready."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times, the service has always been slow and I usually look past it. However, my last experience was terrible. I was with a group of 8, we were the only people inside the restaurant at the time we ordered, and they managed to get the order completely wrong. Half of our order never came, we had to ask multiple times when it would be coming. The manager or owner of the place has no idea what \"customer service\" means. They tried to charge us extra saying we asked for additional portions which we didn't. It's too bad because the food here is absolutely delicious. They need to step up with the service. Honestly it was so dead that it should not be that hard to take an order for a table of 8, and I can't imagine how the place functions when and if it is ever busy. Go to the major Mackenzie locations."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer at this restaurant. The chicken has always been dry, but if you ordered the chicken breast dinner you were never disappointed with the cutlets. The customer service is usually very snobby and self pretentious, making myself not feel very welcome.   For a pricey $15 bucks I was able to get a few potatoes, a couple thinly sliced chicken cutlets, a drink, and more than enough rice. Dining in for lunch was only worth it for the sauce included in the meal. If you had your food to go you usually got a small sample sized container of sauce which was barely enough for one chicken breast. Any extra 'glorified' sauce would have to be purchased at an obscene price. I didn't mind it because dining in had the perks of having the sauce with my meal.   FAST FORWARD TO 2015, they now DO NOT serve any sauce to customers who don't pay the overpriced tag for a small container of sauce. I was upset to find that even dining in, you had to pay extra if you wanted a drop of sauce. What started as an already overpriced lunch for average chicken breast, you can find yourself spending an extra three bucks per order at minimum if you want the full experience. I hate to say, but the only reason why I tolerated this place was because the sauce made the meal. Without any sauce, it is now a typical overpriced greedy establishment. I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Always a good time, been coming to this place for years and never had a problem. I was lucky enough to experience the days where the sauce was free! But the food is still good without."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or takeout. The food is great for kids and adults alike. I always order the chicken breasts with salad. The sauce for the chicken has a nice zip to it and the breasts have been flattened into submission with a thin coating of breading.  I find their pork a bit dry so I'd stick with the chicken. The French fries here remind me of the ones from the chip truck. I'm sure their terrible for me but they're damn tasty."}
{"text":"I grew up downtown where Portuguese food is every where ... I was glad to finally find something in the burbs. I really enjoyed the BBQ chicken; it was very flavourful and juicy. They have a \"special\" sauce, which I enjoyed much better than the usual Frank's Red Hot that most Portuguese restaurants serve. The potatoes were cooked perfectly. The fries were okay...it could have been more crispy.  My kids got the chicken sandwich on a kaiser...so wish it was on a Portuguese bun instead.  The place was packed...and every minute or so someone came in to pick up trays of BBQ chicken and potatoes.  Best chick  in this side of town...and I've looked around!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The snotty service--they really don't care if you come back or not--and the fact that they cannot seem to fill a take away order with any degree of accuracy takes away from the fact that the chicken is actually pretty good... even if they only give you a teaspoon of hot sauce to go with a whole chicken.  There are much better options around: restaurants that actually care about their customers and are interested in making sure you have an enjoyable experience.  (This was the location on Major Mac west of Keele Street.)"}
{"text":"Service was a big mess, I feel like they are really understaffed, the only 2 waiters there were so busy, and the place was packed with customers we Waited 40 mins for our chicken to be ready... it was way over cooked ... the only good thing was the fries. Rice pudding was not fresh and too sweet. Probably won't come again..."}
{"text":"I would have rated this restaurant a 4 BEFORE they started charging you (absurdly)for their sauce. Never have I had to pay for sauce at any Portuguese or other restaurant. Are they going to start charging for the ketchup and salad dressing too??? Their chicken breast combo is good but way overpriced. I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent but uninspired. This place is a good option if you're starving and trying to avoid carbs (bread) like I am. For people who live and work in this area there are very few options within walking distance and I'd probably return at some point but prepare to be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I am very conflicted with this place.  I hate the service, staff attitude and the long wait times.  Even when you call your order in ahead of time, they tell you 15 minutes, I arrive 20 minutes later and still wait 20 minutes or more.  And they don't even apologies, they just say we are very busy.  But I go back.  The food is good not amazing.  If you get the chicken grilled it has a nice flavour.  But ultimately I go back because of the hot sauce.  The hot sauce is amazing but the BS part, it is the most expensive sauce ever and its not even homemade.  A small container is $5, that is nuts!"}
{"text":"Called in a pick up at 4:30. Got there at 4:45 waited till 5:00 to get it. Food was very good but the timing has to improve."}
{"text":"If I had to choose only one restaurant in Newmarket to eat at ever again.... this would be it. Excellent food, try the pork ribs. So good I just keep coming back...."}
{"text":"This bbq place is really nice. We had chicken breast and pork loin slices. Both dishes were really awesome. The only thing less than perfect was that the pork was kind of hard to chew. And, potato sides are sooooooo good!! Definitely coming back for potatoes!!"}
{"text":"The first visit on it's second day of business in November 2010 was a one star experience.  The 1/2 chicken was anorexic.  The service was unsmiling from the owner's daughter.  Almost as if she hated working with her mom who ran this second location.  The first location (which I consider the best) was a few kilometres west on Major Mackenzie Drive past Keele Street run by her father.  Fast forward a few months into 2011.  I tried this new location again three more times.  The 1/2 chicken improved.  More meat.  But, still not as good as their original location.  The last visit had the local Health Inspector walk in at around 12:30 pm on a Wednesday.  It appeared he found a few deficiencies and the owner was having a discussion with him at a table across from me.  Nice!  I don't mind the interior.  It is basic.  Nothing gaudy for the hour's weekday lunch.  So, far the second best place in Vaughan for Portuguese chicken.  The original location being the best.  There is a new Portuguese chicken competitor a few blocks west at Weston Road and Major Mackenzie Drive.  I will try it and report back with a review."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch before going to the doctors office. Chicken was dry but tasty. Make sure you order sauce because it helps if the chicken is dry. Good amount of food for the price. My daughter liked the kids chicken meal and ate all of the chicken. Normally she does not finish her lunch but she liked the chicken. We ordered French fries as well. They are home made and OK but not spectacular, I think they use the wrong potato type for fries."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Portuguese style  chicken.  The chicken sandwich is my favorite.  The chicken is always juicy and tender, and the kaiser bread has just the right fluffiness and takes in the hot sauce really well.  Talking about the hot sauce, it has \"fire\" but not enough to burn, and it elevates the taste of the chicken breast.  The restaurant is clean and the server is very friendly, why would I go anyway else?"}
{"text":"The food here is unreal. The chicken isn't dry. The fries and the potatoes are on point. I love eating here its an absolute pleasure."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken breast sandwich. It was nice and juicy. I ordered an extra sauce to add more flavour to mine. Budget friendly and was able to get a Soup, Real chicken sandwich, and my choice of drink - all under $20. Overall great space, great service and great food!    https://youtu.be/AhocK7k48kg"}
{"text":"I rated this establishment a 1 because I never got a chance to eat thier food. Went in on a Thursday night at 5:30 p.m. There was two people in the restaurant.  I wanted to order a 1/4 chicken but it was not on the menu. I could only order 1/2 chicken. I hate white meat so I asked if I could have the 1/2 chicken but all dark and the person at the counter said no substitutions. Since the employee was so inflexible I left.  I guess this location is so busy they don't require the business. Poor customer service and I won't be going back. I can go to Swiss Chalet and order a 1/4 chicken.  It was my first time at this location and my last."}
{"text":"I just came back from Red Rooster Portuguese BBQ and although my tummy tum tum is comfortable numb, and pleasantly plump, my mouth is still watering for more.  Having a health conscious friend back in town for a few days from Vancouver we were trying to figure out a spot to grab a quick bite that was filling, healthy and manageable for the wallet. After some consideration I decided I would introduce him to the wonders of Portuguese BBQ chicken.  .......sluuurrrrppp!!! Sorry Every-time I say \"Portuguese BBQ chicken\" I salivate again  Ahem - Moving on...  Red Rooster is located on the Richmond Hill/Vaughan border on Major Mac just West of Bathurst. If you're having difficulty finding it just look for the Medical building on the south side of Maj.Mac and its in the same plaza.  My friend and I entered with hearty appetites and driven by the portion size comments many of you Yelpers eluded to I somehow knew we wouldn't be disappointed. Here is what we had:  ME: 1/2 Chicken with 2 sides (I went for the potatoes and salad) w/ bottle of H2O -Chicken was well cooked and seasoned by a Portuguese saint, while the potatoes were round little lumps of soft heavenly goodness. The salad was perfect for the health fanatic in me as fresh mixed greens, veggies and olives piled my plate (and the dressing was served in a bottle on the side)  HE: Grilled Chicken Breast with 2 sides (He had fries and salad) w/ bottle of H2O + and espresso. -He got 2-3 perfectly cooked chicken breasts and he mentioned that the fries had some sort of delicious seasoning on them. Salad and Dressing (same as above).  The one X-Factor this place has is the bottle of Piri Piri sauce. OH EM GEEEE!!!! I wish I could swear in a review because I totally would - that is how good it is. What a flavour, What a spice. This SAWSE is......(that's right) BAWSE. If it didn't have a kick to it I'd probably take a swig straight from the bottle.  The only item my friend and I agreed that kept this place from achieving a 5th star was the lunch time price. $14+tip for me and $18+tip for him. I can see myself paying that for dinner but Lunch should be closer to that $8-$12 range. But again the portions are quite substantial so you are getting what you pay for I guess.   I shall return here again. Hungry!! Won't you come with?"}
{"text":"Do not expect your order to be even close to ready; especially on a busy night The chicken breasts and wings are good and so are the potatoes. I find the other chicken dry. Unfortunately nothing is worth the aggravation of waiting well past your designated pick up time. Tonight I ended up cancelling my order and walking out because it still wasn't ready after an hour wait. This place has got to get their act together if they want my business back."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty...especially the Rotisserie chicken. The ribs are good, but they are the opposite of \"fall off the bone\""}
{"text":"Am a fan of red rooster from the very beginning location in Maple. The food at the newest location in Newmarket is no different than what made them successful to begin with - fresh,  local,  authentic and delicious.  Count on red rooster to satisfy your hunger with food that is as delicious as nutritious. From their grilled or rotisserie chicken, those yummy parisiense potatoes to their multiple fish  dishes like my favourite - red rooster cod. Finger licking  good! By far their most favourite and popular item - their hot sauce..good on anything ! Recommend all my friends and family to visit red rooster when they are near one and with the Newmarket location near my family, it's a staple stop."}
{"text":"My family used to drive all the way to Maple from Richmond Hill to get takeaway from the original Red Rooster location on Major Mackenzie. It was always a great treat for our family and certainly something I haven't had in years.   So ironically, my Friend and I were on our way to Newmarket for an event and had actually been talking about best Portuguese chicken we'd had before. Then while stopping for an errand at nearby Party City we noticed the Red Rooster was a few doors away. What luck!   We took this as a sign and made tracks to get in there ASAP for a quick lunch. There are two doors once you enter, right is strictly for take out or pre orders and straight is for dining room service.   Decor wise, it's very simple, with a nod to Portuguese culture with a few simple frames posters and images. Just enough to set the scene but let the food be the star.   The menu is diverse for sure but most popular was the half chicken dinner with 2 sides (I went with the round potatoes and salad) and a large Piri piri sauce. Special note, a large was not explain to me that it would be enough for a family, I think when dining solo a small Or medium would be more than enough.   Food came quickly and for the modest price the portion size was quite generous. The chicken was cooked very well and unlike other chicken spots it wasn't a boney bird, in fact it was quite meaty. The potato's were also awesome, like soft little pillows surrounded with a lightly crunchy outer shell.   Total bill for two half chicken lunches, two large piri piri, tax and tip was under $50.   Loved it! Will be back next time when in Newmarket   Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Having been to the location in Vaughan, I was excited to try the Newmarket location. It was extremely clean, and had a spacious feel. There is two options, to either take away or sit down. However, I remember food taking fairly long to make regardless of which route you chose at the other locations, so we just sat down.  there was one waitress for four occupied tables, and I had ordered hot water but she actually forgot and gave me cold water...I just let it slide. I ordered the chicken wings with salad, and my friend ordered the ribs. When the waitress asked us if we wanted hot sauce, even though it was extra, I was glad I ordered it.   The food came at a fairly reasonable time, but still seemed a bit slow (similar to the Vaughan location). The chicken wings were very dry, which is hard to accomplish since chicken wings are all dark meat. Good thing I had the creamy hot sauce, which I ordered mild, to moisten the meat a bit. I was very disappointed in the quality of the meat as the Vaughan location's meat was extremely moist and tender, and I had ordered the exact same dish.  The hot sauce should not be a cover up for dry meat, they need to go back to the drawing board on getting the meat succulent. Maybe they should ask the Vaughan location for meat cooking tips.  I finished off with a Portuguese custard tart, which was tasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience ordering take out from this red rooster location, I order from one of the major Mac locations frequently and I was hesitant to visit this location after reading the other reviews. I decided to try it anyways and I was far from disappointed. The girl over the counter was pleasant and the food was amazing!!!! Super fresh, (gave me free peri peri sauce). Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Great value for excellent food, try the pork slices with the piri piri sauce."}
{"text":"As I stand in line For 40 minutes, waiting for my pick up order that was supposed to be 10 minutes, I remember why I don't come here anymore. They just can't handle the business! One person manning the register and she's the waitress. I'd like to order in advance but she's too busy to answer the phone.  The chicken Is delicious but they need more staff and a better system to get the food out."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant (especially Portuguese) where you have to pay EXTRA for sauce. I bought a chicken breast combo, a whole chicken, and a few sides.. That didn't even come with sauce. $5 for a container that was barely enough for my combo, let alone a whole chicken. \"Waitresses\" were super rude too. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favourite places. Unfortunately this is the second time they got my take out order wrong. Drove all the way home, and I don`t live close by, only to find my order completely wrong. Called in to let them know, the owner said he would call me back. He never did. I don`t expect a free meal, but an apology would`ve been appreciated, and some reassurance that he spoke to the staff to make sure they are a little more careful with orders in the future. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Will probably return to eat here again.  The wait times are average, we went around 7pm on a week night and it wasn't packed at all. They have draft beer (Rooster Lager or something), and we tried it, it was alright.  It's the only draft they have but the main thing is regarding their food..  The price is a bit on the high side for this quality but overall, we were satisfied. The potatoes and rice were cooked well.  We tried the chicken and the pork slices. The pork slices were very dry; good thing they have this special homemade sauce which makes everything taste a lot better. The chicken was great, loved it.  It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"The chicken used to be superb and now the potatoes are squashed on take out. Chicken has a bit of burning smell. Bring the good meal back"}
{"text":"I was at the medical centre and was starving, and since theres only 2 food options in the plaza I decided to try here. Nice and close.   I ordered at the counter and sat down. My food was ready and brought to me within 4 minutes which probably means it was ready from before and sitting there.. But whatever. Id also ordered grilled chicken , & shed given me the half chicken combo.   Very good portioning, ceaser sauce for my salad was put on my table so i could pour myself Which i appreciate because nobody understands how much i love my extra dressing.   Was pretty good chicken. Not complaining. & I was full, means a happy me ."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of my favourite go to place for take-out. Rotisserie is the best. The chicken is nice and moist and very flavourful. I always order large hot sauce. The sauce is delicious. I probably drain my chicken with their hot sauce. It's not really spicy or hot, but it gives the chicken the best flavour. They give plenty of potatoes if you order. And for dessert, I always get a to-go Portuguese tart. Yum! I have tried the grilled chicken, but it tends to get dry. As said above, I normally get the rotisserie. I definitely recommend this place to try!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out there last Friday night, we ordered one chicken meal and one ribs meal. When we got home, they only gave us the ribs meal. In the chicken meal, there was only rice and potatoes, the chicken was MISSING!! We called to see what they would do about it, they said that we would have to go back right away for them to do anything. It was getting late and we were hungry, so we didn't bother taking it back. If you want to pay full price for two meals and get ripped off because they refuse you to reimburse you even though they conveniently 'forgot' to give you the chicken, then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Eat your chicken and shut up! Why everyone nowadays needs staff to kiss their ass is beyond me. It's simple, good chicken, sauce, fries and salad. And these guys are always busy so sorry if the little girl behind the counter didn't treat you like Lady Diana."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in Toronto! I really miss this place! I wish they had a location in Dallas, TX!"}
{"text":"Red Rooster Portuguese BBQ is a small restaurant chain that specializes in Portuguese BBQ. This location is quite small and can probably seat somewhere around 20 people give or take a few people.This location seemed to do quite a bit of take out business.  I decided to go with the 1/2 grilled chicken combo which came with either rice, french fries or parisienne potatoes and a choice of either a garden or caesar salad ($12.50 plus tax). I went with the parisienne potatoes which are essentially roasted potato balls and a garden salad. The chicken was a little dry inside, it was nicely seasoned on the outside but it wasn't overly flavourful. The parisienne potatoes were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. The garden salad was pretty standard. The portion size was reasonable but I wouldn't say it was a lot of food.  Red Rooster Portuguese BBQ seems like a decent food option for the neighbourhood since there weren't many options in the area and I'm sure pretty sure there aren't an abundance of Portuguese restaurants in Vaughan like there is downtown. The food is okay, nothing special, it's reasonably priced food and the place was pretty clean."}
{"text":"The best plate you can order here and fall in love with is the Chicken Breast Combo with their famous hot sauce (it's not really spicy but the flavour is really good on the chicken) a garden salad (amazing dressing) and Parisienne Potatoes.  Personally, I don't like their rice because it taste bland and dry. You're better off with the salad, potatoes, or fries !   Cheers xoxo"}
{"text":"I have FELLOW co-workers that bring in take-out from this place from time to time so I thought it's about time to see what they see that I don't as it is just next door to a Pho spot I frequented many years ago.  Walking in and it was noticeable that the decor is Portuguese themed  and there was a few seats so it's not PURELY take-out.  We perused the menu and the most affordable for this lunch time is the 1/2 Chicken w/2 Side options($10.49).  I choose the Garden Salad and Rice over the Parissiene Potatoes or French Fries simply trying to have a lighter meal but the whole dish came in a sizeable portion.  The Chicken had a LIGHT seasoning on top but was grilled to perfection however didn't have the flavours even when dipping into the additional Spicy Sauce which didn't have the kick I was hoping for.    The Rice was straightforward and didn't have the Saffron flavour I had elsewhere.  The Parissiene Potato was pretty SOFT without being mushy because it was pan fried before service, so I don't mind it A-OK.  Unfortunately they didn't have a 1/4 Chicken Combo instead for a LUNCH portion however they offer if you don't want the sides, simply get a Whole Grilled Chicken($11.49) for take-out.  My friend had the Chicken Breast which seemed to be flattened so it wasn't as juicy as our 1/2 Chicken.  2.5 *Stars* as I would come back for the Grilled Chicken.  There are loads of Custard Tarts($1.25) on the back counter which I would like to try next time.  They do offer a take-out FAMILY Pack Special($23.50 - Whole Chicken, 1 Med Parissiene Potato, 1 Med Rice)."}
{"text":"Dropped in at lunch to grab some take-out chicken and was hoping to get a side of vegetables but they only offer salad.  Have been eating way too much salad and would have preferred some carrots/cauliflower/broccoli...Ended up heading to Swiss Chalet.  Hopefully they will consider adding veggies to their menu soon."}
{"text":"Pros -you get two sides  - customer service  - variety of food  Cons - small chicken  - dry  Overall: 6.5/10 , there's better within 5 minutes driving"}
{"text":"Had a coworker offer me a piece of their chicken breast cutlet and found it to be really good so I didn't hesitate to order with them the next time.    We have ordered now a number of times since and it is always consistent in quality and taste.  We love the hot sauce!  Chicken cutlet with fries and ceaser salad really hits the spot."}
{"text":"Consistently good...  Always a sure bet.  I was a bit disappointed with the size of the whole chicken.  It seems to have gotten smaller.  We usually get the combo."}
{"text":"Fantastic Portuguese BBQ Chicken.  We eat here often and cater family parties - me and my Portuguese in-laws love this place!  Food is excellent and definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Nandos fairly frequently, so I was really addicted to good Portuguese chicken.  But this was not really a good experience.  I had the Half Chicken dinner which was pretty dry and tough.  Fortunately, it was covered with a giant mound of salad to add some moisture.  I don't know what else to say.  Maybe I have been spoiled, but this place could compete with a bit of a kitchen makeover."}
{"text":"So you want to call in your order in advance and be worry free?  Go buy yourself a lotto ticket because it wont be your lucky day.  I've ordered here many times.  I call  in my order, I ask them what time.  They give me a time and I add 10 minutes.  You come in, you see people waiting, and sometimes no one waiting.  You tell them your order.  They go ok, they go to the back and come back and say they are making it.  MAKING WHAT? A  CAKE?  No matter how much time you give them, they don't start making it until you arrive.  It has nothing to do with being busy.    If you actually had this thing called \"customer service\" this place would be amazing.  Why do I keep going back?  I'm like a lab rat that doesn't learn.  The food is good I guess.  Everyone that goes here leaves angry.  Its part of the experience.  Hope to see one of you lab rats soon!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most disappointing Portuguese BBQ places I've been to yet. We ordered a half chicken combo to go and we were told it would be 5 minutes, this was a bit weird to me but I assumed it was a mistake. When the food was ready before it had even been 5 minutes I was really concerned. The dryness and lukewarm temperature of the chicken confirmed my suspicions that they cooked the chicken ahead of time and left it in a warming tray. The chicken was barely edible and the potatoes it came with were just as lukewarm. I hope they will improve upon these things as they are open longer but for now I'll have to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"So were do i start end of a dynasty chicken usedbto be so good now its dry and not spicy even wen ordered spicy why cause they dont give you sauce unless u pay rediculous price for it safe to say not going back to either location"}
{"text":"This place is good because it's in the middle of a residential area where there is no good restaurants near by. My kids love their grilled chicken and so do I actually. Love their sauce but you gotta ask and pay extra for it. Or you go home then realize you forgot about the sauce and it's just not the same. The potatoes and rice are pretty decent. Again my kids love them. Not something I'd get for myself personally. Their service is also incredible slow. Even when I call ahead of time and tell them a specific time to pick it up, I still wait 10-15min when I get there. Portion is quite big , for that price, the portion has gotta be big."}
{"text":"Red Rooster, definitely a great place to get some Chicken! Could you guess?!?! I stepped in with one thing, and only one thing in mind. A whole Chicken. I glance at the menu board and I have to make a hard decision between Rotisserie Chicken or Grilled Chicken. Sure enough there was no hard decision because they always run out of Rotisserie Chicken, so it must be the bomb. With my luck they ran out of Rotisserie Chicken that one night. My mind still on a while chicken, so I got a whole Grilled Chicken. It was pretty good but I was still disappointed about the Rotisserie Chicken sell out (86). I know I'm gonna go at an earlier time to get the Rotisserie Chicken.   My friend got the Chicken Noodle Soup. She said it was not very good and it was probably because there were two containers of the soup and all of the Chicken was batched in the one container while the initial container barely had any chicken and she was not impressed. I didn't really expect a good soup, but I did expect good Chicken, which satisfied my craving. One disappointing thing was there was no sauce or hot sauce that came with the Chicken. Most places have a sauce with their chicken but it was an additional charge. Oh well, still good Chicken. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Really good food - the chicken is always delicious, the fish is yum and the pasteis de nata are some of the best I've ever had. Great quality and value for money with excellent friendly customer service. You can't really ever go wrong with Red Rooster."}
{"text":"Well.. won't be going back here.  The service was horrible, they forgot half our food order.  The food itself was \"meh\".  Not good compared to places like Churrasco Villa (Mt. Pleasant & Eglinton).  The chicken was dry.. sauce was ok.  When I went to pay, and told the woman that they forgot parts of our order, she didn't even apologize.. My money will be spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good chicken, average fries, poor rice, average salad, great sauce. Once again service was terrible. So much attitude. Order in advance, then make you wait long without  an apology.   Don't like the way they charge an extra $5 for sauce, when I purchase $80 of chicken.  Attitude stinks."}
{"text":"The place is very clean with a nice decor. The service was courteous and friendly.  The food was a miss and a hit.  My order was ready fairly quick...in apprx 5 mins my half chicken with salad and potatoes was out.  The food overall was not bad. But here's the kicker... the home made piri piri sauce i requested halfway down my meal was mind blowing. It just took the chicken to a new level. I could have drank that sauce.  I will go again to try their sandwich as it looked pretty good.  But yes, definitely get the sauce."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see this place has just 3 stars. Before they opened in Newmarket I've been going to the original locations on Major Mac (Been a long time customer). Love the piri piri sauce! I usually always order the chicken filet combo or I get the family pack. Very flavourful and moist chicken. I can't say anything bad about this place. Whether it's here in Newmarket or in Maple, the service and food are pretty much the same. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good chicken and great value but.  Slow service when you take out. The house sauce is out of control.  You get one ounce with a whole chicken dinner.  Typically unorganized when you get there.  If you can deal with the mess, the food is good."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place in Toronto to heat a barbecue meal!  It has a Cousy very clean portuguese style where you can see many barbecue meal options on the Menu that is in English and Portuguese.  There  is also some good Portuguese Red Wine like the Vila Regia and Floral from Douro and others, on White Wine there's Piriquita and on Green the Gatão.   The Chicken Breast Slide it's juicy and it taste marvellous! I had a very nice conversation with the owner, and he explained while working the process of the meals that surprise me with a very good organisation and of course he didn't tell me how to make the secret of \" Red Rooster BBQ \" that is the sauce!  As a Flight Attendant of a Portuguese Airline I really recommend all of you to try this place, go and enjoy a nice barbecue meal!"}
{"text":"Place was dead at Noon on a Wednesday. Cashier seemed somewhat inconvenienced by my being there.  Didn't seem too passionate about her restaurant.  Ordered a chicken sandwich.  It was just OK.  I could make better at home. Kind of weird that the potatoes don't count in the lunch combo as a side.  I will continue to go to The Chicken Place in Aurora which is fresh, made to order, delicious and they're friendly/seem to want you there."}
{"text":"This is the newer of 2 locations in the medical building plaza just by the Vaughan/Richmond Hill border. Being a new location, the decor/washrooms/general appearance of the place is new and clean.   Personally, 80% of my opinion of a restaurant is based on the food and the last 20% is the service and price. This place excels at the food quality. There isn't a single item on the menu I don't like. The sauce they have, rooster juice I call it, is incredible. As far as price and service, it's average price and service is average at best. They get very busy during peak meal times so you can expect a wait. Honestly if you expect your food in 5 minutes, you are going to be disappointed.   All in all, a solid 3.5 stars (sometimes 4) from me!"}
{"text":"Was on our way to York Region Pride, when we happened across Red Rooster.  We just so happened to be making a stop at the local Party City to deck out our Jeep for the parade and decided we needed a quick lunch. Oddly enough, the two of us just so happen to be having a conversation about Portuguese chicken in the car and it was as if the Portuguese chicken gods placed this at our feet. We just could not resist and slide in.   The restaurant itself was clean and modern, with some nods to Portugal and a television with the World Cup game on (if memory serves). The menu had some great offerings, which were cheap in price. I went for the 1/2 Chicken with potatoes and caesar salad for $13.50 and got a large peri-peri sauce for an additional $5.00  The serving sizes are HUGE, let me tell you that. The chicken itself is juicy, tender and delicious. I felt like the salad itself was kind of an afterthought, however, I could have had more potatoes and on second thought, I should have had potatoes on potatoes. But oh well, that's on me. The peri-peri sauce I got was medium but tasted more like a mild. I got a large size and it was literally served in a bowl. I would have liked a head's up from my server that it was that big, as I likely didn't need a size that big and would have ordered a small or medium.    Overall, I loved the vibe and experience here. 10/10, would come back."}
{"text":"My sister an I have been coming to this place for a very long time and I am surprised I have yet to write a review. The chicken is always delicious, and the fries are fresh cut and delicious. The house salad dressing is to die for. Every dish I have had is great! Their \"hot\" sauce is also delicious, my only complaint is that they make you pay for it now.   We have been coming for a very long time and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  There are better churasquiera's out there, but this isn't bad either, for the area.  The chicken is good. The wings are good (nice grill taste). The hot sauce is the star. The house salad is not impressive. The rice is dry. The potatoes are ok.  All in all, a fresh option for the area."}
{"text":"I went to the one by Bathurst and major Mack I called ahead for my order I had the rotisserie chicken the potatoes and the chef salad the food was really good and the staff are friendly as well. I defiantly recommend the chef salad it's definitely worth it to try it ."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Chicken is crispy-skinned, tender and flavourful, rice is tasty and all the sides are fresh. Level of customer service has some room for improvement though. Wait times are slightly concerning, a poorly-worded sign at the front makes it clear there is \"no priority given to small orders\" when ordering ahead of time, and paying for sauce? That left a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended. Do you pay for soy sauce at sushi?"}
{"text":"Big portions for what you pay. Chicken is amazing.  And the potatoes and fries are great.  Very crispy without being too oily.  However the place is understaffed so it'll take some time to get your food especially if it's busy."}
{"text":"We usually take to go but a few of us came to eat there..  Place is small but who cares?!?! We are there to EAT!  You can never go wrong with the chicken breast combo and that's what we always have.  I ordered mine with French fries and roasted potatoes, which I LOVE!  The chicken breast is great and so is the hot sauce that I ordered with it (which now you have to pay extra for which is greedy of them but its worth it so whatever-that's where they get one less star).  It amazes me how these restaurants start to change things when they get busier, ex. change their portions and put prices on things they didn't charge for before and increase prices.  But, if it was my restaurant, perhaps I might do the same.  Who knows?!  It does cost them money to keep giving hot sauces for free so I guess its understandable.  If they should change/modify anything, it should be their salad.  Very blend and boring which is why I NEVER order it anymore.    Chicken wings, chicken breasts and any chicken you get there is Fantastic!  French fries, rice and potatoes are yum as well."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with this place.  After much consultation with the girl behind the counter regarding the \"speciality of the house\", I opted for the grilled chicken dinner (1/2 chicken with two sides).  I had take-out.  When I got home, the salad, which was otherwise fresh and in a separate container, consisted of mostly iceberg lettuce and was in a pool of water.  It also contained a hair in it which ruined it for me even more.    The grilled chicken was cut into four pieces.  The flavour was just ok...rather bland.  The tiny container of hot sauce that I asked for was flavourful but swimming in grease.  The chicken and parisienne potatoes (my second side consisting of blank round little potatoes) was also swimming in a pool of orange coloured grease.    The portuguese tarts looked yummy - they were sitting outside on the counter but I forgot to order one before leaving.    The restaurant has a small seat-in area but has non-descript decor and no ambiance.  I think they could have tried harder to inject some portuguese flavour to the place.  It is not at all inviting to eat-in but is more like 'fast food\".  Some of the patrons were eating what appeared to be grilled chicken breast which looked good.  I wish I had ordered that but I am not inclined to give it another try in light of the very poor experience I had this time."}
{"text":"Love to grab some of this food and take it home.  Easy to do, and it's delicious.  Not only is the chicken flavourful, but their cornbread is delicious. Getting your order takes quite a bit of time though, especially at peak times.  Definitely best to call ahead and pre-order...although you'll still have to wait."}
{"text":"Went in not knowing what Portuguese food was or the flavour. Wanted to try something simple so I got chicken wings and fries while my girlfriend got 1/2 chicken with potatoes and Cesar salad.   My chicken wings were delicious!! It came with 12 and had a seasoning on them which I couldn't tell what it was plus they were grilled. The French fries were amazing. Thick cut fries well done and had that homemade feel which was amazing!   I didn't know what to expect since that spot was a chicken place before which didn't so well and this Red Rooster place is going to be there for 1 year!   When you first walk in your greeted right away. The lady was all the way in the back kitchen but still acknowledge our presence which I feel is very important to me walking into a restaurant. Knowing that your being welcomed. The menu is simple and not overwhelming. Once I ordered the place is nice they have Portuguese pictures on the wall and feels very comforting. Definitely going to come back again. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Bad customer service and old chicken put it back in fryer too make it look fresh . The owner is not even poteguese !"}
{"text":"Red Rooster is my favourite place to grab some take out Portuguese food. I've grabbed single meals, family dinner packs and large catering trays from this location and have never been disappointed with my taste buds. Great chicken, great rice and great potatoes   Why only 3 stars if I enjoy the food you ask? The place seems disorganized. The waits times are horrible. I have always pre ordered and have waited up to 30 minutes AFTER the set time.  I'm also not exactly impressed with paying an extra $5 for a tiny container of spicy sauce, which is a staple in the meal and should certainly be included.   Every time I order from here I leave frustrated with the wait, but end up forgetting about it once I dig into my food.  I would certainly recommend trying it out if you're not in a rush or catering for group of hungry people!"}
{"text":"I really like the product that red rooster offers. Their chicken is tasty, sides are great, and the sauce is second to none.   If I was writing this review in 2012, they would most likely get 4-5 stars from me. However as of late 2014/early 2015, I have become more and more annoyed with this establishment.   For some reason they feel as though they are 'holier than thou' as if they are doing you a favour by selling you overpriced chicken. The general attitude of the young ladies that work there is a bit snobby for my taste. Also, a HUGE new disappointing aspect of red rooster is that now you have to pay for the sauce. I am paying nearly 15 dollars for a lunch there, please explain to me why I am not entitled to all the sauce my heart desires. Why do I have to pay an additional $3-5 dollars for sauce that used to be free? I understand the purpose of a business is to make money, but this is a bit far when you are charging such a premium for simple chicken and rice.   All in all, I really like the food, I just do not appreciate the greed and business practises."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant once and didn't like it at all. I had to wait a long time before I could place my order because the waitress was hanging around in the back kitchen. The food took a long time to be ready and when I finally get my food, the chicken was dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Food is average. The issue with this place is the service. They show zero regard for any sort of customer service whatsoever. Often you'll see people waiting there and nobody is in the front. They go back to the kitchen to do god knows what.   Call ahead ? Good luck. Every time I've called ahead I've waited 45+ mins for my order. I've even asked in the phone when should I show up so that my order is ready. Pick any time . 2 hours? It doesn't matter. You're always waiting.   Their fries are good. They act as if they are the best on earth. So what happens is is no matter how long ago you order your food, they only make your fries when you arrive. So you end up getting hot fries and cold chicken .   The food here isn't nearly worth the aggravation of how poor the customer service is here.   And the fact they charge for the sauce is ridiculous.   I used to go 1-2 times per month. I have stopped going completely.   There are so many better options within the area where they treat people decent."}
{"text":"Nice friendly people. Great tasting chicken breast sandwich. Great wait staff. Clean and spacious Resturant.  Going to try the Nata as well? I'll be back again."}
{"text":"After grabbing takeout from this location I just have one question: What kind of abomination is this place?!?!   After a dentist appointment, my boyfriend asked me to pick up an order at the Red Rooster a few doors down from my dentists office. Having had such a stellar experience with the Newmarket spot, I expected it to be just as good, if not better given Maple/Vaughan's largely Mediterranean population.   The tip off should have been the customer service or their lack of. The girl at the counter couldn't have cared less if a celebrity had walked through the door. Her face was set in a scowl, \"Hi\" she intoned in what I *think* was her attempt at being welcoming while she continued to stare at me petulantly. But hey - it's a Saturday, this is the winter that never ends and there's probably a million other things she'd rather be doing. I was there for the food after all, I can make exceptions for questionable service if the food is good.   $70 later (and a prompt text to my boyfriend asking *how* he managed to order $70 in takeout?!) and I was out the door. Food smelled good, I was hungry and itching to take my freshly cleaned teeth for a spin.   You cannot imagine my immediate disappointment from my deception when I sat down to eat. I can think of a long list of adjectives to describe the food here and none of them are good.   The chicken was incredibly overcooked and it forced me to take a sip of water with each bite just to get it down my throat. Bland rice, flavourless parisienne potatoes, and rissois that I quite literally - no dramatics intended - spit out immediately after biting. Helplessly hungry, and irritated, I eyeballed my boyfriend's salad and asked meekly, \"how's the salad?\" I took his grimace as an answer.   Initially, I thought I was being hypercritical of this place. However, about 4 hours later, I found myself standing over a stovetop making myself a bowl of instant ramen that cost $1.99 with nothing but my stomachs grumbling to keep me company. It was then that I realized - no, no, I am not being hypercritical, this place just sucks and they robbed me of $70 and now I'm starving and making instant noodles that cost 97% less!   This location needs to take some tips from the Newmarket location or reassess their teams capacity for cooking 'cause this ain't it."}
{"text":"\"Can we get Portuguese food?\"  \"No.\"  This tends to be how most conversations regarding weekend take out options with my boyfriend go. And after our previous costly Portuguese takeout blunder, I was not risking being the laughing stock of my family yet again. Somehow though, my boyfriend swindled me into an agreement and that's how we ended up ordering dinner from Red Rooster.   I'll admit, I did roll my eyes when I saw they had rissois on the menu - that is an all day ordeal and any place that takes on this challenge is either doing it wrong or really is hitting the ball out of the park. Unfortunately, the employee who is responsible for rissois was away so we couldn't order any; but onwards with the review!  The chicken had exactly the roasted flavour I expect when I have BBQ chicken. The rice was delicious, although the fries left little to be desired (some were a bit too well done and could have used some salt.) I was absolutely elated that they carry an array of Sumol products that took me right back to my childhood. (Seriously, nothing better than passion fruit juice - if you haven't had this before, you're missing out!)  We also ordered their pasteis de nata which I was completely gutted over as the custard had gone a bit funny and the crust was soggy - I couldn't get through it. And honestly -- I think they were store bought. So for this reason and the French fries (which honestly, might have been a personal preference) I give Red Rooster 4 stars!"}
