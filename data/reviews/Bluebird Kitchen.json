{"text":"The Cuban might be the best sandwich in the city.. seriously.. porky, salty, juicy, pickle-ee, flavor-dripping-down-your-face, kinda good... and I'm sure the Local Fried Egg sandwich is the best breakfast sandwich in the city... rich, and yokey.  Look, if you want fries on your sandwich, or a crappy buffalo chicken wrap, or processed cold cuts, then this place just isn't for you.  This is real food people. Food that starts out as quality ingredients, that are transformed into a wonderful, delicious products.  When you're baking your own bread and pastries, roasting and braising your own meat... that's cooking. That's what we're supposed to be eating.  I can't say enough about people who treat food  with the proper respect it deserves.  It's absolutely refreshing in this world of chained, crappy, processed, mediocrity."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast/lunch in Pittsburgh.  Sure, Pittsburgh is the land of crepes and waffles and giant, starchy, breakfast meals, but, for the same price, you can get a sandwich and a fruit/veg salad at Bluebird Kitchen!  The breakfast egg sandwich is delicious, as are the Cuban and croque monsieur lunch sandwiches.  But my favorite eats are the salads - beet with lime and cilantro, cauliflower with chickpeas and curry, spinach with oranges.  All so good!  I'm totally on board with the restaurant's idea to source fresh, local, foods and craft the menu items as appropriate.  Oh and the baked goods are a treat!  I've had a couple of the cookie sandwiches and macarons and they did not disappoint.  A yummy, creative, thoughtful alternative to the traditional Pittsburgh breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing their espresso and vibe and service. LOVE.   btw, I go during the quiet time of the day. I have had some of their food but I can't afford to do that much. The sides I have had have been great. The monthly vegetarian sandwich not so much, but I've only tried that once or twice."}
{"text":"I follow a Vegan diet and the Bluebird has plenty of options. The service is always top notch as well- they are always friendly no matter how many annoying questions I ask... Much appreciated as I am aware of how much of a pain special dietary needs can be.  Best Soy Lattes in town, hands down- they come with two shots of espresso: perfect. Vegan chocolate chip cookies are to die for- prefer them over normal cookies.  Highly recommended. Sure, a bit pricey, but I you want homemade you have to pay for it. Absolutely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"For a small business, they sure don't want more business! I called today (12/31/14) to see what the soups of the day were and the owner answered and said \"uh, yeah, we just closed. We were only open until 12.\" I realize that it is New Year's Eve, but you are a business in a downtown area and people work on New Year's Eve day. This has happened a few times before with this location (their Stanwix location, I was told, has been closed ALL week), so I'm left wondering, are you a small business trying to stay in business?? Just curious because I would be happy to take the $10+ I would have spent (not to mention the 3+ co-workers who were all coming with me to go out to lunch) and spend it at another restaurant in Market Square or Downtown Pittsburgh. Your establishment isn't THAT phenomenal where I need to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Bluebird several times over the past few years since I work so close to Market Square. Sadly after my experience today I won't be back. This morning I stopped in for oatmeal and a coffee and had to ask one of the employees to take my order. Apparently she was taking a phone order but never told me that. I told her what I wanted and waited patiently while she continued to talk on the phone.   More people came in and other workers took their orders. After about 5-10 minutes I became frustrated and told another employee how long I had been waiting and then left.   This is not the first time I've experienced bad customer service at Bluebird. Most of the workers are rude and unfriendly."}
{"text":"I keep trying this place, hoping it could get better but it hasn't yet. I've had so many items and they are all just ok. Two weeks ago I went in for a breakfast sandwich and after a 15 minute wait I finally got my sandwich. When I went to office and unwrapped my breakfast, I saw 1 egg, covered in pepper (so much that it looked like cigarette ash), with LETTUCE AND TOMATO and the smallest little piece of cheese. Now waiting for 16 minutes wasn't great but getting LETTUCE and TOMATO on a breakfast sandwich?? I didn't ask for lettuce and tomato and this isn't listed on the menu. Why would it be? And all the pepper and the tiniest bit of cheese?? I will pay for quality, freshly made food and I'll even tolerate so-so service but I can't deal with really terrible food.   I will say the Stanwix store is so much better. I only go to that location and only get the granola which is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everyone is friendly, they're welcoming and kind, and the food is fantastic! The breakfast sandwich is to die for, perfectly cooked eggs on gloriously crunchy ciabatta bread and the thickest bacon you could ever imagine!   Also their coffee is phenomenal. I have been here every morning this summer for coffee before heading in to work. It brightens my day every time!"}
{"text":"Let me just get this out of the way: Bluebird, when it's good, is REALLY good.  What sucks is, unlike my coworkers and everyone else here on Yelp, I have had more bad experiences with BBK than good.   The first time I went there, I was giddily excited to try their vegetarian sandwich-of-the-month. It was some kind of tofu on ciabatta, and the menu boasted that it had some kind of funky sauce and lots of delicious pickled vegetables.  What I got was a rock of bread with uncooked tofu and beets. Everything was served ice cold. It was gross.  I also tried another veg-o-the-month sandwich a couple of years later. This time it was fried eggplant and some other stuff. Same deal - ice cold, served on rock hard bread, and tasteless.  Then, one day recently, I happened upon this AMAZING potato kale and beet soup. It was one of the best soups I've ever had. I thought my luck with Bluebird was finally turning.  Since then, I have stalked BBK on social media and at the store, looking for another delicious, amazing, vegetarian soup. They never have it. They have no soup, or they only have meat soup.   Today, I went back to Bluebird to check on the soup situation. As I walked in the door, one of the counter workers stared at me with this look of disdain that can only be rivaled by my cat when I spray him with water. She stared, then went behind a pillar with another coworker while I looked at the soups. She came around the wall after a few seconds, and obnoxious giggling, to take my order. I got this miso egg drop soup that was marked gluten-free and dairy-free. I wondered if that meant it was also meat-free, but I didn't want to burden this poor girl with any more of my disgusting demands, so I left.   It had chicken it. I gave it to my coworker, who said it was delicious. Yay.  I wish Bluebird and I had a better relationship. I just don't know what I did to hurt it. But she has burned me, time and again, and it's just not worth all the pain to have one good experience every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Bluebird Kitchen is simply not what it used to be. I haven't been here in five years, and I was pretty disappointed in my sandwich. I used to love the house turkey sandwich, which boasts house roasted turkey breast, butter lettuce, bacon jam, gouda cheese, and avocado. I was downtown this afternoon and decided to treat myself. I got back to my office that is now in Oakland, and I thought they'd messed up the order. I couldn't find the bacon jam or the avocado. I dug through and there was a stingy little swipe of each. So I got a turkey sandwich with lettuce and cheese on multigrain bread for $9.90. Maybe some things are the same as ever, but I'm never going to bother with this place again."}
{"text":"I have not one complaint about Bluebird Kitchen. They are quick, attentive, thorough and nice. Not to mention their sandwiches are sensational and very upscale for a Pixburgh sandwich that typically contains french fries. A little taste of France in the Pitts sounds like a fabulous way to spend my lunch hour!"}
{"text":"Sometimes OK, but today I had the worst New England Clam Chowder of my life.  Gritty clams, appears to not be cream based(a defining characteristic of NE clam chowder), undersalted, and utterly tasteless.  I usually find this place to be underwhelming and overpriced but I keep giving it another shot for some reason.  Probably that awesome Cubano they make.  I should just stick to that."}
{"text":"I so love this place when I was living downtown Pittsburgh. Its my #1 choice for my breakfast and lunch. Frittata Sandwich and Chicken salad sandwich are just some of my favorites. I have brought some of my friends to eat with me here and they love it. The place is very nice and neat. The people who work here  are so friendly and awesome! Some of them even knows my name which really feels good as a customer. I can't help myself but to keep getting back here. Very recommended. Still going to visit this place when I get back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and wanted a nice lunch for one while avoiding a chain restaurant.  I stopped in after 1:30pm (no waiting) and had a great turkey sandwich, tomato soup, and one amazing biscuit.  Not sure how long they have been in business, but would love to see one of these in Chicago.  They ran out of decaf coffee, but gave me a soda  water for free.  Nice decor too."}
{"text":"We thought we were walking into a sit-down cafe/restaurant so it kind of threw off our experience. Overall, the food was decent and I was happy to find that most of it is organic and made in house. Not a mind blowing experience."}
{"text":"The Stanwix St. location is the best part of my morning ritual: (1) tackle the overnight email traffic, (2) grab a cuppa joe, (3) get a takeout Savory Oat Bowl from the Bluebird.  I've never been any kind of oatmeal fan, but this amazing combo of chicken stock, oats, braised kale and fried egg has me singing its praises with a convert's zeal. I often need to work through lunch on various events, and the savory oat bowl *easily* keeps me going until suppertime, with maybe an apple or two along the way.  It's a perfect breakfast, and a great value."}
{"text":"Best food I've found in pit. Fresh juice, local eggs and bacon and homemade sausage. They just need wipes."}
{"text":"The sandwich I had was good, but essentially a half of a sandwich for $9!  It came with nothing else, so if I would have ordered a drink and a bag of chips I would probably be in the 12-15 range!  Way overpriced for me."}
{"text":"So glad we stumbled upon this place while visiting Pittsburgh. Our sandwiches were great (House Roast Beef and Croque Monsieur) and the potato salad was delicious, but what I really want to write about is the apple pie that was being served while we were there... I cannot remember the complete list of ingredients or exactly what the pie was called, but I can say that was absolutely the BEST apple pie I have ever had in my life. Every bite was PERFECT! Next time we are in town we will certainly visit the Bluebird Kitchen again. I can only hope and pray that the apple pie is being served again, but if it's not I'm sure there will be another dessert just as delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to go here after watching it being constructed for what seemed like a decade. Had the fried egg sandwich with bacon, and it was really good. The quality of their ingredients is obvious, as the bacon was thick and flavorful, the eggs were delicious, and the bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  This restaurant is a refreshing change of pace from some of the other options around downtown, and will hopefully be here to stay. Can't wait to go back and try some lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Excellent quality fresh foods.  Not cheap, but good food rarely is."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and fresh. I love the oatmeal for breakfast and their bakery items are super delish and unique (bacon glazed cinnamon bun anyone?). Lunch is super pricey, though--$12 for a tiny salad. I'd go somewhere else for lunch but I liked breakfast so much I ate here 4 days in a row!"}
{"text":"Good food but really stingy portions for the price- 3+ dollars for a side dish and got maybe 3 tablespoons of food?  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Their ice coffee is superlative.   The perfect spot to grab a bite while exploring Pittsburgh, we started our day with the egg sandwich and a smoothie.  Well made and great bread.  While I question the wisdom of lettuce on a warm sandwich in general.. The food is top notch."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and ordered the pastrami salmon on a bagel and egg sandwich on a pretzel bun. We also split a side of sweet potato corned beef hash, which was amazing!   The sandwiches were tasty and a nice size. We would have preferred that they offered to toast the bagel. Nice place to stop in for a quick bite in downtown pgh."}
{"text":"I only give it one star because there is no negative star rating.   Impossibly slow.  Apathetic staff.  .....Waiting for over ten minutes for a sandwich that never came while watching the kitchen and wait staff stand around gabbing....... Then, when I got back to my office to eat my beet salad, I found that the server had given me less than half of a serving.  Save yourself the time and aggravation and walk on by."}
{"text":"Customer service was extremely poor. I specifically asked if the potato soup contained meat and I was confidently told no by the cashier. I started eating within the restaurant and came across what seemed like chicken, so I asked the cashier if she could identify what was in my soup since there was no meat included in the ingredients. She then said that she didn't know, but that she was sure the chef said there was no meat in the soup. I walked away, but wasn't satisfied with this answer, so I went up again and asked if she could ask someone else what it was that was in my soup I was eating. The cashier then turned to another employee and said \"here you deal with this, I don't know\" and put her hands in the air. The second employee looked at my spoon and said that she didn't know what it was and repeated that it wasn't meat. -__- She then calls the chef to see what was in my soup. The chef observes and says that it looks like chicken and that someone must've used the wrong ladle - causing there to be chicken in the potato soup....Someone who I assumed to be the manager apologized and gave me a refund. The two women were rude, uninformed, and unapologetic. I didn't appreciate their attitude towards me for asking about the ingredients in the food they were serving. This was my first time trying bluebird kitchen and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and lunch spot in downtown Pittsburgh, right off of Market Square.  Their menu has seasonal items that change each month, but the main sandwiches/salads stay the same.  They always have a variety of cold salads and cookies/pastries on the counter.  Limited counter seating, so it's not the best spot for a large group.  The order line does get backed up, but the staff does a great job of keeping it moving.  My favorites are the turkey sandwich and the cuban."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp rating but was sorely disappointed.   Ordered Turkey sandwich and received it promptly. In fact it had been pre made, but seemed fresh.  It had a couple of thin toppings of their specialty condiments (avocado and something else) but it was very dry.  I asked for some mustard and was offered a mustard dressing for 80 cents.  I asked if they just had some plain mustard and, after checking with the kitchen, was told no.   A sandwich shop without mustard?  The sandwich would have been perfect for $5 or even $8 on the high end, but I paid nearly $10 for a basic sandwich and a glass of ice water with no table service.   Wanting to give them one more chance and still hungry, I decided to try their Peanut Butter cookie sandwich (2 cookies filled with a cream frosting).  Once again, the taste was okay (although slightly burned and overlooked), but the cost was nearly $3.   I probably won't be going back soon."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and will come back! Got the pastrami salmon... Delicious! Nice staff.. Winner winner"}
{"text":"Interesting lunch, in a good way. I had some kind of brown rice and zucchini salad, which was very flavorful and the soup   Was also tasty. I will go there again. I liked the vibe. Good lunch option in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I used Bluebird last week for a breakfast in-service for work. I ordered some mini (as in one bite each) quiches, fruit, assorted pastries and coffee for 20 people. The total was over $400!!! that's over $20/person, for fruit and quiche! I could understand that price if I was serving some gourmet breakfast spread; but this was not gourmet. The quiches were pretty good and the fruit was fresh, though the pastries were pretty bland and unappealing...most of them went untouched.  I am not sure what is more outrageous when I look at the bill; the $37.50 for paper plates and utensils or the $55 for two boxes of coffee. That is literally twice the price of a box of joe from Dunkin. Absurd. I'm glad they didn't deliver, who know how much that charge would have been!"}
{"text":"The food is wholesome and delicious.  The staff are good-looking and well-mannered, but they are painfully slow."}
{"text":"I stopped by Bluebird Kitchen the other day to grab some breakfast. I thought the place looked fantastic and modern. I can tell they must get some decent lunch business because most of the space is reserved for ordering and waiting for your food. There are two long shelf tables where you can sit, a little uncomfortably, and eat your food within. It is nice to be able to eat and look out at the passing downtown crowds though. I got the egg sandwich. It was decent, but I will never understand why one would want lettuce and tomato on a breakfast sandwich. After taking those off, I enjoyed the sandwich. The egg was cooked to perfection and was runny, just as I like it. Fortunately my girlfriend had my back with a handful of napkins! The coffee was good, and hot. No complaints there.  The wait time for my food was a little longer than I had expected, especially since there was not a line to order. I guess that is the trade off for freshly cooked food. I think this place would be exponentially better if they had table service, but the space may not be there for this. Overall, this is a great addition to Market Square and I look forward to trying lunch."}
{"text":"Great idea, thank you!  - healthy but fast lunches, wow, what a concept! - locally sourced eggs and other farm products, you care! - housemade everything, no frozen crap - great, fast breakfast in the morning with tons of healthy but tasty options - pretty good cup of coffee as well  - Only complaint, don't be afraid to let the chalk board menu signs get messy - use them, we wanna know what today's \"soup of the day\" is.   Good job!"}
{"text":"Came here for the breakfast sandwiches and we were not disappointed. I had the fried egg sandwich on the pretzel bun and the hubster had the fried egg sandwich with bacon on ciabatta roll.  OMG!  For a breakfast sandwich they are HUGE! We ended up splitting the pretzel bun sandwich and saved the ciabatta roll for the flight back to Sacramento (low cost airlines = little bags of peanuts and pretzels).  Bread on both sandwiches was excellent.  Nicely layered with fresh produce and choice of swiss or cheddar cheese - yum!!!  We also got a cashew scone and chocolate chip muffin for later which were also delightful."}
{"text":"Yinzer Ottolenghi. Rotating menu, everything's high quality."}
{"text":"I work downtown and stop in at bluebird from time to time.  We've even ordered catering a few times.  Food is great and my favorite is the oatmeal for breakfast.  It's the best oatmeal I've ever had.   Sandwiches for lunch meeting are really great but I get the feeling that catering either isn't their favorite thing to do or they just don't do it enough to perfect the art.   Almost every time we order, something is missing but overall they take care of the issue and we are still happy customers.   If the food wasn't so amazing I'd never go there because their customer service is lacking.  In my personal experience I've never run into anyone on staff there who didn't think that it was my pleasure to enter into the establishment.   LOL if they fix their customer service attitudes this place would earn a fourth star from me."}
{"text":"It's a great little place for lunch. They don't have much seating, so if you get lucky, take advantage of it. You're near Market Square, so takeout is also a great option. My favorite is the chicken salad. It's not your normal recipe, so I suggest trying it. They also have a great macaron selection, which makes for a great desert back to the office. They sell Slingshot Coffee, a great coldbrew. Not many places have it in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for a business meeting. The chicken salad sandwich did not come on the croissant as described on the menu. The chicken salad itself was very salty, and there wasn't much of it on the sandwich altogether. The chicken salad was actually big chunks of chicken making it kind of hard to eat - take a bit and pull out a big hunk of chicken. Unfortunately, I will not choose to order from Bluebird again."}
{"text":"BEETS.  Give me all the fresh roasted beets.   I've been saying for some time now that I wish there was something East End Food Coop-y downtown for lunch and Bluebird kitchen is kind of that.  They are so effing good for lunch that if it's nice out I pretty much have to abandon my salad from home in the office fridge and hit this place up.  Lots of delicious and healthful vegetable dishes and soups that you can get as sides or full meals, or go  with one of their sinful sandwiches and desserts .  I haven't had anything from here that I haven't loved.  The main issues are that the line is usually out of control when I want to go, sometimes the staff takes out their obvious stress from said line on the wrong customer (any customer) and it has to be nice out for me because there's never room to eat inside and it's nice to eat outside in Market Square.  But that long line has got to be good news for them and I want more options like this downtown, so cheers."}
{"text":"Tried this place again at the insistence of someone in my group.  Even worse than before.  I paid $6 for a cup of chicken broth.  It said chicken and farro soup but I see a small number of grains and even less chicken.  The pieces of chicken I got were dark gristle.    What a scam this place is.  I have never seen a restaurant so stingy with ingredients in my entire life.    It will be my mission to talk everyone out of this place in the future.  Total joke."}
{"text":"While the quality of the ingredients are pretty good, and the presentation of the food is pretty good, this place just falls down for a couple major problems.  1. Speed. Went there for breakfast recently and the it took entirely too long to get my food.  I'm trying to sneak out of work to grab a quick sandwich and instead it turns into my lunch break.  There were no other customers in the place ---- the name of the game is to get people in and out. ESPECIALLY DOWNTOWN!!  2. Generosity of the ingredients.  The roast beef sandwich was all bread and very little meat.  I don't mind paying $9 for a sandwich, but it better be good and fill me up. They had only one or two measly slices of roast beef.  For these two reasons, I won't be going back any time soon!"}
{"text":"Bluebird Kitchen is tucked away in Market Square and easy to miss. It's a hidden gem, though and a great place for a healthy breakfast or lunch option in downtown. I love stopping by in the mornings for their granola and yogurt. In the afternoon, they have a great selection of fresh veggies, salads, and other lunch options - I love their fresh beets! If you're able to find a bar stool near the window, it's a prime spot for people watching, too! Tasty food to go, in downtown for a great price... that's a win for me!  - xoxo, A (A California girl living in Pittsburgh on purpose)."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast one day we had to be downtown. My daughter visiting from Lancaster mentioned it. It actually is reminiscent of some places we eat breakfast in Lancaster when we visit there. It was on my list of places to visit, but I never seem to have that list with me when we're trying to decide where to eat. I had the Frittata on a ciabatta roll. That phrase just rolls off the tongue The roll was fresh and soft, not too chewy. The filling was very good and didn't fall out as sometimes happens in such sandwiches. Same for the Local Fried Eggs that my daughter also ordered on the ciabatta roll. She and I shared the Blue Bird Granola, also very good, but I would have liked a bit more honey or fruit to sweeten a little more. My husband had the Biscuits and Gravy which he orders just about everywhere he finds it on the menu. He said it was good which is just about as good as his praise gets. My daughter tasted it, and said it was delicious. We chose to sit at the counter to eat, although we saw many people getting take-out orders. We didn't notice when we entered how close Market Square was or we might have gone there to sit and eat. The seating isn't the best for comfort if you decide to eat there. We also found the paper container for biscuits and gravy a little disconcerting although understandable for take out and the environment. I would recommend the Bluebird Kitchen for breakfast and will return to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food but a lack in attention to detail. I usually get the vegan option for lunch. I am unsure I will be back. Their last vegan sandwich had Kalamata olives on it, which are great on a sandwich once you remove the pits. I almost broke my tooth. Thinking it's an easy mistake to miss one I continued to eat my sandwich. Every olive on the sandwich still had its pit. When I called to inform them they did not seem too concerned. So enjoy with cation."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times this week.  The breakfast is fantastic.  I just had the frittata.  It was amazing.    This is a great restaurant and I am glad it is in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great fried egg, cheese, tomato and sausage for $6 plus a great macchiato and not overly sweet cinnamon roll. You've gotta go. Seems like a place that would be in SF or NYC. And that's a good thing."}
{"text":"Ive been to this bakery/ restaurant about 30 times. I love the concept of a French bakery.The quiche and croissants are five stars.Anything I ate was five stars. So if you're hungry I suggest the Quiche or another daily special. One friend likes the grits. On a lighter appetite, the croissant or an amazing muffin.   The coffee.....well, I am not happy with the flavor. Too bitter. I enjoy espresso,cappuccino, drip coffees, and usually the strong flavors. I have tried their cappuccino, americano, drip and decaf cappuccino,drip and pour overs. Nothing makes me warm and fuzzy. Granted, I am a coffee snob, so take my judgement with a grain of salt. Please try this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Missed out on breakfast so we got lunch instead. I got the July vegetarian and y boyfriend got a chicken salad. Both meals were incredible. My meal was a sandwich and it was life changing. Bye."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop and cafe. My vanilla cappuccino was delicious. House roasted turkey sandwich was phenomenal! Service was great too"}
{"text":"I would only recommend this spot for their pastries & breakfast - both of which are super tasty. Skip their coffee and their lunch. Annoyingly, they have delicious coffee, but they are cheap on their to-go cups so most of it ends up on your hands, clothes and the street (I've experienced this repeatedly over the past couple of months). But the real killer here was that my salad was filled to the brim with unwashed lettuce (nice and gritty, yum!) and only about 2 ounces of chicken. What justification can I provide for spending $15+ on lunch when they can't even bother to wash lettuce? Maybe it was an off day but lettuce costs $1/head and skimping on toppings to save money is just not acceptable at that price point. So if you are going to go here, skip lunch and coffee and just go for the pastries & breakfast."}
{"text":"Thanks to various events that I have sampled Bluebird Kitchen at I could not wait to try out the real deal.  Glad I was able to beat the lunch crowd today as by the time I finished up my lunch (yes they have small counter tops with stools to sit at) the line was almost out the door.  They have a choice of fresh salads, sandwiches, sides and desserts which rotate daily.  I went with the turkey sandwich on homemade bread (the best bread I have tasted in a while that was thick and so fresh), lettuce, and a bacon jam with cheese.  I picked the potato salad as my side which had a nice mix of regular and sweet potatoes.  Got to sample the brussel sprout salad which was also tasty. Can't leave out dessert and went with the vegan chocolate chip cookie which melts in your mouth!  The only catch is the prices and those 3 things cost $15 but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Not the best.  Baked goods are awesome.  Soups are OK  but not overly flavorful very disappointed in how this place is sliding.  pricing keeps going up and quality down.  I just paid $10 for a turkey sandwich that was missing half of the ingredients described on the menu. Cashiers cant make change and they just hand you your stuff without even asking if you need a bag.  I got soup and sandwich handed to me.  Soup was dripped all over the container.  I asked for a bag and got an eye roll and a bag popped and handed to me like I had a disease. don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Discovered this little cafe during a business trip. I ordered the chicken salad. House-roasted chicken with pear slices, grilled onion, blue cheese and candied walnuts was delicious.   There is not much seating. It is more of a \"to go\" place.   My only complaint is that half my lettuce was heart/core of the head of lettuce.   I would recommend for a healthy, delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Their baked goods are delicious I'll give them that. Beyond that their Foods okay I'm a former chef and my tastes and standards are high. The owner is a bit graphing rude and do not really care for him and his sensibilities. I can create a lot tuna environment when you're putting out a certain energy. If I want a cup of coffee I'll go to the 7-Eleven that's about how high they rank with me. If you want the sandwich who's playing at other places like your house"}
{"text":"Haven't written a yelp review in a really long time.  The customer service at Bluebird Kitchen warranted it.   The food was amazing, exceptional.  The young man working the cash register was seriously afflicted with an unacceptable attitude.  Enough so, that even though I am craving the food, I will not return.  LIke Ever.  Disappointing that so much care and effort are put into the food only to be ruined by a little twit with an attitude.   It matters."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with a co-worker while we were at a conference.  I was not sure if it was because I was hungry or it it was really that good. I had the breakfast egg sandwich on a chibatta roll with the additional sausage. To say it was delicious and that it hit the spot is an understatement. Something to be said when a friend egg is cooked just right, so the yolk runs, but not that much.  The sandwich also came with lettuce and tomato with Swiss and cheddar. Yum! So we we decided to go back the next day and don't you know, it was good on that day too. So this is a definite have to visit location. It is my understanding that they have a sister store not to far away as well. Haven't been to that one, but I have to recommend this on not only for the food but for the friendly service that we got.  They also have a special on day old pastry, I had a mixed berries and perch bread pudding that was on point. Great job all around."}
{"text":"Being able to make \"put a bird on it!\"-related jokes is probably the only  reason I didn't give this place 1 star. I was in Pittsburgh for an extended weekend, and having already had some great food on the Square, thought to hit this place up. Let's start with the food and drinks: coffee was mediocre at best, and although they told me my Americano had four shots, it certainly didn't taste like it. Food? Dismal. I had a Cuban that should be emargoed, and the price was Bay of Pigs-level ridiculous.   But here's the kicker! You can serve crap coffee, barely edible food, and STILL be a decent cafe as LONG AS your staff is moderately friendly. But not so at Bluebird! I was not thanked for my purchase, I was questioned when I asked for the WiFi password to be written down for me, and was neither greeted nor even given a friendly goodbye by the 3 staff that were busy thinking of other creative ways to be rude to their clientele (I can only assume).    I know what you're thinking: they were probably super busy painting birds on things, and just didn't have the time....NOPE! My friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant.   In conclusion.  Save your hard earned coins for a place that will at least serve you a half-decent cup o'joe."}
{"text":"We were in town for a visit and stopped by for breakfast. I guess we went too late because the first three things we tried to order were not available. I ended up getting the oatmeal. It was good but nothing spectacular. The dirty chai latte was really good, though. I have a feeling this review would be more positive if the other dishes had been available. If we go to the downtown area again we'll probably give it another try earlier than 10 am."}
{"text":"I used to love this place a few years ago. Everything was fresh and unique and the baked goods were delicious.  Today I stopped in for the Baby Romaine salad that they've had on the menu since they opened (another favorite of mine). Unfortunately, their salads seem to be similar in quality and flavor these days to the ones you find in the cooler at a Rite Aid or CVS. Whatever they did to the marcona almonds made them seem chewy and stale, the romaine was wilted and browning, and there were barely any dates.  With tax, it wasn't a great way to spend 8 bucks on lunch. Here's hoping they get back to the fresh old days."}
{"text":"Local fried eggs with bacon on ciabatta was delicious. The yogurt parfait was fresh and good. Fresh squeezed orange juice and cinnamon roll were good too. Only complaint is that it took about 15 minutes and 2 reminders to get a simple bagel, which turned out to be burnt and bland afterall. Well worth the prices."}
{"text":"Before heading to Pittsburgh this past weekend, I consulted a friend online about where some of the best local spots downtown were. He had mentioned that there were many changes happening in downtown Pittsburgh; both good and bad. When the boyfriend and I walked over to Market Square, just a mere block from out hotel, I was saddened to see major chain restaurants slowly taking over the area surrounding this adorable public space. Chipotle and Starbucks have been making their presence known next to old oyster houses and a dying breed of long-standing locals. However, there was a glimmer of hope just outside of the square. Bluebird Kitchen has only been open for a few months, but I can say with confidence that it is one of the most charming local spots in town.  We only had a couple of days to explore Pittsburgh, so we got up early and wandered a few blocks away from The Fairmont hotel and grabbed a quick breakfast at Bluebird Kitchen. It seems that this place is more of a grab-and-go type of spot for locals and business folk on the run. Prices were incredibly reasonable and the quality of ingredients were top notch; from house-made breads, local eggs, and even agriculturally responsible meats and organic produce. We both ordered their egg sandwich which was a steal at $4. Served on a thick pretzel roll with fried local free-range eggs with crisp lettuce, cherry tomatoes and gooey cheddar and Gruyère cheeses. I opted for some house-made sausage on my sandwich (an additional $1.25); light and full of flavor.  A hefty breakfast for two clocking in at under $10? We will surely return on every Pittsburgh trip. The lunch menu looks pretty great too."}
{"text":"I ordered the house turkey sandwich for lunch.. I unfortunately have to say I was underwhelmed. It was certainly a fresh sandwich but the main reason I got it was because the shallot bacon jam sounded really good, except they barely put any on. I'm talking I couldn't even see it at first so I actually went into the work kitchen for some dressing and upon further inspection found the slightest smear of jam under a part of the cheese. The sandwich was quite dry and bland so for $9.90 I'm definitely disappointed. I will say their staff was really friendly and their baked goods looked amazing. I'll definitely try this place again for breakfast but I don't think I'll pay for lunch here again."}
{"text":"I have had to downgrade my rating after numerous trips there. Today was the straw that broke this camel's back. I was there before the lunch rush. There was one other customer, she was being helped.  The three other employees ignored me for a good two minutes.  One was absentmindedly playing with her phone.  I ordered the chicken vegetable faro soup and a vegan chocolate chip cookie.  The service is just so hipster, I'm-too-cool-to-work vibe that I honestly can't take it anymore.  Every transaction with every employees is just cold and unfriendly, but yet I still feel guilted to write in a tip on the tip line.  Got back to my office to eat my soup, and it was nearly all watery broth.  What a kick in the teeth.  At least my cookie was good..."}
{"text":"I got the pastrami cured salmon bagel twice this week before work. The first time is was delicious. The second time the bagel was too stale to eat. Why would they serve that? Throw it in the toaster?   I think I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Bluebird Kitchen reminds me of something you'd find in NYC. It's one of the fancier take-out places for breakfast and lunch here in downtown Pittsburgh. You can tell a lot of thought was put into building the menu because it's not your average sandwiches and salads; it seems slightly gourmet. I've tried a couple things here and they've all tasted well put-together and very fresh. On top of their regular menu items, they have a daily special along with changing salad options and not to mention their baked goods. The few downfalls to Bluebird Kitchen are the space is small with very minimal seating, the layout is slightly awkward, so if you're not familiar with the place, it's hard to figure out where to order vs. where to pay, and it's only open until 3pm Mon-Fri, which was a real bummer for me when I used to live downtown."}
{"text":"Came here twice in one week during a business trip. First stop was for a quick coffee and to grab a macaroon I'd seen on another review. The macaroon was so delicious (blueberry cheesecake flavor). Ambiance is cute too. The service was meh. Was not greeted, rather just stared at until I said hello and asked what I wanted to order.  Second stop was for a quick breakfast sandwich. Again yummy, but same kind of cold nonchalant service. I totally wanted to rate this place higher but service is kind of a big deal to me. At least the food is good."}
{"text":"A great local healthy option!  Stopped I here with a coworker and I was impressed. They have healthy soups, salads, sandwiches, and sides. Lots of vegetarian options as well as GF. Their desert selection also looked amazing and were hard to resist. It is counter service and the lettuce type salads were pre-made but looked very fresh. Their sides and soups change and they have specials.   I had a small watermelon/kale/quinoa salad and a large corn chowder soup. The salad was light, flavorful, and refreshing. The corn chowder was just amazingly packed full of corn and other vegetables. It was hardy and delicious. I was full but couldn't stop eating it.   I also got a peanut butter bacon cookie... Yes PB & bacon... omg... So much for watching calories but it was worth it. The cookie was moist and scrumptious.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bluebird is the type of place Pittsburgh wants for their next generation. They're trying to be trendier and give a more hipster feel to the new places. Obviously the old diners and blue collar joints aren't leaving, but the people in Pittsburgh are making a real concentrated effort to add things to their city that more resembles something stolen from Brooklyn. I can dig that.  Bluebird is tucked into Forbes right around the corner from Market Square. It's a fresh space with a counter in the front of the store and a couple of tables to the side. Giving a nod to the name, the color tone is a calming blue that relaxes you. It's so warm and inviting you almost forget there's almost no seating for people!  My dad and I both ordered lattes, and I was a bit famished so I decided to order the grits. He went for a blueberry muffin as he has much more self control than me. We received our lattes and pastry almost immediately, and were able to snag two seats at the counter right before my bacon cheddar grits became available.  The lattes weren't my favorite, but they were acceptable enough that if my dad asked to come back I would be okay with it. He enjoyed his muffin and I dug right into the grits. They were perfectly cooked, and included a large mound of cheese and a wonderfully executed runny egg. There was also a lot more than I was expecting; I had trouble finishing it all! My only qualm was that it was served in a cardboard to-go box. I understand that may be the cool thing to do, but it was a little difficult to make sure a huge mess didn't end up on the counter. I can't imagine the mess you'd have to sop up if it were taken to-go.  I would visit here again. I think I may have chosen the wrong drink, but I loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Bluebird sets the bar high for deli restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh. The quality of sandwich breads and spreads is top notch. Roast beef, turkey, and vegetarian options are worth trying out. Kettle chips are average, but the fresh cookies are incredible!"}
{"text":"A litte bit on the pricey side at first glance, however the Cuban sandwich was worth it. The meat was tender and the whole grain mustard gave the sandwich a different kick from your typical cuban sandwich.   Red velvet cookie sandwich was also delicious and fresh.   Be prepared to wait in a little bit of a line around lunch time though and seating is sparse. Good for carry out if you have the time to spare during your lunch break."}
{"text":"Finally! This review is LONG overdue - during the last year or so working downtown has given me multiple chances to eat at the beloved Bluebird Kitchen. I've come here for made-to-order breakfasts and lunches alike, and nothing has disappointed.   Their enormous breakfast sandwiches and fresh fruit smoothies leave me feeling full and satisfied, moreso than other places with similar breakfast options; the potato, sausage, egg and goat cheese laden frittata sandwich is a definite favorite. And their lunches are also a wonderful and tasty option should I forget to bring something to work that day. Their roast beef and Cuban sandwiches have been my favorites so far.  If you're the type who likes seasonal items, Bluebird offers monthly smoothies and sandwiches as an addition to the standard menu. I tried their special vegetarian sandwich from last summer (with fried green tomato, grapefruit & cabbage coleslaw) - I admittedly remember that sandwich being on the bitter side, more so than I expected as someone who likes both green tomatoes and grapefruit. It wasn't bad though, and it was certainly a unique flavor profile compared to what I typically find for a quicker downtown lunchtime option.  It's definitely safe to say that this place has knocked it out of the park and made my taste buds very happy time and time again. And that's just considering their main meals - the amazing desserts elevate your meal options to an entirely different level. They're good. They're really good. You should go buy one of them in addition to a sandwich. And oh: this review is based on my limited perusing of the menu - I have yet to try their biscuits, granola, quiche, bread pudding, and salads.  I know getting to Bluebird before they close can be a chore if you're not nearby, but they're worth it. Stop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely and charming place in the middle of downtown Pittsburgh, but it was simply just okay. I went for breakfast with my mom and got the pastrami cured salmon bagel and she got the sweet potato corned beef hash. We also ordered a pumpkin cinnamon roll to go (I can't resist anything pumpkin). The interior was beautiful, the food looked great, but upon eating it I just kind of felt alright. It wasn't too special except everything just looked good. I'm willing to give it another try for lunch because it's never easy to get breakfast perfectly right!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for lunch in downtown Pittsburgh. The food is delicious and inspired - not the generic sandwiches and sodas you get at a corner deli. I've had their soups, sandwiches, sides, desserts, and coffee. The breakfast menu looks amazing as well but I'm never downtown for breakfast so I can't say much about that.  The prices are a bit higher for a meal than, say, nearby Chipotle or Subway, but the quality of the food you get more than makes up for the difference in my opinion. I usually get a small soup and small side and that's enough for a satisfying lunch for me and comes out to be about $7-8. They have a core menu of items and also daily and monthly specials so there's always something new to try. One thing to keep in mind is that the sandwiches are made to order while the salads are pre-made that morning and in to-go boxes.   Seating is limited to bar-style seating along the wall and windows, which works fine for me since I'm usually just looking to grab a quick lunch during the workday and not to have a long sit-down meal.  I hope Bluebird Kitchen never leaves downtown because there's really no other similar spot downtown like it."}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh for work and when I searched 'vegan' this came up with many reviews saying that there were a lot of vegan options so I decided to give it a try as it's right by the office building. - I went twice - once for breakfast and once for lunch.   Good points: almond milk available, labels for 'gf' and 'vegan', friendly staff, and AMAZING lattes   Not so good: The food - both times it just left me with a blah feeling - to be fair, for breakfast I just had the oatmeal, which was never going to be all that exciting - for lunch though I had the January sandwhich special which was chickpeas, lemon, carmelized pineapple, brussel sprouts, and pickled onion on sourdough - with all of that it should have been bursting with flavor but it litterally had no flavor at all - it just tasted like a ton of bread (which tasted more like french bread than sourdough to me) and smushed chickpeas  So honestly the 3 star rating is all for the latte"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches and pastries. Also had an iced coffee that was great.   Just be aware there's a window between 10:30am and 11 where they switch from breakfast to lunch and you can't order some things during that time."}
{"text":"This place used to be acceptable when Pittsburgh didn't have many other options for quick and healthy dining. However, for the last few years they have been resting on their laurels without taking new competition and consumer awareness into account. It's 2017, you can't put a revolting, rock-hard avocado on a $9 salad anymore and expect repeat customers. I also find many of their lunch options to be poorly-conceived, and their soups and sauces are usually either under-seasoned or overly sweet. Not worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Not the best service...food was disappointing...we went there on a recommendation we were in town from California. .I don't particularly recommend going there for breakfast. Can't speak about lunch."}
{"text":"BEST biscuits and gravy I've ever had!!  Also had coffee and quiche, both delicious. Staff was very friendly and helpful. If you're visiting the area and looking for a quick breakfast/brunch, I highly recommend trying this place out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous little spot! Menu changes daily, but you can bet there will be something (or a lot of things here) that you will like!! Came here for breakfast and got a coffee, small corned beef hash, and salmon pastrami which tasted delicious with their homemade pretzel bread as they were out of bagels. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! Seating was a little tight, but the lines move quickly and they accept credit cards including AmEx! Yay!"}
{"text":"\"Discovered\" Blue Bird Kitchen via Instagram while visiting Pittsburgh for the week. I normally don't do repeats when traveling, especially in Pittsburgh where I have many favorites. I made an exception this time however! I stopped in twice for lunch this week, and was very pleased both times.   Somehow I managed to hit the line perfectly on both visits, but the line is a good indicator of how delicious the food is here! The first visit I got a roast beef sandwich, on nicely chewy ciabatta. I took it down to nearby Market Square and enjoyed it while listing to some great live music.   My second visit, I tried the Cuban and a cinnamon brown sugar macaron--flavor explosion! I removed one extra fatty piece of pork from my sandwich, but that's a personal preference/texture issue with me. The macaron was perfect!  With tip, my lunch was less than $15 both visits, which was awesome! They also had a limited dining area, which I took advantage of today, since there was a busy farmers market going on at Market Square.   My next trip to Pittsburgh I want to try their quiche, it looked really good, as did their layer cake of the day. I will also pack more stretchy pants, because I think I gained 5 pounds this week, eating my way through the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"It was such a nice sunny day so my friend and I decided to grab lunch. The vibe at bluebird reminds me of home in San Francisco. We decided to split the Cuban and the roast beef sandwiches. Both were delicious, but the roast beef was a little too dry for my taste both in the beef and in the composition of the sandwich. That Cuban tho.... Omg so deliciously moist and flavorful and he pickles were awesome. We also decided to have a rhubarb oat bar while we waited for the sandwiches to be made, and that was bomb too. Overall I'd come back again to try the rest of their menu, especially those breakfast items they have"}
{"text":"Usually I have very high expectations when I go in to places like this and there appears to be so much thought that goes into each of the sandwiches. We had the vegetarian and the Cubano and neither of them lived up to our expectations. The seasoning and balance of ingredients just wasn't quite there. The bread was the only thing that really stood out to me. Would I come here if I worked nearby? Absolutely. I wouldn't go out of my way though. I like the idea of having higher end sandwiches in Pittsburgh, but the execution needs a bit of work."}
{"text":"This place is so new that when my friend suggested we go there for lunch, I had never even heard of it.  Fortunately, always up for something new, I agreed to go and I think I found a new favorite lunch spot downtown!  Bluebird Kitchen is located just around the corner of market square, next to Chipotle, and really sticks out as an original, non-chain, clean and cute bakery/eatery.  The inside is a gorgeous open space and very clean.  Their lunch menu is made up of an extensive selection of sandwiches, soups, salads and various sides.  (I didn't see the breakfast menu, but was informed they will start serving it tomorrow.)  In addition to lunch and breakfast, they had an array of delicious looking desserts.  The best part about Bluebird Kitchen is that everything is homemade daily, which is so refreshing.    For my lunch I got the Cuban sandwich and a cup of gazpacho.  My sandwich, served warm, was to die for!!  I could eat this sandwich for every meal and be a happy girl, except now I'm too intrigued and want to try everything else.  I did try to order the chicken salad sandwich at first, but they were all out of chicken salad.  (I went for a late lunch and they said this was a best seller - obviously I will be back to try it asap.)  My gazpacho was refreshing - I prefer a little more spice in mine, but I'm sure it's a bit different every day since it's made fresh.    As my friend and I were waiting for out food to be made, the owner, Liz (I think,) came to chat with us and was super friendly and genuinely interested in what we ordered.  She even offered me a free dessert while we waited!  (She clearly knew the way to my heart.)  I thought she just meant a free sample, but she gave me a whole gigantic cookie sandwich!  I'd be lying if I said this didn't make my day, maybe even week. :)  I got the chocolate cookie sandwich with pistachio filling.  Honestly, every dessert looked marvelous but I have a soft spot for pistachio desserts.  Like everything else, this cookie sandwich was excellent and I wish I could eat a dozen of them at once.  My only suggestion would be that they put some chairs or seating in the space.  There are bar tops along two walls that some people were eating at standing up, but the space is definitely big enough to put in some small tables/chairs or at least stools at the bar tops.  My friend and I had planned to eat outside so this didn't affect us - it would just be a nice option.    I will be recommending this place to everyone I know - I even grabbed some menus to put in my office.  I really hope the best for this place and think we need more unique eateries like this downtown.  I can't wait to go back and slowly, but surely, try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Monday thru Friday only!!!!! Closed weekends!!!!!! Be ware!!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this place is in Pittsburgh! If you work downtown, you know that there aren't many lunch options. Sure, you can walk to Market Square and sit down somewhere, but if you're short on time, your options are pretty limited to run-of-the-mill chain-type places. Bluebird is such a breath of fresh air!  From the signage to the decor, it is warm and inviting. And though the interior is on the small side, there's plenty of room to wait inside for when the weather is bad. They change the menu often depending on what is in season, especially the desserts.  I had been meaning to try this place for a long time now because my work friends rave about it, but because I often bring my lunch, I didn't get a chance to go until last week. Because we were having a pizza party at work, I decided to get a few sides and a dessert to the go with the pizza. It was a Friday after all, so I had to go all out. I had the housemade chips and a side of brussels sprouts with pecans and bacon jam. The bacon jam (which is so overdone at times) was really the perfect complement to the brussels sprouts and I had no trouble eating the entire thing.  For dessert, I tried the panna cotta on recommendation from the work friend. It was an earl gray panna cotta on top of a small piece of poppyseed cake. It was absolutely delicious. The textures of the panna cotta and cake blended together perfectly. There were so many sides and bakery items I wanted to try, and of course I need to come back for a real lunch sometime, not just sides and desserts. Everything looked and smelled incredibly fresh, and there are so many healthy choices as well. This is truly food you can feel good about."}
{"text":"$9.00 for canned tuna excuse me tuna nicoise is just not going to work for me. Not in this universe nor any other for that matter.   The Bluebird Kitchen has hours until 3pm.  I arrived at 2:50pm and not wanting anyone to have to prepare something that close to closing time I opted from the tuna nicoise salad with the mustard dressing. Now hear me out on this one. When the dressing is the best part of the meal you know you're in trouble.    The description of the salad said, \"Yellow fin tuna cured in oil. Oh come off if BBK, yellow fin, and cured ought to be removed out of that description. I feel smoke going up my breaches and I don't like it.  I do not like far reaching menu descriptions and inflated prices for a tuna salad.  I had to grab a  copy of the menu after I started eating.  I had to reread the meal description to double check what I had gotten myself into.  I don't care what kind of tuna you started out with. Once it goes in the can it all becomes the same tuna when you take it out of there.  The space is very lovely, big windows and bright , airy and sunny.  I would love to go back for a cup of coffee....but I'll get my tuna salad elsewhere for now.   Switch to tuna steaks, add another $1.50 to the price of the salad either that or take $4.00 of the price of the salad and let it be what it is."}
{"text":"When traveling the world it's sometimes tough to find a quick stop to find vegan food to fuel you up. This is certainly the place to do it. Further if you have travel companions they can find many options that are non-vegan. Glad I found this local favorite on my visit."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a few days for business.  I really wanted to try breakfast, but didn't have time to squeeze it in prior to scheduled meetings for the day.   I did however visit for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.  At 12:15, the place was pretty full, with people in line wating to order and well as customers waiting for their orders.   There was a pretty decent list of sandwiches, salads and soups.  I opted for the Rotisserie Chicken salad sandwich which had apples, cashews and curry seasoning on a homemade croissant.   I also opted for a side salad of grains and vegetables.  The sandwich ($8.50), was a little bit pricey but, it was pretty fresh and tasty.  The chicken was a bit salty, but all in all the combination was spot on.   There were multiple side salads displayed and available.  I opted for the Farro, strawberries, veggies and figs in a honey balsamic dressing, or at least that's what the sign read.   When I arrived back to my office, I actually had a salad that was completely different with asparagus (I'm allergic) and tofu, savory, not sweet.  I removed the  asparagus and enjoyed the remaining salad.   This place was a bit chaotic, but I would return....the food was good."}
{"text":"Knowing not the adventures of downtown lunching (as I work in the 'burbs) - finding myself downtown noonish on a weekday (jury duty, sees) - I was recommended by a friend to try Bluebird Kitchen.   It was a beautiful day, one of the first warmish/sunny days of (almost) spring -  full of energy - and busy (the city) and the breakfast and lunch cafe that is Bluebird Kitchen.   Great location - Market Square - and a unique lunch place for Pittsburgh. Reminded me of lunch joints in NYC. A little pricey for an la carte, grab and go lunch, but I wouldn't necessarily say overpriced - worth the extra few dollars for quick and easy, good, fresh food. There are places to sit along the windows and walls - high top bar stools along the perimeter of the inside - but it seemed most took their food to go...I'm sure when it's really warm outside it would be great to grab a salad, soup or sandwich (or cookie!) to take to the square and enjoy."}
{"text":"My mom and I popped in to the Bluebird Kitchen on Thursday morning during a long bike ride. I had a cinnamon roll and a chai latte and she had a hot tea and a egg in a basket. The location is a little unexpected (we went to the one on the ground floor of the First Niagara building) and the hours they keep don't permit me to visit very often. They are open 7-2 on weekdays and not at all on weekends to my knowledge. The food was delicious but I was sad that they didn't have the selection of cookies and other treats I see featured on their Instagram account. I'm going to need to make a special trip to the Market Square location before school starts! Good food and nice beverage selection - great brunch stop!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing great things about Bluebird Kitchen, so I was very pleased to find out it could live up to the hype.  All the food was freshly and creatively prepared.  I tried the Cuban plus a Hazelnut Oatmeal cookie, and both were really tasty.    I don't get Downtown much during the day, however it's good to know there is a really good option for lunch and breakfast.    I was also surprised to find out there are 2 locations, the second location is on Smithfield."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice and had two pretty different experiences.  The first time, L and I went for lunch to grab something and bring it back to work to eat in the office since we knew that there was no seating in the place and it was farmer's market day in Market Square.  We both had the veggie sandwich on rosemary and sea salt foccaccia. We also decided to splurge and split the oatmeal sandwich cookie.  Can I just say wow!  Both the sandwich proper and the sandwich cookie were delectable!  The veggies were perfectly cooked - zucchini, red peppers and onions.  They were covered with a lovely melting of cheese.  The sandwich cookie was to die for - much like the one from your childhood, but adult sized and adult taste.  Today, my friend S and I went and were just kind of lukewarm.  I ordered the home made turkey sandwich and he got the chicken salad croissant.  His croissant was much too hard and the salad was more of chicken and mayo.  He opened it to show me and I was surprised there was nothing else in there.  My turkey sandwich had an amazing jam on it - hard to describe, but excellent and the cheese was definitely above par, but the turkey was odd.  I know that it is homemade, but it was too gelatinous for turkey from a place like that.  And the bread was a bit stale which I found hard to believe seeing as how we were the first customers in there.    All in all, I had a fantastic experience and a so-so experience.  I will likely be back in the future with hopes that today was an off day."}
{"text":"We were looking for top-notch coffee in Pittsburgh, and this is my wife and I's favorite coffee, even though it is advertised as a Kitchen.  Excellent Americano's made with coffee from Counter Culture roasters."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food, friendly staff. Downtown lunch favorite. I always get the roast beef sammich"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast. Only tried the biscuits and gravy this time. The biscuit was definitely homemade, very light and fluffy. Sausage gravy had a decent amount of sausage and was not salty like most sausage gravy a can be. I will definitely be checking out more of their menu in the next few months!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and concept. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich. The homemade croissant was good but the chicken salad was a little dissapointing. Too much cashew and it had a different taste to it, maybe they used a mayo substitute? It was alright overall, I would give this restaurant a shot again, just not the chicken salad"}
{"text":"I am SO in love with myself for discovering the Bluebird Kitchen today.   I mean, I have found a shining oasis in the midst of chain restaurant mediocrity.  Well, before I get too self-congratulatory, I should first admit that today when my co-workers and I went to Market Square to get lunch, I declared that I was going to hit Chipotle.  I may be a snob when it comes to restaurants, but I can appreciate a good chain establishment when I see it, and that one makes my short list.  However, when I walked through the door and came to the horrifying realization that the line was, oh, 4 miles long, I walked right back out with a \"Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.\"  Not worth it.  But, now what?  Every place was crazy busy.  Then, as though my feet were being guided by a higher power, I kept walking away from Market Square towards Wood St., and that's when I saw it: a little, unassuming sign saying \"Bluebird Kitchen\".  And then I knew.  This was The One.  I walked inside, and my little hipster heart lept with joy as I beheld the giant chalk menus, retro-ish tile floor, window-seating counters, tureens of soups, bowls of fresh side salads, and plates upon plates of lovingly prepared assorted cookies.  There were only a handful of other patrons inside, but I knew the tidal wave was coming and I had to act fast as more people steadily walked through the door after me.  I made a quick pass down the line to look at all the food and hemmed and hawed over whether to get a Cuban, Turkey, or the monthly vegetarian sandwich for but a moment before deciding not to over-think and ordering the turkey sandwich, a side of the sweet potato salad, and a lemon crinkle cookie.    Turkey sandwich - excellent quality bread, right amount of meat, and toppings made it all very moist Sweet potato salad - Delightful.  Sweet potatoes were soft, and the crunchy almonds and pears set it off nicely Lemon cookie - Perfection.  Soft, pillowy, buttery, sweet but not *too* sweet.  The only thing that took away from this meal was my fault, and it was that between the sandwich bread, the potato salad, and the cookie, it was a very sweet meal.  I should have ordered something salty like a soup or chips instead of the potato salad to balance out the flavor.  But that's okay; now that I know this place exists and I grabbed a menu, I'll be better prepared for next time."}
{"text":"The baked goods are excellent.  I really like the cookies.  The sandwich portions are small for the price and not really all that good.  The food is nice looking, but the taste just wasn't there.  I had the turkey, bacon, avocado.  If you want a fancy sandwich, stick with Thin Man in the strip."}
{"text":"In the movie \"Chef\", Jon Favreau plays Carl Caspar, an executive chef who gets fired after a video of him berating a food critic goes viral.  So he buys a dilapidated lunch truck, renovates it, and starts selling the most amazing Cubanos.  Thanks to social media, his lunch  truck becomes a huge hit.  The movie features so many mouth watering close-ups of  delicious food being made, I almost cried into my $8.00 box of popcorn!  And I've had a hankering for a good Cubano ever since.  And now I've found one, thanks in part to Yelper DJ J. 's sandwich list and review.  I haven't had many Cubanos before, but this was that perfect blend of ham and  pork belly, served on a yummy carba-licous  ciabatta roll.  I know a sandwich is good when I want to slowly savor each bite rather than wolf it down.  And what better way to top off a Cubano than with a nice cup of fair trade coffee?  I think next time I come here I'll try the Pain Bagnat.  Or maybe I'll come for breakfast and try the pastrami cured salmon.  But in the meantime Carl Caspar (Jon Favreau), you and your lunch truck have met your match!"}
{"text":"I have become a Bluebird addict for both breakfast and lunch.  Try the Pastrami-cured Salmon with cucumbers on an everything bagel for breakfast.  The egg sandwiches are to die for as well.  At lunch, their poached tuna nicoise salad with mustard vinaigrette is the perfect mix of healthy/delicious.  Soups vary daily, and I have tried about 10 different ones without disappointment.  They had Borscht one day which was phenomenal.  I keep hoping for its return!"}
{"text":"Very good food, but poor service, wasn't greeted coming in, employees seemed like they were each zoned out, not paying attention to each other, one eating behind the counter, another rubbing her nose, a third cutting apart a cardboard box with a bread knife, I was served by another carrying my food in one hand and a large baking sheet full of cookies in the other. Also very pricey, I don't think I'm coming back despite the food."}
{"text":"At first glance, I thought \"kinda pricey\" but I tried it out anyway. I didn't expect much from the Croque Monsieur sandwich (basically a ham sandwich), but the gooey sauce or cheese was delicious with plenty of ham and crunchy bread which altogether made it more than just a simple ham sandwich. Delicious. I still think the prices are a bit high though."}
{"text":"Really impressed with everything here. The chicken & brown rice soup was delicious. The sandwiches were amazing. The coffee was great too. And the staff was really helpful and kind."}
{"text":"Very good made from scratch food.  Includes the bread and even the cold sandwich items. No deli preserves in anything. Just food fresh ingredients that taste great.  Sandwiches made to order and a good selection of soups and deserts too."}
{"text":"After 3 sub-par experiences I felt obligated to review.  1) Ordered  sweet potato hash. The staff admitted the potatoes had oxidized a bit and didn't  look appealling. They tasted Ok, but were extremely greasy.  2) Went in for coffee. There were at least 5 people in front of me waiting to order. After a few minutes of waiting without one of those people ordering, I walked out. 3) Ordered the parfait. Expected yogurt.  If it was yogurt, it didn't taste like it. It was the consistency of stiff whipped cream and didn't have much flavor. Impossible to stir. I didn't  finish it."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite lunch option downtown. Fantastic sandwiches/salads/side dishes, and their catering is PHENOMENAL.   For people who complain about the price: have you been to au bon pain lately? It's a comparable price, and I'm willing to pay $1 or so more to support a local business (with way better food)."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu is limited and it's more to grab something to go; you won't get bacon and eggs on a plate.  The coffee is good, but the barista said she needed to the manager to make a cortado...?  The lunch sandwiches are great, especially the chicken salad. I love that is comes on a croissant which is worth eating just as a croissant!"}
{"text":"I like it.  Lots of good sounding things on the menu.  I had coffee and almond bread pudding.  Both were good although the coffee was almost boiling, could have been a bit cooler.  My co-workers got espresso that looked pretty damn good and also had fresh squeezed orange juice.  The girls that were working there were very pleasant.  There is not much seating inside but they do have a counter that is facing the outside window.  I love it when cafes do this.  You get to watch everyone walking by outside and with the location of this place (right outside Market Square) you surely get to see a lot of people."}
{"text":"When I want something... I want it then and there....Not at a later date... it doesn't count then....this place is always busy...iv been here twice...for breakfast and lunch...both times was pretty busy and slow... i really don't like how this place closes at three pm...too dame early!   for breakfast... i order their coconut oatmeal without the dried fruits... its a really healthy and hearty breakfast...I can actually see myself eating that every morning!if that doesn't fill you up  their coconut scones is deli-sh as well...not too sweet but still flavorful...their breakfast items changes daily! so ask for their daily specials!   for lunch i order their Cuban sandwich! might be one of the best sandwiches here! pork belly.... throw in some shredded cheddar cheese while their making them...sourdough bread in the toaster..with sweet pickles..topped with special spicy mustard sauce! yummies!   area is limited to seating...service is OK...no outlets or restrooms!"}
{"text":"We ordered Bluebird's breakfast catering for a 100-person small design conference we were planning. I wanted to make sure there was healthy, energizing food, and not just a stack of doughnuts to put everyone to sleep. Bluebird could not have delivered better. The greek yogurt with honey and granola was my favorite, but the pastries and fruit (berries, strawberries, pineapple) blew everyone away. It wasn't your typical fare and was clearly prepared with care. I seriously ate way too much yogurt. Highly recommended for a unique and healthy breakfast catering option."}
{"text":"I returned with two friends for lunch the other day and was yet again wowed with their menu. I got the tofu banh mi, one of my dining partners ordered the roast beef sandwich with lentil side salad, and the third person ordered chicken chorizo quinoa soup and a biscuit. The tofu banh mi was flavorful and had been marinated in a salty brine, was served with pickled veggies on a crusty baguette with some sort of bean tapenade. I would have liked more bold Vietnamese flavors, but the springtime-y pickled veggies were really nice. The roast beef was a major hit, as was the pineapple lentil salad. The chorizo chicken soup was described as bland, but not bad. I've only ever had amazing experiences with soups here, so I believe this must have been a fluke. The pastry course (which I strongly recommend that everyone indulge in at Bluebird) consisted of an almond torte, a lemon tarragon mini-cupcake, earl grey shortbread cookie, and a carrot bundt cake. Each was its own perfect little bite of dessert extravagance, and I found that I was amazed at the skill and restraint of the pastry chef. The carrot bundt cake had a bit of orange zest and salt in the icing, which perfectly complemented the rich earthiness of the moist carrot cake. A favorite amongst all of us was the earl grey shortbread cookie.  As usual, the place impressed and was a fantastic stop for lunch. Sandwiches and salads are nearly always fantastic, and the meal was great with a few reservations."}
{"text":"Food was great walked here from my hotel that was downtown with a co worker and it was Worth the walk! I went in there to get something healthy (quiche) and walked out with some amazing sweets . The women who worked there were super nice but it took a moment to get some service."}
{"text":"Bluebird Kitchen is a decent place to stop and eat at if you are downtown and want to grab something quick and healthy. Everything is pre-made and al la carte. The only downside is their selection is pretty small and since everything is pre-made you can't omit or add anything. Their house made potato chips are some of the best chips I've had.  They do have an awesome selection of desserts.  If you're not already downtown I wouldn't go out of my way to stop here. Parking downtown is too much of a pain."}
{"text":"We came to Pittsburgh for a work meeting, my husband ordered the biscuits and gravy every day for breakfast- he loved them. We wanted a healthier option for breakfast that would keep us full. I ordered the sweet potato hash the first day and the steel cut oats the second day. Both days I had the smoothie with protein added. I couldn't stop talking about the food- it was DELICIOUS. I also got a salad to go for lunch the first day. The blood orange vinaigrette was the best I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Stanwix location and I will say that while the layout was certainly aesthetically pleasing, I was not immediately impressed with my options. However, after trying a few different options, I was very satisfied. I tried their vegetarian option with crushed chickpeas. The  sandwich could have used a sauce or something, it was a little bland. The bread was phenomenal, I don't know if they make it or not but it really made the sandwich. I had their tomato and fennel soup which was unique and so good. I tried a brown rice and asparagus side dish that was also absolutely great. My other side was roasted carrots, farrow or barley and a yoghurt sauce which was surprisingly tasty. Overall, great food and I didn't feel guilty about eating it. Will be back."}
{"text":"I had a mocha and the bluebird granola, greek yogurt, fruit  and honey parfait. They both exceeded my expectations. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would come here again. The only thing that would have made it a better experience for me would be a more comfortable environment, like comfy chairs to sink into. That, however, would likely interfere with busy lunchtime traffic."}
{"text":"With 3 guests in my party, we lined up.  A guy was taking our order when a girl stepped up and spoke over him (confusing on who to talk to?)  so overall I was asked for my order 3 times, by two people.   Although they were nice, it was such a forced nice.   I had the turkey, and it was what I expected.  There was flavor, and it was the perfect size.  I could eat the entire sandwich and not feel overly full or remain hungry."}
{"text":"Best grits I've ever had and being from the south that says a lot. Thick cuts of bacon and cheese in the grits and topped with 2 eggs. My husband had the goat cheese frittata sand which he really enjoyed"}
{"text":"Decent food but way overpriced. Over 9 dollars for just a sandwich is definitely not competitive lunch pricing in Pittsburgh. I am always annoyed by something when I go here so I just need to stop doing that."}
{"text":"Attention \"out of towners\" staying near market square... This is the spot! The menu isn't expansive, but what they have is fantastic!!!  I got the \"Breakfast Sandwich Special\" with bacon on a pretzel roll. It was phenomenal! Excellent ingredients and wonderfully prepared, the sandwich was second only to the wonderful service!    The Bottom Line: Don't skip this one. Grab breakfast here (served until 10:30am) You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back here because the items are attractive, ingenious, and the staff is amazing- it is rare that, especially in a large city, I return to places with inconsistent marks, but damn, that was a fine cake. And it has only been finer.   Since my last visit, I have swooned over Bluebird's delicious Instagram and have eagerly come back for their chocolate peanut butter cake, sage and brown butter nectarine, and nearly French, perfect macarons. I'm still iffy on their savory items, but await tomorrow's breakfast sandwich with gusto. When all is said and done, I think this is an awfully special bakery."}
{"text":"Although they have some good food, I'm not totally sold on it. For my birthday, some friends have ordered me a pistachio cake which was delicious! It was totally unexpected and I really liked it. I would definitely recommend their cake although it's a bit pricey. Other than the cake, I had mixed feelings about their other dishes. For this visit, I got the chicken salad in a croissant. At first, I really liked it as the mix of apples and nuts were so good and made it crunchy. But I was a bit disappointed in the amount of mayo that it had as I don't like too much of it. I also got a side dish which had carrots, veggies and herbs. This was okay as I didn't end up finishing it.  Overall, I think that the food is a bit pricey but they do have some good stuff. In addition, there is limited space for seating during lunch."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Thankfully we were able to beat the lunch rush and get a seat at one of the few stools since I was meeting the hubby for a quick lunch break... Otherwise we wouldn't have anywhere to sit to eat.  That's my only complaint really with the place.  The roasted chicken salad was pretty big, or should I say the chicken was pretty big. It was pretty tasty too.  I was a fan of the watermelon and cucumber salad side they had as well (so much that I had to try to replicate it).   This is a solid to go lunch option (and breakfast) downtown.  The staff was pretty nice too."}
{"text":"I had the fried egg sandwich for breakfast today. Wow! It has two fried eggs, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and it's on a pretzel bun. There was great flavor all around. The pretzel bun added some nice saltiness. They also have great baked goods and yesterday's baked goods are half off which is pretty nice. Overall, a great spot just off the square for a healthy breakfast."}
{"text":"I dream about their biscuits and gravy. So good! Their cinnamon buns are also amazing. I've only ever ordered takeout from here and it tastes just as good as I would imagine it would if you had eaten in the restaurant.  My only complaint is that they aren't open on the weekends!!"}
{"text":"My overall experience at Bluebird Kitchen was very much less than satisfactory. I am from out of town and was recommended this place by a coworker. I was with a group of five and received my order at least ten minutes after the last person in my group. I asked a worker if there was an issue and was given a snippy response in return. I ordered the roast beef sandwich, which had an underwhelming amount of every ingredient on it... roast beef, aoli, onions.   Overall, would not recommend. I could've gotten Dibellas or any of the other nearby sandwich places for more food and better service."}
{"text":"Solid spot for an on-the-go lunch. Everything is made fresh and on site. Would have given more stars if they replenished the soup that we wanted, and had room to dine in."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at BbK. I went there on my lunch break and there was a short line. I'd say in and out took me about 20 minutes to order, pay, and get my lunch. Not bad at all because everything is made fresh and the service is great.   I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which might be the best I've ever had. It had apples, chick peas, and I'm pretty sure some cumin with fresh chicken and a light mayo dressing, all on a croissant. I also got a side of chips which definitely taste fresh and homemade.   I grabbed an oatmeal cookie with chocolate buttercream icing for later, but I'm just going to go ahead and assume that it is also delicious. The prices are reasonable, too.   Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Highly over rated. The fried egg sandwich was okay at best. The pretzel bun was flavorless and the combo of egg with lettuce and tomato did not work well together."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim for breakfast and it was amazing! Fried Eggs sandwich with cheese on pretzel bread was phenomenal! Coffee is decently strong too. It was so good I went back the very next day with a friend and had the salmon and cucumber sandwich.   If you have a little extra time in your morning visit your local downtown pittsburgh coffee shop its worth the adventure! My only quip is that it probably took around 10 minutes for them to make my sandwich when nobody was in the shop. Kind of dissapointing considering they have like 3 or 4 people in the kitchen and all i wanted was eggs.   I will be returning soon to try their lunch menu. Im sure I wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"nice place to kill some time. only seating available is two bar type counters that run along the walls. about twelve stools total. have ordered something different each time visiting and it's always delicious. iced coffee is good. GREAT place to people watch. customer service could be better and it's always kind of dirty- crumbs on the countertops and the floor is always littered with little bits of trash or food crumbs. overall they deserve a B-"}
{"text":"The food is typically great.  The service today was terrible.  I waited over 15 minutes for a simple off the menu sandwich while the shop was essentially empty.  After multiple inquiries, I finally left without lunch as no time remained.  The staff were doing anything but waiting on customers.  This was a favorite lunch spot but I won't be back ."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Bluebird's food, however, don't anticipate a large portion. If you're leaving feeling stuffed than your wallet will be feeling slim.   At times their kitchen can get easily backed up. I would suggest if you have a limited time for lunch that you may want to skip visiting Bluebird. If you can order ahead or if they offer delivery you may want to consider that route.   If it is winter time when you visit, you may want to be keep your coat on. The frequent opening of the door tends to keep the entire place on the colder side. Opening doors though are a great sign of a business doing well though so this is hardly a criticism of the establishment."}
{"text":"Fun place to do a light breakfast. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who doesn't want a grease belly all day. The hash I had was inventive although just a squeak dry. Not a lot of room to eat inside so on a good day eat outside on market square."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich and orange juice. Both were very good. A little on the expensive side but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Stayed in Pittsburgh for 3 days. Had breakfast here all 3 mornings. Gorgeous oatmeal. Beautiful granola with fruit and great European style coffees. Highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast before a conference, I was excited to try some local breakfast places. I think the highlight of my breakfast was the freshly squeezed orange juice: it was very sweet, natural, and definitely the champion of the day.   I ordered the local fresh eggs on ciabatta with the house made sausage.  I would have given a four if the bread had been toasted,  but it wasnt. The sausage had good flavor, but I would have liked a little salt on my eggs. All in all a good breakfast. If I am back in town I would try the pastries, they looked and smelled amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch selections! Cute little bistro with great salads, sandwiches, and different sides every time. No way you can walk in there without getting a sweet treat. The thanksgiving lunch special was the best surprise! You will not be disappointed. Smaller place so seating is limited."}
{"text":"Bluebird is indeed, as good as it gets for lunchtime fare in downtown Pittsburgh. I'm sure it is for breakfast as well; I just haven't made it in that early yet! I adore this restaurant - both locations on Forbes and on Stanwix. Everything I have ever tried has been wonderful! Everything is fresh; lots of local sourcing, imaginative menu items and salads every single day. The sweets are dangerously awesome. I won't go on, but if you're looking for some fabulous, healthy and creative soups, salads and sandwiches, plus a hot entree option daily, Bluebird is your place."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, had the Cuban and a cookie sandwich for dessert (sugar cookie with mango frosting). This place is delicious. The food was incredible, fresh ingredients. Bread was crusty and clearly baked same day. Not sure if it's expensive for Pittsburgh, but I found the price comparable to places in NYC. Would definitely come back...want to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"came here for breakfast by recommendation of the night manager of the Omni William-Penn hotel.   quaint space with high ceilings, bright feel and light seating.   menu was small, but with good selections. the steel cut oats were warming and home-y with the twist of a coconut milk base. when the girl was serving it to me though, a dollop of oats landed on her finger and she scraped it back into the oats container - grossed me out a little.   hubby ordered the egg sandwich. overall, a fine sandwich with the highlight being the bread.   as we leave the best we can say is \"it's okay\". average breakfast menu that you can get anywhere."}
{"text":"What a gem of downtown!  This places serves the best sides in town. I regularly go to bluebird to get a side of quinoa or panzanella to accompany my sandwich. Also the chocolate pistachio cookie is rich and delicious!  Don't forget dessert when you go here!"}
{"text":"Woohoo - Breakfast redemption!  So my less than stellar reviews in the past had to do with my lunch experiences at Bluebird but this morning I went there for a breakfast sandwich and was not let down.    I had the fried egg sandwich on a pretzel roll with sausage.  It was hearty and delicious which is exactly what I needed.  It was freshly made as you can tell with the eggs - the eggs weren't industrially processed to look like a white and yellow cookie.  No, these were real eggs cracked open on a skillet and put into a sandwich.  There were tomato slices and greens.  I think the pretzel roll was a good option as the salt on the bun offered a little something to the unseasoned eggs.  The sausage was a nice complement as well to the sandwich.  They had some amazing looking pastries but I resisted.    I guess I know when I'll be heading over to Bluebird - the early morning when the birds are chirping!    I appreciate the owner reaching out to acknowledge my less than stellar reviews.  I'm glad that I got to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Bluebird Kitchen for breakfast is like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.. Its just meant to be. Its one of the [few] perks of having to be at work at 5am. $6 for a single sandwich is a little pricey, I'll admit, but when you're indulging on what may be the most amazingly delicious part of your day, you forget all about that 6 bucks. I haven't been quite as impressed with lunch at bluebird (ergo the 4 stars instead of 5), but that's neither here nor there- let's get back to breakfast. If you happen to be downtown during breakfast, do yourself a favor and have some bluebird for breakfast, you will not be left disappointed."}
{"text":"The boy and I also frequent this place for lunch. We've been going here since it opened and I must say, I'm impressed. I really loved their May Veggie Sandwich (not their July, but the boy really did). I love how they change their menu every month. What a great idea! And from what I understand they use local produce! Plus two for them!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We stopped for breakfast this morning and I was very impressed.  The decor is very classy; it almost feels you stepped into a NY deli or something.  Wood counters, huge thick cutting boards displaying baked goods, jazz playing, and artfully written chalkboard menus on the wall.  The coffee is good, and the breakfast sandwiches are better.  I had local fried egg + cheddar on a pretzel roll, which to my delight was HUGE and came with fresh lettuce and tomato.  For $4?!?!  Take that, Egg McMuffin.  The husband had pastrami cured salmon and cucumber on an everything bagel.  He said it was awesome.  We will definitely make more breakfast stops here, but I'm also looking forward to trying lunch.  Everything on the menu looked so delicious, plus they had pumpkin pecan bread pudding...couldn't bring myself to order it for breakfast, but I'm going to have to try it someday soon!"}
{"text":"Spending a lot of time in Pittsburgh and had become convinced that lunch was going to be protein bars only. Until we found Bluebird. Great soups, fresh salads, a lot of vegetarian options that aren't available anywhere else in town. Plus the service is awesome and the staff is just adorable. Pretty much my only choice in downtown now."}
{"text":"Great food but on the pricy side. Not a chain so that is a plus. Best takeaway food in market square. Recommended if u are looking for more upscale lunch to go."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. I Arrived at 10:40 am and was told it is between lunch and breakfast therefore only the pastries and drinks are available. Breakfast service had just stopped and lunch would start at 11. Oh well, I said and ordered a cappucino. It's the sloppiest cappuccino I've ever been served. Maybe they're just new? I asked them how long they'd been open-- 3 years. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the amazing ratings that Bluebird Kitchen has on Yelp and just had to try the restaurant when I started working downtown!  The restaurant is extremely busy during the weekday lunchtime hour. During the two times that I've been, the line is at least 15-20 people long. I recommend planning to get takeout since seating is very limited.  I have tried the Chicken Salad sandwich, House Roast Turkey sandwich, Chocolate cookie \"sandwich\" filled with a Pistachio cream, and a Chocolate Strawberry cupcake. The Chicken Salad sandwich was good but a little too heavy, and I ended up throwing half of it away. I wasn't expecting much from a basic turkey sandwich, but the House Roast Turkey was amazing! I will definitely be ordering that sandwich again sometime soon. The desserts were disappointing, especially for the high price ($3.50 for the cupcake). Though I liked the concept of the two, both the chocolate cookies and cupcake were very dense, while the icing on the cupcake was too rich and tasted like butter. I will not be trying their cookies or cupcakes again.  Of the four things I've tried, I would only re-purchase one of them. Based on this, I can only give the restaurant 3 stars. However, I definitely plan on trying Bluebird again and will re-review if I have a better experience in the future!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this little place while looking for a quick place for breakfast on our way out of town.  Unexpectedly, they make the best cheesy grits I've had in the north! Seems like a busy local favorite."}
{"text":"I have gone here once before but did not feel particularly motivated to review it. I had the croque monsieur and it was tasty but I think I may have built the Bluebird Kitchen up in my mind that the sandwich just could not live up to the level I wanted it to be at.   However today I went with one of my coworkers back to the Bluebird Kitchen and it I don't think either one of us could wait to review the sandwiches we had. I chose the Cuban sandwich because it is pretty much impossible for me to not eat one when it is an option. This Cuban sandwich was everything a lunch fantasy could be. Packed in between a buttery ciabatta roll, was layers of rosemary ham, pork belly, Swiss cheese, pickles and whole grain mustard. I eat quite a few Cuban sandwiches and this one has surpassed a good majority of any of the ones I have had in the past.   They also have delicious looking cakes and cookies. But I was too overwhelmed by the amount of pig I had committed to eating that I didn't think it was wise to add a macaron the size of my head on top of it. There are also daily specials which include a lot fresh soups and salad."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic breakfast sandwiches and coffee.  I was there waiting for them to open at 7am while watching (and drooling over) all the fresh baked goods stream out of the kitchen.  I went with a egg and cheese sandwich on the pretzel roll after talking myself out of multiple delicious looking sweets (breakfast bread pudding!?).  The bread was soft, airy, and salty.  The egg was perfectly cooked and loaded with good cheese.  Top this off with a spot on brewed cup of coffee with beans from my favorite roaster from NC (Counter Culture) and I was set.  Wish I was in town long enough to grab another breakfast or try the lunch.  Next time Bluebird."}
{"text":"Very nice addition to the Market Square area. I went for lunch and enjoyed the simplicity of the menu (soups, salads, sandwiches), but the complexity and thought that went into the individual items.  I had the smoked turkey sandwich, and unlike the majority of smoked turkey sandwiches, it really tasted smoked. Very delightful. I didn't have any desserts, but one of the people I went with had a fudge brownie and said it was delightful. All the baked goods looked succulent.   The staff was extremely friendly, overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"A coworker and I walked a few blocks to the Bluebird Kitchen since we had heard that this was the bee's knees.    It was lunch time and not too crowded yet so we ordered, paid and waited for about 10 minutes for our cubans.  We both thought that the $9 for the sandwich ($11+ with a side) was a little pricey for the small 5-6\" sandwich.    We walked back to the office to eat and we both agreed that the bread was VERY  TOUGH!!! and we both felt like we needed dental work afterwards.  We agreed that for the price, the bread could have been softer and there should have been more ingredients.  The 2 local sub shops put in more ingredients than what was in these sandwiches for much less.     Service with a smile:  5 stars Cuban sandwich:  2 stars"}
{"text":"Today went here on a whim for lunch. The atmosphere is relaxed and modern. The staff is really friendly. I had the chicken and quoina soup, which I recommend their soup all fresh and homemade. Get their bread that they make. I also had the tuna sandwich. This place really love to add olives in their dishes. It was a little pricy but well worth it for the quality."}
{"text":"Seriously, how am I supposed to get lunch anywhere else now?  I just started working downtown and after finding The Bluebird Kitchen I don't think anywhere else will compare.    First time I went (yesterday) I ordered the Croque Monsieur, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it was an out of body experience.  The brioche bread was amazing, then add the ham and gruyere, and you have an unreal sandwich.    Today when I went back I ordered the Cuban, and again was thrilled.  I topped it off with a chocolate chip cookie which was delicious as well.    The only draw back is their lack of seating, but I'll happily take my lunch anywhere I can if it tastes like this.    If you are downtown for lunch, don't go anywhere else, I don't think I'll be able to...ever."}
{"text":"(Stanwix) Have you ever been to a place where the staff act as if its your pleasure to simply walk in??? Well welcome to bluebird! Beyond the nice/nasty lukewarm staff the food was soaked in grease....disgusting.  Neither of the staff at the front counter could be bothered with waiting on me as they were holding a conversation much more important than working.  After I finally was given the privilege to order they both went back to the kitchen to see if what I wanted right off of the menu could be made!!?   There was no one else in the restaurant and now I see why.   I get the whole hipster restaurant gimmick but the half a** service I can do with out."}
{"text":"They have a really good chicken salad sandwich! My only gripe is there's not a lot of seating inside when it's cold out- there's plenty of outdoor seating in market square when it's warm though! Wish it was open on the weekends."}
{"text":"I ordered a double espresso, as usual, and this time I received a single shot of espresso. I asked one of the workers about it, and she was very rude about it and refused to add another shot! I paid full price. The coffee was good, but I will NOT be returning for the rude service."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in for lunch after following Bluebird Kitchen on Instagram for while lusting after their unique baked goods.   I came in around 11am to beat the rush (a line had formed by noon) and was greeted with very friendly service. Having not been there before, I didn't realize you placed your order at the beginning of the counter, and then made your way down to the register. I ordered at the register unknowingly  and they kindly took my order there instead.   I had a Cuban, which was warm and toasty and delicious. The pickles and mustard added the perfect tangy flavor to the sandwich. My only complaint is that the piece pork belly on my sandwich was a little fatty, but this was not a problem as I picked it off and ate the good parts as the sandwich was still loaded with ham. Overall, it was a very satisfying lunch.   I ended up going back up after my sandwich to order an oatmeal sandwich cookie- which was huge and delicious- the filling wasn't too sweet.   This place is a little on the pricier side, but completely worth it in my opinion for the noticeably quality ingredients, attentive service, and fresh bright atmosphere that makes for a relaxing lunch break. I will definitely be stopping in again to try the delicious sounding soups and more baked goods!"}
{"text":"To all my GF friends out there, this is for you:  I stop into Bluebird once or twice a month. My go-to is usually their pre-made salad with tuna, oven dried tomato, tomato, haricot vert, hard boiled egg, olives, avocado, and mustard vinaigrette. Delicious, filling and worth the $9. I have tried select GF options from their fresh food bar but unfortunately, their portion sizes for the price are VERY poor. However, I can't knock down their rating to 3 stars for that. They make up for it with their GF dessert options. The peanut butter bacon cookie= HOLY DELICIOUS! Sometimes, they offer it as a cookie sandwich with a sweet cream filling. I treat myself to this mouth watering creation a few times a year. If I could get away with it, I'd have one everyday! There are other GF desserts and from what I've tried, they are worth every penny.  Now that I've read the reviews of their lattes, I will have to pair one with my favorite cookie next time I treat myself!"}
{"text":"Grab-and-go cafe with something for everyone. The sandwich menu offers hearty classics-with-a-twist, such as turkey with jam. The sides are great for people who like unconventional food, and the desserts range from peach hand press to bread pudding. One of my favorite places for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"I work downtown at a local Hotel, and was dragged here one day by a fellow staff member.  I'd just like to say, that if I had the money; i'd be going here every week! Whenever I have cash in my wallet, and am craving a delicious homemade sandwich, I go here on my lunch break!  My favorite would most certainly by the amazing Chicken Salad Sandwich. Filled with chicken, mayo, granny smith green apples, cumin, and cashews on a huge croisant roll, it will fill your stomach to the point of bursting.  More often than not, I have to wrap up the other half and take it home!  The delicious bakery portion of the small cafe always smells delicious (however, I'm a picky eater, and haven't found something I'd like to try).  The only complaint is that the wait times are a bit too long (especially if you want lunch; but come 10 minutes before 11am, which is when they start serving it). However, the above was solved by asking if their was a solution; they told me to call to place a to go order about 5-10 minutes before leaving work and it'll be ready by the time I get there)! How great is that customer service?!  All in all- I hope they NEVER take the Chicken Salad Sandwich off the menu. If so, I'm sure I'll find something just as delicious when I go back week after week!"}
{"text":"Yet another welcome addition to the the Market Square dining scene!  Bluebird Kitchen does things a little differently than some of the other new places in the Square...it offers breakfast for one.  And the breakfast offerings sound quite nice...but I can't imagine ever having time to swoop down the street in the morning from Grant Street.  That means you lucky folks in the lower area of downtown won't have to fight off we intruders from the the upper area!  I'm envious.  Lunch, however, is another thing.  I'll be back frequently for the fresh salads and other items on the menu!  Lured by the prospect of \"crispy\" porkbelly, I ordered the May's salad.  Besides the aforesaid porkbelly, it consisted of arugula and endive, slivers and flecks of smooth gouda, roasted thyme onions and slivered pear with a mustard vinaigrette I could have eaten with a spoon it was that good!  The porkbelly - and I'm a big porkbelly fan, mind you - left a lot to be desired.  Not crispy at all, it was a generous portion of what appeared to be raw thick-sliced bacon.  I know it wasn't raw....it just looked that way.  It was chewy and had strings of inedible rind.  That went on the side and remained uneaten.  Ugh.  But the salad itself was wonderful.  Next time I'll get ANYTHING other than the porkbelly.  The service is friendly, efficient and QUICK!  You're in and out - even with a line in front of you - faster than you imagined possible.  Don't expect to eat in comfortably...take your prizes outside to the tables in the Square and enjoy some al fresco dining...or take it back to the office.  Side note:  a colleague of mine ordered the porkbelly sandwich and found the same problem with the porkbelly.  Some work is needed on a better preparation of that particular product."}
{"text":"Ordered: Bluebird granola, House roast beef, and macchiato. Everything was delicious, a bit expensive for the granola ($6) but everything did taste great.  House Roast Beef was nice and crunchy on the outside."}
{"text":"I went here twice in two days. The first for lunch, where I had the salad with tuna, hard boiled egg, oven dried tomatoes, and haricot verts and a GF peanut butter bacon cookie. The cookie was so amazing! I was dubious at first of the flavour but was really surprised at how much I liked it! If you're looking for a quick salad, this is a good option because they are pre-made with your choice of dressing on the side. The next day I came back for breakfast with a friend. Although the experience was fine, I was a little bit irked with the service. First, we wanted to share the \"frittata\" and a smoothie. It is unclear on the menu that it's actually a frittata sandwich served on a roll. Being gluten free, my friend asked for a substitute for the bread -- anything without wheat. The girl helping us said we could get the granola/yoghurt INSTEAD of the bread, but when we went to check out she charged us for the whole parfait. If I hear \"instead of\" without a follow up of a price change, I assume it's for free and don't want to be charged for it. We ended up having just the frittata without bread which was fine. The other problem was that I asked for almond milk for my coffee and the girl said they didn't have any almond milk but could give me soy milk. But we had ordered the \"April smoothie\" which had almond milk in it and when I asked about that she said, \"oh right, I was going to make it with soy milk.\" We ended up not having a problem with the soy milk, but I think it's dangerous to not mention it because it is possible we had a soy allergy and specifically ordered the smoothie because of the almond milk! We didn't mind the soy milk in the smoothie at all, but I think it is something they should have mentioned to us before making it. I wanted to get another peanut butter bacon cookie, but they said they don't sell them at breakfast which is a huge bummer! I hope I can come back and have it again another time soon."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place for lunch after reading the reviews but was underwhelmed with what I ordered. The sweet potato soup was not hearty at all - the broth was basically water with a sweet potato flavor. The turkey sandwich was just OK. I don't think the flavor combination worked. I didn't finish either one."}
{"text":"Tuna Nicoise salad was really delicious - fresh, great house-made sun-dried tomatoes, and a killer mustard vinaigrette. Didn't get to try a vegan chocolate chip cookie, but I will definitely try a pastry or cookie the next time! Very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"One of the neatest, most eccentric lunch spots in downtown Pittsburgh goes to Bluebird Kitchen. With a solid lineup of sandwiches, and a fantastic array of daily sides to choose from, this restaurant strikes that perfect balance between a cool, light lunch on a humid summer day, to a warm and filling meal in the middle of winter.  To start off, the sandwiches are killer. From the somewhat healthy turkey to the not-at-all healthy cuban, each sandwich has its own personality, with its own bread, its own sauce, and of course, its own meat. Pair that with a side of brussels sprouts, wheatberry, quinoa, or farro, and you've got yourself a very satisfying meal.  But above all of that, I'm in love with the potato chips. Now, I don't know what they add to those potato chips, but I would not be surprised if there were cocaine, because these chips are addicting. So, on top of your sandwich, your healthy side, make sure to add some crack chips to balance out all that flavor.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The only downside to Bluebird Kitchen is that it isn't closer to my office. For this reason, I've only been able to try their breakfast foods (lunch isn't served until 11) but I've been impressed with everything I've had.   Their breakfast sandwiches are hearty but not too heavy, and the pastries are light and satisfying. I love the flavor combinations: orange and pistachio, blueberry and almond, coconut and cashew, classic mixed berry... and to top it all off, the prices are comparable/lower than chains or other cafés like this one.   Everything is made in-house, so even if you go for the day-old half-price pastries, it's still fresher than just about anything else you can find in the area. Plus the counter staff are friendly without being onobnoxious or annoying. Bluebird Kitchen is definitely the type of restaurant Pittsburgh needs more of."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant around 9:30 in the morning.   There was a line 4 people deep at the cash register and 4 people deep where you order your food. There was only one young lady trying to take care of all of these people. There were other workers in the kitchen but no one came out to help.  When it was finally my turn to order I ordered a Frittata. It came on a ciabatta bun with lettuce and tomato. The frittata had goat cheese, potatoes and sausage. After I ordered I moved over to the cash register line. It took awhile to get the frittata and they forgot that I had also ordered a mocha (coffee). So then I had to wait for them to make that.  I took my food and coffee to go and went to enjoy the nice day while sitting at a table at Market Square. The mocha was very good and very strong.  The ciabatta bun was fresh as for the actual frittata there was only one or two small pieces of sausage. There were a lot of potatoes. It seemed more like a potato sandwich.  For a breakfast that cost $12 I expected better service and better food. I brought home a menu to see if anything caught my eye enough to make me want to go back and try lunch."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I was in town for work and was not interested in a $40 breakfast at the Fairmont, so I explored and found the Bluebird Kitchen two blocks over. By the end of the trip, I had eaten here four times, twice for breakfast and twice for lunch.  I still remember that first breakfast. Studying yelp, I found this spot and saw a review for a fried egg sandwich, and considering I was pretty much drooling, I threw on my jacket and headed that way. Wanting to size up the review, I ordered without hesitation the egg sandwich, which came on a fresh ciabatta roll topped with lettuce and tomato. I added a piece of local pork sausage for a few bucks. The taste was ridiculous. Freshly baked bread; hot sausage; hot egg; cool and crisp lettuce and tomato. The presentation was just as good. I'm standing there on a cold morning, and it is drizzling outside, and I am handed this piece of waxed paper, which contains a $6 breakfast sandwich that is better than pretty much egg sandwich I've ever eaten.  Lunches are equally as delicious. I had a quinoa wrap and some wheat salad on one day. I had a roasted turkey sandwich on another. Everything I ate here was delicious. The coffee was strong and flavorful. The price was what you would expect for food of this quality.  There is a small counter for eating in, but that's it. Most people grab food to go. I hope I am in Pittsburgh again soon to eat here again.  Five stars."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh. Super friendly staff and nice ambiance.  Wife and I got to their restaurant close to 10:30 AM, but their breakfast was already over and were switching to lunch. So we just got their oatmeal. Really wished we got there just a bit earlier because if their oatmeal represented their breakfast menu, it must have been amazing!  Not much sitting area though - it's definitely one of those places where you go in, eat real quick and leave. Only stools lining the wall. Lunch looks good too, but didn't go."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy lunch spot in the city. The location on Forbes near Market Square is more of a grab and go. They have tons of premade salads ready to take (made daily). Fresh soups, various sandwiches on fresh breads and baguettes, and premade sides like broccoli quinoa salad or a roasted potato salad. Each mouth they feature a special sandwich and salad as well. All the options are quite healthy and everything is so fresh. Very vegan and vegetarian friendly too. Do not leave without a sweet treat--their vegan chocolate chip cookie is to die for. Friendly staff, prices are kind of high, though. The second location on Stanwix is much bigger inside with tables, however they offer a much smaller menu than the original Forbes location."}
{"text":"It can be a little tight around lunch time but wow totally worth it amazing bread, sandwiches are out of this world. Delicious desserts and great soup made this one of my new favorite places downtown"}
{"text":"In town for a conference all week: ate the \"2 local eggs on ciabatta\" 5 days in a row very very happily.  Several days I added the sausage to the sandwich: the sausage was hearty and flavorful: tasted like real meat, not grease.  The breakfast sandwich also had a few slices of tomato and lettuce which were great.  Also had an iced Americano a couple days and their iced coffee a few times.  This was quite passable, notably better than the chain around the corner. Happy to find this quality breakfast in the skyscraper part of town."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast/lunch spot in Pittsburgh. You can't go wrong here. Everything's fresh and delicious as well as affordable. Plenty of workspace with outlets and room to do work if needed. Also great for takeout. Cinnamon rolls with bacon are the best!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot.  The sandwiches are awesome and worth the price.  The sides are always a fresh, healthy option.  I usually get two small sides, which is more than enough to fill you up, and it's about $5.   The owner, Liz, is always so pleasant and happy to see regulars.  The entire staff is so friendly and helpful.  If you're not sure about any of the menu options they are always ready to explain and even offer suggestions. The soups are absolutely delicious.  The coffee and beverage selection is unique and equally as tasty as the food options.   The pastries are on another level.  I always have such a hard time walking past them on the way to the register without picking up one.   DEFINITELY try Bluebird and I'm positive you'll become a regular, too! I wish there was a 6 star option, because they totally deserve it.  I'm so grateful there's a lunch option like this in Market Square!"}
{"text":"TLDR; great food. Bluebird Kitchen is really a takeout place, not a cafe.  Tried this place for a quick lunch with my spouse. The food was good as many other reviewers stated. Good variety of tasty artisanal bread, fresh ingredients, and nice, clever takes on the basic sandwiches. She ordered the Turkey, I the Roast Beef. We also got their in-the-restaurant made chips, which were great.   I rated it a little on the low side for me, as the food was slightly on the pricey side for what we got ($30 lunch for 2 for sandwiches, no refills on iced tea). And, we went expecting to eat in. However, it is definitely \"Bluebird Kitchen\" not \"Bluebird Dining Room\". I mean to say that the accommodations for dining in are not good at all, unless you want to sit alone and watch people walk by at the windows. There are three bar tables along the walls of the place, with backless steel 30\" (think low bar) stools for seating. I imagine that most people will be getting food to go and eat at the tables on Market Square, but the weather was too cold for us."}
{"text":"***UPDATE*** After my last review, I got a message from Liz M., the owner of the Blue Bird, stating, \"I hope you will give us a second chance to fill you up. I think a sandwich  just might do the trick...\".  I feel that if an owner of a business bothers to reach out to me after a review, I owe it to that person to follow up. So today I stopped into the Blue Bird for lunch and ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Although it was pretty busy, the staff was very cheerful and courtious and I moved through the line rather quickly.  But after paying for my order, I waited for about 15 minutes to get my Cuban, which, in my opinion is a little longer than average for lunch. But like I said, it was busy and there were pleanty of orders to be filled before mine.  There's very limited seating at the Blue Bird so I took my sandwich back to my office which is only about a five minute walk. The sandwich held up well and was still warm when I unwrapped it. Paying $9.10 (tax included here) for a sandwich isn't what I'd call being thrifty but after one bite I could tell that this sandwich was worth every penny! The ciabatta was firm but not too hard. The pork belly and ham blended well with the pickle and mustard. The serving size was just perfect for a hearty appetite (I skipped dinner last night and only had a cup of coffee for breakfast today).  I'm upping the rating to four stars for a delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try their food for awhile ever since I saw someone mention this place in the Pittsburgh Gazette. I finally had the chance one Friday afternoon after I getting espresso grounds from Nicholas's Coffee Company. I unfortunately had already ate but was slightly hungry so I ordered one of their side dishes (which change daily). Their quinoa salad was the perfect protein packed snack consisting of arugula, gouda, and apples. I enjoyed the refreshness of this side dish and would definitely come back on an empty stomach to try their entrees!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to add that the customer service is so far above average here.  It so nice to be treated like a human being who matters by the people who you give your money to, which is something that's seriously lacking in many other eateries downtown.  The addition of the cordons and stools puts the finishing touches on this already amazing place.  And don't miss the baked goods.  Liz better hang on to that pastry chef; I see great things in her future!"}
{"text":"The BF and I were looking for a simple brunch/early lunch after flying in from Chicago. The four star rating I saw made me pick Bluebird Kitchen but we're leaving disappointed. The price of the food does not match the quality. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, which was handed to me from a cooler in the back, and my boyfriend ordered the August salad, which he was told to pick from the cooler in front. I understand being prepared for the lunch rush, but why even call yourself a kitchen if you're simply handing out prepackaged food like 7-11? My chicken salad was entirely too salty, and my boyfriend's salad had bitter lettuce. Disappointing. And the customer service is likewise disappointing, as other Yelpers have mentioned. No one walks you through the menu, or explains why they serve some foods prepackaged or some foods hot.  TL;DR not coming back and not recommending it."}
{"text":"I don't know if anyone has been to the new Market Square restaurant named Bluebird Kitchen, but it is a lovely addition to Market Square.  Previously, if you wanted something other than a donut, bagel or Egg McMuffin, you were pretty hard pressed to find something else.  However, with the opening of the Bluebird Kitchen you will be able to find much more than those breakfast staples.     Recently, I had the opportunity to indulge my southern hankerings for an old fashioned breakfast of grits and eggs.  Boy oh boy, were they delicious!  The stone ground grits were creamy and had flecks of cheddar cheese mixed into the grits along with little nuggets of bacon.  Topped by sunny-side up eggs, this was a breakfast took me back to Columbia, SC where my mother was born.  On another visit, the pastrami cured salmon on a toasted bagel made me believe that beef pastrami may be eliminated as my favorite type of pastrami.  With the addition of cucumber and oven dried tomato, this let me know that this restaurant gets all of the little details right.  You also want to try this restaurant for lunch where the house roast turkey sandwich with bacon jam, that's right bacon jam, is smack your mama good!"}
{"text":"Semi- regular patron, I only go there for the biscuits and gravy. My problem is with consistency. Good biscuits but the gravy is hit or miss. I don't think they use a recipe everyday.  Presentation is sometimes in a big box with lots of gravy or in a little box with barely any gravy. (Always 2 biscuits) depending on who is working the amount of gravy varies as well the quality.   I have had the best and the worst biscuits and gravy here but I am always paying $7.49 for a dish comprised primarily of flour and butter. Which isn't worth it most of the time... but when it's good it's damn good.  This has been my experience the past couple years,  good enough (sometimes) to go back but the price and inconsistency are the reason for 2 stars."}
{"text":"Put it this way: I haven't written a Yelp review since 2008. I forgot I was even a member until I tried to join today solely to write about this place.  I've had my eye on Bluebird for a couple months, and thank goodness I finally found an afternoon without a single reason to walk by. There was actually a line spilling onto the sidewalk, but not being in a rush, I was intrigued by the wait rather than discouraged. I'm so glad this place is living up to its hype.  Bluebird Kitchen belongs in New York. No wait, San Francisco. The point is this place totally elevates breakfast & lunch. Its focus on fresh & local, coupled with its relaxed & rustic yet somehow also sophisticated atmosphere & presentation is unexpected in downtown Pittsburgh. It's high time the East End shared some of the foodie wealth! It's refreshing. The prices are fair ($4-$5 breakfast items, $6-$8 sandwiches, $7-9 salads) The staff is adorable & friendly, too.  All I ordered on my first visit was a white bean, sausage & broccoli soup. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was broth-based, rather than a thick, roux base I anticipated with \"bean\" in the title. I felt like I was at my mom's kitchen table eating this soup, that's how fresh it tasted. I love soup but tend to shy away from eating it in restaurants because it's usually loaded with sodium. This tasted good for me: light yet hearty.   Check out Bluebird, if only for a dessert. I didn't have one but I loved how each cookie looked unique; no pre-mixes here! Enjoy, folks."}
{"text":"On one side of Forbes Avenue sits Cherries Diner, epitomizing tradition. On another sits Bluebird Kitchen, blinding eyes and palates with sharp, futuristic decor, and a forward-looking menu. Yet, both are comfortable and appealing to me in every way and in their own way. Will Old Pittsburgh be alienated by the shiny novelty of Bluebird Kitchen? Will Young Pittsburgh embrace Bluebird Kitchen and reject Cherries as a relic? Can they coexist? I truly hope so.   The other morning, a change in my schedule presented me with no other breakfast mission than to try Bluebird Kitchen.   Being a blue-collar man in the morning, I was hollow in the belly. My innards were disturbed and gnarling.   My first meal consisted of Sweet Potato Corned Beef Hash (a small order), Pastrami Cured Salmon, Black and White Trifle, and freshly-squeezed orange juice.   The hash was unorthodox, resembling dirty pasta in a cardboard Chinese takeout container. This was not a heavy, thick, oily hash one gets from a can nor was it crisped via a flat top grill. Not that I don't enjoy those manners of corned beef hash as well, but this put my culinary mind in a trick. Instead of cubes drowning in a muddy sea of red meat, the potatoes were stringy, again, like spaghetti, and bits of corned beef and bacon merely acted as flavorings with those potato tendrils being the central component. Was an Asian influence at work here? I don't know, but I do know that sugar, salt, and starch butted heads within that box and created a very enthralling side dish that was almost grotesque to behold yet possessive of gorgeous flavor and an odd but welcome al dente/brittle texture.   And if I didn't think that breakfast could get more complex, there was THAT sandwich...  I'd been craving salmon and cream cheese in some configuration for a little while now and BK's (not he, the Burger King who should be killed) satisfied that yen tenfold. The \"house cured\" salmon tasted like a wonderfully warmed-through, smooth, soft, silky sashimi that was only rounded-out by the inclusion of the mild, white velvet of the cream cheese spread. Cucumber brought the crunch factor, oven-dried tomato acted as the natural sugars, and with a pretzelesque bagel came the chew and the brine. A cool (literally as well as figuratively), calculated, supraintelligent breakfast sandwich, PCS owns the sunrise much like the hash did; with subtle tastes and punctuating mouthfeel.   I came close to ordering the Breakfast Bread Pudding, but when I saw that cup with the decadent to behold ebony/ivory filling and was told what as in it, my plans were diverted.   I get the feeling that some stale brownies needed to be used up (BK was selling ones of the mint variety), and if that was the case, then there was no more brilliant way than to break them up into bricks, suffocate them with a luxuriously corrupt funereal white buttercream, and rain chocolate syrup death onto this grave for the day-old and baked. My pupils disappeared as I scooped each spoonful into my jaws as evidenced by the morbidly curious stares I received from passersby while seated near a window. Too debauched to be had on such a radiant cockcrow, morning soon fell to mourning...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMg80LiH_kY  And after finishing my deathly dessert, I turned to the young woman that waited on me, threw two thumbs up in the air, and cracked a smile, which she returned, this edible battle for my soul only replenishing it. The cup of tart, nutritious, pressed afresh sunshine that was the orange juice rejuvenated my spirits further.   Speaking of which, the employees are decidedly hipster sans the slack, snobbishness, or casual disdain. I felt as if these tattooed, fashionable whippersnappers were waiting for me to stop in so as to impress me. If so (yeah, riiight, like they were just dying for Yelp's Darren W. to come by for all of these months), they succeeded. Their prices are affordable. Their fare is evidently creative and appetizing. Their service is relatively keen, clever, and kindly. Their local-first ethic is admirably conscientious of the land, sea, and air. Their all-inclusive enthusiasm is undeniable. What minion of the Redhead coos \"Hellloooo\" to every single patron as they walk in the door and towards the counter like she's a friend of theirs?   So, why exactly are you still dancin' with The Clown before work? Break the habit. Turn to the Bird."}
{"text":"Staying in the downtown area there weren't many options for a quick breakfast all weekend long. Most places were only open during the week, so we only had Friday to find a local breakfast spot. Rolled the dice and went to Bluebird and it paid off.   Nice modern looking place. Clean and sleek. Quick line. Ordered up some biscuits and gravy. While not known as a city that does biscuits and gravy, these were pretty good.   If you're around during the week and looking for a full, yet inexpensive breakfast, Bluebird is your joint."}
{"text":"Freindliest service in downtown Pittsburgh and beyond no doubt.    Some of the best tasting ciabatta bread, eggs and bacon I have ever eaten.   Prices just right.  Clean and fresh atmosphere.   Great way to refuel and wake up.   Young kid waited on me and was fantastic.  Good didn't take long at all.   I'll be back again and again.    Go there."}
{"text":"Just a chance to put in my $.02 on the Bluebird, since it has been Yelped about so many times.    Fantastic lunch spot Downtown. I hear it is a great breakfast, too.  Looked at the menu on the chalkboard above the counter and notice that the specials and soups were only on the little sign out front.  So I asked and found that one of my fave's hot butternut squash soup was available.  It was so cold and the hot soup was delicious.  The Cuban sandwich went perfectly with the soup. The cookies and salads looked great, next time.  What a great alternative Downtown."}
{"text":"My mom never made food for us that SHE didn't like, so I grew up through a childhood without chili, Mexican food and biscuits & gravy. Sickening, right? Once I grew up old enough to buy my own food, I realized how much she truly deprived me. First off, Mexican food is my all time favorite, so it really is a crying shame that she did that to me. Secondly, due to my sheltered past the only kind of biscuits and gravy I've ever had is Grands biscuits with gravy from the grocery store. I never realized how life changing homemade biscuits and gravy can really be. Bluebird Kitchen has the absolute best ever--unless your mom made them for you homemade, then you might not think they are the \"absolute best\" but you can't dispute that they are darn good.  The biscuits were flaky and had just the right amount of crunch to go perfectly with the gravy. The gravy had homemade sausage in it and was lick the plate good. I also had the fried egg sandwich with homemade sausage. That was really delicious too. The best part of Bluebird Kitchen is the fact that everything is locally made and that they use quality ingredients.  Only downside was that it was a little slow but keep in mind they are making everything fresh for you -- it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour. We weren't in a hurry though, so I'm not docking them any stars. There was a girl that decided to cancel her order because she was in a hurry and didn't have time to wait.  Service is always #1 to me and there was the nicest guy working the counter. He apologized to us for the long wait and was very pleasant.   This is another spot that I have Yelp to thank for leading me there!"}
{"text":"This is a good lunch spot in Market Square and a solid four stars. Keep in mind that they do close at 3. I went in with coworkers around 12:30. There were a few people in line and we had to wait a few minutes for food but it overall moved fast.  I had the turkey sandwich that has avocado and jam on it. My coworkers had the roast beef (cold) and the Cuban (hot). We all enjoyed our sandwiches. My only complaint is that the bread was a bit too think for the sandwich. Some people might enjoy this but it was too much bread for me. Nonetheless, it was tasty.  Service was fast and friendly and the prices seemed on par with the area. We didn't get to have dessert or coffee so we'll have to go again to try that."}
{"text":"review for location in First Niagra building:  sandwiches are good but over-priced so i would not recommend them.  However, the salads are very good, I am a health conscious eater and ordered a tuna salad.  It came without the mayo and contained half of an avocado, very well made and healthy salad if you are looking for a healthy light lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place. I trust their food and it's such a pleasant place to have breakfast or lunch.  There are always vegan and gluten-free options but some great meat options too.  The oatmeal is delicious (get all of the toppings!) and the grits have bacon and 2 fried dippy eggs on top.  The Tuna Nicoise is a delicious salad and other reviewers aren't kidding: the mustard dressing is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat downtown. If I am around the area at lunch time I'm sure to stop in...heck, if I'm in the area I stop in no matter what time and take a home a pastry. I love the macarons, the chicken salad sandwich, the hot chocolate, and SO much more. I heard the owner speak at an event and really like her story. It really makes me appreciate supporting businesses that support Pittsburgh. I love following along on Instagram, too. Great photos and a good reminder to stop in!"}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to checking this place out for lunch.  I ordered the Pain Bagnat, Soup, Cookie, and a water for $17.00.  I was expecting it to live up to the price tag.  When I got back to my desk I discovered that I received some sort of chicken salad concoction instead and since I can't eat mayo it was a loss.    The soup was good for the first few spoons.  Then what was left looked like a gob of nasty so that, too, was a wash.  The cookie was good at least and water never disappoints.  Looks like I'll be hitting up the vending machine with what little cash I have left. Bummer.  Maybe I just caught them on an off day judging from all the good reviews.  Way too expensive for what you get regardless."}
{"text":"Very good coffee - Counter Coffee beans, can't go wrong there.  Extremely friendly service, very welcoming.  Had a great breakfast sandwich - fried egg, sausage, on ciabatta bread.  Everything else looked great as well.  Good atmosphere in there as well, nice place to hang out and enjoy your food and coffee."}
{"text":"We just missed breakfast and I was a little bummed because I wanted to try the pastrami salmon. But I am so happy we decided to stay for lunch. I had the cuban and my girlfriend had the roast beef sandwich. Both were excellent (ask for a side of horseradish sauce for the roast beef). Coffee was great and was served in a huge mug. We has a hard time deciding on a side because they all looked so good. The sweet potato and black bean salad was excellent. I couldn't believe how reasonably priced everything was for being made in-house and organic. Great healthy spot that won't hurt your wallet.   That being said, the highlight for me was the Honey Tuilles. Oh my god was that good. I need to see if I can get them shipped down south because I might be addicted!"}
{"text":"Loved this little gem!  It's not really an \"eat in\" as most of the people at the counter are waiting for their take out order. Best to take your food and eat at a table in Market Square. Breakfast only served until 10:30. Get there early as they do run out of menu items. The steel cut oatmeal cooked in coconut water was soooo tasty.  My husband raves about the breakfast sandwich.   I really wanted to the the sweet potato hash but they were all out of.  Closed on the weekends and only open until 3pm."}
{"text":"This was a perfect lunchtime destination for a trio of conference attendees unfamiliar with the downtown Pittsburgh area and looking for something involving vegetables. One of our group had been to some kind of major meat-o-rama meal the night before and was craving salad. So I popped \"salad\" into the Yelp app, and it sent us here.  There were salads indeed, as well as sandwiches and soups. What there wasn't was much in the way of seats, so we were lucky to be only three and to find room at a side counter. I had the April's vegetarian sandwich, and my companions both had a tuna nicoise salad. Although my sandwich was good, I think my lunchmates got the better deal. There was simply more food there. I was still hungry after my sandwich.  I tried to order an infamous vegan cookie (I say \"infamous\" like I know anything about it, but I was just going by the Yelp reviews), but they were all out. I was partially assuaged by the availability of green tea."}
{"text":"Would've given this place 4 stars but it just didn't feel right especially when I have this place two chances to redeem themselves. It wasn't the food that was bad- more so the staff. I ordered the local egg sandwich with bacon on ciabatta. Tasted great and nothing short of how I pictured it. I also ordered their smoothie of the day (kale, blueberries, etc.). That's where it went all wrong. I saw the staff use their bare hands to put the fruits and vegetables in while wiping his hands on his pants with the occasion combing of his hair. I wish I didn't see all that. I couldn't sit back and drink that...I had to ask for him to keep the drink. I swapped it with their freshly squeezed orange juice. This time he put on his gloves...the juice was delightful but the outside of the cup was all sticky (he probably didn't care at that point). And this all happened during the first visit. The second visit, I ordered the local egg sandwich with bacon on a pretzel roll. However, I got the sandwich on a ciabatta roll. Sandwich was good but wasn't what I ordered. Wish the staff was more attentive..."}
{"text":"I picked up a house roast beef for a working lunch. It was quick to be made and definitely carries some weight. The ingredients were fresh to the bite and enough horseradish aioli to delight and not overwhelm my taste buds and the sandwich. I do like adding chips for a side but found that the sandwich alone was enough to satiate my stomach. If you get there early or late enough you can find parking around market square but if you go during peak hours it won't be so easy to get in and get out."}
{"text":"Grossly underwhelmed with my visit to Bluebird this morning. I've been hearing so many great things about it, and just had to try it. I was met with fairly rude service, and when I tried to order breakfast I was told that they had stopped serving breakfast. So I tried to order lunch, but was told they weren't serving lunch. So my pickings were pretty slim. I had a slice of the Quiche and the small Sweet Potato Hash. The hash was quite flavorful, however the \"small\" size is more like a spoonful (plus it was lukewarm). The quiche was ok, but it tasted pretty watery and lacked a lot of flavor you'd expect to taste in a Quiche.   I love the concept of this restaurant, I just had a bad experience. It seems silly to me to drop $9 on a pretty mediocre (and SMALL) breakfast. I'll be back to try lunch sometime, I'm just not in a huge hurry."}
{"text":"Bluebird Kitchen is an upscale cafe serving breakfast, lunch, and an assortment of desserts. On this specific visit I ordered the Local Fried Eggs on a homemade pretzel bun. I ate the entire thing without putting the breakfast sandwich down. I think that speaks for itself - it was delicious!   Did you know they offer half priced yesterday pastries? It's a first come first served basis with those pastries. So, go see if you can score a sweet deal!"}
{"text":"I've walked by Bluebird Kitchen countless times, always thinking \"that looks cute!\" but never having a chance to stop in. I recently started a new job and now have a longer lunch break, so a friend from work and I stopped in here for a bite to eat today.   We got there around 1 and the lunch rush was just ending. The line moved quickly, the staff was friendly, and we didn't have to wait long at all while our sandwiches were made.   Speaking of sandwiches--the Cuban that I ordered was fantastic! Rosemary ham, pork belly, a delicious mustard dressing, and (of course) pickles came together in a delicious combination. The ciabatta was sturdy and resisted sogginess during our walk back to the office. Nothing worse than a mushy sandwich!  There were so many delicious pastry items and I wanted to try all of them (it took some serious self control not to pick up a dessert--but Girl Scout Cookies are everywhere my the office right now!). I'll be back some morning for coffee and a pastry.   Overall this was a really pleasant experience and I'm excited to return. Such a great little spot!"}
{"text":"Updated 9/2016 - love that I can always count on a dairy free/ gluten free option at lunch! it's so great to have a restaurant with great food that is thinking about this! I've been going pretty much every day when I visit Pittsburgh - breakfast (sweet potato hash is great) and lunch!"}
{"text":"When Bluebird Kitchen opened I was so excited and not let down at all. The menu items are always fresh and up to par. The House Roast Beef and House Turkey sandwiches are my typical orders and they live up to what a sandwich should be. Last night at a Yelp event I was able to sample Bluebird catering items for the first time. The asparagus wrapped in phyllo dough is so good. Well done, gang!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place.   When I was a meat eater, I loved their turkey sandwich. It's so fresh, flavorful and delicious! The bacon jam was very savory and the avocado was very creamy. It couldn't be beat!   As a vegetarian, I love that there is always a special every month! I loved their black bean burger on a brioche bun! Super tasty.   I love their baked goods! The peanut butter sandwich, chocolate chip cookie dough sandwich, and vegan chocolate chip cookie are amazing! I mean, all of their baked goods look awesome.   I love their hot teas as well. The coconut oolong is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Very impressed! I feel like I'm a pretty tough judge on deli/sandwich shops.  I think it's really easy to make a boring sandwich, salad or side.  They can just end up being bland and not creative at all.  That is NOT the case with this place (look at my rhyming!).    First thing's first.  Everything on the menu looked awesome!  From the sammies to the salads to the sides, it was really hard to decide.  I'm a sucker for roast beef and horsy dressing, so I went with the Roast Beef sandwich.  It definitely held it's own with a nice amount of meat, lettuce, tomato and horsy dressing (I love me some sauce!) on a delish ciabatta bread.    I also sampled the bean salad and pasta salad.  I LOVED the bean salad!  It was super tasty and had great flavor.  The pasta salad was bland.  I wouldn't get that again.  Only loser in the meal though... so I still left a very happy lady.  The bakery part of the deli looked incredible!  I could have gobbled it all up.  I, of course, had to get something!  So I tried the homemade s'more.  It was ooey gooey goodness!  I had my eye on a couple other items I'll certainly be back for, promise!  Although the line was long, it moved along fast and was able to zip in and out in no time.  This is such a great spot for a quick lunch, if I worked downtown I might be tempted to go in every day!  Another new establishment we're lucky to have in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Mediocre coffee. Nice enough space. They don't have gluten-free bread. Why serve whole food, but not serve your audience."}
{"text":"If you're interested in getting soups or sides I suggest calling and asking ahead of time what they have since it changes daily. Their cauliflower soup is the absolute best!! They have a monthly vegetarian sandwich that can often be made vegan and their sides and soups are clearly labeled vegan. They also usually have vegan chocolate chip cookies that are incredible! I haven't had any of their other desserts but they look amazing. Just be aware if you go at peak lunch time it can take a bit to get your sandwich (sides, soups, and desserts are ready right away)."}
{"text":"I'm in love.  Hands down one of the best lunch places in downtown Pittsburgh.  I love their sandwiches, and rotating hot meal menus or special of the day.  Their desserts are uber tasty and unique and the staff is friendly and so helpful, kind, and they know how to dress!  They are super busy during lunch with a line out the door.  So I suggest you go there early (rather than late - they tend to sell out of the specials).   Definitely stop in if you are in the market square area of downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that Bluebird's food is more than just a-ok.  The breakfast pastries are deliciously gluttonous. The lunches are fresh and unique. Seriously, try the turkey-gouda sandwich. Yum.   I also appreciate that the Bluebird Kitchen works around seasonal local ingredients.  Blueberry season? Expect to see it in muffins, macaroons, and even the soups! This is fantastic.  My problem has nothing to do with the food quality itself.   For several reasons, I think every item on the menu is overpriced by about a dollar.   First, the portions are small. The sandwiches, though delicious, are about the size of the lunches you would make at home with wonderbread and deli turkey.   Second, sides are not included.  If you do want a side, it will cost you at least 3 dollars. Not worth it for a side!   Last, some of the people who work there are downright unfriendly.  Once, I queried a rather listless female about the blackberry macaroons.  I had purchased Bluebird's scrumptious macaroons before, but the ones I saw behind the glass this time were \"mini.\"  So when crankypants tells me off the top of her head that they were about the same price as the normal sized pastries, I was taken aback.  When I asked her if she was sure about the cost, she rolled her eyes and gave me sass. Come on. It was a just question!   Like I said, I am overall impressed with the superb quality of the food.  But both the service and quantity are lacking..."}
{"text":"It was lunchtime on Thursday and all the other popular restaurants were packed so I needed a quick and healthy meal to keep me going. Bluebird kitchen was clean and affordable with so many interesting sandwiches, pastries, and salads. I ordered the chicken salad on a croissant and my girlfriend and I shared the pecan pie chocolate bar. The sandwich was a bit small but the dessert was plenty to keep us satisfied. It would be nice if the sandwich came with a side item but I'm happy they gave us water for free to drink with the meal."}
{"text":"I once asked myself, \"Where do all the young professionals of this fine rust belt city wait in line for fancy carry out lunches?\"   The answer is Bluebird. It is all pretty good, somewhat high minded, scratch made kind of stuff. It is generally pretty fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm sorry this review is about to be so short. Literally my favourite place to get a bacon-covered cinnamon roll in the city. Ask nicely (pay extra) and they will put a fried egg on it. AHAHAHHA I KNOW I'M A MAD GENIOUS. Bam, crushfast (more extreme than breakfast) of champions.   NOTE: Prices could be better."}
