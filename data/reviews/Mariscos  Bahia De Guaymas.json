{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of their food and the kindness of their servers. 
The owners are a pleasure to talk with and I was impressed to know that this is a family owned restaurant. They are preparing to renovation both the outside and inside to bring the restaurants appearance up to the level of their food and service. 
The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and service provided.
This restaurant has become a destination for myself and my family. It's always exciting to find a nice place with good service that you can bring your friends in for a beer or your family in for some good food and desserts.
Talk to the owners, George or his sister and please tell them Damian sent you. 
This place is a hidden gem off 16th st and Broadway in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very good. Didn't know what to except, but it was close to where I was working so I decided to give it a try. I got the chimichanga beer lunch special with cheese, it was about the size of a Chipotle burrito, it was huge! Not only was it big, the shredded beef was moist and well seasoned. Very good meal, very friendly staff, I'll think I'll cone here again when I'm nearby."}
{"text":"It is a Wednesday and they offer a sweet sweet oyster deal buy a dozen at $14.00 and get one dozen free. The chips and salsa are a great starter they offer a big variety on the menu of sea food and the food is great."}
{"text":"We were in town for about 5 days and ate here twice. The food was amazing.  Great customer service as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food... seafood very good and the environment nice too. Servers are nice"}
{"text":"Ok guys I from Texas and its hard out here to find a good seafood place without it killing my wallet, but the good lord showed me this place and i took a chance. It was one of the best places I've been too. The ceviche was to die for and so were the micheladas. I had the jumbo shrimp diablo (my mouth is watering while I'm typing this) everything was great and the customer service was excellent"}
{"text":"So for the monolingual, \"Bahia de Guaymas\" means \"Guaymas Bay.\" Don't walk in expecting your typical Mexican steak fajitas, because unless you're coming for lunch this is a Mexican seafood restaurant. Can't speak for the seafood, but the lunch was great.

Very affordable - no lunch special more than $7. Salsa and chips were fresh and tasty. The meal itself was incredibly filling - I had a huge burrito and the wife had her typical cheese enchiladas. You can get whatever meal you ordered smothered in enchilada sauce for an extra 95 cents. The enchilada sauce is reminiscent of New Mexican chile sauce - sweet and spicy.

Music is a bit loud, I got up and discreetly turned it down at one point. As we left a mariachi band was walking in, sorry we missed out on that but we had to run. Overall the place has a low-key party atmosphere. Give it a shot if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I have to say at first when I walked didn't know if you get seated or you just sit on your own... the place is in the middle of no where but the staff are nice. Told her it's her first time and she gave me complimentary fish soup. I had the shrimp ceviche and the shrimp cocktail. The ceviche was amazing but the cocktail could have used a little more flavor. Small little place but delish overall"}
{"text":"They have the best ceviche in town & breaded shrimp are extremely good too. Good spot for any type of seafood your craving. Their waters are fresh and have a good variety. Love this spot!!!"}
{"text":"As close to Mexico as you can get without a passport! We ordered the shrimp ceviche, tacos al pastor, shrimp tacos and pargo rojo con salsa de ajo (red snapper in garlic sauce). Everything was deliciously authentic, and the tacos al pastor, ah, Â¡me vuelve a Guanajuato de nuevo! We fed a family of four with sodas for $50 plus tip, and we were STUFFED. Lovely service, fun music and real Mexican food. 10/10 will return soon."}
{"text":"I live about a block from this place! I really enjoy the food, this last time I tried the Marlin quesadilla it was exactly what I expected it to be! Cooked to perfection. They always have beer specials. The waitresses are really friendly its always a chill environment as its not overly loud like most Mariscos places. The fresh fish entrees are always fresh taste as they were just fished out of the sea.Nice little spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I probably should write a review, since apparently I'm the restaurant's profile picture right now (oh dear).

The prices for dinner items are a little more expensive than the hole-in-the-wall establishment that I expected when we pulled up to this Mexican joint.  That's probably because the vast majority of the dishes are seafood related.  There are non-seafood items, especially on the lunch menu, but seafood is definitely the special of the house (bahia means bay).

So, of course, I made the mistake of ordering a non-seafood dish.  Luckily it wasn't a horrible mistake - my cheese enchiladas were filling, had decent flavor, and were, best of all, cheap.  However, I'm sure the seafood here is spectacular, and I broke my own rule and didn't order the house specialty.  My horchata, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious.

Service was great as well.  When the chef sent out beef enchiladas (not an item on the $7 lunch menu) instead of my cheap version, the waitress apologized profusely and offered to let me have it if I'd like.  The bus-boy was a cute 10 year old wearing a walkman.  Obviously an authentic family-run establishment.

Stop by if you're in the area - it's better than those buffet places that the nearby DMV is advertising!"}
