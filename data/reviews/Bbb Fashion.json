{"text":"the customer service is terrible! all the employees are too busy talking to each other to help customers.. then after finding what I wanted I went to pay for it and the girl tells me that the register isn't taking care right now.. anywhere else I've been they would let you know that before you waste time looking around. put a sign up or something!"}
{"text":"Little gem hidden away in a local complex. I always come here for my going out heels  the clothing is always a hit and miss but I promise you will always leave with a new pair of shoes!"}
{"text":"The store definitely has very cute cheap little clothes and shoes. The employees do talk to each other a lot and will not reach out to you or ask how you're doing. You have to find one of them around the big store to ask questions. The girls back in the beauty section are very knowledgeable about the hair and products which is good. Would recommend to anyone to find a quick night out outfit, but don't expect to be tailored to by the employees."}
{"text":"The two girls that were in the back today with the beauty supplies were really rude. They had zero customer service. I looked and I did not see the products that I needed as I walked out of the area they proceeded to clap and laugh as I left. I will NEVER SHOP THERE AGAIN AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. I ended up going to Mid k and received excellent customer service."}
