{"text":"I felt really lucky today, for over a year I been searching for a decent Manti .And finally I found them :) they weren't as my mom used to make but I did hear divine music in my ears every little bite i took.The service was good the place was super clean. Will be back for some Manti very soon!"}
{"text":"I went to this place not expecting much, and was delightfully surprised! I had a chicken kabob meal with came with two large chicken breast skewers, a huge bowl of salad, pitas and really deliciously spiced garlic potato fries. It was also affordable, at $12.Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken laffa.  It was served in tinfoil and was extremely greasy.  My plate was left with a pool of oil.  Chicken was dry and over done.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice now. First time was excellent, 5 stars! The Chicken Shawarma large salad great, dressing even better. We also had the Chicken schnitzel very good. Second visit, pita warm and fresh, shawarma still great, but found a hair in my Jerusalem mix. Server tried to be apologetic, gave us coffee on the house to make up for it and 10% discount. they are very nice for service and I know everyone needs to be profitable, but unfortunately this visit has not left me with a happy time. I will give it maybe 1 more try, but I will stick to the shawarma or kebobs."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.   We ordered the chicken shish kabab and the lamb shish kabab for dinner.   It came with pita bread, huge salad, mains and one side(potatoes and rice).  The kababs were amazing!  Loved the potatoes too!  There were more than enough food for 2.  Dinner for 2 including tips for $40.  Great Value.    Not sure why they named it Yummy Grill though. Needs a better name in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had a dinner with my fiance, food was ok. I will say manti was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"It is a good restaurant for student to go out for lunch I would not go there as a family day out Not an amazing food or service"}
{"text":"Tried the food last week at a corporate catered event. Everything was so delicious. My plate was probably about three-quarters filled with their various meats (beef, chicken, lamb, etc). All of their sauces and dips tasted pretty good, although they didn't have a genuine hot sauce. They had a watery red sauce that wasn't hot and a teeny tiny container of red pepper flakes in oil that was also surprisingly not hot. If they could get a genuinely hot sauce (maybe it is available and my company just didn't order it), this food would be even \"yummier\"."}
{"text":"We were there last night celebrating my wife's birthday and it was a great time! The food was amazing, our group was very multicultural and everyone found something they liked to order and was very happy with their choice. Amazing service, very reasonable prices and an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great prices. Cozy , family friendly Mediterranean restaurant. Food comes in very large portions with side salad. Very good!"}
{"text":"Went to Yummy Grill for dinner with a buddy. Had the Humuz and Chicken Wings as apps. Humuz was really good and made to perfection! The wings were very disappointing, they were served on a skewer and almost undercooked. Had the Kefta Kebab as Entree, which was disappointing, got served 4 couldn't make it past 2. My buddy had the Shwarma platter and said it was good. Overall slightly less than an average rating."}
{"text":"Went here first time about 4 years ago, the food was great. Then decided to go back over the weekend for my birthday dinner. The place is very accommodating and the food is delicious. All of the guests enjoyed their meals and they are reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food that you get. Definitely missed this place and will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"While there are many options for Middle Eastern / Russian / Central Asian cuisine in Thornhill (serving generally similar fare), my experience at Yummy has consistently been exceptional. My family and I find the service fast and friendly, but the quality of the food and the obvious care taken in its preparation are what keeps us coming back.  The staples of a Middle Eastern kitchen are executed exceptionally well. Highlights included: - Hummus: very smooth, flavorful and strikes a great balance between the creaminess of the tahini and the richness of the chick peas.  - Shawarma: crispy on the grilled exterior, tender in the interior, and importantly, lacking the greasiness that often accompanies many shawarma offerings.  - Kebabs: well-seasoned, juicy with a great texture; many others I've had in the neighborhood are either bland, or the meat is overworked, leading to a pasty texture.   While there are many restaurants I enjoy, I don't write Yelp reviews often. What drove me to make an exception in this case is the wonderful experience I've had in getting Yummy to cater a 70+ person function I held a few weeks ago. Working with Boris was delightful. He suggested foods that travel well, keeps well in heating trays and will be tasty when produced in large quantities; he never pushed unnecessary quantities and or more expensive menu items. The food was prepared on time for pick up, was packaged appropriately for transport, and Boris even provided fully-functional heating trays for service. Top-notch effort and execution."}
{"text":"The food was good but it's overpriced ($45 for a 2 dinners and 2 drinks...)   We ordered takeout and they didn't give us cutlery.   I also asked if I could get fries and the counter girl said yes but then forgot to tell the kitchen and I got vegetables in my order...   I called after to let them know and whoever answer didn't even apologize and their excuse for the lack of cutlery was that most people take it home to eat..."}
{"text":"This is one of those neighbourhood gems. The food is always good, the service friendly and priced affordability. Eastern European and Middle Eastern foods nestle comfortably side by side."}
{"text":"Good value for the food especially for the items to choose from.  It is a family owned Mediterranean restaurant and was relatively easy to get a large table of 15. Many of us had the lamb while some choose steak or chicken.  The decor is somewhat cosy with a family feel. The meal came with the typical sides of salad plus lots of pita bread. Service was a nice pace which gave the group a chance to chit chat. Place is definitely not as fancy as other restaurants serving similar food."}
{"text":"Recently went there for a quick snack/lunch. It is a brightly decorated restaurant, located in a small suburban strip mall.  It features mediterranean cuisine, but is basically serving Israeli type middle eastern food. It curiously features a number of Uzbeki dishes on the menu. My old stand-by Jerusalem Mix is also on the menu.  For our quick lunch we shared a large Israeli salad and a HUGE chicken shawarma pita. I can be a large eater at times but the chicken was extremely plentiful and the whole thing very tasty. We were also served complimentary pickles of cucumber and spiced cabbage leafs.  To complete the meal I had a small piece of average baklava, and a pretty good coffee. The prices are really reasonable and its quick, plain, good and simple."}
{"text":"Yummy Grill?  More like Crummy grill.  How this establishment is still open with all the other much better options in the area for Mediterranean. The shwarma I ordered once, I took 3 bites and realized it was under cooked and had no flavour and threw it out.   They charge extra for certain toppings inside your laffa.  The laffa was basically a very thick piece of dough, not fresh. We ordered a schnitzel and it was a simple egg wash without any breading.   Paid 40 bucks for a meal we didn't eat.  To top it off the front staff was old and angry.  Just close it down already."}
{"text":"Simply the WORST shawarma or Mediterranean food ever. Do not even make a mistake of going in here! Me and my family of 6 went in, ordered sharwamas and chicken fingers. First off, they didnt even put the fingers in the fryer for atleast 45 MINUTES! Then, we went to ask the manager politely that its taking too long. SHE BLASTS US OFF SAYING FINE DONT PAY FOR IT BUT YOU'll GET IT. Secondly, we told them politely that the shawarma's are very chewy and old! She simpy blasts off starts shouting starts calling us 'RIDICULOUS' ppl, talks in her afghani language with other ppl n keeps on shouting non stop. The owner is cooking herself in the kitchen, she has NO IDEA what this type of food is and thinks she's the QUEEN of shawarmas. Tells me her restaurant is 'award winning' - hahaha. NEVER GO THERE, worst food ever. This is not how restaurants work."}
{"text":"I usually order from here through UberEATS. Tonight I actually went in myself. As always, they have good food, good prices, and nice staff. I recommend them to all!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small plaza near Atkinson road is a fabulous middle eastern mom and pop restaurant.  Been here a few times and its great place for a lil shawarma snack and battered fries. Shawarmas are packed to the max and you'll definitely make a mess trying to eat them. The cheese perogies are frozen here, don't recommend it.  Nice servers. Will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"3.5  Went to Yummy with a couple of friends last sunday night.  Nice little Mediterranean place.  Overall it was a pleasure experience.   Pros:  Food was pretty good for the most part Service was pretty good (though there was only one waitress for the whole place)  Cons: One waitress for entire place Not really accessible if you don't drive  If you stick to the Mediterranean items on the menu, you will be fine at this place.  The items like steak, fajitas, etc. will be hit or miss.  We came as a party of 11 so we had a wide assortment of dishes.  The kebabs, shawarma, and lamb chops were all done very well.  Cooked the way we asked and very tasty throughout.    Rib steak, not so much.  Asked for medium rare, it came out more rare than anything.  Not a big thing as the person who ordered prefers more rare the more done.  Could be a big thing for someone who doesn't.  Steak wasn't very tender though even though it was rare.  The cut of meat itself must not of been a good one.  Enjoyable, but could of been better.  Other non-Mediterranean items were at  best just OK.  The rib steak was the one that stood out though.  Every entree comes with a chef salad and a side.  The chef salad was very good.  It comes with their own salad dressing which I really liked.  The choice of side is grilled  veggies, rice, home made potatoes, and french fries.  Most of us got the homemade potatoes based on a recommendation and we were not disappointed. The home made potatoes were some of the best potatoes I can remember having.  Go with that one for sure!  The restaurant can seat about 30 so for the life of me I can't understand how they only have one waitress for the entire place.  Yes, it's sunday night and we were a bigger party.  Even without us though, there were at least 15 other people there.  After we left, another party of 10-15 was walking in.  The lady that was working was excellent.  She did her best despite being alone.  She just couldn't keep up after a while though, not her fault at all.  They need minimum 2 wait staff for any given night.  I don't know the circumstances behind it, (maybe someone called in sick) but if it's an everyday thing to only have one, the service will suffer.  Overall, a pretty good experience.  I probably will go back if I'm craving Mediterranean.  I will stick to the traditional items this time around though."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and also to their \"express\" location on bathurst and steeles (in the Kiva's plaza) first, i read the reviews and I have to say ... if someone is complaining about chicken wings, this may be because you are not at the right place for chicken wings.. (i wouldn't go to a Chinese restaurant and order french fries, but that's just me) their portions here are great and the entrees come with a nice green salad and a hearty side; i can never finish it alone, forget about getting an app too I have been here for parties and just for lunch or dinner I have had the chicken shish kebob (dark meat) and it was very juicy, flavourful and a large portion have also tried the lamb chops which i enjoyed and found to be cooked just right without being undercooked have also had the steak (the one with the bone); for around $18-20 you are getting a great peice of meat that is cooked well and has lots of flavour (the chef puts a tasty mix of garlic and herbs on it) I have also had the lagman (a traditional Uzbeki soup); this is quite good and heartly and i have had the samsi (Uzbeki-type perogies with lamb inside), these are very tasty and taste homemade! my family also likes the chebureki here (deep fried thin dough filled with ground chicken or veal) i've even had the fish here (served sizzling and topped with garlic and lemon) and i don't even like fish! the spreads are also good; i've had the hummus, babaganoush, mushrooms, grilled eggplant, etc and never been disappointed they also serve pickled cabbage and pickles with each meal (i LOVE that pickled cabbage!) (you can see i've tried many options here :D) Their fries are REALLY tasty (they are not thin cut so u get a nice crisp outside but really soft inside) and the home potatoes are nice too (chunks of potatoes with garlic and herbs) all in all, a very tasty place with lots of middle eastern options for a very fair price and quite sizeable portions (no, their chicken wings may not be amazing but this is not what you come to Yummy Grill for)"}
{"text":"I would give his place 3.5 stars and round it up to 4.    I come here specifically for the Manti and Pluff. Both of which are traditional Uzbeki dishes. I have been lucky enough to have home cooked Uzbeki food a few time and I love it!  I would say the Manti (lamb dumpling) is pretty good, the lamb is nicely marinated, i would say that the cm  I have had Manti (lamb dumpling) on only a few occasions, my eyes always pop open when I see it on a menu.  Apart from home-cooked, I would say this place has the most memorable Manti.  The wrapping is thin but it falls apart easily and the juices all run away... :( but it is very juicy! And the lamb meat stands out with the marinate flavour. My brother thinks highly of it too and said he will come back next week for sure.  The pluff (lamb, carrots, garlic, and rice) was really good. Again, i always order when I see it and this is more flavourful then most places I have tried! The reason is because it's much more oily compared! Bad for health but awesome for taste!  I can't give this place a full 4 or 5 stars because of a few reasons, service is not the best, no smiles, just straight up to the point service, even though it was just a phone order and pick up - they hung up on me twice when I ordered,   Another reason is price, $50 take-out price for 12 dumplings and a pluff.. i on average visit of new restaurant once every 2 days and writing reviews really makes me think of the value of food versus the price I pay.."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good!  They actually grill on charcoal so the meat has that bbq taste.  The chicken schwarma dinner is huge. Comes with fries, a giant garden salad and pickles and cabbage (its like 3 containers for 1 meal). Three people could easily eat this and its only $14.00.  The falafels are also pretty good here too, and tried kefta kabob pita which is not bad but a little gamey tasting because its half lamb half beef."}
{"text":"We love this place. Food is excellent , reasonable pricing, good service! Our friend from US  was very happy with this place . Would highly recommend if you love Uzbek and Mediterranean food. Good Job Boris!"}
{"text":"Salads were great starters and things went downhill from there.  The saute veggies I had with my chicken tasted like stale frozen veggies reheated in the microwave.  No toilet paper in dated ugly bathroom."}
{"text":"This is like others offering falafel except much more attention to fresh and tender loving care to all their cooking ;making all from scratch. Their meats and salads are delicious . With many places to choose from this is the one in thornhill to go to"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Will definitely be a regular. Great (and better) alternative to MeVaMe"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place in Thornhill for shawarma. 9/10 times I've been here I've had nothing but delicious, fresh chicken in my shawarma with loads of hummus and tahini. The other time I had some old chicken that was smelly. Still ate it obviously ;)   Service here has always been good. I like how they give you a nice big glass pitcher of water with your glasses so you don't have to worry if the server is going to come back to quench your thirst constantly.   Whenever I go out with friends I always order the pita with hummus appetizer. The hummus here is unbelievably good!"}
