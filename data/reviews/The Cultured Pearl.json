{"text":"I had the best date night here this past weekend. Forget what you know about the old Pearl because you won't find it here. Great service, strong drinks, delicious food and live music every night. We were concerned we might not be able to converse once the band started but the volume was at a level where you can still enjoy the company you're with. I'm already plotting an excuse for my next visit."}
{"text":"We were a group of about 10 women in for a Bachelorette Party this past weekend.  Our experience was great! The food was fantastic, we were all so happy to have the Sunset Strip (our favorite Pearl sushi roll). It was delicious!! The calamari was fantastic as well. The service was nice. And the music was great. It was a little loud for dinner, maybe next time we will request a table a little further away from the band. Well done, Cultured Pearl! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Cultured Pearl is a huge step up from Pearl. It is classy and cool. The staff is amazing and the food and drinks are the classics with a new twist. Love the live band."}
{"text":"Excellent concept and amazing food!

The octagon layout with the live performers in the center create a very entertaining vibe. 

I stopped by with a buddy of mine for a quick bite to eat on a Friday and was surprised. This is certainly a very unique place. We enjoyed a round of sushi from the outside bar listening to the live jazz.

The vibe was so nice we decided to come back for dinner the next night with a few more friends. Very tasty menu from the apps to the entrees. We had sushi, calamari, Seabass and roasted chicken. Mouth watering is all I can say!  Everything tastes gourmet!

The piano player took requests and kept the place entertained with his unique renditions and humor. The night ended with the most awesome cover of the the Beasties Boys \" Paul Revere\" which included help from those seated around the octagon.

Tammy, Heidi and Rob took great care of us the entire evening.

This is my new fav!"}
{"text":"One of the best parts of this place was the outdoor seating and the live music. Don't get me wrong, the sushi was great. The sauce on the two rolls I got ,Double V and Red Zeppelin, made the need for soy and wasabi nonexistent. The tuna was fresh and full of flavor. As always the wine was a little over priced but a small bone to pick considering that this happens everywhere"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Great staff! Great atmosphere!
The Cultured Pearl has wonderful sushi dishes that are prepared like a work of art. They have a DJ that plays top 40 and old school music on Saturdays.  Great place for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Great service! Tasty little random find. Ate here because we were staying at the Hyatt House. Their sushi was delicious and had hilarious names. Great staff. And tasty drinks. Had the Drunk Monk. Perfectly balanced drink. We all had almost every single roll. All were devoured. Sweet chili edamame so addictive. Pork belly skewers ok. Could have been more melt in your mouth but they were good."}
{"text":"Definitely a new experience for me - eating sushi while feeling like your at a bumping night club. I found the whole concept to be very fresh and unique. The sushi was also very good and flavorful and I enjoyed the modern steel chop sticks! The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that this may be a tough place to go if wanting some romantic date or plan on needing to talk to your company a lot because the music can we quite loud..however now I know and next time I come back it will definitely be with my girlfriends as our first stop before a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Don't bother, unless you're under 30 and don't care how your food tastes. If you like loud music, sports on many screens and salty bad food this is your place.   There's so many other great places to eat in Scottsdale it's just not worth it. Wait staff marginal.  Liz"}
{"text":"This restaurant is now called TRU sushi and sound. The place looks super trendy but its sort of in a weird location and not very crowded around dinner time. It definitely has a lounge-y feel and a DJ that starts playing around 8pm. The sushi was okay and a little pricey but they have happy hour until 7pm. The waiter wasn't overly friendly, he seemed kind of annoyed with us because we asked a lot of questions, but he did check on us frequently. Not many gluten free options, all I could eat was the sashimi and edamame. But they do have gf soy sauce so that's a plus. I wouldn't come again for the food, might be good just to hang out if your looking for a lounge-y type bar with music.  There is a lot of patio seating as well."}
{"text":"Unbelievably Amazing Food!

The food was absolutely impeccable. Living here, I've come to expect sub par or mediocre experiences from most higher end establishments. I was impressed.

The food that came out was plated and presented in the most dazzling way. It felt so refreshing to dine at a restaurant that took presentation so seriously. Equally impressive were all the amazing flavors that danced around my palate. I am not easily impressed but this food completely blew me away. These are 5 star quality dishes that I would expect to find in a fine dining establishment. For what I ate, the prices were extremely reasonable. I wouldn't mind even paying more for what I had. 

My utmost compliments to the chef. The flavors here have changed for the better and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I hate to buck the trend, since I have no doubt the Cultured Pearl is a fabulous dining experience. Unfortunately I did not stay after our server, who was very pleasant, informed us they were not serving alcohol the remainder of the night, and probably the rest of the weekend. We appreciated the notice and took our business elsewhere.

An AZ Liquor Control Board infraction is the only thing this could be, which must have occurred just before we had arrived because everyone else was nursing drinks.

There is no excuse for this. Lack of training, and ignorance of liquor laws is a lethal combination for any restaurant, and particularly one in an area of such a young demographic. Loss of revenue plus fines. Ouch!

I will hopefully improve my rating after my next visit, but in the meantime, this 1-star review will serve as a reminder of what happens when you get lazy and don't abide by principles."}
{"text":"We went to the old pearl frequently and the food and service were getting worse with each visit so I was super hesitant to take my family back Friday night. We were SO surprised. The food, drink, and service were wonderful. The new layout is awesome with the small stage in the center. The night we went was a live jazz band with a piano and singer. We loved the background music and it wasn't too loud. Darryl did an excellent job serving. We left raving about it. Only regret is no brown rice."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so nice. We went for my friends birthday and left impressed. The bartender recommended the best rolls and drinks. Love the band and new set up. Must try!!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of the pearl before but I love this place now. So classy and it's a great set up. They also have live music pretty much every night and the band tonight was a great jazz band."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, our waitress was incredible and I wish I could remember her name now but she was an attractive blonde in her mid thirties (?). 
Great decor and the music was happening right in front of us-very good vibe and loved the avocado margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant / social club with great food and fun. You have to check this out"}
{"text":"It is trendy and the music is good, but I found the menu to be limited and overpriced. It is okay, but I have had better sushi at two-thirds the price."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Pearl all the time, so I was excited to check out the new place! It has been completely remodeled and is absolutely beautiful. Very upscale with a great decor, layout, and general feel - big piano in the middle of the room for live music too. I had the blue drink (I forget the name.. first one on the menu) and loved it! Highly recommend garlic soy edamame too! The fish on the sashimi didn't seem to be as high quality as I have had other places. But I did enjoy the spicy Pocket Rocket specialty roll. A spot definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Awesomeness!  Fantastic menu and great atmosphere.  Super energy and food is to die for."}
{"text":"This place is delicious the ginger creme brul√© is amazing  the shrimp cocktail is also really good but only enough for one person and the  deep v roll is freaking awesome"}
{"text":"From the delicious and creative menu to the exquisite and intricate design to the hot and captivating entertainment, the Cultured Pearl is Scottsdale's answer for the grown and sexy to mix, mingle or just chill."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to get our drinks. My date's entree was served 15 minutes before any other food. Took 45 minutes to get the rest of the food, after being asked twice what we ordered. Our appetizer was served after we finished the whole meal. While we were eating, a couple people at the table right next to us were smoking cigarettes. It definitely interfered with the taste of our food and was generally bothersome. In their defense, they were short staffed and apologetic. They comped our drinks from our bill, which was only equivalent to $7.00. OK food, bad service. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"We had a table of 20 come in for my friends birthday, I made the reservation the day prior and they were very friendly about it. The day of I got a call a couple hours before asking if we wanted to start with any food so it could be ready when we got there... I thought that was very awesome of them even though I declined the offer... When we got there they sat our group around the piano, a little awkward seating for 20 just because everyone was sitting apart but we dealt with it fine. The service was awesome and the wait staff was more than patient and friendly. They even honored coupons we had from the website which was great... I love that they kept some of the original sushi rolls on the menu... There was a singer there and she was great I believe her name was Vanessa she entertained the entire group! Overall we had a great experience. Even though I love the laid back style of the old Pearl... I'll take the better service... I hope this place doesn't let there standards drop because I know my friends and I have and had bitter experiences at the old Pearl and we've walked out because of horrible service a couple times. but yeah keep it up guys! #EndRant"}
{"text":"What a great place! I love the atmosphere, I love the ambience, I love everything about this place. This place is just too cute. Very romantic as well, The way the setup is. 

And what?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? There's live music playing while eating sushi? The guy on the piano was amazing.

My waiter was so patient with me, of course I had millions of questions about the vegetarian menu, and what was good, what was his recommendation. And what was his favorite. All the above. Etc. Haha.. I ordered the hamatchi popper and the rice crispy rolls.( Of course vegetarian) it was delicious!!!!!! The sauce on the Hamatchi was delightful, if you love spicy. GET IT!!!! and the flavor on par! The presentation... O_O it was too pretty to eat. Haha :) and the rice crispy, it speaks for itself. It was nice crispy. Haha ;D

Overall. This place was exquisite. I would definitely dress up and have date night here. Even though it says casual. The menu had a great selection and the price was reasonable. Everything was wonderful. 

The reason why I gave it a four star because we ordered the edamame....... and it came out last. Instead of a starter. Booo.. I was so full then. :( it's okay. I still love it. 

I'll be back for sure!!!! :D"}
{"text":"I didn't know where to go last night for my 25th birthday so I left it up to yelp to find a highly rated place, I ended up going here and feel in love! This place is absolutely beautiful and the service was amazing, Erin went above and beyond to accommodate our first time here. Food and drinks were amazing. I'd highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place and have really been wanting to try it. Last time I was here it was only called Pearl and was completely different. 

I loved it! I ordered the Rice Krispy roll. If I remember correctly, it comes with cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce, and salmon I believe. For drinks, I ordered the Hibiscus Cosmo. It comes with vodka, sake, and a hibiscus syrup that makes it very flavorful. 

The best thing about this place was the ambiance. You walk in and you get the elegant, classy feel to it. The way they have it set up, there's a piano right in the middle,  and tables all around the room. The guy who played the piano was amazing. It's such a great date spot AND they also have happy hour! Our waiter was great, sociable, friendly and very knowledgeable. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another failed business by Tammy and her silent partner husband.  All of their eating establishments last about a year & go under like the Blue Wasabi,  the Star Spangled Grille (lasted 6 months),  Too bad because  sushi was good though even if a bit overpriced.  I think Tammy needs to find another line of work though!"}
