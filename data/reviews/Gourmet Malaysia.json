{"text":"Friendly owner who even sang a karaoke when he found out my dad and aunt where from Malaysia. The rendang could have been better but the roti cannai was wonderful. The Pulut Hitam and Ice Kacang were some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"In a city where malaysian food is so hard to find - I really wanted to like this place. I didn't.

We arrived at 1120 and were the only people in the restaurant - it took 20min for someone to take our order. One waitress was vacuuming and others scurrying were around taking care of a large catering order.

Having rarely eaten Malaysian since arriving in Canada 18mo ago we were excited and ordered 3 dishes:

1. Har mee (prawn noodles) - only cooked on the weekends - must be special!
- it looked great, 3 large prawns, a big bowl, thick noodles
- unfortunately the soup was so watery with little prawn flavour it could have just been instant noodles

2. Mee Siam. When this came out I was like, wow, has it been so long since I've eaten Mee Siam that I've forgotten what it was???

So I wikipedia'd it to check if my memory was faulty:

Mee Siam , () which means \"Siamese noodle\", is a dish of thin rice noodles (vermicelli) in spicy, sweet and sour light gravy.

No, my memory was correct. The dish that was served was basically fried bee-hoon (thin noodles) with some tasteless watery gravy - slightly sweet but certainly not spicy, not sour. My wife suggested it was sweet chilli sauce, but bottled sweet chilli sauce would have tasted better.

3. Roti chanai with chicken curry

Finally something that tasted authentic. Given the other 2 dishes I was worried the roti would be microwaved. Instead it was light and crispy. They curry was also great - it's not too spicy and pretty much like what my family makes. Chicken was tender and fell off the bone.

Unfortunately 1 out of 3 is a fail. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I have been there about five times.
I always felt that the service there was bad.  Food was okay so I kept going back to this restaurant but from the service we had last time, I will not go back there again. 
Waitress had no clue of the food even we ordered from the menu.  They brought us wrong food and insisted that this was the one we ordered. 
They took long time to serve food. 
Dessert was not good at all. 
I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I entered the restaurant, and it was not love at first sight: the atmosphere was depressing and gloomy. I reluctantly took a seat at one of their tables. When I looked at the menu, I saw a whopping 300 items - a bad sign if Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares had taught me anything. Nonetheless, and after careful deliberation, I ordered the Chicken Satay, veggie roti, Indonesian fried rice, and garlic calamari. 

The satay chicken was fine, but uninspiring. The veggie roti tasted like it was reheated, and the curry was barely palatable. 

The Indonesian fried rice was bad: it was atrociously sweet, and lacked even the slightest hint of savoury flavour. The calamari was like chewing on rubbery breading: it was more salty than the Dead Sea, with absolutely unredeemable flavour.

The service is fine, although I nonetheless strongly advise against dining here."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! According to a family friend from Malaysia, they are very authentic as well. 

My family and I haven't been very impressed by the Chinese/Chinese-inspired dishes, though, so we do tend to just stick to the Malay stuff (and curry!) :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Malaysian food restaurant in Toronto.  I was introduced to this place by the Chair of the Chinese Malaysian Association in 2011.  Have taken many friends here to try this place since.  All have loved it!!!!   Was there 3 times in December.  I grew up with Malaysian food, so for the longest time, no restaurants in Toronto satisfied that authentic taste & dishes I was looking for until I tried this place.  The teh terek, roti canai, mango salad, kang kung belanchan, chili fried crab, chili fried lobsters, laksa, mee goreng, etc are all delicious.  Their teh terek & ice kachang are also very authentic.  GM have very friendly staff & the dishes are priced reasonably. They now have a stage & a function room which can hosts private events.  Was there last on December 27th, 2012.  That night, they had a private function, so only a few tables were available for other guests. We were lucky that we had made a reservation for 12 people that evening.  Although we were seated in rather cramp conditions, the good food made up for it."}
{"text":"If you like clean cutlery and table cloths this is not the place to go but the food is worth it. Very flavourful but they mean spice!"}
{"text":"Tried their Char Kway Teow, Prawn Mee, Rojak and couple other dishes but not quite of fan of their food.  Gave them 3 chances but each time we tried, it failed our tastebud. If you say they serve Singapore food, I don't think it's even close, as I'm an ex-Singaporean."}
{"text":"We went there last night for dinner.  We ordered an appetizer $19.99, a chicken coconut curry rice $7.88,and a bowl of laksa $7.88.   The portion and the food quality are good.   We will defnitely return for their food.   My only complaint is the waitress didn't ask if we wanted to pack the remaining food before they took away and they are lack of food allergy knowledge."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Roti is light and crispy. Everything in the shrimp and praen menu is right on. One of the top Malaysian restaurants in Toronto. Owner Yummy is extremely friendly. Family owned and operated. Try it!"}
{"text":"Delicious south east Asian dishes. Definitely try the roti, which are crisp on the outside and fluffy within. 
Mee goreng noodles are a crowd pleaser. 

Service is below average but the food makes up for it. 

MSG is present but not prevalent.

There's also a small 'shopping' section near the cash. The Durian flavoured Thai coconut roll is delicious. It comes in a medium sized chip bag. It's a gateway drug to the real fruit."}
{"text":"The Lasa and curry Rotti are very good and authentic I love to come here when I m craving for Malaysia Food I will recommend to my friend"}
{"text":"After deciding to launch the restaurant from the food court shop, the experience and food has definitely dropped the ball. The set deals aren't really that worth it, and the food wait is sometimes too long. I recently went in to try their set menu for $36.

You get: 6 chicken satay (which is still good, but peanut sauce is runny). 6pcs chicken wing (nothing special), King Prawn with garlic(deep fried) and it def is frozen shrimp, king oyster mushroom with lady's finger (okra) with belachan sauce (This was basically boiled veggies whole that weren't cut, and sauce dumped on top of it) NOT GOOD! Hot N Sour Soup which was very thick and spicy (Not a good soup, but portion size is good), and Ice Cream (Norm).

This place is hit n miss for sure. Better to risk it in the food court, at least you don't have to tip and wait as long for the food!"}
{"text":"Check your takeout order BEFORE you leave the restaurant.  I ordered an extra bowl of Hainan Rice in addition to the Hainanese Chicken on Rice. They charged me for it but did not put it in. Not happy with their sloppy service."}
{"text":"I'm Malaysian and I'm so glad we found this place. Food was authentic & delicious. We had nasi lemak, char kuey tiao, roti canai, ABC and teh tarik. Service was good. There ample parking space, restaurant is spacious & clean. Will definitely return.
They sell Maggi Mee & Sambal ikan bilis there too. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"We went as a group of 13 people. Food was alright, satisfying. We went for an anniversary celebration.
The experience was awesome. We were eating, half way to finishing when suddenly we hear Gangnam Style on a Dance game(unsure which one). Some kids and their families went on the stage and was just having fun and taking pictures. After they left, the owner came out and changed to karaoke and offered us to sing. None of us did so he chose a song and sang for us.  Then a group of us did decide to sing together. Afterwards, he sang for the anniversary couple as they danced on stage. It was just a great and fun experience. 

We are from Maryland, USA visiting. We will definitely come back when we come back to Canada. =)"}
{"text":"This Malaysian restaurant is pretty hyped up so I had to try it. I've gone here several times and always leave pretty satisfied. 

The Indians' love this place since it has a hakka flavour, good spices, and a huge selection of roti dishes. 

I would say my favourite are the Seafood Scrambled Egg Chow Fun and the Laksa; top notch! I've had several of their other dishes as well, they were okay, not as flavourful as I would like -- but that's just my preference!"}
{"text":"So disappointed... please never book an event here and expect it to actually happen. I just encountered the ultimate in customer service failures here.We booked a place for our xmas party and I came into to put in a deposit and finalize details as I was directed to do... Only when I got there I found out the venue had been booked after us and we were bumped. ... What I was told was \"I called and there was no answer so we cancelled.\"
So no message, no notice, we let the phone ring and there was no answer so we cancelled? what the????"}
{"text":"We ordered Hainanese chicken rice, Assam laksa, chicken and beef satay, Nasi lemak, char kuay teow and as dessert we ordered durian ice.

Three of us who were born in Malaysia all agreed that the flavour of the dishes weren't authentic, except for chicken satay and durian ice.

Durian ice is surprisingly good. Must try if you are there."}
{"text":"Had an early lunch at 11am on Saturday. We came here after reading so many good reviews here.

Ordered three items: Chicken satay (6cps), Fried Hor Fun w/Mixed seafood & Hainanese Chicken on Rice.

Chicken satay: 6 sticks of deep fried chicken. That's bad. The chicken should have been grilled on bbq fire. Satay sauce is regular and taste OK. Price is $6.80 for 6 sticks.

Fried Hor Fun w/Mixed seafood: Small dishes for $7.80. Hor fun is OK. Seafood (3 shrimps & few pieces of fish cake) was hidden in the bottom of plate. The chef did not know how to decorate a dish! Taste bland. 

Hainaese Chicken: very very disappointed. Chicken was not fresh, taste like yesterday. Taste bland. No dish presentation at all. The chicken was sitting on top of soy sauce! Small dishes for $7.80. 

Service is not efficient. No lunch special on weekend but they showed a flash sign about their lunch special on the window. It's not a big deal for us. 

My plan was to try the roti. The server said it was not available any more. 

Parking lot is terrible. There is a music school in the same building. Many parents  are dropping off/picking up their kids. 

Overall, expensive lunch for sub-standard food. It should be 0.0 to 0.5 star."}
{"text":"High recommend. 

pros
-very reasonably priced
-roti is a must and curry
-karoke bar can be good or bad....
-good value of food for money

cons
-ambience is alright. kinda feels like a dining hall
-service could be better"}
{"text":"This place is so dirty - the chairs have stains on them, I was afraid to leave my coat on the chairs.

Now that's out of the way, the food - I went to Singapore before and was craving some Hainan Chicken and Bak Kut Teh. When I found a Malaysian restaurant that have Singapore food as well, I thought I would try it out.

They do not have Bak Kut Teh when I asked, so I ordered the Hainan Chicken, and some salt & pepper shrimp (as it was cheap) and some veggies. 

Hainan Chicken was in fish sauce, big no no. In Singapore, the Hainan Chicken was not in fish sauce. If I wanted fish, I would have ordered it. The dish did come with cucumbers - that part is authentic. But nothing else is authentic.

The shrimp was very salty, the veggies were okay.

I guess I have to go back to Singapore for real Singapore food, this is just the worst ever imitation."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Decent food.
 
They are still in \"food court\" mode. The service is pretty bad, in that they are clueless as to how to serve at a restaurant. Basically, I could not order dishes by name, and only by number. This caveat was insisted upon several times. The girl who took our orders took 4 or 5 attempts to write it down (it was only 2 dishes), because somehow the paper kept slipping from her hand/palm. Most of the serving staff cannot converse in English (nor Mandarin), except for the manager and a Malaysian waitress. So if you know Cantonese, it would be smoother sailing. Hilarious because Malaysians do know English. My malay was barely rudimentary so I did not try it."}
{"text":"I have read lots of positive reviews on Yelp and friends recommendation to try out this restaurant. The food was alright, no \"wow\" or \"best\" factor.

I ordered the Mee Gorang, Hainanese Chicken and Beef with satay sauce. Nothing is wrong with the taste but it wasn't the best I had either. Tamrind Hill Malaysian Restaurant in Vancouver would score higher in the taste category than Gourmet.

Gourment Garden has a karaoke night which I found out unexpectedly, and there was a smoke alarm that went off for half an hour as well.

The staff gave us a 10% discount for the next visit due to the persistent annoying alarm ring. The intention is good however I'm not sure if that is a good customer retention strategy since my first impression was annoyed by the alarm, I don't think 10% off the next visit will make me come back.

The staff is very nice and apologetic regarding the alarm and poor singing from karaoke bar. That's brownie points!"}
{"text":"Love the amazing flavors. The stingray in banana leaves was awesome. You have to eat the bones and all... The bones has a delicious gelletan texture. Also,  the curry was on point! I find their curry similar to thai curry....more coconutty with a hint of lime leaves. Very refreshing...  Dessert was awesome too. Love the multicoloured dessert! Only thing I wish they had was beer... Awesome food like this deserves some awesome beverages!!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Malaysia is the most authentic Malaysian restaurant I've been so far. It is a must go restaurant, each time our family visits Toronto. We highly recommend the nasi lemak, roti canai, curry laksa and so much more... Every time we wanted to try so many delicious dishes but unfortunately our stomach don't have enough places..."}
{"text":"I love this place, decent place to have a meal. It's affordable, quick, and value-for-money. It's an alternative to nearby One-2-snack. Both of them are equally good.

Recommendation: Rojak, Laksa, Nasi Lemak Set (with curry chicken, ikan bilis, and peanut)."}
{"text":"Oyster omelette - YUM!  Roti is one of the best in town and the Singapore Lahksa is very nice as well."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday night as a group of 6. The place wasn't that busy which was nice. 

Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing (fried rice, chilli chicken, soup and a beef dish) or maybe I prefer their neighbour (Asian legend) but this place, while economical, was not great. 

The meat portions were small and I second a previous comment with respect to the voluminous menu. I am one of those people that wonder how a restaurant can be \"specialized\" when they serve more than 200 dishes!

Allow me to simply sum the experience thusly: the first year university student who lives on campus and doesn't cook didn't want the left overs."}
{"text":"Excellent

Laksa is not on the lunch menu, but it comes out first. Other items that should have been faster like the Hainan Chicken Rice came out last. Strange but just to let others know, don't shy from ordering it for lunch if you're pressed for time. 

Everything is good and authentic. Lunch service was quick and the Satay came out surprising fast, especially compared to their old takeout place across the street."}
{"text":"This was my first Malaysian restaurant. Liked the roti canai and Lusaka. Called my order in advance and picked it up as I heard the wait while dining in the restaurant can be long.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Truly delighted! Came here last night for dinner on Yelp's recommendation because I suddenly had this massive craving for Singaporean/Malaysian/Indonesian food. Before coming here, I used to think that Restoran Malaysia (located in Richmond Hill) was the best place in the GTA for Malaysian/Indonesian type foods, but after last night's visit, I can bravely say that Gourmet Malaysia is just as good -- if not better!   

-----Food: Great!------ 
Penang Char Kwei Teow     --      At first, I was pretty skeptical of the dish, since it looked more like the Cantonese 'Stir Fried Rice Noodle with Beef', but was I ever wrong! The stir-frying techniques may be similar when preparing the dish, but the ingredients are way different. Unlike many restaurants that rip you off with a mouthful of rice noodles, the dish had a large array of shrimp, calamari, bean sprouts and fish cakes that balanced the noodles. The flavouring itself was done well, without making the noodles taste too salty or bland.   

Indonesian Fried Rice     --     Very flavourful, unlike the ones that I have eaten in the past, this dish has a very distinct taste to it. Apparently, it's a type of special spice or sauce that local Indonesians & Malaysians use to cook. Either way, I found that it complimented the rice well. Again, the rice did not seem too salty at all and was completed with a spark of spiciness in each spoonful.  

Roti Cannai (Chicken Curry)     --     As a huge curry/roti fan, I was very happy with this dish. Usually, restaurants charge you separately for the roti and the curry, and the curry would usually be stinging hot. Here, the curry has a very strong, flavourful aroma, from there on I knew I was on to something. The curry wasn't watery and carried a faint coconut taste, and best of all, was NOT hot at all. So to anyone who cannot take the spiciness in curry--this is the one for you! The roti was nice and warm (very flaky) when it was brought out, providing a nice dipping palette for the curry.  

Special Gourmet Malaysia Platter     --     Love, love, love, love, love! The platter offered a variety of things to eat, so it was the perfect choice when we couldn't decide which appetizer to order. My favourite were the chicken/beef skewers and the mango salad. Very authentic peanut sauce to accompany the skewers. The skewers in turn had no char in sight and were not over-the-top chewy. The Mango salad is to die for -- tangy, zesty and very addicting!    

Nonya Kuih     --     Coconut Fanatic would be what I'd translate it to. If you have never tried these before, this is the place to go. The sweets are chewy, elastic-y and have the strong coconut goodness in them. Brownie points for making them mildly sweet. 

Buboh Cha Cha     --     I have to admit that this was the only thing that I didn't enjoy as much. In my opinion, it looked and tasted like baby porridge with its mashed sweet potatoes, beans and yams. On the other hand, my parents loved it, noting its slight sweetness and how easy it was to consume.   

-----Atmosphere: Moderate-----
One major point that I have to make was how dim the whole restaurant was. I'm not sure if they were: a) saving on electricity b) creating a romantic mood c) recreating an authentic South Eastern eatery with the realistic lighting effects. Overall, I can't complain much because I could't really distinguish the interior of the restaurant (and the visual colouring of the food) due to the poor lighting, but I was comfortable throughout my meal. 

-----Service: Alright-----
To my surprise, the servers weren't all that bad. Generally speaking, they were polite, fast and informative. I was slightly bothered that they served our appetizers last after all the main dishes were distributed. But the desserts took way too long to arrive. We had to wait at least a good 10 minutes for the pre-made Nonya Kuih and an additional 5 minutes for the lukewarm Buboh Cha Cha, which was also pre-made. I not exactly sure what took them so long to serve the pre-made desserts -- is it really that hard to place the sweets onto a plate and spoon the sweet soup into a bowl? 

*----- Final Thoughts: ------* 
Happy with this new-found gem, will be back to try the rest of the menu!

{"text":"Me and my family went yesterday around 7:30 pm for dinner. As we entered, there were two parties going on that day. We got a table right beside the door and were given our menus. We were waiting about 15 - 20 minutes and had to call a waiter over in order to place our order. I believe they forgot about us due to the party that was happening. We had asked for water with no ice but the waiter had brought us boiling water.  We had ordered  roti (3 piece) with chicken curry, and Mei Goreng with chicken only and Mei Goreng with shrimp only. The food was alright. There was ONLY 2 pieces of Chicken and shrimp in the Mei Goreng.  I would not say it was the best that I have eaten. There was too much crowd waiting at the door watching us eat which made us feel a little awkward.  I most likely will not go again to this restaurant due to the poor service and little quality food."}
{"text":"Good food! I ordered a takeout the other day and the portion was HUGE! I got the mee goreng yellow noodles and it was really good! My friend got the hainanese chicken on rice... tasted a good but not exactly our taste. Anyway... a good place for food,  and I definitely recommend the mee goreng noodles! You guys should check it out!"}
{"text":"I always go here if I want some Malaysian/Indonesian food. Their laksa, roti cannai with curry, ikan bakar, and their other food in general are really delicious.

I went with a few non-South East Asian friends recently and they were taken aback by the variety of food in the menu. However, they ended up liking everything we ordered and found them to have their own distinct tastes."}
{"text":"came here with my husband on Saturday for late lunch...first we order satay chicken,fried omelet. satay chicken and fried omelet was ok, we have had better satay chicken in different restaurant..for drinks i ordered mango bubble tea,which was too bad..any food court\"s bubble tea shop makes way better than that...for main course we order fried vermicelli with shrimp and nasi goreing fried rice (recomended by the server). vermicelli with shrimp only had 6 shrimps,taste was ok..BUT the nasi goreing fried rice smells like raw fish.we literally couldn't eat that at all.we requested the server to replace it..but inlplace of replacing it thay charged us 15% for table charges (because they are quiet sure they are not gone get any tip). 

DEFINATELLY NOT GOING BACK THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"I've been to Indonesia four times and was craving Indonesian food like nobody's business last week so I went with my parents to see if we could perhaps make this our regular place. Sadly, the low quality of ingredients used, the small portions and the half hour wait time left us dissatisfied. We ordered the nasi lemak which was okay but could have been more flavourful. We also ordered the beef rendang which was presented on a small side dish platter and was mostly tendon rather than meat. For dessert, I had the martabak which was the best part of the meal. Needless to say, it seems I will have to keep looking for a place to satisfy my Indonesian food cravings."}

Quality: 80%

Food quality has improved in the last year or so especially after they moved into this much larger space (from food court to a proper restaurant).

It is one of the best places to get Malaysian food, value wise it's better than Restoran Malaysia but RM is more upscale."}
{"text":"The curry is good . The amount of chicken/vegetables is minimal . But for $7.99 lunch special that comes with a soup and a drink (too sweet ice tea or regular tea) it's difficult to beat. 

They don't honour any discounts for checking in Yelp."}
{"text":"The service at the new restaurant is terrible. The waiters just simply don't care.  The food at the new restaurant is also quite bad.  After eating there last night I went to the old location in the food court across the street and was happy to discover that they are still there.  The food court food is far superior and authentic, unlike at the new restaurant.  The owners need to train their staff properly or fire them all."}
{"text":"Heard so much about it but didn't think such Malaysian restaurant is possible in Scarborough. Owner Yummy (yes that's his name) is the friendliest Asian man I have ever met. His wife is the chief. Great curry and rotie  . This is the real deal not run by hong kong or mainland Chinese. Very clean and big dining hall.
The curry lamb was very good.
Satay was excellent.
Just wish they offer chicken white meat instead of dark for all chicken dishes!
Price was reasonable. 
They offer weekly lunch specials too."}

{"text":"We were trying to go to the food court location across the street but it looks like it's closed now. We went to the restaurant location instead. Service wise it's your standard asian service, we had to flag down a server to order and flag a server for hot sauce etc. Before we got there I had already decided we were getting the Singapore Laksa and the Char Kwai Teow but for some reason when we were there I hesitated and ordered the Singapore Laksa and House Special Chili Beef instead. I had major regret about the Chili Beef, it was just okay, everything about it was just okay. The Laksa was really good, except that I wish it came with a thicker egg noodle. All in all it was a disappointing meal, we will not be back. One 2 Snacks is just down the road, I highly recommend you go there instead for take out. The prices are so much better and the portion sizes are much larger - the only issue they're only open Thursday-Sunday; breaks my heart."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is one of the better Malaysian restaurants in the city.  The food and the service is great, but the crowd kind of gets to me.  During the dinner hours, you can get a hoard of people waiting to be seated and there are tables right next to the waiting area.  That gets to me because I would not want to have a family stand right next to my table as I eat.  But if you're not seated in the 4 to 5 tables next to the entrance, you are good to go and enjoy your experience.

{"text":"I don't know many Malaysian Singaporean restaurants so this is the only place i come for Malaysian food. This place is big, a casual atmosphere great for families. 

Their food is delicious! I am never disappointment. You must be a fan of spice here. Almost everything here is spicy and very authentic.

I had dinner here last night:
#5 Poh Pia which was a rolled crepe inside mixed veggies and topped with some chili and other sauces. This was a great warm appetizer for $3.80.

#33 Roti cannai which was chicken curry (or you can choose beef curry) and it comes with 3 pieces of Roti $6.99. I love it. the roti was so flaky, crispy and not oily at all. yum!

#192 Mee Goreng yellow noddle with seafood in Sambal sauce. First bite in to this and it was such a familiar taste. It taste exactly like the sauce in pad thai! Just not rice noddles, but yellow thick egg noodle (shape like spaghetti). I love sour, spicy, sweet all in this dish.

I will definitely try new dishes next time."}
{"text":"\"Dip the roti in the brain.\"

We went here on a Monday night and got a seat no problem. 

What we ordered:

*Chicken Satay
*Roti Canai with Chicken Curry
*Nonya Fried Crabb
*Mee Goreng Yellow Noodles
*Penang Assam Laksa

Overall, everything was delicious, but the best was the Nonya Fried Crab.  Not cheap at $28.99, BUT it was huge, it was spicy, savoury, meaty and the brain!  Oh the brain in that shell was divine.  Since we didn't order rice, my sister came up with the genious idea to \"Dip the roti in the brain!\".  Good idea.  

Everything really was delicious, but when I go back, I'll be nixing the penang assam laksa and ordering another laksa instead--the flavour was interesting, salty, sour, spicy, but of everything that we ordered, this was the only thing leftover almost in its entirety.  

I don't know why everyone's complaining about the service; we had amazing service, swift and with a smile.  When we bought the Malaysian pop in the cooler, the waiter explained to us what it tastes like (fanta but milky), and why it's popular in Malaysia (helps to cool them down when it's hot).  Try it-I forgot the name, it's the only pop in the cooler at the front."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed visiting this restaurant for the first time. 

There are a LOT of items on the menu....despite being named \"Gourmet Malaysia\", there are a lot of food from other cuisines, especially Chinese. 

The chicken and beef skewers were...okay...nothing special.  

The beef in the curry was a bit tough, seems like they weren't really marinated or cooked with the curry.

Maybe I will give this another try...if I really can't find anything else to eat."}
{"text":"Went there about 8 yrs ago, it was great everything. But, was there recently last week with Bf & everything went bad. Ordered 4 dishes: beef & veggie (called sour bitter melons dish), seafood delites fried rice dish, Chinese broccoli dish.  A taro bubble tea drink. Informed them with the nec. Food sensitivities & asked them to add extra minced fresh ginger & other items & spices to still obtain the desired tastiness I desired.  
They came in terribly short in portion size( worst than other restos even with The High Food Prices of this year )
   The quality of food ingredients have degraded horribly. eg. Rice was tiny broken grains. Dishes were not tasty except for large amts. of requested ginger. It seems too many on staff for such a small Resto. Only redeeming factor is they are friendlier that night. Only half of the Resto was filled. The other half was reserved for a wedding engagement. The seat covers were covered in expensive wedding material adornment. The broccoli was fresh and crispy as usual. But, dishes too pricey for what you pay for. Not my cup of tea. Ttbill $40w/t&t.  
   By the way, I did get upset stomach that night & next day."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice.  This restaurant has been open for about half a year.  The first visit when 2 of us go into the restaurant two-third empty and asking for the sofa seat but is not given.  Then after 5 minutes another 2 come in and has the sofa seat.  Although we are the first time customer, I cannot see why there is such a different treatment.  I can see that the waiter talk to them in their local dialect. We order a mild Singapore Laksa and the Chicken Roti Prata.  The Singapore Laksa is good but next time we will try out another Laksa recommended to be better.  The Roti is one of a kind.  This is by far the best Roti I have in Toronto so far.

The next visit I bring the whole family over.  I book a table a day before.  My reservation cannot be found.  I need a big table.  I talk to several waiters and the manager Yummy and they find out that the waiter taking my reservation the day before is a new hire.  He did not stick the reservation sheet to the counter.  So we request it to be resolved.  However given most of the big tables are empty, we are left alone with everyone standing at the entrance waiting for more than 35 minutes.  I cannot see why they cannot give us any of the empty tables available.  We have to complain to the lady owner. Then one of the only 2 big tables foots the bill before we are served to that table while at least 6 big tables are still empty.  As this is a special invitation to my family to try out the Malaysian and Indonesian food, I am a bit forced to stay.  

We order an appetizer platter, Chicken Satay, Chicken Roti Prata, Indonesian Laksa, Fried Rice, Belacan sauce fried vege.  The Roti is still the best.  The Laksa is a bit sour but has a different taste than the Singapore Laksa.  The platter is good to try out different combination of appetizers like shrimp cake, fish cake and the like.  The lady owner is kind enough to give us a complimentary iced fruit plate.

Overall the food is good but the service needs to have a big improvement.  We may not give it a third chance.  By the time when we pay for our bill, 2 of the empty big tables remain empty the whole evening.  What a joke!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a mainstay for toronto malay food. That being said its a bit of a shame considering the lack of competition that it faces. the authenticity of the food is pretty on, though some of the dishes are sub standard. I was nota  fan of their nasi lemak and their indonesian dishes are only okay, definitely not something to bbm home. 

If travelling isn't your thing, then gourmet malaysia is a decent choice, though given the chance this yelper would definitely chose a home cooked meal back in indonesia or going to malyasia directly."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the satay, nasi goreng, mee goreng, hor fun, penang laksa, roti chanai with curry. The nyonya snacks were good too. Abit pricey though."}
{"text":"I had their chicken rice, it was good! A bit overpriced for Asian food that you can get at other places.

Service is ok"}
{"text":"Good menu selection and it took us a few extra minutes to decide what to order with many dishes to choose from.  The food came to the table quickly and the servers were responsive."}
{"text":"This was our first time having Malaysian food and the waitress asked me if I liked shrimp paste.  I said no but for some reason whatever she recommended had a generous amount of it.  It was so gross.  I'm Filipino so I'm familiar with the taste of shrimp paste buy this was taken to a whole new level.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Probably the best Malaysian food in the GTA, slightly better than Restoran Malaysia with a slightly larger menu.

Singapore Laksa- great, better than R. M.'s
Nasi Lemak- good
Apam Balik- good
Crispy Squid w/ Salt and Garlic Chili- great
Banana Leaf Grilled Stingray- great

At Gourmet Malaysia you will get food that is slightly tastier (than at R.M.) and a lot cheaper. It may seem amusing at first that the nice owner calls himself \"Yummy\" on his business card, but it is easy to understand as this place is GREAT. Portions are fine. It would be very hard to find better food for the price."}
{"text":"Food and service was slightly below mediocre. I would give them 2.5, if I could. Restaurant is large but not that busy on a weeknight, yet three waiters/waitresses were available and one of our orders was still forgotten because she was busy. Regardless, I was expecting more from the food and it just didn't impress. I ordered green curry chicken and felt it was lacking in flavor/spice. Fiancée got Laksa and it was mediocre, at best. We've had an instant noodle version of this dish from T&T and that was much more tasteful. 10% discount for checking in via Yelp is a great idea. It's a shame to say, but I doubt I would come back or recommend the place"}

I love Malaysian food! It's just too bad there aren't many malaysian restaurants in downtown, we have to travel all the way uptown. One night, my friend and I decided to check out Gourmet Malaysia which seemed to have many approvals of Malaysians I know in Toronto.

Gourmet Malaysia is just like any large Chinese restaurant. Seatings are kind of random and scattered throughout- with tables, booths and round tables.
It was busy when we walked in, but we ended up standing around for good 4~5 minute before anyone came to encourage our presence. At restaurants in downtown? unthinkable!! In uptown and at asian restaurants? it's frustrating but very understandable.

After we were finally seated, I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted to order. I wanted to order everything and their menu was huge!
After my excitement died down a bit, I narrowed it down to few items I just needed to try.

Ordered: Mango salad with Satay Chicken (#17)

* 6 chicken skewers and mango salad for $9.99
* Mango salad was horrible, it was sliced up mango pieces in sweet chili sauce
* I originally wanted to order lamb skewers (yumm) but they were out so ordered chicken instead
* Chicken skewers were decent, peanut sauce was kind of runny and bland but it was overall good

Ordered: Roti Cannai (#33)

* 3 pieces of roti cannai with choice of chicken or beef curry for $6.99
* Roti Cannai came hot and fresh with a side of beef curry
* They were very buttery and rich tasting compared to ones I had before
* thin layers of roti cannai made it easier to pick up the beef curry goodness
* This was so satisfying and the roti cannais were huge!

Ordered: Hainanese chicken on rice (#231)

* Plate of hainanese chicken and rice for $7.80
* Chicken was served warm (everytime I had it somewhere else, it was served cold?) and it was kind of tough
* I found the pieces to be too big and because of the size, it lacked flavor
* I wish the chicken pieces were smaller and fattier, it almost tasted like weak wine chicken from chinese restaurants
* On the other hand, the rice was so good!
* I could probably eat the rice just by itself, it was one of the best chicken rice I ever had
* I will probably just order the rice as a side, would pass on the chicken

Ordered: Penang prawn mee (#211) (weekend only)

* Bowl of noodle with clear soup served with hard boiled eggs and prawn for $7.80
* Noodles that came with this were like egg noodles
* They were chewy and the consistency was perfect
* I found this to be really bland, I thought the soup will have more flavor
* The soup almost tasted too watered down for me
* This was my first time having this so maybe it's suppose to be like that
* Personally I didn't enjoy it very much

Summary: Dishes were hit or miss at Gourmet Malaysia. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but in terms of authentic flavors and quality, I found it to be quite inconsistent. I loved the flavored rice and even just for that, I would go back to this place. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes (hopefully all Hits next time!)"}
{"text":"Servers were quick and fast. Food came in a timely manner. Ordered curry beef with roti, chicken skewers (got beef instead... waiter heard us wrong I guess but it was still delicious), seafood pineapple fried rice, and Hainanese chicken rice. Out of the four dishes my rankings are:
1. Curry (beef or chicken) with roti - roti is super crispy and flaky. Picks up the curry really well. It was bombs! 
2. Seafood pineapple fried rice - some sweetness and flavourful fried rice. 
3. Hainanese chicken rice - the rice is nbd, nothing special. The hainanese chkcken however super flavourful! I would probably just order the chicken instead of with the rice. Ranked 3rd because the rice didn't stand out. 
4. Beef skewers - I've had better for cheaper..."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place if you are up for trying different cultural food. It has some pretty delicious variety to offer."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. My favorite dish is curry beef. The beef meat is very soft. And with the curry source, the whole dish tastes so delicious! Strongly recommend their curry food. 

The owner 'Yummy' is a very nice guy! And also his wife, very friendly, always smile.  If you have a chance to meet this couple, you will have no wonder how they run the business so successfully. 

Another awesome part of their restaurant is their VIP event room. There's a stage and karaoke machines. It's like real ktv. Maybe even better than ktv, cos you can sing whatever song you want, just ask Yummy to setup his computer and search your favorite song online. LOL  So if you wanna celebrate your birthday or hold any party, it's definitely a good place to go!      

I love the place! Strongly recommend you to experience the incredible Malaysia food and great customer service there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go is Gourmet Garden which is across the street from Gourment Malaysia, until one day while I was enjoying my Singapore Laksa and Chicken satay the owner Yummy came over and started talking with us. He started telling us about the new place Gourmet Malaysia that will be opening across the street and everything about it. Yummy is a super nice guy and has always made me feel welcome at his restaurant and he enjoys hearing what you think of the restaurant and food.
My first visit to Gourmet Malaysia I was greeted by Yummy and he made sure he gave me the grand tour of the restaurant and introduction to the menu. Every time I go the service is friendly, fast, and the food is amazing. I always go with my Malaysian friends and they agree that the food is excellent, even after being back from a recent visit to Malaysia. 
The Belacan Beans are amazing and always come out hot and fresh. One my favorites is Singapore Laksa which always has a good quantity of fish cakes, shrimp and chicken to keep me satisfied. The chicken satay is another favorite and always tastes amazing with the cucumber and onion with each piece of chicken.
Overall I've been very impressed with the service and food of Gourmet Malaysia."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars based solely on my takeout experience. 
My wife being Malaysian Chinese says that this place serves one of the better Hai Nan chicken rice dishes so being in the area that day we decided to grab takeout on our way home. 
In total all we ordered was 2 dishes the Hainan chicken rice and Nasi Lemak which shouldn't have taken long to make (15 minutes maybe 20 minutes max) at a time when the restaurant wasn't even packed. We waited a good 10 minutes before I had to take a deuce (Max 5 minutes) and when I came back we still had to wait a good 15 minutes for our food. 
The problem being they had to send the dishes back twice because they kept getting the order wrong. I appreciate the hostess out front who kept making sure our order was correct but I couldn't believe the kitchen got our order wrong that many times.
Overall the food was great but that was just too long a wait for takeout."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5 on a Friday for lunch. For starters, the place has alot of tables so there is really no need to make reservations during weekday prime time lunch hours, we were seated right away. 

The food was alright and affordable, the restaurant has a $7.99 lunch menu that includes an entree and ice tea. From the lunch menu we ordered the chicken curry roti, hainanese chicken rice and char kuey teow (Malaysian fried noodles). From the regular menu we ordered the stingray and boxing chicken. 

The standout items were the hainanese chicken and stingray. The hainanese rice they used was tasty and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The stingray was a unique experience, I've only tried stingray at this restaurant so it surprised me that the bones were unusually soft compared to other fish, the stingray sauce they gave us also had some real kick to it. 

The only thing that annoyed us was the fact that they did not honor the yelp check in 10% discount. There were no signs on the restaurant that mentioned that other than when we asked and they told us they didn't take those discounts anymore."}
{"text":"The food here is awesomely good  the atmosphere is a bit to desire for, can get crowded at ful capacity becuz it's chairs are all close together"}
{"text":"Had the char Kwai Teow, very good and lots of wok air.

Service was polite and efficient even though it was very busy.  Also had the singapore laksa which was plenty spicy."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I went, it was surprisingly empty. Regardless, the food was great. We got gado gado (contains peanuts), singaporean laksa, and indonesian fried rice. The fried rice could've had more stuff in it though. P.S. Don't expect too much in terms of service. Some of the waiters there seem really bored or indifferent."}
{"text":"Did I tell you how much I love this place? The owner's name is 'Yummy' for fuck sakes, and their food is yummy - isn't that funny? Well, I am convinced that their secret ingredient for their dishes is CRACK because I've become so addicted to this place. 

My bestfriend and I ate here again for the fourth time, (using our hands just like how they do in Malaysia... trust me it makes the food 100 times better). We had their Ikan Bakar (grilled stingray... awesome by the way... worth the 18 bucks); sambal prawns (yuuuuuuum), house special chili beef (meh, its okay but still yummy.. tasted like regular chinese food to me), and their nasi lemak with chicken curry.

Girrrrrrl, I tell you. I cannot get sick of this place. This is my fourth review by the way, and I believe they deserve more stars. Their service has improved as well, especially the fact that the server, i forgot her name, the one in glasses, she remembered me and my girlfriend haha. And really catered to us well. Love this place, please don't ever change."}
{"text":"The only place in the GTA to get Indonesian food. Everything we ate was authentic and great!"}
{"text":"It was my second dinner at this restaurant. I just want to point out that this is my first Malaysian food restaurant ever. I went with my family for both of the times I've been here. It's a big place and didn't have too many people inside when we checked in.

There's not much to talk about the service since I didn't experience anything bad.

It was a little bit expensive than I expected. But the food were tasty. It's been a while since I last visited (it was like last year), but I remembered the lamb curry I got was unfortunately chewy. But the flavours were nice.

I also got the chicken satay. The first time I had it, it tasted really good. But the second time I had it, it was just good. The portion of the chicken satay was small.

I think my favourite was the nasi lemak, which was very fragrant and nothing like I've had before. It came with a bit of meat curry although I don't remember what the meat was, although I do remember that I enjoyed it.

The Hainanese chicken was also pretty good. I didn't like the soup, tho.

My mom chose to get the roti and she really liked it. I was too busy eating the meats so I didn't care for that.

We got other dishes too, but I forgot what they were.

I got the shaved ice for dessert (I forgot the name of it but it was not in English). It was a great choice to finish up.

Overall not a bad experience. But could be better."}
{"text":"This was my first time, and overall, I thought that the food itself was quite decent but the decor and service needed more work. It's a bit of a big place, but somehow the tables are very spread out. As a result, I felt that service was a bit inattentive and it was hard to flag someone down for more water or even to get the bill. The place gives off a really old/dingy feeling that looks like it could use some revamping as it wasn't inviting enough to make me stay longer than I should. 

My recommendation is the Hainanese Chicken on Rice. It was quite delicious and lives up to my standards of the dish. That being said, I found it more oily and saltier than other restaurants. Generally, I found most of the dishes were really loaded up on salt and grease. I think once in awhile, this place would not be a bad choice, but I wouldn't particularly go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"The food here was quickly served after ordering. We ordered the Singapore laksa which was delicious, very authentic and the coconut flavours is emphasized in the curry. It is mildly spicy, and has shrimps in it too. We also ordered the fried squid was thinner, very chunky and nicely spiced. The roti cannoli is a must get here, we went with the chicken but the beef is delicious too. The crunchiness puts a great touch to it and it's so soft. The portions are decent sized and great for several ppl. They have a very authentic and have Asian shows around. The place can be slightly better lit however"}
{"text":"We've been going here for years.
Used to be our favourite South East Asian food, sadly no more :(
Every time we come here, the price is always more, but the quality of food is always worse than last time we were there.
Food is not fresh, they have been re-heated in the microwave.
They also keep changing the food, same name but with lesser quantity and quality.
They charge for tea now.
I guess we'll have to find other place to get our SE Asian foods.
We actually got sick right after eating here, had to use bathroom few times. 
Beware guys!"}
{"text":"Staff offered some great recommendations like the Roti Cannai and we ordered lots of other food that was some of the most authentic Malaysian food I've had. We also had the fried squid w/ sambal sauce, Gado Gado, the special fried rice (which were among the favourites for what we ordered) and some other items. 

Overall, it was a pretty good experience and service was quick and efficient. 
The restaurant wasn't loud (or too crowded) when we went at around 1PM on a weekend."}
{"text":"Since I grew up in Malaysia my expectations are very high for Malaysian restaurants. I would only give a 3 out of 5 for this place."}
{"text":"We returned there for dinner on Saturday night; the menu clearly displays Item No. 34 - 40 available weekend only. We tried to order one of them each time we visited this place; and each time we were told it was not available but never told why. So, we thought we give it another try and order No. 40 but our waitress told us that items No. 34 to 40 are unavailable, again. Maybe it is time to remove those items from the menu if you never plan to serve them to the customers???

We explicitly told our waitress that for our appetizer we wanted the Special Gourmet Malaysia Platter and then for the main course we wanted Beef Rendang, Nasi Lemak Coconut Rice served w/ Curry Chicken, Egg, Peanut & Ikan Bilis, Fried Belacan Bitter Melon, Squid & Kang Kung w/ Peanut Sauce. To our surprise, the Fried Belacan Bitter Melon and the Nasi Lemak came first. Fifteen minutes later, the Beef Rendang, Squid & Kang Kung w/ Peanut Sauce and the Special Gourmet Malaysia Platter finally arrived. What happened to the explicit request about appetizer first and then main courses???

1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent

Special Gourmet Malaysia Platter (1: Poor): fish cakes were cold & rubbery, satays were cold, tough and chewy, cucumber and onions were old & dry, mango salad was too sweet

Beef Rendang (2: OK): a little too dry and for an item w/ one chili on the menu, the spiciness is too mild. This should be a NO chili item. On the salty side; on the scale of 1 to 10, the saltiness is a 7

Nasi Lemak (1: Poor): where is the coconut rice? Substituting it with steamed rice and hoping the customers won't notice it is just unbelievable. The curry chicken is bland. Only 3 pieces of ikan bilis?

Squid & Kang Kung w/ Peanut Sauce (1: Poor): taste ok but the kang kung is too soggy, should have drained the water better before placing it on the plate.

Fried Belacan Bitter Melon (3: Good): finally an acceptable dish but on the salty side. On the scale of 1 to 10, the saltiness is a 7.5

Teh Talik (2: OK): too diluted, barely taste the tea flavor.

Ice Kacang (2: OK): nice attempt for a popular item

Pulut Hitam Black Glutinous Rice w/ Coconut Milk (1: Poor): very little of the black glutinous rice, thickened by corn starch to make up for the consistency, taste bland.

Service (1: Poor): SO SLOW. It is extremely hard to get any of the server attention. I even flagged one of them when she passed by our table; she stared at us, ignored us and walked away. Really? And, you expect us to tip well and come back?

I was born and grew up in Indonesia, and then I lived in Malaysia and Singapore for several years before moving to Canada. And, the more I go to this place the more disappointed I become. Would I come back to Gourmet Malaysia? Maybe? Not because I am impressed with the quality of the food and enjoy the poor service. But because, there are other items on the menu I want to try and the fact that \"real\" Indonesian/Malaysian restaurants are scarce in the Greater Toronto Area and because I am hoping I will find something on the menu which will make me say: YES, this is it, it's the real thing. Or, maybe I shouldn't keep my hope up and just cook them myself at home?"}
{"text":"It's hard to find authentic Malaysia food in GTA, so there is not many comparison. The food here are very tasty but the price are way more expensive than before."}
{"text":"My new favourite casual dining restaurant in town.  My wife and I love Malaysian food, and I'm glad we found this gem.  They have a really cheap lunch specials with large portions, soup, and free iced tea.  Since discovering it, my wife's wanted to come here almost every day for lunch (and she's not even pregnant!).  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Decided to go here on a whim.. glad we did!! It's a massive restaurant that seats at least 70-80 people. They were having some corporate dinner, so half the restaurant was set up in 10-seater round tables. It was kind of distracting to have a good conversation because there was no partition between the corporate dinner and the regular diners. 

Anyway - besides the atmosphere, we ended up ordering one appetizer and two entrees:
- Malaysia Prawn Cake (4 pcs) - these were deep fried fritters topped with one prawn on the top. They were good, but oily. I wouldn't order again. 
- Mango Chicken - this was with shredded mango with chicken - sweet and sour sauce. [this was deep-fried which we think it would be - the mango was very nice, but the chicken was just okay - wouldn't order again]
Chicken, Spicy Sweet & Sour Sauce) 
- Ikan Bilis Crispy King Prawns w/ Coconut Spices [massive, i mean, MASSIVE kind prawns coated in delicious blend of spices and coconut shavings - so delicious!!! - would definitely order again]

Overall, the food wasn't salty (I thought it would be) and the portions were on the generous side! We didn't order any rice - didn't feel the need to. The portions, again, made up for it! The kitchen worked fast and our order came out pretty quickly. Certain menu items do take longer to make and they indicate that on the menu, so that's good! 

At the end, the bill came up to $34 with taxes in. I would definitely try Gourmet Malaysia again because the menu is big and there's lots more to try! Next up, the lobster!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh, if only buttery, warm Roti's were as healthy as water, my life would be complete. I love the roti's here, and with a side of rich curry, I could eat the whole lot.

But that's about it. I am not a fan of dishes heavily laden with sauce so not sure if it's the type of cuisine, or the way they cook it here. The fried whole fish is a waste, as at $18.99, all you get is some sweet and sour sauce and fish meat that is practically non-existent. The fried rice is apparently really good (I didn't try), but my cousin always orders that dish, along with the Omelette with Oysters, Fried Calamari, Fried Tofu, fried..... 

On this particular night, I didn't feel like anything fried, so I just had a small Tom Yum Gong which was all right, but not the best. I had my beloved Roti and I was happy.

My family of 6 and myself decided to chance this place, without reservation, on a Saturday night, prime time. The man told us no reservation, no can do...the place was packed. Luckily enough, when we were outside trying to call other places, the man said he had a booth for us, but it would be tight for 6. We happily snapped the booth up. Lesson - ALWAYS MAKE RESERVATIONS!"}
{"text":"Repeat visit for lunch....and it was just as good

Nonya chicken curry w/rotti: 4.5/5
Nonya fried crab: 4.5/5 beautiful presentation as well. I had to lick the shell clean, the gravy was too yummy to let it go to waste!
Deep fried shredded beef: 3.5/5 not my thing. But my gf liked it. Tasted a bit like candied beef
Black pepper beef: 4/5 

Service: 4/5 friendly and helpful regardless of how busy it was. theyve these funky gadgets where you can buzz them to order, for water, to pay the bill and to even cancel the order. They look like a baby monitor :)

Hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Great place for good food! Mostly spicy if you can't take spices even the \"not so spicy\" dishes are a bit spicier than your regular. But food is very flavourful. Not all dishes are spicy though they also have a selection of Chinese foood. Definitely try all their \"popular items\" aka. suggested items (happy faces) Especially their Malaysian dishes. I love the Ikan Bakar which is a grilled sting ray dish in banana leaf #67 but order way ahead because It takes 25 minutes to make. Also order the Teh Talik milk tea ?? \"pulled tea\" #305. It's delicious and can quench your firey mouth in an instant. Service is decent and decor is unique. A lor of people hold banquets here too. They also sell specialty desserts and snacks near the door to go (eg. Durian jam). Give them a try!"}
{"text":"After a week of craving nasi lemak... Finally got my friend to join me for a late lunch at Gourmet Malaysia (GM).
We arrived around 2pm on Saturday and we were able to sit right away, guess we missed the lunch rush. This was my first time at GM and I already knew what I wanted to order.

- Nasi lemak
- mango salad with satay chicken
- Roti canai with beef curry
- Wintermelon and longan juice
My friend added a pad thai since she wasn't familiar with Malaysian food, but it turned out to be the only one we didn't finish. Our bill came to under $45 including tax n tip. All the traditional malaysian food tasted great... I've had better pad thai.
Service was quick and friendly. The space was pretty big.

Definitely coming back here =D

Update: 5 stars
Stick to the authentic Malay dishes... they're GOLD!!!
Ikan Bakar (grilled stingray) is Awesome!"}
{"text":"Had a pretty good experience at Gourmet Malaysia yesterday evening. 

The Good
- Delicious food
- The most incredible chicken curry roti ever. Fluffy buttery crispy roti that soaked up the curry soooo well
- very nice \"bowl\" shapes
- sheer menu size is good because there are so many options

The Bad
- Really loud
- Strange portion sizes (6 small skewers for $8.50... then an entire meal for $8.50)
- sheer menu size is bad because it can be really hard to decide/navigate what you want

For more information and pictures, feel free to check out my complete blog post on my website located in my yelp profile!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is not great. The waitress weren't friendly.    We didn't receive one of our order until we inquired about it, that happened when we finish our dinner."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  I am born Malaysian, and their food does not come close. The LAKSA comes with such little soup, and they say that's how it's supposed to be. It's OVERPRICED for what they call Malaysian food. The service is horrible, and I'm boycotting this place! I asked them if they cater and they just give me prices straight out of the menu. The curry chicken on rice is a cheap take on thai/penang curry. Better off going to the small mom and pop AUTHENTIC Malaysian (take out) at ONE2SNACK, where the food actually tastes like Malaysian."}
{"text":"Decent option for Scarborough! 

I'm be had some great terry bad Asian food in Scarborough and this place was pretty good. The pad Thai was quite bland, but it wasn't at all greasy, had lots of veggies and was GIANT portion. The ginger chicken was very flavorful and also light. The  steamed garlic veggies were fresh and well done."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend for lunch.  Parking is a bit of a nightmare with the Chinese grocery store behind it.  Food was very good and tasty but we did find a large hair in our soup noodles which was a bit disturbing.  Satay skewers were good as was the Nasi goreng."}
{"text":"At a table of 10 people, the food we ordered was a bit of a mixed bag. 

The food taste was between bland to flavourful, the portions were mostly small for the price, but overall food experience was average. If portions can be enlarged for the same price, it'll make the experience much more worthwhile.  Please note, it's *not that bad*, but it can be better. 

The service was terribly slow, but that could attribute to being understaffed. Our table was never cleared, so dishes arriving had to be put on the side (rather than on the lazy Susan), and ordering a bowl of rice took almost 30 minutes, such that our curry chicken got cold. Overall service experience was below expectations. 

If service can be significantly improved, with larger portions for the same price, I would come back."}
{"text":"i suspect that their lunch specials (~$5-6 each, if i recall correctly) bring in some good business, though it was quite empty on a thursday night. tons of items on the menu, and i came on the basis of a few recommendations:

- the CHICKEN SATAY with MANGO SALAD: this came out super fast and was nicely grilled. my only \"complaint\" of the skewers is that there wasn't enough surface area to douse peanut sauce on ;) instead, we tried to covertly spoon feed on the sauce alone, and i'm pretty sure we would have licked the dish clean if there weren't so many staff standing by haha...it was good.

- the MEE GORENG: also quick to serve up; saucy, spicy (just tingly spicy, but definitely not wimpy spicy) and full of a variety of seafood, including some massive prawns. me likey.

for ~$20 (inc. tax), two empty stomachs were more than happily filled. good deal!

p.s. they also have a dance floor near the back of the dining room and private room in the back with kareoke for anyone who's interested. for normal nights, they seem to just have random videos on by the dance floor, such as back-to-back parodies of Gangnam Style for oh, about 20 minutes :P"}
{"text":"I have only tried a few dishes recommended by yelpers and it did not disappoint...just that one downer where the service charge of 15% is included automatically in your bill."}
{"text":"Singapore laksa is very heart warming on a crisp cool Fall day. The curry broth is spicy but not overly. You'll find your nose running halfway through your bowl. They use the thin rice \"my fun\" noodles here. Personally I like thick egg noodle which picks up the creamy curry broth better. Toppings pretty standard with bean sprouts, chicken, tofu puffs, shrimp & fish cake. Overall a satisfying bowl of comfort to warm your tummy & soul."}
{"text":"I ordered Nasi Lemak, roti canai.  The food here is good.  They have a section where you can buy authentic Malay snacks. The coconut based curry is good. Probably one the best I ever had. This place is a must try for Malay food. Service is on point and the food tastes good."}
{"text":"Don't expect good service. We had lunch here and my parents know the owners. I've been here for new years and the experience was loud and overcrowded but mostly positive.

Food
- Vegetarian mango chicken: my parents have had this before and we're recommending it. The mango was fresh and the sauce tasted good... The mock chicken however was only slightly warmer than room temperature. 
- Seafood kway tiaw: probably one of the least oily versions I've had. Few actual morsels of seafood but otherwise no complaints. 
- Eggplant and green beans: your average oily pan fried vegetables that would be found typically in a Chinese restaurant. 

Service:
Sub-par unsmiling service from university aged waitresses. No thank yous or shits given."}
{"text":"Gourmet Malaysia is alright.  It's not horrible, but its not the best. 
Cuisine offers seafood, poultry and a vegetarian menu with \"mock meats -- mock chicken\".  My family members are former omnivores who converted to vegetarianism... these dishes offer some texture of the meat in a curry sauce. I guess it tastes good. But no reason for a chicken eater like me to go for mock meat. The real deal chicken was underwhelming. It felt like I was eating lunchable meats... did NOT enjoy the texture of this.

The Roti Kanaai is good. Which is basically a layered roti with some lentil (dhal).

Spacious place, accommodates parties."}
{"text":"I have spent a few good hours reading the various reviews here and decided to actually visit this place.  We ordered the roti w beef curry, fried squid with fragrant spices, nonya? curry and fish head curry.

The roti seemed to be of the frozen variety and the curry was flavourless.  
Sure maybe bad batch or any other excuse i could come with. 
Next came squid, it tasted of oil and breading and absolutely no squid meat or flavour was detectable, we made it bearable by dipping it in curry to give it some flavour. 
The curry chicken was also mediocre and tasted like it came from a can.  
Fish head curry that was anticipated by me was a huge huge disappointment.  Seemed like tomato paste with curry was used to make the sauce, okra, onions, and tomatoes was popped in.  The pieces of fish head. had a stale taste and we chose to leave the dish.  The curry had no flavour of fish. The only tasty aspect from dish was the half cooked okra and each of us cherished the three pieces in it. 

I have had better Malaysian curry from a food court. 

This restaurant should not be called gourmet anything and i am confused on how it is still in business.  

Food was absolutely bland and we will not be visiting after spending $55 bucks on this hugely disappointing meal.  

No One from our party enjoyed our meal.  

Absolute rubbish!

Too bad i cannot give it 0/5 stars."}
{"text":"Alright Scarborough, time to see what in town. 10 of my friends, and myself, ventured to Gourmet Malaysia for some family style eats. We ordered enough for an army, but we were up for the challenge! 

We ordered the dishes that were highly recommended online. We started with the roti and curry as well as many satays. It all went rather quickly. We understood why the chicken and beef satays were popular; tender, juicy and bursting with flavour! The roti was hot and fresh. There was more meat and sauce than there were roti, but isn't that the story of our lives?  

Next up was the Hainanese Chicken and Deep Fried Sambal Whole Fish. They were OK. The chicken didn't have a lot of flavour as it was steamed. It was juicy, but kinda blah. The whole fish was disappointing. It was so crispy that it was almost impossible to get any meat off of it. Definitely not worth $18.99. We feel a lot went to waste. 

Ikan Bakar(Banana Leaf Grilled Stingray) and Crispy Butter Prawns were next. The prawns were plentiful and piled high. They had the heads on, which freaks me out a bit, but the batter was good. The stingray was the shocker....it was delicious. It had the texture of chicken and the flavour of white fish. The sauce complimented it well. A few were not up for trying it, but that just meant more for me! :D 

The round tables had a lazy Susan making sharing easy. Each table had a call button so you could contact a server if you did not see one. That was handy! Wish more places had that! 

Service was good. Some things got lost in translation, but at the end of it all we were all full.  

I went there 1 other time to grab lunch. The lunch specials are not available if you're doing takeout. I ordered the Curry Beef. The portion was ok, no rice or anything with it. The beef was very fatty and full of gristle. I don't recommend it.

It was busy both times I was there, perhaps it's just me!"}
{"text":"Love this Malaysian restaurant that is located in Scarborough, I ordered the roti, mango chicken, beef and lamb curry and everything was delicious. I like to order extra  bowl of rice to eat with the curry. I had never been to their old cafeteria location before so I can't compare to that."}
{"text":"Very bad service. This is the second time they didn't get my order right. There are better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Service
The workers were very nice but I had to complain about how slow the restaurant was running. My friend's curry beef bowl arrived within 5 minutes of ordering whereas my noodle bowl didn't come out until 30 minutes later. I told my friend to eat first but he thought it would be rude...but seriously his food got cold by the time my noodles came by. And don't you readers start saying I was complaining silently, I asked the waitress if she could follow-up. She was very nice but told me that the restaurant was very busy which is why my food was coming out so slowly. Dude, it's a holiday maybe you should be properly staffed. Did I mention that there were empty tables and no line-ups? How is it FULL?

Food
I ordered the Laksa (which is the one that came 30 minutes later) and it is most known for having a spicy soup base complimented by noodles. I asked for half spicy which you should not do in the future as it wasn't spicy at all. I saw lots of pepper logos beside the dish so I thought I would get my tongue burned, but nope it's safe ladies and gentlemen. The soup itself was very good, well seasoned, and the temperature was just right. My only complaint is that the dish would be better complimented with thicker noodles and not vermicelli. I did not feel that the noodles absorbed the full flavour of the soup which was somewhat of a waste.

My friend ordered coconut rice with curry beef (flank?). I really regret to say that we could not taste its full potential as we waited so long for my actual dish to arrive. The bulk of the sauce (while it is seemingly covering the whole dish) is hidden in the bottom. You need to actually mix the whole thing together or else the first few beef bites will be quite bland. The coconut rice was okay but nothing surprising and a little expensive for its size (I've had way better)."}
{"text":"Love this place.... my first visit.
Service is great.... folks are all over the place taking care of you. 
I ordered the tom yum chicken soup. OMG. Wow! The portion size is big... and the curry lamb another  amazing dish. 

Check it out.... oh its halal too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very mediocre and not a very good representation of Malaysian cuisine.  Malaysians that give this place a high rating probably do not have much exposure to good Malaysian food in the homeland. 
No real Chef is Malaysia would attempt to tackle the extensive menu this place is offering.  Quantity and no Quality.
Malaysian food is essentially street food and the street vendors in Malaysia will make one thing and they do it really well.
A lot of the folks that venture into the restaurant business have never cooked any of these dishes in Malaysia and they are trying to do it all.
This place even dares to serve Teh Tarik that is pre-mixed like a 3 in 1.  Very sad."}
{"text":"A feast for six at $17/ea. Try to bring someone who knows what to order, so you get the best, most unexpected Malaysian flavours."}
{"text":"This is great restaurant. The service is good every time we go. My wife who is Malaysian Chinese, loves the authentic Malaysian dishes that reminds her of back home. We have our favourites when we go but we like to try new dishes on the menu. Seems the Roti Canai and nasi lemak are ordered most often by diners. The portions are big and delicious. The nasi goreng is one of my favourites. It's a big spic, just the way I like it. The Mee Siam is also a favourite of ours that we ordered every time we go. The place is usually busy every time we go it seems, but they often has half the restaurant reserved for private parties. It's a great family restaurant. Lots of choices on a great menu. Very comfortable atmosphere, friendly waitresses and 5 star service and taste. Try it, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"We go to this place all the time.. The food is very authentic and the price is fair.. The curry there is highly recommended.. 
A must try..."}
{"text":"Having Returned a few times recently, glad to see that the service issues related to launch have mostly been ironed out.  You won't get fantastic service, but it's more prompt and seemingly more organized now than when it first opened.  People come here for the food, which still shines with its vibrant and harmoniously balanced flavours.  I am willing to overlook other things, so are others in predictably long waiting line on weekends.

LIKE:
Kant Kung Belacan, or anything stir fried with Belacan sauce
Laksa, Assam Laksa, Penang Prawn Mee
Roti Cannai
Ikan Bakar (stingray grilled in banana leaf)"}
{"text":"My favourite is the Indonesian fried rice. It's hard to go wrong with that!!! Also in love with the Ikan bakar (stingray), as the texture is very chewy compared to regular fish. The rojak is also something I come back for, it's an appetizer with fruits drizzled with a sweet peanut sauce (very addicting!). As for drinks and beverages, I tried the chendol (coconut milk and shaved ice) and the winter melon/Logan drink. They tend to lean a bit on the sweeter side but it's my personal preference. Finally, I had the ice kachang for dessert and it's perfect for summer!! Condensed milk drizzled on shaved ice with red beans, corn, grass jelly and green jello"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for both lunch and dinner and I'm actually quite fond of this place! 
My go-to order is the curry chicken with roti - the balance of flakiness and density in the roti is incredible as it creates the perfect crunch that still remains suitable for dipping and coating. Thankfully, the curry isn't too spicy (since I have low tolerance) and the chunks of chicken meat are both tender and juicy. I would also recommend the seafood pineapple fried rice, which really packs a flavourful punch because of the combination of sweet fresh fruit and savoury seafood. 

FYI: The stir-fry dishes are also well done -  they aren't too oily, which is normally the caveat of stir-fry dishes, and yet they're fully distributed in sauce and the noodle strands don't stick together. For laksa lovers, the coconut laksa isn't very spicy but is definitely aromatic and flavourful.

So on an overall, I find the quality of the food here is consistently flavourful, well-presented, and quite delicious. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the worst dining experience I have ever had in all these years!!
We ordered 3 items from the menu,
212. Penang Assam Laksa
213. Singapore Laksa
and Fried Chicken Wings 6 pcs

Singapore Laksa and the wings are fine.  
Penange Assam Laksa is very disappointing, to say the least. The soup tasted extremely fishy and the noodle is over-cooked. The noodle had no texture and way too soft. We left the Laksa almost untouched.

What upset us the most wasn't the Laksa, but the attitude of one of the server (an older lady). Right from the beginning this server was horrible. When we walked into the restaurant and asked for table for two, she pointed to an area with a handful of empty tables without saying anything or any other acknowledgement nor smile. It was like we were bothering her and were not welcome. When we told her we are not happy with the Laksa, she was like \"It is what it is, the soup base used fish and of course it is fishy....\" (not word to word, but you get the idea...) Then she just walked away and THAT'S IT!  I would have expected that this server would offer some alternatives or express the regrets that we don't like their food. Instead, she made such a statement and walked away.   

I love fish and fish soup, but there is a huge difference between taste like fish and taste fishy. Period.

I had been there for lunch the service/food were acceptable. However after this recent unpleasant experience I will not return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Tasted a hot and sour soup and beef skewers as starters which were good. Main dishes Nasi lemak and Nasi goreng were ok, I have had better. First time trying the Assam laksa which was good. The tiny soup cups or bowls were funny and not impressive at all to drink out of. Overall average food, ok ambience. Not going back."}
{"text":"this was my second time there and I enjoy trying new dishes on the menu. I need to go back there again. Plus I bought some Malaysian snacks on the way out as well."}
{"text":"We came here based on all these positive reviews and I'm glad we did. 

Malaysian cuisine is new to me. When we saw the menu, we saw many regular Chinese dishes and also some foreign dishes. We came to get Malaysian food so we ordered something that didn't sound Chinese. We ordered Sambal Beef and Penang Assam Laksa. 

Both dishes had a lot of flavor. It's hard to describe. It's similar to Thai food in that it's often a mixture of sweet/sour/spicy/savory. Since we go to Chinese restaurants often, we know too well that in most places, the \"foreign\" dishes tastes \"Chinese\". We're happy to see this place giving us authentic tasting dishes. Of course, we've never been to Malaysia but at least this place is giving us new sensation to our taste buds. 

Will come again. Too bad it's so far from my home. I need to find an excuse to come here. But to be frank, while the taste is unique, these 2 dishes are not things I'd crave. 

My only real complaint is that the portions are a bit small for the prices, at least when you compare to other Chinese places. But since they are serving authentic food, the premium is justified. The staff speak Chinese by the way."}

Hello  everyone
              Gourmet Malaysia is a good place but nothing spacial.
I have big concern about their portion size bought 
Malaysia style chili chicken,and Nasi goring(friied rice)
Chili chicken I found 22 pices of whole red chili in the chicken???? around 5 to 6 small pices of chicken.????NOT WORTH FOR 8 dollar.



Fried reice very very small portion  not enough for the regular person

If is down town the portion size is ok but this is Scarborough compare with other Scarborough Restaurant The portion size is not worth for the money

NEVER VISIT AGAIN"}
{"text":"2 more reviews for 30 days challenge !!

I have a thing for curry and fried rice/ noodles, so that it was really hard for me to say no for Malaysian food or Thai food. I had a coworker who comes from Malaysia. When I ask her the #1 Malaysian food in her mind. She said Gourmet Garden, no doubt. But she did warm me that since it is a food court, so that you might have to wash your clothes inside out after, which by the way turns out to be true.

After I got to know this, I travel 35 mins up to east and found this place. 
First time I ordered the fried noodle and fried chicken. I LOVE IT. It was a long day at work, and I was really tire. First bite of the friend noodle, I feels like I woke up again lol.  The fried chicken is very special, I was thinking of ordering the bones in one, but owner recommend the boneless one, with dry little fish on top of it. VERY VERY TASTY. 

Owner is very friendly, if you ever wondering what to eat, ask him for advise. 

The only reason it is not 5 stars, is because it is not a restaurant yet. Although, it make the price really good ($6ish for noodle) but some people might not like the dinning environment that much. I heard the owner is opening a restaurant now. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"This meal was something completely different than what I'm used to as far as eating Asian.  Firstly it's not very often I'm in this area of town (Scarborough) so it's a whole new experience in itself.

I didn't know what to really expect because I have no real experience with Malaysian dishes but I am more familiar with other cuisines from Asia.  The venue is rather large and seems like the seating is practically like a banquet hall for some of the round tables with chairs dressed.  We were a party of 10 so it sort of was a perfect fit for family style ordering with the lazy susan in the middle making for easier access to the dishes.

The host of the evening ordered for everyone with some suggestions and requests made taken into consideration.  We had a wide variety of dishes for our party of 10.  

We started off with chicken and beef roti starters (different servings).  The roti were smaller than I'm used to, not as soft and fluffy, and thick but still layered and seemed to be grilled.  

Next we had a combination of beef and chicken satay skewers with sides of peanut sauce.  Those were good and went over well.

We had 2 whole chickens one was Hainanese and the other was Hainanese deep fried version.  Each order comes as a half chicken so basically it was 2 orders of each.

Crispy butter prawns, a fried fish dish I'm not sure of the name, another beef dish, stingray (yes, stingray!), a chicken broth rice and rice noodles.  I think that was everything.

The food was a little different than other Asian cuisines but with some similarities.  The chicken that wasn't fried seemed really rubbery and the skin tasted almost as if it wasn't cooked but it was probably just boiled.  It's hard to say.  The flavors were good, just different.

The fish dishes were hard to make out and take apart.  Each dish only really had regular sized forks and/or spoons to serve with which made it hard especially when you can't see the fish because it's covered in sauce.  The larger of the fish was really hard to separate and serve and seemed rather bony.

The rice was really good, it had a hint of ginger in it and I could describe it to be a less watered down version of congee almost because it wasn't soup.  The rice noodles were very good.  

Overall it seemed some dishes were better than others and while some things were very different I can't say that it was so much to my liking.  I am probably just too used to the way certain dishes are cooked that I probably couldn't appreciate it the same way such as the fish which was hard to serve because it was harder to make out.  

The service was really good however.  They have one of those radio call devices to signal if you'd like water, if you're ready or order or you'd like the bill etc.  There are buttons on this thing meant just for that.  Basically they know when you want when you press a button!

The food for me just seemed to be OK.  Some dishes were better than others and the menu is really overwhelming.  I think I counted 322 items as each are numbered.  There are so many things it's hard to get a good overall understanding of that menu because there are just so many choices."}
{"text":"Gourmet Garden is a place that my parents discovered.  It is located in a plaza that houses a food court that is home to Chinese BBQ, a Cantonese cuisine joint and this Malaysian/Singaporean joint.  

If I were you I would highly advise for you to get the food to go as the food court itself will leave your clothes reeking of all sorts of food smells and its not the most inviting of food courts (nor the cleanest).

I always get the Satay Beef Noodles here.  Greasiness aside, its got the spiciness that I like, the beef is tender, and the noodles have the right amount of elasticity to softness ratio.  Another dish that I quite enjoy from our friends at Gourmet Garden is the Hainanese Chicken Rice.  The rice is always flavourful, and there are never any left overs!

They've recently opened up a full-service restaurant across the street called Gourmet Malaysia - my advice - stick with the food court.  Better portions, and cheaper too!

Cash only."}
{"text":"Food was pretty standard. Service was amazing. But food was brought out in reverse eating order. Got the mains first. Followed by the apps and then the soup. I highly not recommend you not order the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"This review is symbolic as it both mark my #150 review (I know doesnt seem much) and I have yet to review an Asian food place.  You think I would given I did grow up in scarborough and well 90% of the food and population is Asian,  Even in my own group I am minority.

So I came here on wednesday night after a long day downtown, meet up with a group of people I hadn't really met before but it was a welcoming experience. Like we are old pals and friends over some roti or Satay. Like family/community meal.

I'm not too knowledge on what I ate ( probably not a good thing) but all i know is it tasted good from the roti/satay to stingray (didnt think I would eat that) 

I know there was prawn,  some h..... chicken ( I forget) Noodle, beef chicken pork and well your typical meats. I may not have known but as a clueless stranger I know I didnt eat something I didnt like. (Well maybe the chicken)

Looking from the outside it didnt look that big but inside it was medium sized, there was about ten of us and we managed to fit. They werent too busy for 8ish but I guess people eat later? i can only remember two other groups and one might have been an indian family.

They had unique buzzer which seem like a good thing, i think may have had 2 or 3 servers so I would assume this place get busy and it probably harder to keep track. All and all a great meal. It wasn't too pricey given the food we had,so that a plus"}
{"text":"Way in the East end of Scarborough where no subway dares to tread is a row of strip plazas that form one if T.dot's Chinatowns.  Gourmet Garden is located in a nondescript building that looks like its being readied for redevelopment.  One of several now closed food stalls that form a small food court, Gourmet Garden seems to have all the customers to themselves.  One taste of their spicy and fragrant laksa noodle dishes and one can immediately understand why.   
Born out of the partnership that was Bunga Raya, whose other partner went on to form the wildly successful Restoran Malaysia.  Gourmet Garden more than holds its own in quality of food and deliciousness but lacks the comfort of modern decor.   
You place your order with the cashier who hands you a little cardboard chip with a number.  Find your spot at any of the available spots and wait for your number to be called.  
As with most Asian food courts, it's best to haul along a few friends so that you can all share a taste of a few dishes.  Among the 4 of us, we had two kinds of laksa, mee goreng ( fried noodles), popiah (kind of like a spring roll that hasn't been deep fried), roti prata, tahu goreng (fried tofu on top of sprouts and covered in a spicey sauce and hoisin sauce).   All dishes were tasty and are close to the hawker stall experience as we can get in t.dot.   Singapore laksa was flavorful and chock full of a stuff swimming in a savoury coconut curry soup.
Roti prata was flakey while maintaining the chewiness you need to dip into the accompanying curry sauce.  

Gourmet Garden delivers fully on providing the Malaysian/Singaporean hawker center experience without the jet lag of a trip half way round the world. With delicious food and quick basic service, it is well worth the drive for a filling and flavorful lunch."}
{"text":"I drive here from downtown to devour plate after plate of roti canai, the best I've found in the city. The other food is decent, but that's what you deserve for trying anything other than that crunchy chewy buttery roti. Full disclosure: I just ate 3 orders. Bonus points go to this place for the impromptu karaoke sessions by owner \"Yummy Forever\" during dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty good
I pass this place on the bus every day, so I decided to try it out.
Being a white guy, I had no clue what anything was.
I got chicken satay (very good) chili chicken malaysian style (I like it too) and Indonesian fried rice (not bad, but had I known there was squid and shrimp in it, I wouldn't have got it)
But in all, the food was very good.
Now that I have a menu, I will google some dishes before I return.
The server was very friendly, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I always like Malaysian and Singaporean dishes.  They are very fragrant and spicy.

This place offers affordable dishes and in large portion most of the time. I particularly enjoy their beef curry with roti ($6.99), teh talik or \"??\" ($2.00), Singapore laksa ($8.80) and satay skewers. Be sure to let them know your tolerance in spiciness. The Malaysian fried rice was quite spicy even though I ordered it mild! If you like balachan (???), they have a whole jar for you at every table. You can simply add it to your rice or veggie dishes.  I'm telling you ~ it's divine!

There's not much decor and service to talk about. There is a stage at the back for karaoke and parties, just like an old style Chinese restaurant. They also have few TVs hanging up showing Malaysian shows. Few times I've been they were showing some homemade/reality music videos, which were hilarious.

They also sell some Malaysian products at the front. I bought a jar of kaya spread (??) for $5. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time today and had the Singapore laksa and nasi lemak. 
The laksa was delicious, especially the broth. The noodles were thin rice noodles that went well with the flavourful soup. There were lots of fish cake slices and tofu but not many other toppings. Not very spicy.
It was our first time having nasi lemak. The coconut milk rice was very subtle in flavour but had a nice texture. The chicken curry was a good mix, only a few pieces of chicken though. The anchovies were flavourful also.

Staff were super friendly and helpful!
Overall a great restaurant..we will be back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"They need to clean their tables, as it was slimy and sticky when we got seated... Anyhow, food here is decent for Malaysian/Indonesian/Singaporean style. Not as good as Restauran Malaysian in Richmond Hill but not a bad joint in Scarborough.

Service was not great. Slammed the tea on our already dirtied tables. Still giving it a 3 stars as it's a good place to eat some flavourful, spicy, South East Asian style dishes with large portions!

Recommendations: laksa rice noodle soup and the fried rice dish. (Too bad it didn't come inside one of those cool carved out half-Pineapples.)"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place that serves a variety of authentic Malaysian food. I come here from time to time and it's always good but not the best."}
{"text":"So after a so-so experience with Malaysian food on Hwy 7...my friend suggested we go here as it is usually better depending on who is cooking..she tells me.  
We are lucky and the good cook is on today.  

We have the beef roti (very good and portion much better than other place)

Laksa noodle soup was good. (though we had to ask for the lime)

tried the gado gado..it was only ok...
tried one other appetizer..forgot the name but it's like a pancake rolled up with vegetables inside..savoury not sweet. It was ok...I liked it but you can tell that you have to eat it as soon as they bring it to you..I ate some near the end of the meal and noticed the wrappers were getting soft and were losing their texture.

I'd go back for the first 2 dishes and maybe try others..the menu was quite large."}
{"text":"My first experience with Malaysian food and I must say it was quite disappointing. We walked in and the ambiance in the place is non existent (but I will not judge them on that because firstly it's in Scarborough and secondly I was here to eat and wasn't expecting fine dining to begin with).  

We were seated right away, given tea and menus. The menu is quite expansive and this being my first Malaysian experience I must say I was a little overwhelmed. I would have liked to ask the waitress for some recommendations but that was not possible as she did not speak English very well. To start we ordered the mango salad and lamb satay, for mains I ordered the chili chicken and my friend wasn't feeling adventurous so she just ordered the pad Thai. 

The starters came out quickly which was good, but that was about the only good thing about them. The Mango Salad was drenched in dressing, so much so that a large pool of sauce had formed at the bottom of the plate, the mango was way too green and hard to stomach. Moving on to the Lamb satay (6pcs) this was probably the worst part of the meal, the lamb was clearly not fresh and tasted frozen. The lamb was tasteless, it was accompanied by a peanut dipping sauce that added some flavour but was not good enough to salvage the dish. 

The Mains arrived shortly after the appetizers, the portion size was average but not overly big. The chili chicken was very saucy and the sauce itself tasted like it was from the bottle. Pieces of chicken were cut up very small and accompanied by some chopped veggies. The Pad Thai was made with squid, a white fish, and some shrimp. The noodles and fish tasted ok, the squid was hard as a rock and like the lamb tasted frozen. Both of these dishes were very underwhelming and quite frankly reminded me of something i would get at a food court. 

As for the service, as can be expected in these types of Scarborough institutions was underwhelming. The food came out promptly but we were never asked how the food was or how we were doing. When I ordered a side of rice it was forgotten (I never got it but it was still charged to my bill! it was so aggravating but the waitress fixed that quickly). I don't think I will return right away, rather I will try other Malaysian places to get more acquainted with the food as I am a newbie to this cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years.  My favourite is the Singapore laska.  The flavour is amazing.  Their curry is also good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has undergone like a million iterations before becoming what we know of it today. It's safe to say it is an excellent restaurant if you want quality Malaysian food. Highly recommend the samba rice as it is probably one of my favourite dishes there because of how well it was done! Give it a shot if you're craving Malaysian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Malaysia was recommended by a friend who longed to eat at this restaurant before they left Toronto for a year. 

Entering the restaurant rather later in the evening, there were tons of seats (weekday night). I feel like the restaurant has way more seats, than it does have for parking seats - limited. It oddly gave us a feeling of those Chinese restaurants in Europe or in a heavily Western populated location where large group tours attend to dine. 

We ordered the Hainese Chicken on Rice for ($9.99), the special gourmet Malaysia platter ($23.99) and their Laksa bowl. All of these dishes were quite large, though I had expected the Malaysia platter to have more appetizer pieces in it. 

The Hainese Chicken had a larger than normal piece of chicken for you to eat, with a fairly large scoop of rice as well. I really enjoyed it - the meat for the chicken although tasted slightly more rough than the regular smooth pieces of chicken, I felt like ACTUALLY was a piece of chicken cause of the amount of meat in it.

The Laksa bowl was another huge dish consisting of noodles and fish ball related items. It was spicy, but it was pretty delicious. I eventually used the soup based - which had some viscosity to it, and mixed it with the rice and it tasted great.

The Malaysia platter's items were slightly smaller than expected. The kabobs on their own were quite expensive, so we decided just to get this all in one. In this platter consisted of chicken and beef kabobs (6 pieces), though it was rather small in size compared to the kabobs at other places. I'd go for this option too if you were looking for appetizers to eat. The spring rolls were much smaller than I had hope for it to be and they tasted like something you could purchase frozen. I really enjoyed the salad - a mix of mango, cucumber and peppers. They also had fried shrimp balls and the fish ball related texture foods that were spicy. 

I think their price and the proportion of food was fair - would come back to visit!"}
{"text":"K. So the service here isn't the best, but the food is totally worth it. I started eating this food before they had the restaurant at this location. They used to be a stall at the food court across the street. I've been coming here for years. Went yesterday for lunch. They don't have lunch specials on weekends anymore. They used to =(

Got:
Poh Pia: crepe with shredded egg and veggies (cucumbers, carrots, bean sprouts) in it, topped with hoisin sauce, some kind of hot sauce, and crushed peanuts. Sans hot sauce, I'd say it's pretty kid-friendly.
Roti with sugar: first time trying this yesterday. Their roti (regardless of which of three ways you order it) is delicious. It's crispy and flaky. Dipped in sugar, it's good, but I'm a savory person, so I prefer it with either their beef or their chicken curry. That being said, the little kid sitting with us loved it. You dip it in the sugar yourself, so you can control how sweet it is. They serve it sans knife, so I'm not sure whether they're expecting you to rip it apart with your hands or not.
Green beans stir fried in garlic: beans were fresh. deep fried garlic came on top. solid dish.
Ayam Bilis Crispy Chicken with Coconut Spices: almost like it was fried in coconut shreds, then covered in more fried coconut shreds. small bits on fried anchovies hidden in that mound of fried coconut shreds somewhere. fragrant. My dad said the chicken itself could have been marinated longer though. I tend to agree.
Hor fun and crispy noodles with seafood is my new favorite. My old favorite was the seafood scrambled egg chow fun. Chow fun is just rice noodle romanized from its Cantonese pronunciation. The difference between my old favorite and my new favorite is that my new favorite has a crispy noodles which one is supposed to mix into the dish. The crispy noodles add an interesting texture to the dish. I order this one for take out too. It keeps warm for a very long time.
Prawn mee(?) - I think that's what it's called. Spicy soup noodle dish with prawns and fish cake slices. Only served on weekends. My Malaysian friend recommended this, so I thought it deserved a try. Spicy and the broth is full of prawn flavor. For the price though (around $8.50), it's a tad small, portion wise. It also only comes with 3 prawns/shrimp, head on, which is good cuz I like the head, but just an FYI.

Other loves here:
Tauhu goreng: fried tofu chunks served with their amazing satay peanut sauce. My mom's hooked on the peanut sauce this place serves.
Ayam Percik Grilled Chicken Fragrant Coconut Spice - delicious as well, to my memory. Can't remember if this one is slightly spicy or not.
Nasi Lemak - Really can't complain about this one. It comes with curry chicken,egg, peanut & ikan bilis, as well as sliced cucumber, tomatoes and possibly sprouts. I like to smash everything together and then eat it, but I'm told that the proper way is to scoop bits of everything onto one spoon. It's more time consuming that way, but most likely more aesthetically pleasing. 

Prices:
Could be cheaper, but for the food, it's worth it."}
{"text":"First time having Malaysian food and I'm in love. Must try is their Cannai beef or chicken curry .... It came with 3 roti's. Also ordered Satay Beef however portion was kind of small but very delicious. Will defiantly go back to try the other types of curry they offer!"}
{"text":"There aren't many Malaysian restaurants in Toronto so it gives Gourmet Malaysia a bit of an advantage from the lack of competitors. Their food is pretty decent, especially for the price. Like any other asian restaurants, they prioritize quantity over quality, so theres definitely room for improvement. One thing that needs work is their customer service- the servers need to be better trained to be more friendly and communicative, and be more efficient!"}
{"text":"I lived in Singapore for 3 years, when I'm craving for south-east Asian dishes I come here. Singapore laksa (the \"curry\"+coconut milk based broth) is way better than Penang laksa (sorta tomato sauced based broth with canned sardines, the smell is just too strong for me);
Roti with variety of curries, really nice.
Crispy fried chicken drum sticks, satay, nice.
Pad Thai is the same ingredients with Char Kway teow, just different sauce. It's different from Thai style pad Thai. 
Try Malaysia signature dishes, won't go wrong.
High calories! ;)"}
{"text":"Big portions! chicken with satay sauce was very rich & delicious."}
{"text":"This place has the best hainanese chicken rice. It is superb and it taste exactly like the ones I had in singapore! Service is good with friendly staffs, and the owner sometimes would come over and talk to you about their food/services if you visit during down time .  Crab, fried squid, stingrays, curry and roti  are delicious!  The laksa is so-so in my opinion. Tofu stew in hot pot can be skipped.

If you're adventurous, I think the winter melon logan drink is worth a try as well."}
{"text":"Great place! Good food, good prices, good service. Menu is so expansive! Order anything that sounds good to you. Some of the dishes are family style, some are single serving so make sure to ask. Very accommodating of big groups, vegetarians, etc. The braised tofu (or something) was a huge hit among veges and non-veges."}
{"text":"If you're craving Malaysian eats, I think it's safe to say Gourmet Malaysia gets it done. Just don't expect too much and you will be fine.

We went with their roti cannai with curry which I have heard many good things about (it does live up to the hype), and went adventurous with the asam laksa which was our first time trying. You know when the waitress is asking if you've tried it before and sort of gives you a disclaimer about its' intensity then you know you're in for a wild ride! 

The roti cannai was excellent. The roti itself was excellent. It was flakey and buttery. You could taste the sweetness of the dough and they gave you three of them. Great quantity! The curry was also pretty good. We ordered a beef curry and it was like brisket with tendons. The curry itself was very flavorful, not spicy, and was excellent with the roti. There wasn't too much meat but still is probably the best thing on their menu, value wise and taste wise! 

Now for the asam laksa. It really was quite intense but I loved the intense of it. For those who dislike fishy taste or in particular mackerel like tastes or smell, then stay away from this! This is quite literally mackerel soup which is very strong on its' own. It's also very soury and sweet. It packs quite a punch but is very satisfying to eat with the noodles. I also like the random fresh veggies their such as the onion, cucumbers, and mint which added a freshness. It's not for everyone but those who can withstand it are rewarded with a treat. 

Price is fair, the interior is a bit outdated but the food is alright and gets it done. The service was pleasant and I appreciated the heads up by the waitress!"}
{"text":"Everything was really good! We ordered the satay beef, mango salad, laksa and nasi lemak. 

Everything was delicious and authentic (according to my best friend whose dad is Malaysian) except for the nasi lemak. We were told by our server that it was the same as the nasi lemak without the banana leaf albeit in a smaller portion (ours has the banana leaf and we ordered it thinking that it would look and taste more authentic) but it was just a mound of rice with a bit of peanut sauce mixed with dried fish on top. The rice to sauce ratio was not good. If we come back here again, we are definitely going to order the nasi lemak without the banana leaf. 

Service was okay. Our server seemed inexperienced but he seemed like a nice guy overall. Our food also arrived fairly quickly which was good. 

Along with two orders of nyonya kuei and the vanilla ice cream with deep fried banana, our total came to $60 between the two of us. Not bad for such generous portions! 

My favourites dishes that we've tried during our visit? The laksa, the beef satay and the nyonya kuei (ours included cassava cake...that stuff was small but surprisingly filling)."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers!  What is Benny doing in the Scarbs?  This is my old stomping grounds.  My Hood!  
So lets check out couple of places while I am here.  
If you have never been to GM, it is the all in one Super Store/Resto!  They got the groceries in the front, the restaurant in the middle and the Art Store in the back.  Wow and lol. 
Seeing that it was our first trip to a Malaysian Resto, we decided to keep it simple by only ordering a Chicken Seafood Curry Coconut Laksa, the Chicken Satay Sticks/Mango Salad Combo and the Beef Satay Sticks.  Verdict:  I liked the Laksa but not enough to finish all the soup.  I was all coconutty curried out.  The fish cakes, chicken and laksa noodles were good,,, I guess.  I have nothing to compare it to.  Hence my Laksa Journey begins...lol.  My Seven year old said she really liked the Beef Satay.  She didn't share them with me, even though I asked, so they must have been good.  The Chicken Satay was deep fried.  Are they supposed to be deep fried?   Anywho, they were tasty with the peanut sauce.   Mango Salad was just ok.  I have had better.
As you have probably already read in the previous reviews that the resto attempts to sneak in a 10% service charge on your bill.  Well it looks as if they got the message and removed it.  Good for you GM!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Singapore laksa .. so good next time I will ask for extra spicy .. mango salad was ok .. will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Roti Cannai, Poh Pia, Nasi Goreng were awesome. If you do not like curry with fennel or star anise flavour then their curries are not for you. While ordering Poh-pia asking for extra sauce might be a good idea.

We also ordered Rojak, which was our least favourite. May be this is an acquired taste. The dish is cold and the sauce contains shrimp paste, so it has a  very strong dried fish flavour which I hated."}
{"text":"A lot of my friends and cousins have told me to try this place saying they offer some delicious food. I decided to come here to test it out. When I walked in, it seemed very gloomy. The booth they put me in needed to be fixed up. It was breaking apart. The restaurant was half full and everyone seemed to be enjoying what they're eating.

We decided to order the Chicken Satay as an appetizer and the Roti Cannai with Beef Curry and Shredded Chicken & Hor Fun in Curry Soup for lunch. The Chicken Satay was very tender but the star of the day was the Roti Cannai. It was very delicious. The roti was crispy and the curry was quite flavorful. It seemed that every table had this dish. Definitely a must try! It comes with either chicken or beef curry. The Hor Fun had a different kind of taste to the curry. It had a kick to it and left us all very full. Lots of noddles and chicken was in it. 

I would definitely come back, especially for the Roti Cannai!"}
{"text":"The best Malaysian food I've had in Toronto. Reasonably priced and a rather large menu. The service is decent for the amount of volume. 

We had the nasi lemak and ayam percik. Both tasted great. And both came quickly with good service.

If you're looking for authentic Malaysian food in the area (according to my Malaysian gf) I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Malaysian food, if you like Malaysian, Thai, or curry, this is the best place to go. Service is decent, not the best. Atomsphere not the best, portion is not the best, but in terms of the taste of the food, it deserves a four star. However, entrance of the lot is high risk for car collision, watch out if you are about to go there after reading this review."}
{"text":"The satay skewers were delicious! Very tender meat.  Curry roti was great too. Just on the oilier/saltier side."}
{"text":"Second visit was just as good as the first! Went with a larger group and they seated us at a circle table with a lazy Suzy which was awesome! 

I expected a weekday lunch to not be too busy  compared to the weekend when I first went but there was a steady flow of people coming in. 

Tried the golden fried chicken this time and it was one of the better fried chicken dishes I've had compared to other Malaysian restaurants. The batter was seasoned perfectly and it didn't stream oil onto the plate which was good. 

For dessert we had the fried banana which was super delicious. For $5.99 you get three pieces of fried banana plus two scoops of vanilla ice cream. 

A  bill for 6 people came to like $85 bucks with tax and tip so not bad at all. 

Me and my family lived our experience and we've definitely marked this place for a return visit!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Malaysia is a mix of Malaysian, Singaporean, and Indonesian cuisine. As you walk into the restaurant, there is a small snack/dessert section that you can order to go or have it brought to your table. 

Coming here with the family for lunch, we ordered:

Mee Goreng Yellow Noodles w/ Seafood Sambasl - Pan fried noodles when a spicy, tangy, and curry taste. It was tasty for the first few bites, but it was too oily to really enjoy it. 

Curry Chicken with rice - They were quite skimpy on the chicken though, as I found mostly chicken skin and perhaps 3 pieces of chicken? The curry itself was moderately spicy and flavourful, but nothing outstanding.

Satay chicken (6 pieces) - For the price that you pay for it, you'd expect the chicken to be a bit larger. The peanut sauce that accompanied the ungenerous portions of chicken skewers was tasty though. The chicken itself had a curry base to them, so there was a mix of sweetness and curry in each bite. 

Soohood Goreng - Perhaps the best dish of the afternoon. Pan-fried clear noodles with chicken. The flavour was definitely there. I enjoyed the smooth texture of the clear noodles when infused with the flavours. 

Teh Tea - Tasted like milk tea, but it had an added richness to it which made it a pleasant drink to have.

Service can get quite slow, as there were only 2 waitresses managing the tables on a Sunday afternoon.

Note: Besides the spiciness in many the dishes, a lot of the dishes can get quite oily (especially pan-fried), but you can request them to hold back on the oil when cooking."}
{"text":"I came during lunch hour on a Wednesday. It was not very busy at all. The waitress has attitude here and don't have any manners. The chicken wasn't fully cooked. The price is alright for the portion they give you (not that much)."}
{"text":"Food is good.Service is very slow.Prices are extremely high.servers are not very friendly but the food itself specially the fish is great"}
{"text":"I think the popularity of this restaurant kind of died down over the past years but the food is still great imo! I loved the assam laksa, hainese chicken, and the deep fried tofu. Personally, I wished the laksa could have a more coconutty flavour.  Prices are fair for the portion and the quality of the food! Service is great - no complaints here."}
{"text":"One of the few Malaysian restaurants that I know of around the GTA and close to home. Near Sheppard Ave E and Brimley Rd Gourmet Malaysian is serving some East Asian comfort food packed with flavor.
The venue is quite spacious with bigger banquet looking tables towards the back of the restaurant to accommodate larger groups and special occasions. 
Thanks to Jen she recommended a few dishes that we....or I needed to try, here's the break down:

Beef Skewer: Easy 5/5 tender, flavorful, served with a peanut sauce in a presentable manner. 

Malaysian Laksa: 5/5 This was my comfort food on a cold day, full of spices, served in a bowl of noodles cooked up in the coconut soup-like sauce with vegetables, fish, chicken and other types of seafood.  Portion was sufficient for two.

Chicken Curry served with Roti, this was the least favorite out of the two other dishes, I wish they could have served an additional roti as we still had ample gravy.  Lots of bones in the chicken curry made it a task to eat.

This place is an overall solid 4/5, there's a lot of more good treats to try on the menu, perhaps we'll need to come back for a second time."}
{"text":"Came to try this place out as I heard pretty good things about them. This restaurant is located beside a chinese supermarket and the exterior doesn't really scream delicious food. But surprisingly they delivered! The satay beef was tender and flavourfu and the assam curry fish was spicy and sour, so good! The curry beef was alright - nothing to rave about. But overall this is a great place for malaysian food in Scarborough. Will be back soon to try out more dishes!!"}
{"text":"East side repping with Malaysian/Singaporean/Indonesian food!  Came here with a group of friends to try several dishes  on a weeknight.

Not busy at all we had no problems getting a reservation and a large table.  We had beef/chicken skewers with peanut sauce (pretty good) and roti/curry to start.  The roti is not like the more common east indian type of roti- this one is smaller and more crispier.  The beef and chicken curry were nice but I preferred the beef.  Both were mild in my opinion and could have been kicked up a notch in spiciness but this was one of my favourite dishes!  Nothing beats roti and curry in a cold might!

A few fish dishes including stingray which was covered in a thick sauce and surprisingly i liked it better than i thought.   2 chicken dishes which I believe were Hainanese style were my least favourite.  One looked to be boiled and I found not much taste to it.  Just not my preference unfortunately.  A side of rice with chicken flavour was really nice change from plain white rice and lent some flavour to the chicken or beef curry.  

Also ordered some fried noodles which were decent.  I'm sure i am forgetting a dish or two but overall i had a good selection of various dishes which I think represented what this restaurant is all about.

Don't expect fancy here.  Plastic white table clothes and the decor is lacking but you are coming here for some cheap food :) 

You are given one of those radio call buttons so you just press it and a server comes over!  No more waiting to try and flag someone to come over. 

Check in on Yelp as you get a discount!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for dinner with my family. Was it really overly impressed with the food. Food was on the oily and salty side. Prices of the items on the menu were $10 and more even though portion size for quite fair.

The restaurant on the other hand was really big and was able to get seating very easily. Service was okay. It was kind of hard to flag the servers down when we wanted to get our bill.

I don't think I'll be coming back to this restaurant nothing on the menu stood out. Malaysian flavors weren't really significant in the dishes only in how they name them."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so busy, but it doesn't mean customers should be neglected. Me and my group of friends came and nobody brought us a menu to look at. We were sitting there for about 5 minutes thinking that a waiter was going to bring us water and a menu, but nope. We ended up getting the menu ourselves. Also, the tables were sticky. I don't think they clean up well. 

We decided to order some items like a specific fried fish dish but they were out. Moreover, they were out of a vegetable dish that we wanted to order. We were somewhat disappointed that we couldn't order what we wanted. 

We ended up ordering a chicken satay dish, kway teow, chicken curry with roti, a fried fish, and hainanese chicken. The chicken satay and chicken curry with roti were my favorite dishes. I love their roti. I was not impressed with the kway teow although I was looking forward to that. Kway teow is one of my favorite noodle dishes so I order it whenever a restaurant orders it. I would not recommend the kway teow here. But the curry with roti is a must get at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food here. Their roti is awesome and I love their Indonesian fried rice. Everything I had was good."}
{"text":"Chicken skewers are the best with the peanut sauce! This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem in Scarborough. Their noodles with seafood is really tasty. Bonus points for being Halal!"}
{"text":"It's great here. I've tried 80 % of the menu and cannot speak highly enough of the food. It's fast and friendly. Wish they had beer and more convenient parking. Would recommend to anyone to try"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Gourmet Malaysia. 
Good side: 
1) Finding a relatively rare (to me) cuisine to try - an interesting, varied hybrid of South & East Asian flavours - is always exciting.  
2) It's a comfortable sit-down place very close to home!  
3) The menu is extensive - great variety.  
4) The Mee Goreng and Char Kway Teow are good. My usually picky daughter enjoyed both dishes.

Needing improvement:   
1) The Hainan chicken was disappointing - very oily, chewy, fatty skin. 
2) The desserts are largely a miss. 
3) Decor could be updated. I like the homey Malaysian flourishes, though.

Will be back, despite the downside, because there are so many other dishes to try."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5. 

The lasi lemak was the best one I had so far (throughout my 4 years being in Canada). It reminded me of home. The sambal and rice were cooked perfectly. I loved everything about it. 

The popia was alright, not bad. It lacked something but I wasn't sure what it was, prolly dried shrimp?

The black glutinous rice smelled good, the santan complimented it well but the soup itself was bland, it wasn't as thick and creamy as I expected. It definitely needed a little more omph or \"kao\" to be perfect. 

My bf tried the mee goreng. He found it to be a little too sweet. 

My friend tried Penang prawn noodle and I had some. It was delicious and the soup? Yum. 

Overall I loved the nasi lemak and Penang prawn noodle."}
{"text":"Food was good. I ordered nasi lemak and cha kwe tiaw. Portion was big. Price also cheap.. will go back to gourmet malaysia again."}
{"text":"I was excited because I love Malaysian food and there aren't too many places serving it in TO. Dining alone I decided to order the Nasi Lemak and supplement it with a Rendang.
I was quickly seated and my order processed although the young lady seemed a little puzzled when I asked for Sambal sauce.  The Nasi Lemak arrived first and it was as advertised although the Chicken curry could have used more heat, less Cardamom and less bones. The coconut rice was delish as was the accompanying Ikan Bilis. The Sambal sauce was outstanding with the flavour of the dried prawns creeping in subtly but not as hot as I have had it before. The Rendang arrived and it looked and smelt wonderful and the taste didn't disappoint either. The cut of meat used was a very cheap one though, and there were quite a few pieces of fat which I had to discard and which detracted from the overall enjoyment of the dish. No Sago dessert (bummer) so the whole thing cost me $26 (with a 10% tip added in so be careful not to tip twice) which was pretty reasonable. Would definitely go back with a larger party this time to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I love Malaysian food and was excited to try this restaurant out.

The food was ok - not spectacular. The chicken curry was nice. But the paratha was super greasy. 

The service was pretty bad. The waiters were all nice but seemed a little clueless. 

There was one woman (the owner?) who was particularly rude. Right after we ordered our drinks and settled in she stormed up to the table with a pad and paper and yelled - give me your license plate - did you park in the front? When we looked back at her puzzled she explained that parking enforcement was here and that she had to verify that only customers were parked in their spots. So we give her our license plate. We asked to make sure we were ok - and she said yes, that she had verified our plate and let them know we were customers. 

When we finished our meal and got into the car we saw a parking ticket! When we took it inside the restaurant to inquire she just laughed. It turned out it's the owner who calls parking enforcement because of non-customers taking their spots. That's fine...but it kind of sucks when customers end up with parking tickets as a result. 

I suggest anyone who decides to go to this restaurant - park in the back and avoid the hassle :)"}
{"text":"With the reviews I was a little worried about the Singaporean Laksa, but it was perfect.  Maybe it was a good day for me or something but everything we ordered was excellent.  Ordered the hainanese chicken with rice, Singaporean Laksa, and plate of veggies tung choi I guess like fried greens with some spicy sauce.  The hainanese chicken was good quality and tasty !!  Singaporean Laksa had a good soup base just the right balance of coconut milk, curry, and thickness.  The veggies was done well and I never tried this sauce before, but it was good!!  Everything had a good balance in flavour and texture.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Coming all the way from downtown, I can certainly say that this restaurant is worth the drive! As a Malaysian, I can certainly say that a lot of the dishes were as authentic as it can get! (Can only imagine how hard it must be to get some of the spices) I had the Nasi Lemak (of course!), Assam Laksa, and Roti Canai. All were really great. Service was also great. On top of that, they have  a section where they sell imported Malaysian snacks -  which really made me miss Malaysia. Would really recommend this restaurant if you want a good taste of Malaysian food!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner, wanting some Malaysian food and I knew this was in the area. Going by some of the pictures and yelp reviews, we ordered satay beef skewers, beef curry with roti, char kwai teow (fried noodle dish).

Skewers are ok, they came with some onion and cucumber, but it could've came with more or the peanut dip. I really liked the roti, it was delicious. The noodles were a little greasy, but the taste was alright. Could use more colour maybe or a something to supplement the flavour better.

As I checked in, I got the notification to use a 10% off with cash coupon thing that they didn't accept. Not sure what the deal is there."}
{"text":"My uncle recommended this place and the reviews seemed pretty good so I was looking forward to this visit with my dining companion, Raj. There were lots of dishes on the huge menu that we weren't familiar with so we chose a couple items that were indicated as popular dishes: Malaysian Style Chili Chicken and Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli. Both sounded really good.

It took a little while but the chicken arrived first and it looked good, with lots of red chili peppers. It was nowhere near as spicy as it looked (thankfully) and the flavour was pretty good.

The fish and veggie dish arrived shortly after and it looked good too. Unfortunately, it was very salty and the diced salted fish was tough, like it hadn't been re-hydrated from a dry preserved state. The veggies were a bit overcooked and chewy. This dish was a miss.

One hit, one miss. Split decision. Service was just okay. Despite my neutral rating (actually 2.5), I'm not sure this is worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I came here today with my parents today to celebrate my father's birthday.  I knew that this place recently opened and were from the same people that had owned the Gourmet Garden food court across the street.  I absolutely love Gourmet Garden, so it was exciting to come here for dinner.

It was a Thursday night around 6:30 pm.  There wasn't many people there, however, it may be the fact that this place is fairly new.  My parents don't really eat spicy, so we ordered the following: roti pratha with curry, hainan chicken, and penang char kwei teow (fried hor fun with mixed seafood).   For drinks, my parents had the coconut drink and teh talik.

ROTI PRATHA WITH CURRY:  Absolutely delicious -- curry was just at the right amount of spiciness.  Apparently they had recently changed their recipe for the roti.  It's a little bit greasy, but mixed with the curry, it was great.

HAINAN CHICKEN:  My parents claim that it's not as good as the one at Phoenix Restaurant, but I thoroughly enjoyed the infusion of the sauces with the rice.  

PENANG CHAR KWEI TEOW: Quite flavourful; however, I would've liked something spicier (however, this dish is not spicy at all).  My parents really enjoyed it.  Surprisingly, not too greasy.

COCONUT DRINK: Didn't get to try it, but my dad said it was really good.  Full of coconut.

TEH TARIK:  You MUST try the teh tarik.  The translation from Chinese is \"pulled tea.\"  It's basically milk tea, but there's a different flavour to it from your normal HK milk tea.  I would definitely recommend this.

Service (as opposed to what everybody else had said) was actually great for us.  They were always checking up on us, and the waitress that we had was very friendly.  Also, every time we cleared a dish, they were quick to come by to pick it up.

Would definitely come back to visit again."}
{"text":"Gourmet Malaysia used to be a take-out  counter just across the street from it's new location.  

  My parents and I have been long time customer and every time we go there, we always order the Penang Assam Laksa and Penang Char Kwei Teow along with a nice cold winter melon logan drink.

  Previously when Gourmet Malaysia was still in the take-out counter, the meals were around $6 but ever since it moved to it's new location, I find the price increased dramatically.  The portion sizes are much smaller now than before.  As well, when we used to order take out from the old location, it includes rice but now at the new location, no rice with take outs.

  Honestly, if it wasn't for the quality of the food, my parents and I wouldn't even go all the way to Scarborough to eat there !!  

  Also, like to let everyone know that Gourmet Malaysia now carries fresh beef balls and fish balls in there freezer located at the front new the cash desk.  I must admit there beef balls and fish balls are the BEST in TOWN !!!   Good for eating plain or for shabu shabu (hot pot).  Prices are $5/package."}
{"text":"Expensive only because the portion is small.
Taste is was say is not consistent because you get the fried noodles and rice and current chicken I would say decide to good. Everything else is down south. I would not recommend this place as going to one2 snake is much better in taste and price"}
{"text":"Ordered the Crispy Boxing Chicken, Mango Salad, Hainan Chicken on Rice and  Beef & Broccoli. 

Crispy Boxing Chicken: 6 crispy, seasoned drumettes w/ chili sauce. 

Mango Salad: tasty slivered mangoes w/ red onions, bell peppers and chili flakes, but still needed something. Luckily mangoes are good just by themselves.

Hainan chicken on rice: Probably not the best example of the dish, but still pretty tasty. Mix the chicken, rice, sauce, fresh veggies and included hot sauce together and you've got some great flavor on a spoon.

Beef & broccoli: not bad, but not their specialty. 

Note: I have no idea where they get their TV programming, but it's an odd collection of what I'm assuming is Chinese entertainment and Russia's Got Talent."}
{"text":"We came here based on the recommendation of Yelp.  We didn't know what to order, so when the waiters specifically recommended the appetizers platter and the Hainanese chicken, we gladly compiled.

The appetizer platter was the best dish of the evening.  The chicken and beef satay were tasty and tender.  We loved the thick sauce that went with the satay.  The mango salad was refreshing, hitting the right balance of sourness and sweetness.  The thai crab cake was spicy.  The spring rolls and shrimp rolls were average.

The Hainanese chicken was a bit over-cooked.  It was more \"boiled\" cooked than the one I remember from Singapore.  I thought the chicken was supposed to be soaked to cook (a much slower process to boiling).  Even so, the chicken was tender and the \"chicken oil\" rice tasty.  We were addicted to the spicy sauce that came with the chicken.  The portion size was average.

As for the restaurant, I found the interior decoration dated and resembled a Canadian-Chinese restaurant in a small town.  The lighting could be brighter.  The place was clean nevertheless.  The restaurant was not full, so unlike other Yelpers who found the services slow, we experienced reasonably attentive and effective service.  In terms of pricing, this place is more expensive than a Chinese restaurant (so there is no point to order Cantonese dishes here), but the pricing is in line with the other Malaysian restaurant on Midland Avenue.

I will return later to try their sambal and curry disles.  They are my favourite Malaysian dishes.

Overall, 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"My family moved to Malaysia when I was a kid and we lived there for over 10 years. We are always searching for good Msian food. This place hits the sweet spot with great dishes, fair prices and fantastic staff. We came for Family Day lunch and everyone was satisfied. Terima Kasih! We will be back! Your staff is tops - give them all a raise! Thank you"}
{"text":"Delicious Malaysian food.  This is the second time I've been here.

Today we had the Nasi Lemak, Roti Cannai, Hor Fun with Clam.  Everything was great tasting, finished everything leaving nothing behind.  The spice was just perfect.  Lots of selection on the menu .. I really wanted to try everything.  

While we were eating, there was some MLM presentation going on .... thankfully we were in the section furthest away from the noise.  We felt very bad for anyone suckered into these programs and losing their time and money, having been through this ourselves in the past.

Overall a great place with friendly staff and clean washrooms.  Can't wait to come back and try something new on the menu!"}
{"text":"Basic interior but fairly large space. Ordered the nasi lemak which was delicious, but the accompanying portions of chicken curry and ?fried fish curry were fairly small, but flavourful! Pad thai was slightly on the dry side but had no ketchup flavour, so its a win!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is evocative of a Southeast Asian canteen/food hall: clean yet no-frills in its decor, bustling with diners, efficient servers (albeit hard to get sometimes), tables at elbow-length proximity, large piping hot plates of food being churned out. It's truly a sight to behold, as it was on our visit for dinner on a Sunday night (Father's Day, no less). The prices are very reasonable for the family-style offerings, and the menu is a tome where even the pickiest of eaters will find something to whet their palate. 

We ordered appetizers of Mango Salad and Taiwanese Fish Cakes, and entrées of Sambal Chicken, Vegetable Mee Goreng, and Seafood Nasi Goreng with Belacan Sauce to share between the four of us. More than enough food; we even took some of it home! The food is delicious and quite comforting. 

You can't go wrong with this place if you know what you're getting; even if you don't you'll probably enjoy it! Can't wait to return and try more of these dishes!"}
{"text":"The interior leaves something to be desired, but the food is great.  Singapore laksa is amazing.  If ong choy is in season, they do it really well here.  The hainanese chicken is one of the better ones I have had and they serve it traditional and also fried."}
{"text":"I've dined her a half dozen times -- went back yesterday with a large group (20) from work and it was splendid.  We ordered in advance and occupied the private room in the back of the restaurant.  Standouts:  beef curry roti, coconut milk laksa, crispy beef.  Also quote good were the wide rice noodles with meat, the steamed fish with ginger, and the Singapore style noodle,  We had a veritable feast and it came to $20 a head.  service was superior (thanks Yvonne!).  Also, worth noting that Gourmet Malaysia is a halal establishment -- very pleasing to some of our party.   The roti alone is worth going back for."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at Gourmet Malaysia. The first time was a dine in experience which was okay. Nothing worth complaining about or mentioning either. Its Malaysian food but run by Chinese. The 2nd time around I opted to take-out. Had to wait about 10 minutes before my food was ready. I got some chicken skewers and curry chicken with roti/flat bread. I have to say for take-out the portions are really small. The container of curry sauce was really only enough for one flat bread but the dish comes with two. Meat portions were also very small. The skewers were also small but you did get a total of 6 skewers so I was happy about that. The dipping sauce was a bit weak in flavor from what I'm use to. All this came to about $15 after tax."}
{"text":"Normally we head to Restora Malay for our Malaysian food fix but in the interest of expanding both our locales and circuit of frequently visited restaurants, we found ourselves at Gourmet Malaysia.
It was a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy.  Service is very prompt and very friendly 

the menu is extensive - there are 100's of items to order from which can be a bit overwhelming.  I chose a Laksa and my husband a chicken satay dish and additionally we ordered roti cannai as well as a calamari....

The calamari was overly fried and way too salty.  I wouldn't order this again.
The roti cannai was very good.  The curry sauce a tad on the weaker side.
The seafood laksa was amazing - by far my favourite and the reason for my 4 star review.
My husbands chicken satay dish, he felt, was a let-down.  The chicken was spongy and the portion was TINY.

We were too full so didn't order dessert.  I would return for their Laksas and to try some other items on their menu."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the food, as I've never dined in. I've only tried the Mee Goreng, and it is amazing. It has a strong seafood flavour, if you don't enjoy seafood don't get it. It comes with a large quantity & is delicious. 

Sadly the prices have risen and this dish is pretty expensive now, but it can feed two. The dish is about $16 after tax. 

I've had other friends try the food here & they think it's amazing for Malaysian cuisine, but believe in general the prices are high. I'm sure to come back and try different dishes and review them after."}
{"text":"Went here last night and boy was the place packed!! By the end of the meal I understood why! We ordered everything from appetizers and soups to seafood, noodles, rice and chicken. The flavor was really good and the food was nice and spicy.  The satay beef and chicken were done well and the peanut sauce was good. The Tom Yum soup was large for the large size and enough for 8 people. It was also well flavored, nice and tingly! 

The service was excellent throughout and even though it was packed the dishes were served quickly and in the right order. The appetizers literally came out in 5 mins of ordering them! 

For the main we had rice, noodles, fish, shrimp, chicken curry, and some beef curry. Don't really remember the name of all the dishes. 

Also the owner was very nice and checked in on us at the end of the meal and also sang a short karaoke song, so A+ for customer satisfaction. 

Will definitely visit again and recommend..."}
{"text":"Tip!! Check in for 10% off if paying cash over $25. 

The food was tasty, a bit salty for some dishes but not too bad. With a party of 3 we ordered 4 dishes and a bowl of coconut rice. The coconut flavour could be stronger for the rice.

I got another rice dish but it was a bit too salty. The bill came up to $60 tax and tips in for 4 dishes and a rice. 

They have wifi but must ask for password. The servers were very nice and attentive. Would comeback."}
{"text":"Apparently my parents told me I ate here when I was a little kid, so this place has at least been around for 20 years. After passing by here for the first time in a long while (I'm rarely in this area of Scarborough), I decided to have dinner with my dad a few weeks later.

This restaurant may be 20+ years old, but the interior is actually quite nice. It's quite modern, but nothing too flashy that might rub off it being all hype. I ended up having spring rolls, chicken satay, poh pia, nasi lemak, and Singapore Laksa.

Everything that I ordered was delicious with the exception of the chicken satay. Since I've also been to Restoran Malaysia I can offer some form of comparison between the two Malaysian giants, and personally I would stick to Restoran for the satay stuff. However the spring rolls, poh pia and nasi lemak were definitely top notch and unique for someone who's not experienced with Malaysian cuisine. Finally, the Singapore laksa was decent, however it didn't have the yellow noodles; only the rice noodles. Most of the laksas I've eaten usually have both kinds, so I was somewhat not used to having only rice noodles.

Service was wishy-washy; they certainly welcome you well and give you the menus, but it was hard to flag down someone to take down the order or asking for the bill, since there wasn't a lot of staff and the place is quite big.

Overall, Gourmet Malaysia is good for anything non-satay, at least so far from my \"first\" visit. I'll definitely try more things and expand on this review."}
{"text":"We ordered chilli chicken, Malaysian beef sataty, nasser goran fried rice and Malaysian noodles. To be honest the food was good big portions but I didn't really feel a wow factor. The chilli chciken looked horrible compared federicks no comparison the beef is just Okay there was nice flavor my favorite was the fried rice if I was to come back here again I would just get the nassegoran fries rice."}
{"text":"I am so satisfied,  leaving the restaurant with a smile on my face.  The Rojak is the best. .. It tastes so good.   The Hanan chicken rice is so tasty.  The chicken is tender and juicy while the rice is piping hot and very flavorful.   The beef satay is very tasteful by itself and the belachan orkra is superb.  Definitely will come Asian when I visit Toronto again in October."}
{"text":"Easy to find, tons of parking near the supermarket at the back. They are halal, which really complimented some people in our 14 person group. The restaurant is spacious and great for large groups. The staff are nice and attentive for the most part. They added service button machines at each table which helps. We even got to hear the birthday song in a high pitch voice played on the TVs a couple of times that night.

The food menu is huge - they cover 4-5 different cultures of food. Based on what others got around me, they are generous with their portions. The laksa and fried rice dishes are huge. I had the roti chicken dish, which is one of the menu items that was considered to be smaller portions. It was still very filling for me. I love the roti they make here, it tasted very fresh and crispy. 

They unfortunately do not do separate bills, but we managed :) Overall we enjoyed our time here. It's a very 3.5 star experience."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews.  Not a bad place but I think you can do better in the city.

Pros:
Lots of Malaysian dishes to choose from
Plenty of seating

Cons:
Dishes in comparison to other places could be better

We were feeling Malaysian and we knew about this place in the past because we frequent the Chinese places around the area here a lot.  Based on the reviews we went in with some expectations.  We were immediately seated on a Saturday night even though the place was busy because they have ample seating here.

We ordered the sambal chicken, beef rendang with petai, curry laksa and a seafood rice noodle for our little one to munch on. The food comes out rather quickly and here are some thoughts on the first three:

sambal chicken:  This dish was too tomato-y and didn't have enough sambal sauce taste to it.  I had a better sambal taste at congee wong with one of their noodles.

beef rendang: This was probably my favourite of the four. Too bad the portions are minuscule.  It was served on a side dish plate with about 10-12 pieces of beef.

curry laksa:  Lemongrass on Bayview had one of the best laksas I've ever had and I use that as a benchmark.  The laksa here was OK, but the soup was definitely not as rich as it could be.

All in all, the dishes were OK but they all could of been better.  If I had never had Malaysian food before, I think I would rated these much higher.  Because I have something to compare to, it made it a bit tougher on this place.

The prices here are pretty good.  Most non-seafood dishes here are under $10.  I like this place but I admit I have my favourites elsewhere.  It's still a nice place to go to for a south east Asian meal."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets in terms of \"authentic\" Malaysian cuisine.   The food is great, but the atmosphere has little to be desired.  Their service was also subpar.  But hey, it's a Malaysian Restaurant!  When I go back home, we eat on the dirty filthy streets with dirty filthy tables, but the food is still just as good.  Lolz...  So, I wasn't really surprise.  I go for the \"food\" and  there are a few key dishes that hits my heart each time: their curry, laksa, satay, and roti.   
On a side note, I wished they made a better nasi lemak wrapped in pandan leaves.  Will definitely come back again when I feel like I'm missing home."}
{"text":"Food is meh at best. Service comes with bad attitude."}
{"text":"3.5 I came with a friend for lunch on a weekend, there was plenty of seats. First impressions: your usual Asian restaurant in Scarborough, old school run down place your parents would bring you to for casual dinner.
We ordered beef skewers,  Char Kwey Teow (Fried rice noodle with mixed seafood) and a Roti with Chicken Curry.
Food came fast and was generally quite delicious.
The beef skewers were tender, well seasoned and the satay sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and nutty with a mild kick.
Char Kwey Teow tasted like Cantonese fried beef noodle, but with beef, shrimp, squid and fish cake. Portion was very generous but I think the proteins were lacking in quantity. It tasted good, wasn't excessively greasy and not dry.
The roti and curry was REALLY good. A warm flaky roti is the key to my heart for Malaysian food. Curry was not thick but coats the roti well. It wasn't too spicy and very tasty. HOWEVER, I noticed some of the \"chicken\" I was eating was actually beef brisket. I know this is offered as both chicken and beef option so at first I thought they just got the order wrong...but both proteins were found in there so it weirded me out a bit. Both were delicious and tender so I didn't say much. (Those with dietary restrictions should beware.)
For similar foods, I find prices slightly on the higher end. 6 beef skewers were priced above $10. My friend who has been coming for years noted there has been a price hike of a good 15-20% since she last came."}
{"text":"amazinggggggg food. good service. Most items I have tried here are soooo guuuuud. I recommend:

-roti with chicken (the most garlicky and fluffy roti.. just so good)
-special fried fish #64 forget what its called this is by far the yummiest.. the broth is tomatoey and the fish had so much flavour infused I didn't know fish could taste like that (and I eat lots of fish). At the same time the texture of the meat was sooo soft and the outside skin was soo crispy! 
-spicy chicken skewers (dry rub. flava flava!!) 
-hainan rice (a lil hint of ginger) 
-coconut rice

They honoured their 10% off check in, which was a plus!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for a while now to see how it this place compares to my favourite Malaysian place One2 Snacks just down the road.  You know how when you have something so good that anything else is ruined for you forever?  Well that is how bad One2 Snacks has ruined Malaysian places for me:(

We came on a Sunday night around 730pm and the place was pretty full.  The menu was really extensive and indicated which dishes were spicy or had peanuts which is a huge plus for families like us with a member with severe peanut allergies.

In terms of the food itself it was okay but nothing spectacular.  The laksa had way too much coconut milk and char kway teow has almost no protein in it which was too bad as I was looking forward to enjoying it.  On the plus side the Hainanese chicken rice and the roti canai with curry chicken were pretty good and service was quick and attentive.

But overall we didn't enjoy our meal that much and most likely won't be back anytime soon especially since One2 is just down the road:("}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the customer service here. They were very polite and prompt. They even have those buttons where you find in Korean restaurants to call the server over, however there service button had options for the bill, to order, etc. 

The food was decent, I got the beef rendeng with Hainan rice on the side. ($13.99 plus $2.00 for Rice). The flavoring had a lot of layers and penetrated through the meat. I found the pieces of meat were too fatty and also a lot of cartilage/tendon.

FYI if you check in you get 10% off your total if its over $25 before tax. Keep in mind you have to pay cash to get this deal. 

If I'm in the area I would come back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be much better before the renovation. 

I went there last week with my family hoping to have my favorite me java noodles there (not sure how to pronounce it), but when I arrived, I found out that the store was renovated and their menu changed. They no longer carry many of the food items they used to.

I ordered a Chicken Pad thai and a Stir fry Chow Guai Tieu noodles and to our suprise the ingredients in both dishes were the sames. The only difference is that the pad thai had a tomato sauce lol...

Not planning to return any time soon imo."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken curry with roti and pad Thai. Chicken curry was a red curry, very flavourful but it was the roti that really stood out. The roti was very crispy yet soft in the middle layer. The pad Thai was average, it didn't have much meat but it was quite flavourful (not the most authentic though). 

Not the most authentic place since a lot of dishes seem to have Chinese fusion but the dishes we tried were good nonetheless (considering it wasn't very pricey). 

I've never seen a menu that has so many choices. Even the lunch specials had over 30 choices, all averaging $10 a dish (includes either ice tea or hot tea). 

Service was fast but there were only a few patrons in the restaurant. Easy to find location but parking lot is small."}
{"text":"Just got back from another orgastronomic experience at Gourmet Malaysia.

The roti chanai is a MUST.  The roti (reminded me of a superlative paratha) was not greasy, flaked gently into the luscious curry sauce (vegetarian).  Only comment:  curry sauce could have been hotter (temperature).  But 5 stars for sure for the roti itself.

Now for the star of the show:  the Assam Laksa.  It is an \"acquired\" taste, i.e. salty, fishy, sour, sweet, tangy - big bold flavours that just meld into one luscious bowl of gorgeousness.  The noodles are OK, but its the melange of flavours that are perfectly balanced.  Pieces of mackerel in there and REAL GALANGAL!!!  Perfect amount of belachan.  You can buy your pandan sweets here, Friends!  Also have kelapa (coconut) cookies and luscious treats from Indonesia - i.e. krupuk.  My tea Tarik was ok, and rounded off the meal perfectly.

Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"Good little change up from the plethora of Asian food in Scarborough. Went with the family and some friends and had the app platter which had great chicken and beef satay sticks and excellent mango salad. 

The roti was excellent. All the dishes were flavourful. I would go back again.

Service was friendly and the food generally came out quickly. Except white rice which we ordered but we had to specifically ask to be brought. Decor is typical, albeit a little dim. The disco dance stage at the back of the restaurant was interesting and a magnet for kids. 

Dropped off 2 stars since I called to make reservations and got told it was busy - so I couldn't make one. Decided to go anyways and when I walked in, got asked if I \"had reservations?\" I hate it when people, let alone businesses vacillate between what they say/ do. 

Btw it was busy but there were 5-6 open tables."}
{"text":"My girlfriend had been talking about taking me here for authentic Indonesian/Malaysian food for months now, and I'm glad I finally came. We shared the nasi goreng (Indonesian fried rice), the penang char kway teoy, and the deep fried squid in fragrant spices. The squid was tender and flavourful, and both the rice and noodle dishes definitely impressed. They used to be located in the food court across the street and were wildly popular, but according to my girlfriend, who had been a regular there for years, the quality's only gotten better. 5/5 stars, would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for some authentic Indonesian/Malaysian food that tastes great and actually fills you up."}
{"text":"Don't expect much w/ the decor/ambiance. You are purely here for the food. It was the best Malaysian food I've ever had !! Definitely cannot wait to be back. Service was also good. Now if only I remember what the dishes were... I could eat here everyday! 

Price wise, reasonable. There was lots of parking as well."}
{"text":"Me and the family went for dinner after reading the misleading reviews here.
It turned out to be an extremely disappointing exp.
Now ive had great malay food outside Canada. This was the first one we tried in toronto or even Canada, and it was far from gourmet!

Firstly  the ambiance:  stained rundown carpets, ordinary setting but nice hustle bustle(granted everyone have their culinary standards/ palates)

2ndly: service: although the waiters cleaned up and gave us the tables promptly, they kept us waiting for nearly 30 min. Very annoying because we could see them either chilling out behind the counters or just conversing among themselves but wouldnt pay any attention to my raised hand and the check out lady droped the receipt on the counter rather than placing it in my hand as she was too busy chatting away with other staff, lady.. a little smile and eye contact would have been courteous. 

3rdly food: I dont know if anyone of the previous reviewers had actual rotis, but the ones this joint serves are just frozen  parathas (frozen indian flatbread found in ethnic grocery stores). thawed in the microwave.  the actual gourmet malays ive been to artistically bake rotis in front of their patrons!

Nasi goreng was something anyone could whip up after a quick 30 sec youtube flick. chicken curry very bland, watery.

But my biggest disappointment was the sizzling beef, which was well not sizzling!! when asked the waiter said in a puzzled tone \"we keep it aside as its too hot\"???

the staff overall score poor on communication, I had to make the sizzling sound to make him understand was sizzling was, this young gentleman had obviously no clue.

Well me and the Mrs agreed never venturing to this part of the Town as it may re-sizzle our culinary trauma. 

I said it before and ill say it again.....never again."}
{"text":"Satays are good and the oyster  pancake is bang for your buck nut last time i had it ouster was chewy and not edible.  Tom yum soups and laksa are worth trying too"}
{"text":"Great food and great price.  Even my kids loved it.  Only downside was they sat us too close to another party, as if sharing the tables."}
{"text":"In the middle of Scarborough and in the depths of Asian food territory, this Malaysian restaurant is a great place to be. The food is affordable and I highly recommend the curry with roti and the chicken skewers. This place offers a great deal for everyone on a budget. We ordered a few more items on the menu and were not disappointed. I would however take off 1 star because the veggies we ordered were not very fresh. It tasted a little old. Parking is also a little bit of a hassle though. There aren't enough parking spaces for the restaurant. But overall it was a good experience!!"}
{"text":"One of the good places in Scarborough that id recommend. It's in one of the those big plaza so parking definitely not an issue. Not a lot of Malaysian food place in the gta but this one u have to go. I love their roti curry and  porkchop!! Cash only though"}
{"text":"I've honestly only gone here for the chicken curry roti. It's so good and the roti is made to perfection. $8.89 dinner with three pieces of roti. During lunch they have a cheaper price! It's usually really busy in the evening after 630. Pretty dead before that and there's so many tables you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends here last week.  The restaurant was a good size and great for large groups.  The waitress was nice and greated us upon entry allowing us to chose seating.  We ordered a few dishes to share and enjoy and believe me we all enjoyed it.  Every item was flavorful and presented nicely, the beef satay's was tender and the peanut sauce that came with it was perfect even though the meat portion was a little small.  If you don't like peanut sauce the satay itself was flavorfully marinated.  Mee goreng with chicken was delish, flavour was balanced and I could have finished it all by myself.  Loved the coconut rice.  Hands down the seafood maylasian fried rice was everyone's favourite.  Good amount of seafood and so good.  Hunan chicken rice is one of my all time favourites and it was delish.  The red sauce is a little different but still yummy.  The ginger is the star, loved it, missed the green onion a bit but fully enjoyed it.  The grass jelly drink was perfect, no milk as some might serve it with. The jelly was not in cubes but rather shreds, a little different but just as good.  The chilli chicken was not as spicy as I have had, the chicken was thinly sliced and tasty.  I had the seaweed soup which reminded me of mom's cooking.  The food came quick and there were people coming and going during our time there.  Will definitely be coming back to try more items."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I've been looking for authentic Singapore laksa in Toronto for a long time. I found this my favorite dish in this restaurant. The sweet and spicy flavored soup, thin rice noodles and ingredients were really good, and the dish came in generous size. The servers were pretty nice as well. The only problem was there were some flies near the windows, very hard to chase away. That was quite disturbing."}
{"text":"Good food.
Authentic.

We had the mango salad and chicken satay which is 6 skinny kebobs. We also had the chicken and shrimp fried rice, ayam billis (we requested no fish) and mee goreng noodles in sambal sauce (we requested chicken instead of seafood).  

It all tasted good. Sensible portions that could be shared between 3 to 4  people.  The only problem with this place is that a number of the menu items are in a different language. They don't have descriptions of what the dishes are.

They included some kind of 10% service fee on the reciept. So I was aware of that and didn't give a tip on top of that.

This place gets suuuuuuper busy in the weekend evenings, so make a reservation if possible or come at another time. 

*I recommend the mee goreng noodles in sambal sauce, but with chicken. Its a kinda sweet n savoury n spicy taste*


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh wow I never gave this place a review? Probably a 4 star 5 to 10 years ago but now...

Yay: 
\"decent\" Malay food in Scarborough
 Large portions
 Few places with chendol drink

Nay:
 prices increased a lot, Esp for the chendol which is 8 bucks now!?!?

I live near restoran Malaysia restaurant and it used to be worth the drive but now... No thanks. Expensive and not that great. The roti doesn't seem that fresh and small portions, restoran Malaysian much better. The noodles isn't the thick ones for the stir fry noodles \"Chow gwai dew\".

They do have lots of vegetarian choices but yeh... Nothing decent and worth the money that stood out... Probably won't come again."}
{"text":"One of the best places so far for an authentic Malaysian cuisine....I've had my share of my favorite places here in New York and I can honestly say, this place DELIVERS!!!!

Their curries have a distinct taste that sets them apart from the other cuisines .Their Belacan  dishes are my favorite. Beef/Chicken Satay, Roti Pratha, Laksa  and the Salted large Shrimps with hot sauce, Mee Goreng.., Hainan Chicken...and the Crispy Squid...

Enjoyed the food, will I go back again...You bet!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly, this place serves some really good Malaysian food. I loved my roti with creamy curry sauce. The service was friendly and prompt. The food variety is great and every dish looks yummy. Just check out the pics on Yelp. I'll be sure to stop by next time I'm in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I ordered Malaysian Laksa. 
The taste of the curry was flavourful and bold. However there was just so much noodles that I had to take some out, or else it would have absorbed all the  soup. The noodle itself could have well fed 3 people. They were generous on the toppings though. Overall, it tasted good and would order again. 

We shared the Hainese rice. It was so delicious, and could have been the best rice I ever had!

Taste wise, I would have given this restaurant 4.5 stars until I found this surprise at the bottom of the rice dish it came in... (refer to pix) then I just couldn't eat afterwards. 

Also you have to pay cash if you want to take advantage of the yelp discount."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic for the price. Four gals shared the sampler appetizer. My main was delicious. Photo included. Even though the item doesn't have a spicy chili photo beside it, it will be spicy especially their curries for non spicy eaters. The place would have been 5 star if service was better. It doesn't hurt to come by and ask if we needed anything else or refill the tea. Otherwise great Malay place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This Malaysian restaurant has some decent tasting dishes to offer. However I feel like it was overpriced for the portion of food you get. Service was very slow as well. I'll probably be finding a new Malaysian restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good.  Their menu is HUGE!  So many choices.   But the two things I wasn't too fond of were the fact that for most of the dishes you had to order the curry, rice or noodles separately.  And the fact that the menu didn't describe the dishes.  We had to ask our waitress what each of the dishes were. Luckily for us, our waitress was amazing and patiently told us what the dishes we were interested in consisted of and made some good recommendations. As for the atmosphere and service, they were pretty good.  Overall, this restaurant is a good place to go for dinner with friends or family.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again:)"}
{"text":"how is it even possible that my order of steamed rice arrive 30 minutes after the main course arrived when they were both ordered at the same time AND after I reminded them 5 times.

They were amazing as Gourmet Garden.  However, when they moved, they removed their service quality."}
{"text":"Drop by for lunch today again..... 

If you can eat in, don't do take out as the eat in portion is huge!

Mee Jave ($6.50)
- a cross between a broth based and a stir fried noodle
- yellow noodles still has this chewy al dente texture
- the gravy is spicy and slightly sweet curry-like 

Mango Salad ($4.99)
- Fish sauce, cilantro and chili pepper dressing
- anchovy as garnish
- the fresh chili pepper can be really spicy which I love!

The staffs really need more training! They are nice and trying but seems like most of them has minimum experience in the business."}
{"text":"This is a large restaurant that offers delicious Malaysian food blended with other flavours. I love places like this because the menu is limitless, family size portions, and it's inexpensive. This is great for groups because of its size and caters to people with dietary restrictions. It's halal and offers customizable options. Be aware that not all the servers are knowledgable of their food as we had to ask several people. A lot of them also don't speak much English so that may have also been a problem. Things that could be improved are the decor, but they get a thumbs up for being clean. Service can be quite slow and servers inattentive even on off-days.

Some things I really enjoyed are their satay skewers, mango salad, and roti cannai with chicken, beef, or veggie curry - all of them are delicious. Their noodles are also quite yummy. I like both the Penang char kwei teow and Mee goreng yellow noodles with seafood. Substitute chicken if you aren't a fan of seafood.

I recommend you pull up a chair with a sizeable group, order multiple dishes, and see what you like."}
{"text":"If you want good Malaysian food in scarborough then this is the place to be.  They have a huge selection of Malaysian dishes to choose from.

Also their roti is the bomb!  Their food is delish and tasty!  I also love that they have a huge selection of vegetarian dishes.  A must try :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends a few months ago after seeing good reviews on Yelp. The portions at Gourmet Malaysia are decent and generally the food was pretty good too. Service is meh. It could be better, but I have no specific complaints.

The only reason why I'm giving three stars is because I made a bad choice in the dish I ordered. I can't remember what it was anymore, but there was an extremely fishy taste to it. The other dishes my friends ordered were good. I would come back to try another dish if I got the chance."}
{"text":"In Toronto, this is where you can get some of the most authentic Malaysian food. They have great dishes like laksa, nasi lemak, roti, nyonya kueh, and more. If it were a restaurant in Malaysia, I don't think it would fare as well, but for a small taste of home, it's great!

They used to be a small cafeteria across the street and became a full restaurant a few years back. I think the quality was better then and the prices were cheaper."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Malaysian food.  Either the taste is weird, or the quantity is not worth its costs.  So i was a bit hesitant when a friend suggested Gourmet Malaysia.   
Situated in Scarborough, i like how the restaurant has free parking.   The restaurant itself is pretty large, so it can accommodate big parties of people.  Another cool fact about this restaurant is that it sells Malaysian packaged snacks for you to take home with you.  
As for food, i ordered Hainanese chicken rice.  I had high expectations since it's my heritage.  The food came and i was happy that the portion was decent.  When i tried the chicken rice, it tasted pretty good.  The sauce was really nice with the chicken.  It also came with a bowl of soup, just like the way Hainanese chicken rice should be served. 
My friends and i also ordered desserts.  Ice kachang is a popular dish in Malaysia.  It's shaved ice with different syrups for flavoring,  along with other ingredients such as jelly, beans, and corn.  It came in a big bowl, and my friends and i all dug in and thoroughly enjoyed every single spoonful that went into our mouths.  Another dessert that we ordered is called Apam Balik.  It's like pancake with peanuts between the layers.  I haven't had this since i left Malaysia, so i was pleasantly surprise to see this item on the menu.  It was served warm,  and tasted so amazing.  
The service was ok.  Food came quickly.  The servers basically left us alone the whole time.  
Now that i have experienced this gem, i will definitely bring my family here.  They are tough critics, but i think they will like it here."}
{"text":"Environment and food food was excellent. Was not impressed with the service. Prices are reasonable for the place. Will go again"}
{"text":"A Scarborough gem!

Do you want to eat somewhere fancy or do you want to eat somewhere with great food? I always choose the latter and I choose Gourmet Malaysia. 

They have a have a very large menu but I'd stick to what they do best (at least in my opinion). 

For starters, I always get the Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce. This is one my favourite places to get Satay in Scarborough. I prefer chicken, but my friends have been a fan of the beef as well. HOT TIP: order the Roti Cannai with Chicken Curry to start as well. Even though this isn't a starter, I like to order it at the beginning since the two rotis you get is hardly enough to finish the curry, so you can eat the curry with the other food you order. The chicken curry is warm and comforting while the roti is a little crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. 

For the mains, my top three recommendations are the Singaporean Laksa, Nasi Lemak and Hainanese Chicken with Rice. Singaporean Laksa is a large portion of creamy and flavourful noodle soup and in my opinion one of the best Laksa in the GTA. If you're a fan of spicy or just battling a cold, mix in a little (or a lot) of chili oil into the soup. The Nasi Lemak is a coconut milk rice dish served with chicken curry, cucumber, egg, and of course fried anchovy sambol. Please don't be put off by the anchovies; it's honestly what makes the dish special. The anchovies don't have a strong fish taste and goes really well with the coconut rice. Finally, I only recently discovered the Hainanese Chicken with Rice and can now say it's my favourite. It's a very simple dish that reminds me of a home cooked meal. The portion size is good for one person or to share between two people, you can always ask for more rice if it's not enough. 

I'm not a fan of desserts or sweets, but the company I'm with always raves about their Chendol and Durian Ice. Chendol is too sweet for me and really hard to drink down after a big meal but you'll see a lot of people ordering this and it's worth a try just to see what it's all about."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch and dinner, the food is amazing. Quality and taste consistent with every visit. The decor is really tacky but it feels like a family restaurant. The service needs improvement, the staff appears to be very busy and it takes a while to get their attention.

Overall, will definitely come back for more food."}
{"text":"Today was quite a pleasant surprise for us at Gourmet Malaysia.  Have not been here in a while because the last experience here was not that great.  However since we were in the area, we decided to give it another chance and it was really quite good.  

We had the Nasi Lemak, Seafood char kway teow and Sambal Belachan green bean.  The prices were reasonable and lunch selection was extensive too.  
Service was very quick and they even include a hot tea or lemon tea with your dish.  They have at least 20 selections for lunch combos which is plenty for the average price of $7.50-9.  

For $8.50, I would say this place offered a very tasty lunch and speedy service.  If you are rushing and want to eat something good and fast and do not feel like junk food, then drop by here when you're in the Scarborough area.  

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I always love Malaysian food, this is one of the go to craving restaurant. Why 4 star?! Everyone needs room for improvement!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite joints for Malaysian food in the area, I like ordering the curry with roti as the roti is very crispy and buttery. The curry is also very flavourful and delicious. I have also tried their Singaporean laksa which is just the right amount of spicyness and also a wrapped rice dish with peanuts, meat and dried fish. It is spacious in the restaurant and the food is all very authentic and decently priced."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a taste of what Indonesian food is, in the city with no Indonesian restaurants, you might find something at Gourmet Malaysia. The owners: The wife is Malay and the husband is Indonesian. As a result, some Indonesian dishes get featured on their fairly extensive menu. On our recent visit he came by to talk to us and I saw he made an effort to visit other tables to chat as well. 

Our table of four wanted to try a mix of Indo and Malay food:

chicken satay - yummy! moist and comes with chunky peanut-based sauce
sambal ikan bilis - if you like those little dried sardines and heat, you might like this
eggplant nonya style - not too bad, the sauce is petis-based (fermented tiny shrimp paste)
laksa - it was alright, broth was good, fillings could use some work. I would say that restoran malaysia's version is better.
soto ayam - pretty disappointed in their version of indo chicken ..the broth lacked complexity and the fillings were all wrong (vermicelli instead of glass noodle, not enough flavour using chicken breast for this dish, no cabbage, no fried onion, very little bean sprouts, and tomatoes?? ) 

The place is huge so great for large gatherings.. I find it weirdly funny having some dancing MJ in the background screen with disco lights going but apparently they have wii parties on friday nights.."}
