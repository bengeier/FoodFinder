{"text":"BEWARE!!! So last night my girlfriend and I needed something quick to eat and decided to go here. It was terrible in the worst way. The soda system was having a problem and did not taste right. Later finding out that it was broken and was not putting syrup into the drinks. Did they tell customers, NO. Kept right on servicing everyone. The food was horrid and we both got sick later on the evening, not fun for food poisoning. We called the place the next day and said we wanted to speak to a manager (which was not there the night before) to complain. We were on hold for over 10 minutes. So we call corporate, we ask for a refund and are told 3-6 weeks for someone to process and maybe refund. We were also told that it was not a grave matter, no one actually died. Wow, poor customer service all around."}
{"text":"The woman that was working drive thru tonight (I think Beverly, dark hair, late 30's/early 40's) had amazing customer service. She was energetic, positive and extremely apologetic when we had to wait for part of our order. We waited less than 5 minutes for the rest of our very large order. From the beginning of our order to the end of our exchange when she brought the rest of the food out to our car she was smiling and happy. Beverly is an amazing employee and I hope you have a few more just like her on your staff! I'm sure her job is not easy especially on late shift but her personality and attitude would suggest that she loves where she works and is happy. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. Late night snack  thanks to the drive thru attendant, Maria"}
{"text":"Worst. Service. EVER at a Carl's Jr. Never have my son & I had a problem using two coupons for two people until tonight, even at this location. The cashiers (especially the lady) were SO rude about it, we ended up leaving without our food. Tried to ask the lady a question and she just walked away, while the kid at the the register (who looked like he was training) was clueless. So aggravating. Will be calling management in the morning."}
{"text":"I stopped here strictly by accident a few weeks ago. 

We have a Carl's Jr near our house and we go there occasionally. This one was advertising that they were also a Green Burrito. So I thought, why not?

First, the employees here a friendly and very helpful. They clearly like their jobs and working at Carl's Jr. The food on the other hand, as the review indicates is only Two Stars. And, yes \"Meh, I've experience better.\"

My expectations were only in the Taco Bell range and sadly I wasn't disappointed. It was pretty basic. About two years ago, around Super Bowl time Carl's Jr introduced Chicken Strips. They were Four Stars outstanding. Now, they're barely Three Stars. 

What's changed is the size and freshness of the chicken strips themselves. I'm sure Tyson, or whoever was the vendor was told to reduce their size. They did and now I'll pass on them in the future. Its too bad, because they were better than the Colonel or Popeye's!"}
{"text":"Normally carls jr has some of the better fast food burgers around but this visit was quite different.  I only live 4 minutes away but when I got home the burger was almost cold.  I ordered a double and got a single, and the patty was super dry and quite tasteless.  The fresh baked bun was the best thing about the burger."}
{"text":": (
Hubby was craving Carl's burger and we were in this neighborhood, so we ended up here...
A few odd things...
Hubby had the Western burger and I had the bacon guacamole $6 dll burger... Staff was friendly, food was OK. Mine had a strong flavor, like cumin (I guess I do not like cumin very much) but I didn't know if it came from the guacamole or something else.

My sweet potato fries (large) were like half. While the container was flat on the tray it looked full, but once I picked it up... I swear, it was almost half...
Hubby had the criss cross ones and that was reasonably full, but the odd thing is that he asked for large but the receipt said medium.
Straws? They only had short straws by the fountain drinks, which barely stick out of the large cups, like a cm or less... I went and asked if they had long straws and they immediately gave me a couple from behind the counter... o.O

Like some other yelper mentioned, the tables, seats and floor look like greasy... 

Aaaaand, to top it off, my hubby noticed a bug behind me... and it looked to me like a tiny roach (like 2mm).... : ( those brown ones with a yellow spot...

Yuck... please remind me not to stop here ever again... : ("}
{"text":"Carl's Jr....now serving Turkey Burgers.....HUH!!!!! So naturally I had to go and try it because I simply love Turkey Burgers....and I have to say this one was pretty good for a fast food restaurant. They may be on to something here....because no else makes one....McDonald's nope....BK....nope....Culver's....nope....Wendy's.....nope....Jack n the box.....nope....I think you get my point. I had the guacamole Turkey Burger and it was surprisingly good.....now don't get me wrong it wasn't great like the one I had at True Food Kitchen (read my review on that) or any other I have had....but in a pinch it will do. 

The restaurant itself was pretty clean....but it caters looks like to mostly old people and homeless people....didn't care for that really....but again who does. However if your looking for a decent Turkey Burger give this one a try....i think you will be pleasantly surprised. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is dirty, and the food was not like other Carls Jr. I would not go to this location again or recommend anyone else does either. The benches were sticky, the floor was sticky, they were out of straws, the bathroom smelled to all high heaven as well."}
{"text":"The food and service are fine.   I occasionally stop in the dining room which has way more schizos and meth heads than customers.   Random homeless round out the rest of the crowd.   Sometimes they will sit with you uninvited.   Today one is singing and clapping loudly by himself.  Another is face down in his food asleep.   Just keep in mind if planning to bring a family here."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr is my guilty pleasure place for burgers. They make it when you order it so service is a bit slower than your usual fast food place but, it is worth it. I actually crave their fries after a long day at work!"}
{"text":"It's a fast food joint with food that's bad for me. Their Big Carl and waffle fries are two of my guilty pleasures I indulge in and then feel guilty about. But the Big Carl beats the heck out of the Big Mac. Plus they deliver your food to your table! If you use the drive through at lunch time, there is usually a super, friendly women with a heavy accent taking your order. I am terrible with accents and usually need her to repeat herself but she is always very patient with me. It might help to have someone who speaks English more clearly at the drive through though."}
{"text":"My husband went thru the drive thru last weekend.  Driver thru attendant repeated the order, charged for the complete order, but when my husband got home they had only given him half of the order.  There are many other choices for burgers in Phoenix - I suggest you pass on this one."}
{"text":"This location sucks... Show up at 10:32AM can't serve breakfast... I have been to other locations at closer to 11 and they'll still make me breakfast... Then the bro in the intercom system called me \"homie\"... What a joke. You all need to jump on the all day breakfast bandwagon and hire some more intelligible staff. I mean they do want $15/hr. You don't get one star because of all the other awesome Carl's Jr.'s but this one, I won't be back \"homie\"."}
{"text":"I know. Seriously, who writes a review about a fast-food place, unless maybe they hated it so much they have to get their 1-star venom out of their system.

Right off I'll make it clear I am no fan of fast food places and will do anything I can to avoid them. Today was one of those days I actually needed something FAST because I was on my way to pick up a friend at the airport and I was starving.  And Carls Jr happened to be the first place I saw.

So what's up with giving them 5-stars?  Because whoever's running this location has to be doing more than just clocking in each morning.

The girl at the counter was friendly and it didn't seem like an act. I took a minute to read their ridiculously long menu board and she wasn't acting bored and wishing I would go away. Unfortunately, people like her working at a fast-food restaurant are almost non-existent. 

Carls is one of those few places that lets you sit down and they bring the food to you. The person who brought mine was another happy camper. The best news was when I unwrapped my Famous Star it looked good, no make that it looked great, like burgers look in TV commercials. I am so tired of burgers being thrown together sloppily by someone with their eyes half closed ... the person who assembled my burger gets an A for appetizing presentation skills.

The burger itself was huge and had taste, neither of which I've been able to say about McD's or BK.

To cap my visit off, within a few seconds after I finished eating the dining room attendant (or whatever you call him) walked all the way across the room, politely asked me if I was finished, and offered to dump my trash for me. No, seriously, he did ... at a fast-food joint!

I guess I was impressed enough to write a 5-star review, huh?"}
{"text":"I went through the drive through on a Monday morning around 10:00 AM.  It was not busy and there was one car ahead of me.  It took 10 minutes for my order of one item and at least 10 minutes for the car in front of me.  The serving employee did not apologize for the long service time and was generally oblivious to customer service."}
{"text":"So far been waiting for about 10 minutes and have not got any service. still have not got any knowledge meant from the staff that we were going to get served, his place either needs extra help or better people"}
