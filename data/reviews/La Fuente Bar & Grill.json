{"text":"The worst I ever had. Cheese dip tasted like it was cut with a lot of ranch! Salsa was defiantly cut with ketchup and Tapat√≠o. My fajitas came out cold and stuck to the plate no sizzle. My wife's taco plate tasted worst than taco day in high school. I didn't let my 2 year old touch our food. Buyer be ware!!!!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with the lack of a lunch menu because my intent was to order the \"Speedy with beans\" as I typically do at other family owned Mexican restaurants.  This wasn't a deal breaker though.  I ordered a large bowl of chicken soup that rivals any other chicken soup I've ever tasted, sorry Mom!  Mushrooms, avocado, cilantro, and a great \"chicken to rice ratio\" made this chicken soup worth trying.  The decor is par for the course, and servers were nice."}
{"text":"Great food. I've eaten here several times.  I always find the staff to be welcoming and the food to be excellent."}
{"text":"First time here, service was horrible, food was awful..the cheese dip tasted like it had added flour to it..it was a bad experience all the way around..over priced for the quality of food.Never will I be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love La Fuente. I always get the fajita borrito and my husband loves their chorizo chicken. My only complaint is they don't refill chips and drinks as often as they should. Went here the other day and we were out of tea as well as the couple adjacent to us. She did not ask us if we wanted refills untill way after we finished our meal. By then we just wanted our check, which was handled very promptly."}
{"text":"i came here today with my friends to have a good Mexicans meal i was very disappointed the rice tasted like used toilet paper. also my tomatoes were soggy and the queso was like old mayonnaise. not pleased i will never be returning to this establishment ever again, the waiter and waitress messed up our orders and couldn't speak fluent english so it was complicated to understand what he was saying. But the employees were still respectful and fixed everything they could. But all in all the service was absolutely terrific and the food was so good. The queso is the best of all time; i definitely recommend. #10/10"}
{"text":"Texans or others that know real mexican food beware- not good. We stopped b/c reviews were good & said authentic. Well Tortillas are store bought, salsa mild/no real flavor, chips thick- Margaritas are missing Tequila and fajitas are just ok.  We now live in Alabama and I would say the mexican food is equivalent to what I had in NC.  I lived both In Mexico & Texas before and this doesn't come close to good mexican."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. My taco had a nice aftertaste of lime, which was surprising but very yummy.  They had kids pizza which my son loved.  Enchilada does not come with the traditional red sauce but you won't miss it the food is so beautifully flavored."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  There was friendly service, good food, and great drinks.  What more to life is there?  The food was made with all fresh ingredients and was full of flavor.  Everything was just so good from the chips and salsa all the way to dessert.  The fajitas were fantastic, and their rice and beans are to die for.  They even have a chocolate chimichanga on the dessert menu, which is just as delicious as it sounds.  The waitress was very friendly and very personable, and she made sure everything was perfect for us.  It was just a great time all around."}
{"text":"I am really struggling with the other reviews on here for La Fuente.  I had one of the worse restaurant experiences in my life here a few weeks ago.    I went with my wife and two sons on a Saturday night around 5:30.  The place was pretty busy, but we were seated as soon as we walked in.  The waiter took a long time to come to our table.  When he finally did arrive we ordered our drinks and meal at the same time.  While waiting for our food, I looked around and noticed a large number of patrons without food (and empty drinks) looking unhappy.  After a good 45 minutes, our food started to arrive at the table in shifts.  Two out of the four of us actually were served the correct meal and half the food was cold.  I had to find my server to ask for the check (we had been there for almost 2 hours at this point).  He never did bring me the check - the rest of the family had left the restaurant to go shopping.  I finally asked the manager for the bill.  The server had charged us for several items that never came to the table.  Another 10 minutes went by until they could figure out what to charge me.  This \"experience\" took about 2.5 hours of my life.  This was the first and last time I will go to this restaurant.  Maybe you will have a good experience like some of the other reviews on here and maybe you will have a bad one like mine.  Is it worth rolling the dice?  I don't think so.  There are too many other great restaurants in the area to waste your time and money at La Fuente."}
{"text":"I wish I could've rated La Fuente higher.  Though simple, the restaurant has a nice vibe; service was good and attentive; prices were fair, and portions were generous.  Here's the problem: the overuse of an MSG like food additive in *all* of their food - even the salsa.  Instead of enhancing the natural flavors of the food, it took away from what should have been a tasty meal.  While I wouldn't turn anyone away from La Fuente, for this reason alone, it's doubtful that I'll go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for family dining, went with a large group and the food came out all at once and everyone enjoyed their food. My boyfriend's fajita nachos had more vegetables than he would be liked but not a huge deal. My pollo la crema was very cheesy which made it perfect for using nachos and making it an impromptu dip! I did admittedly pick a lot of onions out of mine but again not a huge deal. Will probably stick to other Mexican restaurants in the future."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food here.  Out of all the mexican restaurants in gastonia, I would choose this room.  Usually packed though, which is a sign of how good it is."}
{"text":"Holy awful. The worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been.  You call that a Margarita?  It was shameful. The food didn't taste bad. It just had no taste at all.  This place wouldn't last a week where I'm from."}
{"text":"La Fuente is my second best place to go to for mexican food. I always order the same thing, which is a fajita burrito with chicken. You definitely get a family feel when you're at this restaurant. Only complaint I have is service a lot of times is either slow or not always there 100%. I've been in there on more than 1 occasion where they've had only 1 waitress catering to all the tables at once. However, everyone is always very nice, and I love the sweet tea here as well."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner with the family. It was really warm outside so we decided to dine outdoors. Our waitress was very attentive. My bf and I shared the Fajitas ( although they are named something else on the menu) and my son had a cheese quesadilla and rice and beans. The rice was not my favorite. To drink we had mango margaritas, the price was great (5.95) but, they were way too sweet. The chicken and shrimp in the fajitas were seasoned well. You assemble them yourself which is standard,I just wish they would have came with cheese. We saw a lot of people picking up Togo orders. All in all, we will Be dining here again.  Total was 42.00 for 2 Entrees, a Kids meal and 2 alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant by far for Mexican!!! Maria has always waited on us and sooo sweet! The food is great! Never had anything we didn't love!!! The taco salads are great! Whenever we get takeout it's always been accurate!!"}
{"text":"The most disgusting food I have ever been served in my entire life. After waiting 45 minutes eating good salsa and chips. I'm disappointed after the first bite. Totally gross, bland, cold and last night taco bowl!"}
{"text":"Food is always great here. The dining area is a bit small and they have a lot of seating a bit close to each other but if you can get past that then you can enjoy your meal. I usually get the steak tacos with cilantro on soft corn tortillas and it is always excellent. I really enjoy the mild salsa and their chorizo queso dip is quite yummy too. I do go often to get a bag of chips and salsa to take home. $4 gets you a a bag of Nachos and a drink size cup of salsa. I absolutely love it and never get salsa and chips from the supermarket."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I decided to check out this place. They were very busy from the time we got there until the time we left.  The decoration is REALLY cute, the owners thought about every detail.  The waiter was very attentive, checked on us all the time. They had those chip and salsa that I believe every Mexican restaurant has but those were the best that I ever had. We had a parillada for two and we were impressed with the amount of food.  Even tho they were busy our food was ready on point, we did not have to wait long for it. The food was good, very authentic, but I was expecting a little bit more about the refried beans.  Their menu have decent options and they are not pricey at all.  We will be back eventually."}
{"text":"I order the Chicken burritos it come with Rice and beans & side of guacamole and salsa on top of the burritos they putting cheese sauce they are fast and clean . The food was really good delicious ."}
{"text":"Having lunch today with my fiance anf my service dog. They allowed us to sit outside, even brought water for my dog. The service was fast and friendly. Food came out quickly. I have been here a few other times and it is always amazing. If you want some high quality Mexican  food, this sure is worth it."}
{"text":"The service couldn't be any worse. Food is hit or miss, no refills, no more chips and salsa, waited forever on our check when we seemed to be the only people in there. Very uncomfortable booths, loud music, and it's FREEZING. Surely there is a better Mexican restaurant in Gastonia."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! Good service, fun atmosphere, yummy food. But, it has gone downhill so fast!   Our family of 4 went on a Thursday night, and the food was mediocre, nothing special. We constantly had to ask for more chips and salsa and refills on our drinks.   The people that work here are incredibly rude. When we were first seated, we were seated in the far back corner right next to the bathrooms (with many open tables in the front room). When we asked politely if they wouldn't mind seating us in the front room, the waiter shoved the menus into my hands and said \"here you go!\" Not pleased... Not pleased at all.   I probably won't be going back. There are too many other places to eat good Mexican food."}
{"text":"My family has been going to La Fuente for 5 years now, and we absolutely love it.  We don't eat anywhere else for Mexican.  The service is always great, always very prompt in filling up drinks, bringing out more chips and salsa and always asking if we need anything.  The food is excellent,  and has a wide variety. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just went to La Fuente yesterday!  I have been here a few times before and every one of these times has been great!  Most of the meals are under 10 dollars and this is for authentic Mexican food!  Yesterday I got one of the chicken salads and it had guacamole, peppers, sour cream, and cheese in a crispy shell.   It was good...but not as good as a similar salad at Los Arcos.  My boyfriend got the 3 combination dinner with a chile relleno and two chicken burritos.  I tried a little bit of the burrito and it was much better than the salad.  The  chile relleno was also good.  Overall, i dont have any complaints about the food.  I wanted to give La Fuente a 5 but the service yesterday was kind of slow even though the place was not that crowded ( a Monday night).  Our waiter also disappeared for a while when we were trying to get the check and leave.  I have always had great service here before so I will be back.  My opinion... this is my second favorite Mexican restaurant in Gastonia behind Los Arcos.  I like the cheese dip and chile relleno better here but I like the burritos and salads better at Los Arcos.  I highly recommend La Fuente!"}
{"text":"With good food choices seemingly few and far between in Gastonia, I always love to visit La Fuente. LAst time I was here, I had some delicious tacos, and we gorged ourselves on the yummy chips and dip. I fyou do make your way to Gastonia, this is definitely a place worth trying."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, where there is a great Mexican food restaurant on every corner. This place isn't great, but it gets the job done. Food is pretty bland...so of you like it spicy, bring a bottle of hot sauce.  But, they will spice it up if you ask, with jalape√±os and chipotle.   The Tex-mex staples, like nachos and crispy tacos, are sub-par...but if that's what you are into, you might actually be satisfied.   Though, the specialty items are where it's at.   Any of the actual taco plates, prepared Mexican style, are excellent. The shrimp tacos, carnitas and Carne Asada are all quite tasty. If you are hungry, I recommend the Parradillada, which are like combo fajitas on steroids, complete with shrimp, carnitas and chorizo! It's meat heaven.   Don't expect world class dining here guys. This place is a dive, which isn't a bad thing. I mean, you could do much worse when choosing to dine at Mexican food restaurant inside a Walmart shopping center."}
{"text":"First off, my girlfriend absolutely loves this place, so I've been here quite a few times over the last year & a half. And I'll have to admit, it's a really good meal for a very good price.  Just like any typical Mexican restaurant, they have all of your favorite, classic dishes. I'm a big fan of the enchiladas & burritos, but then again, I'm a big fan of those anywhere. But the prices here are great, with most entrees & the ever popular Mexican combos priced around $6. I would even say that the food is a little better than the price you pay for it. So if you aren't ordering drinks, which they also have a full bar, then you can get out of here for under $10 a person for a great meal.  They just recently renovated the place, so everything inside is a little new to me. But this truly is a great Mexican restaurant if you're in the Gastonia area, as you'll not only leave happy & full, but you're wallet will thank you as well."}
{"text":"Our first time there was this past Cinco de Mayo and the place was a madhouse.  We made a reservation so our table was waiting for us and the staff was great.  I felt the drinks were a bit weak but with the traffic going through there it was ok.  We each had one and could have gone for a second but we had just had enough festivus at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Some of he best Mexican I have ever had. (outside of the South West that is.)   The salsa was AWESOME. I had the two amigo steaks and it was cooked perfectly. The shrimp were a little overcooked, but still very good.   The taco's at the table looked awesome and were gone in about 30 seconds.   If you are nearby, this deserves a decent place to grab some good Mexican food.   The only negative for me was the decor. It was dated and tacky."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant on the inside but food was very very bland. The dishes looked decent, but completely lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Went here on Labor Day Monday.  It was really good. Authentic TexMex; the salsa was exceptional.  I had the Taco's Al Carbon con pollo and they were delicious. The service was just a little slow even though they were not very busy."}
