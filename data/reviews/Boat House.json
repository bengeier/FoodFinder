{"text":"Food was good, service prompt and ambiance was great for a group of people.....not a romantic date and quiet conversation.  Good for a drink meet up too! Karaoke on the basement level!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, oysters on Sunday, fresh, plump and delish, oh, did I mention a buck each! Yeah, can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance was great. The wine director is also very good BUT make sure he advises you the cost of the bottles being opened. He took some liberties tonight that were a surprise to me. I feel if you are opening a $150 to $180 bottle of wine advise the client! Probably wont go back."}
