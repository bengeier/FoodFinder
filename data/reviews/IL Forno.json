{"text":"We went there with our 9 and 11 year old. We didn't feel too welcome at all by the manager because we bought our 2 girls with us who behaved very well and it felt too \"upper class\" to even go there with kids even if they are older. Not a place to go with kids even though kids are allowed. 

The lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which I didn't like. The Alfredo pasta was flavourless. Not too good. Was disappointed that they had no pizza for a month when we went there. 

The waitress was sweet. But the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines. 

There was a sign when I came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats. That was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense. 

Don't think I would go again because it felt like setting a foot in a stranger's house and felt awkward there. Food was good though but hard to enjoy myself."}
{"text":"Crazy good! Where do I start? 

The girls and I went for supper on a slow, rainy night and found our new favourite restaurant in Airdrie! We knew they moved from Main Street to an obscure part of town and it is a little hard to find if your aren't looking or know where you are going, so Google it.

Service: paced nicely and they know what they are doing. From drinks, appies, entr√©es, coffee and dessert. Just when you start to look around, they are there. Impeccable, kind, friendly and knowledgable.

Food: Insane! Just look at my photos! A couple of girls got the daily special and loved it. I asked for a recommendation and there was no hesitation with the suggestion. Also, limincello and the tiramisu- just go for it! No regrets. 

Location: A little out of the way with restaurant access a wee bit limited. They are located on the second floor and there are stairs or an elevator which feels a little unsafe. (Imagine an unenclosed elevator unit- only 3 'walls' where you can literally reach out and touch the drywall while going up/ down.)

Again, the service and food are amazing! Reservations are recommended on weekend/ holidays. Go here for a Date Night and enjoy the experience, leave the kids at home.

Note: They have both lunch and supper hours."}
{"text":"Visited IL FORNO on November 30/13 and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service.  My wife and I had the veal special that is on the daily menu which was superb.  The two grand children had the thin crust pizza that appeared to be good.  The other couple had lasagne and a pasta dish which they greatly enjoyed.

We had calamari and bruschetta with a delicious cheese ball for appetizers that were excellent.

For desert we shared two generous portions of tiramisu which concluded the very enjoyable meal.

I do highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is just a wonderful place to go for a special occasion.Excellant food ! Will definately go there again. Too bad it took so long to get in. You need Reservations!"}
{"text":"For months we have been trying to get there for lunch. They would advertise online as being open and we would get there and it was closed. Finally this past Tuesday we made it in for lunch. We love Italian food and we're hoping to finally land a good restaurant in Airdrie. My recommendation? Skip this place. We had to wait for the waiter to show up from the back. There were only two other tables full while we dined. The menus were shabby pieces of paper. My fiance did not care for his spaghetti and meatballs. They were extremely bland. I had the manicotti which was actually quite tastey. We ordered a glass of wine and water with our meal and the waiter never returned for refills. Overall, we were very disappointed and skipped dessert...which never happens."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and restaurant was very quaint. We were there with another couple and were there for a late dinner. Everything was perfect except the crying toddler."}
{"text":"This is the best food I've had in 5 years, never mind the best Italian food I've ever had. The staff is very personal and friendly, and the owner of the restaurant is the main waiter. It was absolutely perfect. Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Services & food was outstanding! We had the lemon veal meat was so perfectly cooked and flavour that made your mouth water, side was the penne in a zesty fresh tomato sauce it was perfectly cooked. Our other dish was spaghetti carbonara was PERFECT not over powered by bacon because they do not use bacon it was either pancetta or prosciutto they way it should be made! The homemade the dressing caesar salad is homemade with fresh crisp romaine lettuce & bread crumbs 

The passion of authentic Italian food is very notable in the cooking & worth the drive to Airdrie"}
{"text":"We had originally planned on visiting another restaurant for supper in Airdrie; sadly the reservations did not pan out, so we decided to try Il Forno - apparently voted one of the best pasta restaurants in town for 2016!  

Atmosphere: 4.5/5  The restaurant is a little difficult to find, being on the second floor on the side of a mall complex and out of the way of the rest of the city, but the ambience more than made up for it!  Climbing the stairs into the restaurant felt like walking into little Italy, with the mild lighting, decor including fences, and live music.  Busy and lively on a Friday evening... Very thoughtful use of space and interactive staff!  More than enough parking and an elevator for those who have difficulty with stairs.

Food: 4/5  We had the calamari, linguine alle vongole, and salmone to share.  I haven't had calamari in a long time so really enjoyed the crunch and flavour!  The linguine was good - not too rich yet tasty; salmon was also tasty and maybe just a very little bit drier than expected.  Good variety of seasonal vegetables and maybe a little more buttery than I would usually prefer.  I love the really hot fresh buns that came in the beginning!

Service: 3.5/5  Since it was a Friday evening, staff were visibly busy so it took some time for the kitchen to be ready for our order.  I can see that staff were trying their best though.

Price: 3.5/5  reasonable for a nice Italian meal with great ambience

Overall: 4/5  Overall I enjoyed my experience here - the owners have definitely put a lot of thought and passion into generating an authentic and interactive experience for the patrons!  This would be a great place to celebrate special occasions; would love to try some of their other dishes."}

Top 2 or three places in Airdrie if you ask me.."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in last night. Even though we didn't have reservations (which is highly recommended) they got us a table pretty quickly. The service was excellent, and our waitress was very kind and pleasant. We ordered the Rigatoni and the Tortellini and they were both absolutely amazing! We had a Canolli for dessert and while the cookie was a bit hard, the filling was the best we've ever had. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, was a little overpriced but delicious. I managed to come out with my little one, they have a high chair but not much else for little kids so come prepared with a sippy cup and something to occupy them if you are adventurous. I would still try and come here for a nice night out with the hubby. Airdrie has a couple hidden gems and this is one of them."}
{"text":"Have been dragged here twice by friends.....and was DELIGHTED!  The proprietor is a friendly fellow.  The food is as good as - or BETTER - than any I ever had in my extensive travels through Italy.  I don't say that lightly.  The location and decor are....welll.....unusual to say the least - but the food!  OMG!  I can't say enough good about this place.  The prices are great too!  If you dine here and feel that you should gripe about the prices....then you are probably more of a McDonald's \"fine diner\".  The serving staff is all absolutely excellent and they are all very attentive.  I won't hesitate to be a regular here......and I happily drive past many Italian restaurants in Calgary to get to this place."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed the last time I had dinner with friends here.  In the past the food was amazing.  But this time, it seemed to be lacking.  The service was also very slow.  Not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here tonight and everything was awesome.  The decor, service and food were the best we've had in a long time.  Portions weren't huge, but they were filling.  We will definitely be going back."}
