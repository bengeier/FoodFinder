{"text":"A nice place to get a light and tasty lunch. Very smooth vibe which is nice for anyone who wants a quiet sit down with a well priced and good latte. Also the cashier had a happy and inviting personality which is always a plus.

The big window facing the street out front lets alot of sun in for good lighting in the restaurant.

I recommend trying out one of the soups!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch or an afternoon pastry. Excellent breakfast too, come to think of it.

I can highly recommend any of the sandwiches. The grilled cheese is a highlight: full of roasted veggies and apple slices, and it always comes piping hot and with nice molten cheese. (That might not be a recommendation if you like tepid food, but you can always let it cool down.) The banh mi is also delicious, although it could use a little more chili.

I've also tried their various noodle-and-vegetable bowls, which are nice in warm weather. Quite substantial and vegeterian-friendly. Also pretty tasty, but that grilled cheese is hard to beat.

Service is always friendly, but it's not lightning fast. I like to think they are preparing my lunch with extra care and attention. Perhaps not the best choice if you're in a hurry... but maybe you should take some time for a good lunch now and then."}
{"text":"Nice lunch with fresh and bio products. Tasty, fusion and original stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"A charming little spot in NDG. The latte was quite good. I had a baguette with jam and they were delicious though a little expensive for my taste. 

Other then that, it was a very positive experience. The huge south-facing bay window definitely makes it a sunny spot which is amazing when it's dreadfully cold outside. 

I'd definitely go back to work for a bit or have a quiet work meeting. They had evening workshops advertised, I may have to check those out at some point!"}
{"text":"This may be my favourite cafe in Montreal because of the quality of the food, drinks and very friendly service. All the ingredients are fresh and flavourful. 
The only minor criticism is that there are not enough plugs to accommodate those coming with computers. 
Have already returned several times and am repeatedly impressed. Excellent addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A very hot afternoon out calls for a good iced latte.
I went in here for the first time this afternoon - packed on the terrace, completely empty inside.    It didn't take long to figure out why - there was no air conditioning inside.    They did have a bunch of fans going though.
Staff was very quiet, it took 9 minutes to get my iced latte ($4.50 and it is quite small).    9 minutes is a little on the slow side to get a cold coffee.     He brought it to me with a pack of sugar and a wooden stir stick in his hand, but no straw.    It wasn't the best latte I'd ever had, but it was ok.   Not the greatest service but ok.
I probably wouldn't go back, there are other cafes on the same street that are more pleasant with better product and service.     It was quite charming on the inside, sunny and open."}
{"text":"An absolute gem, with locally sourced food. Best pulled pork sandwich that I have ever had. The kale smoothie is petite, but a nice addition to your meal. Very delicious."}
{"text":"J'aime l'ambiance , grandes fenetres et tres belle terrasse ou prendre du soleil avec un petit lunch et un thé. Aussi des plantes pour agrementer le paysage à coté de la passante rue sherbrooke."}
