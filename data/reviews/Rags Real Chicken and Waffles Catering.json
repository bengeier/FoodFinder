No hype, just a wonderful tasting meal from a sincere guy who seems to be doing what he really loves to do.  I highly suggest you consider checking this food out for yourself.  Hope you are as impressed as we are."}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ only open Thursdays-Saturdays. I took home a rack of ribs. They were very meaty and smoked to perfection. I will be back!"}
{"text":"CALL BEFORE YOU GO TO BE SURE THEY ARE OPEN  (THURSDAYS AND FRIDAY AND PART OF SATURDAY RIGHT NOW)  CASH ONLY BUT WORTH IT  Rags... like the fine type of clothing not the dirty dish towel.   Wow... one of the best ribs I have ever had. Seriously top 5. Smoked over cherry, hickory right there in the run down strip mall parking lot.   We ate ribs, pulled pork, brauts, beans and cole slaw. It was all good.   Ribs, smoky and fantastic rub. No sauce needed.   Pulled Pork, appeared to be yesterdays and was a tad dried out. Needed sauce to give it some life.     Braut, hand made filled to almost a half pound, great flavor, nice texture, great braut.   Beans, were doctored very nicely. I liked the secret ingredients.   Slaw, fresh, nice flavor, enjoyed the small diced tomatoes in it.   Cash Only."}
{"text":"If you like Southern barbecue. This is the right place for you. I recommend the ribs. Also the rib tips a must try it. Everything else on the menu is so delicious. From the pulled pork to the hot links to the chicken. No complaints. This is man food. Every time I come here it's like heaven. And the owners are so friendly. The side dishes and desserts are also so delicious."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow. The ribs just melt in your mouth! Delicious! Rags is such a great guy and so willing to talk about his craft. Learned a lot!"}
