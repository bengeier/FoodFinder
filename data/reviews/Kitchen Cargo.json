{"text":"I don't write Yelp reviews often but this place is just incredible. I have tried the fish tacos (only once) and all flavors of the pot pies. The pies are my go to and I just love them! I can honestly say I have never been disappointed with my food here. My favorite thing is the spicy thai chicken pie - it's so delicious. The pastry is flaky and moist while the filling has a great balance of meat and vegetables. I work across the street at the hospital and this place is my go to for my weekly treat. I just heard that they do frozen pies as well which I'm really excited for because seriously this place has great food.
I really hope more people discover this treasure of a place."}
{"text":"Tired the fish tacos and found it to be passable. There wasn't much flavour to it at all."}
{"text":"Bought tacos to eat on the spot and frozen steak and chicken pot pies to take home with me to eat at a later time. The tacos were alright. It hit the spot at the time.

 As for the pot pies, I was fairly excited as the photos looked really good as advertised outside their booth. However the actual product was quite different. After digging into the pot pie after heating them up, I found that there was barely any meat in the actual pies. They were comprised of mostly celery and onion. Where was the meat? All I could find were tiny scraps of what resembled meat. 
I was disappointed and angry and discarded the pot pies. They cost me $6 EACH. The frozen meat pies you can buy at the grocery stores easily tasted better and had more filling. If you are going to charge that much money for one, please put more substance into the filling. 
I will not be going back again."}
