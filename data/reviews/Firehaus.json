{"text":"Decent bar food, decent beer.  I like to go here early for lunch since service is faster and it hasn't gotten too loud yet.  Don't expect anything very healthy here..there are a few salads and a veggie wrap, but all have cheese or dressing (which I guess you could get on the side...).  Onion rings are good, I've heard the mac-n-cheese is tasty, and many of the burgers are on wonderful pretzel rolls.  As a note, they have something called \"haus sauce\", which is just their buffalo sauce, so don't be fooled.  Never been here during peak evening hours, so I can't comment on that, but an ok place for lunch and a beer."}
{"text":"The Backdraft Burger at Firehaus is a campus favorite that is served with some of the best fries I've ever eaten (upgrade them to the Haus Fries and they are the best fries I've ever eaten). The Backdraft is a quarter-pound of ground chuck, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. I opted to add bacon to my burger and top it with BBQ sauce. I also subbed the house bun for a pretzel bun to kick this burger up a notch. The result is a mouthwatering combination of sauce, meat, cheese, and bun that is first-rate.   If the beef was only a little more flavorful and juicy this campustown burger would be amongst some of the better I've had. Firehaus gets major points for being a campus bar that sports some gourmet grub, great drinks, and a fun atmosphere. If you're ever in home of the Illini Firehaus is a must."}
{"text":"Wait staff was decent, but I was hoping that the establishment would be responsive to the community post- students.  No such luck. They coudn't put anything but sports on the tiniest t.v.. Have a nice summer,  Firehaus. We'll spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I think this place is totally overrated. The food is very basic and \"so so\" at best and overpriced for what you get. The location is very good, particularly if you're a student but this is not a place I would recommend.   I'm also surprised at how few food and drink specials they offer."}
{"text":"A campus favorite for students. They have a large selection of bar food items.  Started with the cheese curds, which were very tasty and would highly recommend.  Main course got the burger, which was also good. Not the best burger, but quality and would also recommend.  The side of fries were a over average and yummy.  Also present for trivia night, which was a fun twist.  The other dishes on the menu also looked very good as well!"}
{"text":"Meh, typical college bar. Maybe I'm getting old and this would have suited me when I was in college, but I can't see anything that would make me choose this over any other place, like Murphy's."}
{"text":"My husband I just left the Firehaus and we were very pleased with the service of our bartender. She was very helpful, friendly and had great customer service.   In our time at the Firehaus, we observed an incompetent management team. While the bartenders became busy trying to fill orders for their servers you could see patrons at the bar with empty glasses including ourselves.  Management was sitting at the end of the bar sipping on their sodas and barking orders at employees. At no time did the manager  attempt to help the bartenders and clear their backlog.   As we were getting ready to leave we observed a member of the management team chewing out a member of the waitstaff to where she was in tears. This was done in front of a very crowded bar for all patrons to observe. Personally, I think this is a horrible time (middle of a shift) and place (in front of a crowded bar) for a reprimand to occur.     I think their management team is extremely unprofessional and feel for the employees under their leadership."}
{"text":"Been here once for lunch, once for dinner, and once late night. Honestly, the crowds were biggest during lunch, definitely unusual for a campus bar. The food was okay, typical bar food, but Legend's is better. 2 stars for the food, drink, and party atmosphere, 4 stars for the fact that it is CLEAN, pretty, and well decorated, so a 3 over all."}
{"text":"Edit 10/24/15: quality of food and service has gone down, down, down hill. Way way way way down. Avoid!   Super solid bar food. Fries are great, ingredients are all solid, pretzel bun is !!!, and the burgers were juicy.   Great bar atmosphere and it's in a beautiful building.   I've been twice and I'll be going back. Enjoyable experiences both times."}
{"text":"It's okay barfood for Campustown. The Haus Fries are amazing, the burgers are underwhelming, the booze is expensive for the serving size (almost $5 for a weak vodka cranberry... really?) Plus it gets loud at night. I think if I were an undergrad at U of I, I'd like the place, but seeing as I'm an old graduate student, I'm unimpressed."}
{"text":"Foods great, dance floor is severely lacking. They were like \"there is no dance floor here sir, please do not do this or we'll ask you to leave\" so I had to bring the party to everyone else in the bar. Didn't even finger bang anyone. Completely ruined my evening, worst campus bar for sure."}
{"text":"I dunno if it was just me and my spiritual ora while in Firehaus, but I always got hit on by a random girl on the weekends here. I felt kind of bad because I was already in a very committed relationship aka married. But really, I wasn't sending misleading creepy signals or being charming either. For the longest time I thought it was the smell of my hair wax I was using to style my bed hair when I would go out to socialize with friends. But I tested this theory numerous times in other cities and no dice. Yes, the wife was not with me at other venues.  Investigatively (not a real word)... I think on certain weekends, the local gals come here to find their knight and shining armor to take them away from the small town. But here is the thing, u will never know if she is a local until she tells you. But I came here enough to observe and identify how to spot these rare and undiscovered people. First off, they are extremely beautiful, like the tone of their skin was almost natural and organic... unmanipulated by the city or fake UV rays. They dress differently, no labels and no blig. And here is the kicker, they talk differently. Their topics of discussion are not layered from the dry vocabulary of the bullshit literary material University students are being brain washed in (this includes myself). One big clue seemed to be the type of questions they asked. University girls typically asked questions like what are you studying, where have you interned, what year in school are you? But I noticed the local asked a key differentiating question: where are you originally from?---if you decode this question, it's underlying motive is can you take her away from her boring hometown.  Keep in mind, this place is not swarming with these type of treasures. A treasure is a treasure to be found. I write this review because I hope to read or hear about somebody finding their future other half at Firehaus. A smart city kid that swoops a small town gal off her feet and make a ton of babies after graduating.  So best wishes to you bachelors, go to Firehaus with new purpose. Cheers! I'll be expecting a wedding invitation shortly. LOL..."}
{"text":"I love how they open up the windows when it gets warm enough and have a beer garden up top.  They have good daily drink specials (Sharkbowls on Tuesdays!) and is kept very clean - and I don't just mean by campus bar standards!  During the day, it's also nice to sit by the open windows and grab some chow - just your typical bar food - but it can get pretty busy, especially for lunch.  I remember getting a Sharkbowl for the first time on a barcrawl with co-workers: \"Uh oh, these are really yummy\" =P  Needless to say, the fact that Firehaus was only the second stop on our list made sure that the rest of the night was comprised of a bunch of drunken debauchery."}
{"text":"I like how this place looks from the outside.  The open-air front is inviting and makes you want to hang out there.  But it's a different experience inside.  First of all, it seemed dirty.  Maybe I was just there on a bad night, but it looked like the floors hadn't been mopped in weeks.  Then there's the service, which was terrible.  Very long waits to buy a drink.  We didn't eat so I can't rate the food, but my overall impression of the place was that there are better places in Champaign to hang out."}
{"text":"I remember the Wednesday nights I spent here with a paint-pen decorated mug in my hand or clutching one of the many straws poking out of a Shark Bowl.  Of course it was R&R's back then...  After being under construction for something like 17 years, it finally re-opened after I moved to Chicago.  I came here before a football game last year and was pretty impressed.  Out with the rickety wooden stairs and graffiti-filled bathroom.  In with the shiny photos of firefighters and giant hydrants of beer.  3 cheers for hydrants of beer!!  The decor was crisp and basic, which is appropriate for a campus bar where drunken kleptomaniacs will nab anything that isn't nailed down.  Apparently, you must be 21 to enter after 9pm so they are going for an older crowd.   I highly recommend this place if you're an alum and hitting up Chambana for a sporting event."}
{"text":"I usually like Firehaus and feel confident bringing my out of town friends there for a guaranteed good time. Last night was just not the case. The music was  terrible! I saw a wide open dance and my buddies were ready to tear it up but the music just wasn't there! We were willing to start the party (even willing to dance to Pitbull) but we couldn't keep it going. I consulted the manager, he was nice but unhelpful about this.   My recommendation is to go to Firehaus and enjoy a fish bowl but don't go expecting to cut a rug with your squad."}
{"text":"I am writing strictly about a lunch experience. The service was a bit mediocre, but the place has a bright and interesting atmosphere. The honey turkey wrap was delicious, and the portions were quite filling."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here today before the Illini basketball game. We were going to order the Stone Xocoveza stout until the gentleman next to us mentioned that they had Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout on tap. Whoa. We suddenly were in the craft beer mecca of the CU.  We came to find out we were sitting next to the manager of Firehaus (unless he has a different official title). He was so friendly, knowledgeable about craft beer and we spent a great amount of time discussing Midwestern breweries.  We proceeded to order the boneless wings that were on special and the Firehaus fries. The fries were to die for. Perfection.  This version of Firehaus is a little different than the one of my college days in 2003 (though I acknowledge it was a Sunday afternoon!). The craft beer options here are stellar and we will be back.  Note --- $3 drafts on Sundays!"}
{"text":"On a recommendation we stopped here while travelling.  The food was average. What was a bit horrifying was the amount of accumulated dirt- on the edges of the stair way (eye level to tables), heat grates, banisters & actual webs between light fixtures & the ceiling- all illuminated by sun on the day we visited.  I couldn't help but think about what the food prep area looked like. The whole restaurant needed a top to bottom cleaning."}
{"text":"The food and service are both mediocre. Overpriced compared to other restaurants on campus. Service is extremely slow, even when there are hardly any patrons."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here one day.  Decent place.  Not too crowded for a campus town spot.  At the suggestion of my friend, I opted for the Nacho plate.  Huge serving and it was quite good.  Everything is firehouse themed, as far as the menu is concerned and so many of the burgers and sandwiches and wraps sounded delicious.  Will have to go again sometime and try one.  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Their food is really good. Almost everything I've had is good. It's a little over priced but if you go on days when they have specials it makes the food and alcohol a lot cheaper.   Saturday is always a fun day to go because they have 6 dollar lunchbox pitchers which I can never get enough of. On Saturday they also have half price burgers which is always delicious.   Definitely a great place to check out. Keep in mind, it is right on campus which makes things a little extra rowdy."}
{"text":"Great for kickin' it and watching a hockey game with your friends. This place is sprawling, with an upstairs, another upstairs, and a patio outside.   I went during the summer when it was full but not crowded. The service was blasé but available."}
{"text":"This place opened my last year of college and I really liked it because it was a 21 and up bar.  While I didn't go to Illinois, I spent many a weekend partying down there.  We loved the somewhat clean feel to Firehaus and the cheap drinks.  I went back this weekend for my brothers graduation and it is now an absolute madhouse on the weekends.  It's still a pretty solid place, but it has become more of your typical Champaign bar."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: fun, cheap college bar.  I was impressed with the Firehaus, especially as a visitor for the Wisconsin-Illinois game still decked out in Badger gear. It's right on campus, huge inside and out, and full of people just wanting to have a good time. Prices were absurdly cheap, and drinks were not watered down. My only, minor complaint was the lack of bartenders making waits for drinks very long (sometimes nearing a half hour).   If I come back to the Illinois campus, I'll for sure be stopping at Firehaus for a drink to start the night."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and Marta handled my order. Everything was exactly as ordered.  Friendly and quick service with zero complaints.   The good:  The wings were FANTASTIC. Preparation was great and the 'haus sauce' was delicious. Job well done.   Onion ring batter was clearly a house recipe, and was an excellent and well seasoned buttermilk batter that left little to be desired.   Room for improvement:  The Burger was above mediocre.  Well seasoned, but...  I ordered a double 'Haus Burger'.  Was told on the phone that all of the burgers are cooked well done...What is this, Steak'n'Shake?!  Stop it with the 'double' option and start serving a 1/2 lb. patty like every other brewpub!  Mark it up a couple bucks and serve a premium product... and give your customers the option to have their burger cooked the way they like it (an option for medium rare would've probably made this a 5 star review).  The bun could be bigger to fit the patties, but I'll have to concede that I liked the novelty of having my burger 'overflow ' the bun.   Overall, great food at a good price.  Atmosphere seemed pretty cool, and probably great for watching the game, but I didn't stay."}
{"text":"I've been here before so I know that the food is good, but the service is awful. I went with my boyfriend and it took about 20 minutes for them to notice that we were there. After ordering we waited for an hour and 20 minutes before giving up. All the while tables that had arrived after us had gotten entrees before we even got appetizers."}
{"text":"Myself and 2 others got the southwest chicken sandwich. After waiting for about a half an hour the sandwiches were an abysmal disappointment. The chicken was chewy and charred. I also had to slap on a ton of mayo and ketchup because the sandwich was so dry. The fries were pretty good though no lie."}
{"text":"I came here from Campus on a trip, I had a few friends with me as well. We all agree that this is a nice bar in a good location. Be mindful that sauces may go a little overboard, for example there was too much BBQ sauce on my burger. Atmosphere we very good, definitely would recommend this."}
{"text":"We went for a tour of U of I for my brother yesterday and stopped here for lunch after. If I had read reviews before, we wouldn't have visited but we were pressed for time.   It was seat yourself so we made sure to sit up top so we would be seen. Our server was friendly enough but took forever and the restaurant was almost empty.   We started with the nachos, they were pretty good but covered in lettuce with very little underneath. Turkey wraps were boring and not good. My mom had the grilled cheese and a cup of chili. She asked what soup they had today and she was told there was no soup today. Weird.   My biggest complaint was when I asked for no honey mustard on my wrap and for ranch instead. The waitress said it would have to be on the side. I said \"If they put the mustard on the sandwich, why couldn't they put ranch?\" And again she said they couldn't do it. It made no sense so I said as much. She said she would ask and lo and behold, they of course could put it on the wrap.   The bill came to $46 which was ridiculous for what we got. If we are back in the area we for sure won't be stopping in here."}
{"text":"What a clusterfuck. Came here for a late dinner with some friends, could not find a server even though all of us were actively looking. Other staff members just brushed us off and told us to wait 'cause it's not their job. Eventually got our food, drinks never got refilled (sorry, guy who ordered hot wings and ran out of water), check came eventually, server picked it up an eon later. Didn't bother complaining because nobody wanted to deal with anymore bullshit. We marched away to the sound of bad karaoke.  Two stars instead of one because it was the most hilariously tryhard and unsexy rendition of Dark Horse ever."}
{"text":"This place never fails me for a good time. I would say when I'm in Chambana 70% of the year, this is my default location. You can find me here for lunch dates with my bff for their fried chicken salad with blue cheese and a side of their homemade fries... mmm so delicious! Recently they have introduced $4 40's... which I pray they will continue through the school year, not just the summer! The balcony is always nice on a summer evening. Of course this place gets packed... what campus bar doesn't? But if I had to pick a bar to wait in line for, it'd be this one."}
{"text":"Love the Hazmat wrap!  Customer service is good, if its busy waitresses try and stay on their game. Have had good service during numerous Bulls/Hawks games, Unofficial, and busy weekends.  Can get crowded, but not one of the gross, smelly bars on campus. Their annual yard sale is awesome (cheap mugs, booze, and t-shirts)."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: review is for their food & service, not for the nightlife.  Oh Firehaus, what have they done to you since the Class of 2012 graduated and left?  Maybe this place was always a little sub-par and I didn't notice or care because I was too busy drinking for free, but I swear it has gone downhill in the past couple years.  This used to be my regular spot. I'd eat here probably once a week if not more and switch off between wings, salad, chicken tenders, or spinach artichoke dip. It was all amazing, every time.  But sadly, my old stomping grounds have become disappointing.  I came here back in May for a random visit and saw they added an AMAZING sandwich to the menu, the Southwest Chicken. Grilled chicken, provolone, pepper and onions, and avocado? YUM. Paired with onion rings and I knew this would be my new go-to on their menu.  Flash forward to a couple weeks ago when I came down for Homecoming. My friends and I literally parked the car in a garage a block away and went straight to Firehaus. Ah, the nostalgia! The memories! THE GOOD FOOD!  I ordered the Southwest Chicken with a side of onion rings, like I had been dreaming about all day. When it came out I was immediately disappointed to see they had replaced the fresh avocado slices with some sort of avocado PASTE. Yuck! It smelled and tasted bizarre so I scraped it off. Bye, delicious chicken sandwich! Now you are merely of slightly-above-average taste.  The next day I came in for lunch, because who actually goes to Illini football games anymore? I decided to get a side salad and wings, and everyone at the table ordered a drink with their food. The waitress brought out everyone's drinks except mine, which I found strange since I had just ordered a bottle of Bud Light Platinum. After another server brought out everyone's food and not mine, I flagged down our server and the look on her face when I asked about my food was one of, \"Oh shit.\" So she ran away and came back a couple minutes later explaining she forgot to put in my order originally. Well, duh, I kind of got that. She apologized profusely and said I'd get a discount on my bill.  The wings were worth the wait, honestly, and the salad was as good as I remembered. But then the part where my bill came? No discount. At this point we were rushing off to go to another bar and my friend was nice enough to just pay for my tab, but come on. If you're going to screw up my order and then promise a discount, deliver on it.  Maybe I'm just picky, or maybe I expected more from a place I used to frequent. Or maybe it lost its shine. It pains me, Firehaus, but you only get 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"Firehaus is what it is.  Never have been blown away by the food what so ever, but they do have a discount for U of I employees which is nice.  Service was good the past 2 times I've been there.  The TV set-up looks like it would be good because of the amount of TV's, but employees don't have any clue really how to use them.  Will be back most likely, but it will be for cheap beer specials."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to take my son and his roommate for dinner and stumbled upon this place.  Food was good but took forever homemade chips weren't very good, fries were a better option.  Apps took about a half hour to come and then sandwiches were 45 minutes later and one of our 6 guests food came out 5 minutes after everyone else's.  Didn't expect a 2 hour dining experience for apps and burgers."}
{"text":"One of the better campus bars in town. Good food, lots of TV's, a lot of room as well. Good combination of a fun, college atmosphere and a restaurant feel as well."}
{"text":"We just hosted a party at Firehaus for our triplet's 21st birthday which was held on the 2nd floor.  The bar service was outstanding and the food (italian beef; chicken quesadillas; chicken tenders; veggie platter; pretzel dip) was delicious! The Firehaus staff was very accommodating and even took care of taking down the decorations at the end of the party. I highly recommend the Firehaus for a party!"}
{"text":"Good daily specials!   I feel like this place is just a typical sports bar on campus -- a dime a dozen. I'm starting to get used to the super cheap alcohol in Champaign, that the specials here only get one star. This place isnt that special...besides the fact that it's oh-so-close to my building. The waitress was slow, literally and mentally. She took forever AND  messed up our bill. I guess she's forgiven because she's cute, but geez!"}
{"text":"For Champaign, this is one of the better places.  It has some of the best bar food in campus town and some of the specials are decent.  For example, Fridays they have $4 forties and $4 Firehaus fries which are spectacular.  It's one of my favorite bars in Champaign."}
{"text":"I am rating the food.  (Not the bar).  Let's say, I take a thin ground beef patty and take a mallet, and pound the crap out of it--so that it's shape isn't even round any more.  That is their Backdraft Burger.  Don't even try to order a medium rare one. They are all cooked the same like a fast food joint.  Was disappointed with their burger.  As far as the bar environment I would give that three stars."}
{"text":"You have to try the Jalapeño burger I think it's called the flame thrower ... oh man its so good!  Ask for a cup of their BBq and some fries and you're in heaven!   With it being in campus the atmosphere can dip from time to time because you get loaded with soke obnoxious college students, but over all a very enjoyable experience and good food"}
{"text":"Firehaus is the perfect place to watch sports! Good food (haus fries are amazing) and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has trash service, can't handle it when it gets busy. Never coming to eat here again. Maybe they should think about staying JUST a bar."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to visit if you are looking for a causal, relaxing place to get a drink and converse with friends. There is open seating and the windows are open when the weather is nice. Service is fast. I had a wells drink (rum + ginger ale) that was decent."}
{"text":"Went to Firehaus to watch a Seahawks game (the Bears were playing at the same time). Everything was good except our servers shift ended part way through the game and our replacement server never came to our table until i pointed out what happened.  The bartender pours a bit light....but the drinks are cheap. $2 drinks on Sunday. $2 Maker's Mark and coke. Gotta love that.  Food was excellent. Their Firehaus sauce stuff is amazing (i love spicy food).  Service was good up until the shift change...and then it was alright after i found us a new server.  Even with the shift change issue i think they get closer to 5 stars than 4."}
{"text":"Also known as the best place on earth. This place has wonderful food, such as firehaus fries and five alarm foul sandwich. Especially after you drink a fish bowl or a fire hydrant of beer."}
{"text":"Oh Firehaus. I really wish you were better, but with your normally absentminded waitresses and bartenders who on weekend nights are stuck up, how can I, really?  I think that you're tolerable on Mondays, when I can kind of hear myself think, the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded, and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for $3.  But Firehaus, my experience with you is generally bad.  The lines are ridiculous, the music is overwhelmingly loud, my friend's credit card got closed out to the wrong person, and had someone else's drinks on it... and his last name is not \"Smith\" or \"Jones\" or anything common.  What You did to get on my last nerve?  Once I was there, and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin, and it came up broken.... which means there was glass in the ice bin.  I pointed it out, and so he got another glass... and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it. Gross.  Their food is OK, but overrated. Bah. Firehaus, I will definitely not miss you when I move away."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a bite with friends. Their cheeseburger and chips deal on Tuesdays is awesome and it's only $2.99 so it's super affordable for broke college students!! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place was ridiculous. We waited 2 hours for our food and never received it. When we politely asked how long our food was the waitress kept saying 10 minutes which turned into an hour. We asked a manager what was wrong and he rudely yelled at us and said \"what do you want me to do? Serve you undercooked food?\" We walked out after 2 hours of waiting for our food. Overall, it was a very bad experience and I will not be back."}
{"text":"My favorite loud Champaign bar. Drink prices are reasonable, there's plenty of room, it's never unbearably packed like Lion, and fish bowls are great fun with a group. It's even better on karaoke night if you're there with some friends. I've never had any food there, though."}
{"text":"For a college bar this is actually pretty decent. Its great in the summer when they open the windows and you can grab a bite to eat. Food is all right, standard bar food that will get the job done. They usually have really good drink specials so the place is definitely easy on the wallet. What really stands out to me is that it has so many different levels as well as a rooftop and patio that you can move around and find what suits you. There can be hundreds of people there and you wont feel cramped, and beach week is always a lot of fun."}
{"text":"LOVE Firehaus. I've enjoyed every sandwich and burger that I've tried, and they have really tasty fries. Service is always spot on. It's also a great place to have a beer in the afternoon, which I may or may not do on a somewhat regular basis... The southwest chicken sandwich is wonderful (had that for lunch today) and the spicy french dip is another favorite. They have lots of televisions and are always happy to change the TV channel to accommodate customers. It's a great place to watch a ball game. We've also brought large groups here both for lunch and for happy hour, and we've always gotten good service."}
{"text":"Sadly, not named after the 80's hair-band, nonetheless, the former R&R's has been cleaned up and they provide some pretty good pub fare.  The wings are quite good.  Also, I must say I was impressed with the level of service I received for Sunday brunch, after a football Saturday.  If our wait person was hung-over she sure didn't show it.  On time with refills and completely polite.  Best part, 6 people for lunch: $50."}
{"text":"Great venue!  Handled the 500+ raving gameday fans during \"Dad's Weekend\" with ease.  Despite blowing a keg of cider and a little wait, they eventually got our entire drink order.  No small feat given the throng.  Really appreciated the local fire department appreciation and decor.  Next visit I'm trying the burgers."}
{"text":"I came back to Champaign as an alum with a friend to reminisce and we decided on Firehaus for a quick lunch having remembered they have pretty good food. It's your typical bar-type food but much better quality than you'd probably expect at a college bar. We had bloodies which were pretty average and nothing special. I had a turkey club wrap, which was very good. The best part was the wrap tortilla was a little bit crispy so it had a little somethin somethin extra. The wrap came with housemade chips with seasonings, very flavorful and also got a cup of the cheddar broccoli soup. The soup was so good-definitely could tell it was made fresh. They are nicely sized portions and we both had lots of food leftover. The bathrooms were just as blehhhh as I remembered, but as I said, typical for a college bar. Our server was very attentive and the manager even came over to check on us as well to see how everything was. Quick tip: We didn't get them this time, but the Haus Fries are the best things ever. Order them, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"I'm a little too young to remember this place as R&R's, and I had stopped working here by the time they brought the shark bowl back, but I was one of the first employees of this place when it reopened (FINALLY) as \"Firehaus\" in '05.  This bar took a long time to get on its feet, and by then, I was tired of not making any money due to lack of clientle, so I had moved on. But now, it's kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers, and for that, I give this bar all sorts of props.  Also, I just said \"props.\" Ew.  Anyway, the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN. Clean clean clean. Even on Unofficial, which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year, the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean. The layout isn't my favorite as there aren't a whole lot of places to sit, but the beer garden is excellent, and the buffalo chicken sandwich (with pasta salad!) was pretty damned good.  Of all the Cochrane bars on campus, this one is without a doubt. the best."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to pregame before an Illini game.  Coming from Madison, we showed up around 9 and there were still some seats and booths to be had.  We had a super helpful and friendly waitress that we helped educate on the concept of a beer chaser with a bloody mary.  Speaking of bloody marys, they are $4 during game day (and maybe other times) and for the price, weren't too bad.  My only complaint is the length of time to receive it.  Ordered a breakfast platter that had an option for onion rings as a side.  Of course, I went with that option.  Nothing to rave over but it did provide a good base for the alcohol consumption that followed."}
{"text":"I am sitting here at Firehaus right now and am FURIOUS. This establishment is CORRUPT!! They are robbing college students of their hard earned dollars. The Thursday deal claims that it was from 7-9 it is $1 vegas bombs, we stood by the bar at 8:50 and the bartenders refused to come serve me despite that there were barely any other patrons there. The incompetent bartender weasled his way over to me at 8:55pm on the dot and then claimed that their systems run \"5 minutes\" early and so he would have to charge me $6 dollar per vegas bomb. I tried to reason with him and he simply refused. I have never experienced such horrible customer service, this place should be shut down! In addition, I've had the food here and it is abysmal.   We ended up ordering 2 fishbowls and watched barley 1 shot get poured in by this bartender and then he proceeded to charge us $28!! SAD!    I will not be recommending this poor establishment to anyone of my fellow students. Go to Kams or joes or lion or even clys for a better experience, this place is truly a trash bag. 0/10!!!!"}
{"text":"Though all four years of being. A student here, this was my first time dining at this bar. Seeing this location not as bar for once. the set up is a lot cleaner and awesome than meets the eye. It's just like a typical sports bars with TVs everywhere following all kind of sports.   Now what really attracted me today was it's deal! For $4.99 you can get 10 delicious wings that matches that if Buffalo Wild Wings! Of course, the deals do Cary day to day so you may just have to swing by the place very now and them to see if the daily special flows your boat. But when it does, boy is it worth it!  The waitresses are extremely fast to react and the food also comes with speed. Their bottles and draft selection are humongous, and their prices are pretty decent too! Definitely checkout the place!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the service of one waitress in particular. We walked in on a Saturday at about 10:45 and walked to the back bar. I realize that there were only three bartenders but when each has their own section, you would think that bartender would want to make some money, right?   Apparently, bartender #103 did not and decided to bypass us on not one, not two, not three or four occasions, but five!! We had already been standing there for more than fifteen minutes and had made eye contact with her. It was like she was refusing us service based on my ethnicity! Oh, I forgot to mention that every person she served that was standing next to me was white!   I even called to let the establishment know of their bartender's disgusting behavior and the manager was shocked. When you have waitstaff that pulls something like this, that person represents the ENTIRE establishment! Retrain bartender #103 because that was the most disgusting situation that has happened to me.  Bartender #103 needs to remember that antics like that won't be accepted in the real world.   Even though that disgusting situation with bartender #103 happened, the two bartenders (a male with dark hair and a female with dark hair), who were at the upstairs bar, gave far better service even though they were just as swamped as the back bar. Kudos to the two of you!"}
{"text":"Went here as a stop while crawling along UofI. I think it's a cute place, I like the interior design. Nice bathrooms, decent drinks. Laid-back atmosphere...a huge step up from Kam's!"}
{"text":"One of the many campus bars, Firehaus has a good combo of fun drinking atmosphere as well as a top choice to take your family. The food is better than most other places on campus as far as bar and grill is concerned. Their best options are half priced wings on Sundays/Mondays, the Hazmat or FDNY wrap (1/2 priced on Saturdays), and their chili.   Some things to note are that the waiting staff is usually new during the summer and leading into the fall. Give them some time to learn and adjust to the bar. It can be easy to get aggravated if you're there with a huge group drinking but everyone wants separate checks and the waiter mixes up drinks. Also, the appetizers aren't really worth it omitting the Firehaus fries. Most portions are simply to small for the list price.   Side note: When the upstairs bar is open it really opens up the establishment. There is a second story outside deck as well as an outside alleyway (paved and meant to serve as a patio) to sit and dine outside."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went to Firehaus for a relaxed night. We were both looking forward to pretzel bites and a burger. Initially we had to wait at least 15 minutes to even get noticed once we'd say down, and after only asking for drinks, the waitress took another 15 minutes to get our water. After finally planning our orders for appetizers and burgers, we thought that food would be on its way. Much to our disappointment, we waited, and waited, and continued to wait. Groups that had come in after us received appetizers while we waited, and not once did any of the staff even approach our table or offer to refill our water. Overall, we spent an hour and a half with no food and minimal attention before we gave up and left.   It's a shame because I've heard the food is great, but we never got the chance to see for ourselves."}
{"text":"It is really hard to review a bar from your college town.  The nostalgia factor gets in the way of objectivity!  I've always liked Firehaus but it was never one of my haunts.  I like how they have large tables, and how the front is open-air.  They have lots of daily drink specials, and the atmosphere isn't sketchy.  Dim lighting, very red in there.  Well I guess it is a firehouse.  Despite it \"looking\" nicer than some other campus bars (it's really just that it's newer, I'm sure), you are still going to run into some silly silly people.  Last time we were here, a drunk guy was talking to us and wouldn't leave, so we took his flip flops and hid them in the girls bathroom.  So you know, it's not a total class act of a bar, but it's pretty clean and well-maintaned compared to some of the other options."}
{"text":"Good burgers, good fries. good place for large groups since you can get a large table in the open air section and enjoy nice weather and be loud, but overall, it scores average for champaign. Decent atmosphere, decent food, decent service. I couldn't find much to not like, but not much to rave about."}
{"text":"I hesitate to take my son here based on sketchy reviews. But, it was great fun and a good place to take a touring high-schooler.  Claire our server was lovely and attentive. The menu had something for everyone and the cocktails were strong and tasty.  Our bill for two was less than breakfast at ORD yesterday. Gotta love this lively place!"}
{"text":"I like the food here and the drinks are pretty well made, but the wait staff and management are pretty lackluster. Food takes longer than you'd expect and management just kind of mills around and isn't very helpful getting potters filed when the bar is slammed.   Better management is needed here, but it's still worth a trip for pretzel bites and Firehaus fries."}
{"text":"Everything is just pretty standard. Tried fries and mac & cheese bites. Don't expect too much out of it. Meh~"}
{"text":"I remember a time when this place was called R&R's and there was the legendary Sharkbowl.  This place got a face lift and now it's called Firehaus.  Now they've replaced it with the fishbowl which is a much smaller fruitier version of the sharkbowl.  Oh well.  There isn't much room for dancing.. but I like how there is no cover for 21+.  It also is a college scene but it's one redeemable aspect is that the people are pretty good looking."}
{"text":"Pros: +Cheap Long Islands (at least on Mondays, the day I was there) +Crispy and well-seasoned fries  Cons: -Service was a little slow, especially considering the place wasn't busy. -Instead of walking around our large group, server tried to take and deliver orders from one end of the table. This resulted in some confusion and at least one messed up order."}
{"text":"I am soooo torn in writing this review right now!  So let's break it down into two visits, one nightlife related, one evening food related.  Nightlife: I came here for a friend's 21st and waited for an hour until 145 a.m. (yes, 15 min. before close) when I just said f**k it and left with my friends. Honestly, what is the point of maintaining the line that close to closing when the bar itself is not at capacity??  Evening: We came here at the end of Fall semester as an organization to celebrate a job well done. Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group. We came on a Thursday I think which meant $3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries. Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust. On top of that, they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal. Expect to pay more for a pint than for your entire meal haha.  So it's quite bittersweet... awesome bar food place turned horrible bar at night? This is life :("}
{"text":"One of my favorite places on campus. Great food, good drink deals, minimal cover. Have yet to encounter asshole bar managers 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I remember coming a few years ago to watch some NBA game, and then more recently as a random stop with a few new friends. I feel like it was night and day for me. The service was terrible, and I am a stickler for good service. The kicker: it wasn't even all that busy! Food is standard bar food, the drinks are alright, I just hate having to track down people to get a simple order of a few beers. I'd hate to see what it looks like when it's really busy."}
{"text":"The food at Firehaus is pretty excellent.  I love that you can get the burgers on pretzel buns, and the Firehaus fries are the greatest thing ever!  I've never had trouble with the service either.  One time, I was given the employee discount because the waitress \"kept forgetting about us,\" but if she did, I certainly never noticed.  I do wish the kitchen was open later, though.   The Firehaus fries are $3.99 on Fridays, but even though the kitchen is supposed to close at 10, if I get there past 9:30, it's already too late.  I don't have too much experience with the nightlife here, but it seems pretty crowded when I go to get my fries.  Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you, but it was kind of a pain that I couldn't hear any of my friends from across the table.  I've been there a few times earlier in the week when it's less crowded, and it's been pretty enjoyable.  Last word of advice:  avoid the amaretto stone sours.  Unless the person making mine messed something up, it just wasn't good.  It was bland and syrupy,"}
{"text":"I found myself here a couple of times within the last couple weeks and am surprised I don't come to Firehaus more often.  The inside is pretty nice for a campus bar. It's a multi-level layout with plenty of seating and some standing area. They even have like a small rooftop area and really sweet outdoor \"beer garden\" type thing, plus an additional upstairs bar area that appears to open when it gets crowded, which unfortunately was not either of the times I was there.  They had decent specials, $3 Jaeger bombs and $3 Jim Beam the times I was there, plus a few other ones for beer and food during the day.  Service was pretty quick both times I was there.  We didn't pay cover either time we were there, it seems as if there is cover on really crowded nights.  Have not had the food but heard it's decent.  Pretty nice place for campus!"}
{"text":"I usually have decent service and food here, however that was not the case this time. Me and my friends waited at least 30 minutes for our food to come and the place was not very crowded. The waitress took awhile to come take our orders as well. Once the food finally came, I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the southwest chicken sandwich and the chicken was so dry and tough I could barely bite into it. I could probably give somebody a concussion if I hit them in the head with this chicken. No amount of sauce could salvage it. I'm going to McDonald's after this to get a mcchicken because I'm leaving hungry."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but what I miss the most is what used to be here: my beloved R and R's....Wednesday night mug nights with $2 HUGE mugs of bud, bud light or cider beer...it was dirty and crowded and hot, but played GREAT 80s hair band music (and even music from 80s movies like the Karate Kid...how awesome is that?)..ok, back to reality...Firehaus is pretty because it's newer and the food is pretty standard bar fare, but nothing spectacular.   The decor is nice and eye-catching though. I will go when I'm in town just to reminisce about it's predecessor and those addictive shark bowls with the plastic squeaky shark...ok, now I'm just rambling, sorry!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. I had the wings for starters and a burger. The wings where really good. Burger was small but great taste. Our food came out fast too. All in all the food and service was great."}
{"text":"Two words - GREAT SERVICE. Came here for lunch on a Saturday with a buddy.   I ordered the Royal Burger - fried egg and bacon on a pretzel roll. The patty was homemade and delicious. However. the rolls - the pretzel roll was ...meh. Not the soft chewy consistency I expected.   Based purely on food alone - I give this place 3-stars - it's average.   However, it deserves an extra star for its service. For the first time (in a LONG time) I was pleasantly surprised by the attentiveness, cheerfulness, and friendliness of the restaurant staff. Emma, our server, had such a great personality!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS BAR!   Always came here with my grad school buddies after school, or work, or would start our Thursday nights here. It's fun for gamedays, too!  It's one of the cleaner bars on campus and also has fantastic food! I highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip and apps.  Thursdays are fishbowl nights, but I have since outgrown a need to drink those but you can get good drink deals. I spent Halloween here and find myself returning for any excuse to hangout in campustown."}
{"text":"Restaurant review On a cold winter night on new year's day we attempted to go to Sakanaya, but it was closed. Luckily we stumbled around and found this place open for dinner. Most of the students had gone home for the holidays so it was a perfect fit as this is not really a \"family restaurant\" but a bar with bar food. We ordered the cheese curds which for 5.99 was very little cheese curds and not really that good. They taste like they came from the freezer. The royale burger was a lot burger with double meat patty topped with egg, cheese, bacon, and a pretzel roll. It is definitely not a steak house burger but it was juicy and with good meat flavors. Overall it was good, but not very memorable. The one major plus is if you drink they have quite an extensive bar menu with daily drink specials.  Pros: daily drink specials, lots of bar food  Cons: the food is okay, I can't say that it is the best bar food I have ever had. The cheese curds were a big let down  Hidden deals: Daily drink specials check out my picture of that menu Daily 10% discount for lunch for UI students and faculty Mon-Friday"}
{"text":"We were here on a busy Friday afternoon before a concert. Everything was clean, the bartender was handling the crowd very nicely. I really have no complaints other than the ambiance not being very exciting for a bar."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have ever been. Kept us waiting for more than an hour after we had ordered. Shitty place!"}
{"text":"Hmmm firehaus was nice on the inside, air conditioned, clean for a bar, espec. a campus bar.  My dining partner and I thought the firefighter photography on the wall was on the depressing side, but at least it fit the motif.  Our waitress was competant, and left us alone to conduct our business.  My sandwhich was $7 though, and I still had to pay extra for fries.  Not crazy about that."}
