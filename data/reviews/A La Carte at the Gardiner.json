{"text":"The location, ambiance, service, and food quality were all fantastic and made for a very enjoyable meal during Summerlicious! It seems that they had some organizational issues. We had to wait a while for them to take our order, and strangely enough, they brought our mains before we finished our appetizers. It was just a timing issue and our servers were very nice. Other than that, we loved it!"}
{"text":"Located on the 3rd floor of the Gardiner Museum. This is one of Toronto's best kept secretes. I went with my friend Jett and two other acquaintances. From the moment you walk off the elevator and enter the room you know you are in for a one of a kind experience. Lunching to live piano off to the side and an expansive window with a view of downtown.  We had a good selection of the menu including soup, market salad, roll ups and the beef sandwich. All nicely plated and served. Everything done to perfection. Definitely a must experience."}
{"text":"As others have noted,  A la carte Bistro is a fantastic hidden gem! I lived for 19 years in the city and didn't even know about it's existence until now. First impressions are awe inspiring. The ambiance is sleek and modern and spacious with the 20 foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows overlooking University Avenue and Queen's Park. The food was superlative due to the quality of presentation and the refinement and care taken in the dishes. We ordered a lobster club sandwich special as well as the salmon egg benedict.  We were so happy with the overall experience that we are planning a return visit with friends and family in tow. Service /food quality/presentation /value are all 100%."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the service from our waiter was terrible. From the moment I entered the restaurant he avoided eye contact with me and did not speak to me directly except when I placed my order and paid for my meal. I noticed that he was friendly with everyone but me. I have no idea why he treated me this way but he made me feel like I was a second class citizen. I tipped well because I don't think cooking staff should suffer for terrible waitstaff, but I definitely do not recommend this place."}

A La Carte is such an underrated amongst the participating Summerlicious restaurants. It's located upstairs to the Gardiner Museum. First glance at the menu selections would make you think this is a super-healthy focused restaurant. When the food actually come, you realize A La Carte has got its game. 

- Food: I got the Dandelion Salad as starter, Tarte Alsacienne (crustless quiche), and Strawberry Sorbet for desserts. I highly recommend their sorbet as it is made in house and the taste is very refreshing! Portion-wise, they were good enough for my half-empty stomach. I wouldn't come here otherwise as you prob need a second meal after Summerlicious. Makes sense why they opted for the $18 price strategy instead of $28.

- Plating: the food were served on these interesting landscape plates and engraved with \"G\" for the restaurant's initial. Apparently, the artist is Canadian and has his art exhibits in the museum!

- Service: Top-notch service that are similar to the ones you get the more well-known restaurants like Canoe. Our waiter was super knowledgeable about all of our meals. It felt like listening to a talking recipe book when we asked about the ingredients. 

- Environment: huge space but with fewer amount of serving tables. Tables usually seat 4 or 2. Would be awesome if you can get a table near the windows that look out on Queens Park. I think this extra empty space can be reserved for private events or corporate functions as they also offer catering on the side.

I would choose this restaurant if you are looking for something new and interesting in the St George and Queens Park area. Good environment for meet-ups and brunches in smaller groups. You can't go wrong with dining inside a museum!"}
{"text":"I am part of a non profit organization and we went to see the Kent Monkman exhibit. Before the tour we had lunch at the restaurant. The service was exceptional. Hey were very accommodative of our diverse needs and even gave everyone a complementary cheesecake for desert. I ordered the the feature that day which was salmon. It came with potatoes and some vegetables. I ate every bite is was so delicious. We also got a table with a view of the ROM just next door. Awesome. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I think this place needed more than 1 server on a Sunday afternoon. Overall this place is not bad, the view is nice and the presentation of the food was fire. The only thing I don't understand is why you have to charge $2 for hot water? Like I get it maybe like 25 cents that's fine but why $2????? I just wanted to eat my medicine. And after we finished our meal, it took them more than 20 mins to give us the bill; because he was the only one working!!! At least we got to explore the museum for free after brunch. Oh well ~"}
{"text":"One of the best summerlicious joint! Affordable, good food, friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Love love love the lemon tart!"}
{"text":"Lunched with friends during Winterlicious and all of us very much enjoyed the experience. Butternut squash soup with sage and a drizzle of maple syrup was a highlight. We appreciated being able to order dishes as diverse as paella and chicken pot pie in a Winterlicious menu. The service was very attentive, and the winter light pouring through the big windows created a pleasant ambience."}
