{"text":"Pros: nice staff. Good breakfast buffet.  Cons: Wifi did not work. Only one elevator was running. No hot water for showers. Coworker made complaint and was told to let it run -- there was a 'green hotel' card in the bathroom. The shower could has used a good scrubbing. Room service available but no menu in room. Nothing of interest close to hotel, have to drive a few miles."}
{"text":"All I can say was wow. I was here for work for 2 days. It's close to where I was working and easy to find. I walked into my hotel room and noticed the carpet was dirty. I should of just checked the room right away but I was tired from my flight and arrived late. Their was hair (not my color hair) on the bathroom floor. Their were some hair on my pillows in the bed. It looked liked no one cleaned it. Especially behind the bed. I found tons of dirt and a receipt behind the bad. I couldn't wait to leave. The staff is friendly but I didn't pay to stay in a dirty room. Don't pick this place!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Rooms are mediocre, if that. Absolutely no channels you'd slightly be interested in. Complimentary breakfast shouldn't even exist. Yes, they have on-site laundry room, gym, BUT nothing works. The ONLY perk is the free-wifi, but that's definitely not enough for me to ever come back."}
{"text":"If you need to be online for anything other than the internet, move on, the connection will not say established for more than 5-10 minutes, and uploads are a joke, Service tries their best, but in the end they know less than you do.   Hard Pass"}
{"text":"Well where do I begin.   The room itself: You're giving a small room with a small old school box TV. They've tried to renovate the place but neglected the fact that they could have upgraded TVs for cheap. The only thing going for them is some of the rooms have sleep number beds... But if you don't get one have fun because the other beds suck. The paint was chipping off in the bath tub. They tried to fix a desk drawer with a staple gun and didn't check their work because I cut my leg pretty bad on a staple sticking out the bottom. The Internet is horribly slow. The heaters in the room are highly inaccurate because it reads the temperature coming off the huge windows next to it = major temperature swings. The room was at least clean though.  Service: Terrible. The first day I had my Do Not Disturb sign on which was taken off at 9:30 a.m. No one EVER came to clean our room or ask us if we needed anything. I let that day slide until the next day. The next day I had my do not disturb sign on until 11:30 a.m. 2 hours later no one still never came by so I decided to call the front desk. No one picked up. I went down there and told them and they said someone would be up shortly... 3:30 pm and still nobody! So I called again... No one picked up. Waited 10 minutes and called again... Finally someone picks up and gets someone to our room. It just pisses me off.  Would never return here again. If you are looking for a place to sleep and that's it then this is your place. Other than that don't stay here.  1 week later update: apparently 3 other rooms my friends were staying in never received room service as well. Either it isn't this hotels policy to do so, or the housekeepers are lying and are checking off rooms even though they didn't clean them."}
{"text":"Radisson Eastlake was a perfect location for our guests to stay. The Radisson was a very nice hotel and offered great amenities for the price. Event coordinator Amy Black and Amy Palker did an amazing job answering all of questions and making sure every detail was perfect. We had 70 rooms booked at the Radisson and \" The Amy's\" helped set up limo shuttle service to the reception hall, a private breakfast room and Bloody Mary bar the Sunday morning after our wedding. They also made sure the hotel bar was fully staffed for our wedding guests. I truly believe that the Radisson was the perfect hotel for our wedding guests."}
{"text":"This is an okay hotel. Decent rooms,nice sleep number beds. Not really anything but business parks around for a couple miles so that's weird. Hotel front desk is extremely accomidating and helpful though."}
{"text":"This was listed as a 3 out of 4 star hotel so I booked the reservation. As soon as I walked in I should of known but wanted to give the place the benefit of doubt. The lobby was a bit dated so I thought until I got into the room, OMG, I was taken back to the 70's, it was as if I had walked into a time machine so I'll let the photos tell the rest of the story."}
{"text":"We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and our experience wasn't great. The air conditioner didn't work that well, the rooms were very out dated and the rooms were never cleaned well.  I don't believe our sheets were changed at all during our stay. Not to mention 2 of the 6 days our room wasn't cleaned because we were in the room past 8am.  We had free Wi-fi, but it didn't work great! The gym has only 3 cardio machines, 1 was broken. The machines looked like they had never been cleaned. The pool was clean, but very old. We went for about 15 minutes one day, and 5 people came in through the exit to use the pool.   Next time we come to Eastlake, we will be staying somewhere else. One good thing I have to say is the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Room clean and staff friendly. Will be back. Only a 15 minute to Classic Park (home of the Lake County Captains).  Would go back,"}
{"text":"Spent a night here over a month ago.when I woke up there was no water was never told this when I check in.the manger at the desk told me it was my fault that there was signage placed out to read she point to a sign o look even in the day when not tired was printed on red paper with a a dark print and could hardly read standing four ft from. Gave my number and have been tring to get ahold of someone to do something about it but no one will call me back have left my phone number five times."}
{"text":"VERY unimpressive. This place seems to have zero expectations and ambition to have a nice hotel. Pulling up just made me nervous to see what the inside looked like. It looks like the hotel is crying because of how old and run down it looks.   Walking in, everything seems okay. Very very outdated, but no strange smells and appears clean. They have a bar and small restaurant. It's 8.00 for breakfast, definitely didn't look worth the price.   Once I got to my room, there were over 3 dead bugs in my windowsill (moths, spiders). At that point, I had to check for bed bugs. There was TONS of trash under both beds in the rooms. Bottles, wrappers, etc.   There were dead bugs in the bathroom light, tiling in the shower falling apart, sprinkler a over the bathroom mirror had no cover, you could see up into the ceiling.   All around, very run down, not high expectations with maintenance and housekeeping. Just need a one night stay somewhere with low expectations, go here."}
{"text":"I will be staying here again the next time I have business in Cleveland.  I thought the location was great to get to a variety of client meetings.  My room was huge, my bed was comfortable and the staff was nice.  I'm not sure what the negative reviews were for.  I thought the breakfast buffet was ok, but not great.  No fresh fruit was available or hot tea both of which seem like a basic thing to offer.  But it was fast and filling."}
{"text":"Never again: $99/night for 8 nights, (for a variety of reasons, no ability to change hotels) with no Internet??? The customer care folks obviously know this is a looser hotel & form lettered back the following:  \"On behalf of our entire staff at Radisson we apologize for the concerns you shared about your experience at this hotel.  We are working diligently to improve the high speed internet service in our hotel.  I understand that this is an important amenity for our guests, and I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this caused for you.\"  \"We appreciate your feedback and will use it to fine tune our operations in the hope that upon your next visit we can exceed your expectations. Sincerely, Andrea Boatright, Online Customer Support, Corporate Customer Care\".  Methinks they'll \"fine tune\" their operations & pay the $150 to remove this bad review, rather than to fix the multitude of problems..."}
