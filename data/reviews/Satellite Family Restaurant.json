{"text":"I stopped in for lunch because it was so kitschy and the sign said \"new management\".

While it's not fancy, the burger patty was fresh and homemade. The O rings were clearly homemade and delicious.

It was a Monday at noon. Sadly, there was no one else there.

So I pried...
Lazaros and Laura took ownership Dec 20 2014. Lazaros use to work at Zets by the airport.

I can't help but think if more Clarksonians frequent his place it'll be a great spot to go.

I give an honest 4 stars, but I love kitchy diners. This place has serious potential."}

{"text":"Not really the best diner in Port Credit. The Satellite is a perfectly round establishment a stone's throw from the Clarkson GO station. Being attracted to perfectly round things, I had no choice but to spin the car round (right round baby, right round) into their expansive parking lot. The parking lot, by the by, was the highlight of my visit. (Foreshadowing!)

The exterior signage is all hand-painted and flaking white signs. Obviously charmed, we ventured into the oreo-shaped resto. Decor is best described as \"round diner.\" Belted by windows, the natural light really brings out their palette of sad orange and \"charlie\" brown (the saddest shade there is). The booths don't feature 'benches' exactly but bark-coloured pleather seats that resemble the bifurcated front seats of an old Chevy station wagon. (And they fold up for some reason.)

There were both breakfast and lunch options available. Ordering from the counter I snagged a a burger and fries. My patty was microscopic, dry and not very good. My date's omelette was decent. The meal for two was fairly cheap ($21) but bordering on inedible. The Satellite this may be, but even astronaut food has to be better than this.

Obligatory Title Pun: SATELL-up and get outta here.

Menu Readability: There was both the classic diner board in 1970s mustard coloured back-lit lettering, and a dry-erase board leaning precariously near the counter, and a chalkboard with lunch specials. I guess that's three things.

Need to mention: There are literally a dozen better places 500m east of here.

What this place teaches me about myself: Perfectly round doesn't always mean perfectly sound."}
