{"text":"Great lunch spot for cheap pasta or veal/chicken paninos. Only open weekdays though. Lunch specials with a sandwich and drink for $5.95."}
{"text":"If you love your pasta this is the place to buy it. From spaghetti , macaroni, they have it all are favourite is the meat ravioli. Just add it to boiling hot water  for 12min and you done add you home made sauce and you have a great meal. They also have a hot table it looks good but I never tried it . They have a few locations in Mississauga but this is head office and just a few min from my home. This location closes earlier then there other locations. A must try is there lobster ravioli a bit pricey but so good."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this location to pick up a prepared lasagne as requested by the Mr. He's mentioned a few times that it's quite impressive and had to try for myself!  The location is in an industrial area and was around lunchtime so was extremely busy. The line up at the hot table was about 10 people deep with another couple of people waiting for their called in orders.   I grabbed my medium sized lasagne ($16.95) from the refrigerated area and proceeded to get into the line up. I was drooling over the hot table. Everything looked fresh and amazing.   I was able to pay as I was not waiting for anything else which I bought was quite courteous of the staff.   I would have to say the lasagne was probably the best I've had for an already prepared one. Several layers of tender pasta, no skimping on the cheese and a beautiful rich meat sauce.   I will definately return to try some other items."}
{"text":"Horrible Penne Pasta and Meatballs.  Which ever location served this Friday at the Mississauga Italian Fest, the Penne was horrible. Way too soft. It was mushy and made me sick. I was so disappointed. Pasta should be al dente.  As an Italian, I'm ashamed of how bad it was and how you are serving this, claiming to be Italian at an Italian festival. The meatballs were horrible as well. I couldn't even finish eating it."}
{"text":"As per expected from a mass-produced hot table for the lunch crowd.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I've had Palma Pasta bookmarked for a while, but only got to it now.  Atmosphere was clean, there was a small dine-in area, and it wasn't busy at 12:30pm.  Offerings were various types of pastas including tortellini, penne, lasagna ($5.75, but not sure of serving size), & one in a cream sauce.  There were also cuts of meats (veal, chicken) in sauces for Italian sandwiches.  Lady behind the counter was efficient and seemed friendly.  I got the special of the day, Chicken Sorrentino (basically a flat, breaded white meat with another flat, breaded piece of eggplant with some melted cheese & tomato on top) with pasta at $7.95.  Portion was decent for price, at least 2-3 servings.  I choose the penne and it was alright.  Made from dry pasta, slightly overcooked, sauce was nothing special.  Chicken faired slightly better, breading was seasoned, but chicken itself was not.  Sorta bland.  Criticism:  Packaging did not survive the trip to Square One, a 2.5 block drive!  Cardboard cover came loose and spilled all inside the plastic bag, making the eating a bit difficult.  Would I go back?  Maybe if I was in the area.  Are there better options?  Definitely!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best pasta I've had that is fast foodie in Toronto. Love their meatballs and lasagna. So good! And the ladies who work there are so nice!! Get there early. Before 12 noon is best as the food goes fast."}
