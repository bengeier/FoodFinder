{"text":"Great East European food and a cozy patio. Warm service, Family owned. Ask for feta on your fries - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to California a handful of times and have never been disappointed.  The goulash dinner with mashed potatoes is probably the best I've tasted! Last night we went with a few guests and we were all impressed.  Everything was very fresh including the bread and salads. Service is really attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing eastern European restaurant. The ?evapi are a must try and they really taste like back home."}
{"text":"This restaurant is owned by a Macedonian family, so I thought the 'kebapche' will be great, but no such luck.  The spices were right, but the quality of the meat was below grade.  It tasted old, chewy and fatty.    The most important thing about any kind of grill from the Balkans is the freshness and quality of the meat.  Best grill is made from meat that was slaughtered in the last 24 hours. This meat was obviously not fresh neither of high quality.  Our party ordered a few more items which were ok , but the quality of the meat was a real letdown."}
{"text":"Walked by this place many times and finally decided to stop in. It's a nice place, the bar was full, but not too many patrons in the restuarant area. My friend ordered  the souvlaki sandwich and said it was alright. I ordered the burger, it was horrible. I couldn't eat it. It was a frozen patty. My friend tried a piece and spit it out.The menu says 'all natural homemade'  it wasn't. Processed cheese to boot!  The service was great, friendly and I possibly will be back in the summer for a pint on the patio, we will just eat beforehand. I don't see the point in sending food back if it's that bad. I just leave it.   That's my 2 cents."}
{"text":"I admit, I love pork souvlaki on a pita. And have tried that item at several places. But this place has the best on that item by far. The staff learn your name by the second or third visit, the food is served rather quickly even on the one time I went when it was quite busy, the taste of the food was excellent, the selection of beers available was really good, plus they had some that are not available at other places we've been to, which my husband LOVED (I don't drink alcohol), all at a reasonable price, the bill for 2 people there rarely comes to over $30, and usually around $25. Oh and the seats and booths are really comfortable."}
{"text":"You know when you go to a few establishments because they're close and convenient? They may not necessarily be the best but they do the trick. This is one of those pubs for me because I could literally throw a rock from my school parking lot and hit the place.  When I first saw the place I was expecting crap. It was the only pub in the area, it was never busy, the clientele was fairly older, and there was only one person working in the pub. Things changed once I walked inside. The decor is nicer than what you would expect. I was expecting pure hole in the wall quality but what I received was a pleasant surprise. Long dark wood bar, 3 flat screen TVs, dark tables and chairs, leather banquettes and booths, and everything was extremely clean.  Service has more of a homey feel than what you may be used to. Sometime long wait times and a little disorganized but the workers are so warm and caring that it's hard to be upset over it. It feels like your at Aunt Sally's and she said she'd get you something to drink, then remembers a \"funny\" story about what happened last time she tried getting a drink.  30mins pass and you're still thirsty.   Food is hit and miss. Normally in scenarios like this I would suggest a menu item but none of the items are consistent.   Overall, this place does the trick for me because it has to. Grab a $5 pint of Guiness and watch the bootleg European soccer being played on the plasma.Be prepared to talk a lot with the wait staff."}
