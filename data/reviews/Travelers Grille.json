{"text":"Great food and people! Love the pizza, steak, perogis and burger with perogias on it! Yum!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wed night. Arrived around 6pm and it was busy.  Only one bartender and so service was a little slow, the cook actually came out and was helping her with the crowd.  By the time we started eating it seemed to clear out.  I ordered A burger med rare and it was totally burnt.  I could only eat half, my husband ordered the wing they were .50 special and they were really really good.   So when I go back, which we will, I will definitely just stick w the wings."}
{"text":"Started making this place a tradition. 0.99$ steaks on Monday are amazing. Decent sized steaks normally get 2 plus onion rings. Best onion rings in the area. Started going for wing night as well their wings are better the BWW. Great food great service I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"The waitresses are rude, by far the worst service I've ever experienced. They are racist, it's almost as though they were never taught customer service. I was given a butter knife to cut steak, my fork was dirty. The hallways reek of smoke. You have to look as though you're gonna walk out without paying to even get your check. The nasally red head waitress badgers you about a tip as though it's not common knowledge to tip. Do yourself a favor and just stay away, they suck! Steaks are burnt around the edges, too much seasoning. Onion rings are disgusting and too greasy. You pay for the drink by the drink so like no refills and the one server tried to give us these baby ass cups.   .99 cent steaks  probably raccoon meat."}
{"text":"My two friends and I ended up at this bar because it's one of the few in the area with a juke box. Not only were we berated for playing the music that we like. After I backed up the entire bar only one of the other rude patrons thanked me. This environment is only conducive for drop out alcoholics and people who don't have a job. By the way *Ashely* the bartender who didn't introduce herself to us, also participated in the regulars berating."}
