{"text":"Leaving this 1 star review because my credit card got charged multiple times (and the wrong amount), and I have called and left my name and number twice to get this resolved. It's been 48 hours since I had lunch there, and I still have heard back from no one. Very disappointed in this service."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Love the style and decor of this restaurant. We went on a Thursday around 7 and were seated right away. The bar was very busy. Seems like a popular after work place.  The food was good. The house made salsas were amazing! We also got he queso which was good but not the best I've ever had.  I got the steak tacos and they were excellent. My boyfriend had the chicken nachos and said were fine but nothing special.  Our friends got the enchiladas and were very happy with their choice.  Our server was Jessica and she was excellent. She answered all of our questions and offered great suggestions."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch today. I was by myself and sat at the bar.  30 minutes in bartender told me lunch would be free. 40 minutes after ordering they still didn't manage to put a plate in front of me. Lots of people came in after me and got served. I had to get back to work so I didn't manage to eat here."}
{"text":"Definitely plan on waiting at this spot. There is a place with tables outside in the back where you can wait and have drinks. Whatever they tell you about the wait add about 30 minutes to. The drinks are good and the food is great. We ordered 6 different meals and 2 desserts and everything was good. Chips and salsa as well as the queso with chorizo was amazing - must order. I would definitely recommend this place but don't go when you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Great concept, nearly flawless execution! Food was fresh, unique, and que rico?! I was really impressed with the flavors incorporated into the various tacos (the shrimp dorado is obscenely tasty). I also had the Matador: a quirky tequila cocktail with pineapple, cilantro, and lime...absolutely delicious. Wait staff, on all fronts, was top notch; Pharoah undoubtedly made our experience one of a kind. Definitely give this joint a whirl if you enjoy tequila, Tecate, and tacos!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Great food! Service was really good. Our waitress Maggie was very helpful and very engaged. Great place to grab dinner and drinks. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are great, not your regular. Chips are the thin and crispy type and 2 types of salsa are served. Appetizer Fondita was great!! Would order again and again. Appetizer came out very fast. We ordered the carne asada and was enough to share for 2. It took a little longer than normal to come out. It was more like a T-bone steak than a thin skirt steak. The flavors were good and we asked for extra tortillas as the tortillas were very good! Unlimited rice & beans were also served with the meal. The price is higher than you would expect for Mexican/Tex Mex but the food was very delicious and a great addition for Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of the best Tex-Mex restaurant I have eaten before. It was delicious, portions were perfect for Me. The chips and salsa with the tomatillo sauce is best eveeeer. They are so addictive. Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"We dined here on opening night as well. Overall nice interior and people were relatively friendly. The wait staff struggled a bit (most likely first time nervousness) but you can tell they are not used to carrying trays yet.   Food was excellent. I did receive a cup of salsa all over my pants from a server attempting to carry the tray, but after that the food was really good (short rib).   The manager did come by after the salsa spill and tell us he'd bring margaritas, but I was a little surprised to see it charged on our bill. Drinks are delicious but a little smaller than a traditional Mexican restaurant.   All in all, good to try and really good food, but I think they might have some growing pains until they get things rolling."}
{"text":"Wow.   Went in for Sunday Brunch and noticed a terrible sewage rotten eggs smell and tried to move away from the door. Decided to get a table instead of sit a the bar and were told they were on a wait because servers weren't coming in and they didn't want to back the kitchen up.  I kid you not, it was probably 10:15 a.m. and there were maybe, 2 tables in the front that were occupied and about 3 in the back.  They \"just got off of a wait,\" the hostess told us. I was dumbfounded.  You never place blame on your FOH staff like that and say we can't seat you because people haven't shown up. If you need to pull the bartender off of the bar because NO ONE is sitting there, then do so, ask a manager to help, and then attack service as a team which is what you are in the SERVICE industry.  Way to stick up for the BOH but come on, you can walk real slow to the table. You can make conversation about the menu before departing, suggest dishes, ask if we've been before, etc. All of these things add time, give your staff a little breather, and then you move on.  Really disappointed.  Ended up not staying because of the disgusting smell because we couldn't take it and, we couldn't sit anywhere else."}
{"text":"My family and I tried to come here a few Saturdays ago for dinner: mistake!! Two hour wait and we were starving, so we went elsewhere. HOWEVER. The following weekend my husband and I were in the area running errands and were needing a good brunch (who doesn't need a good brunch..?!). So he looks online and says \"hey Superica actually serves brunch starting at 10, let's go there!\" no mistake there!!   At 10:06 am we were the only people in the restaurant (for a while- it picked up by the time we left). We were promptly served two salsas and they were each explained to us (one spicier, one smokier- both made in house). The waitress also informed us that while it was time for brunch, the entire menu was available as well.   We ended up getting queso with chorizo and splitting the steak and eggs. We both loved them!! The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare), the eggs were wonderfully runny but not under done, and the peppers, onions, Mexican butter, and fixins were perfect. They even brought out a third salsa which complemented the breakfast expertly.  I'm the kind of customer that will enjoy a meal experience more if service is attentive and the decor is appropriate. Superica should know that both service and the restaurant as a whole were excellent. The decorations hit Tex-Mex spot on and they committed to the theme all the way throughout the space, including bathrooms. My husband and I both chatted with two waitresses who, even at 10 am, were bright and happy and had no problem carrying a conversation with us.   So 5/5 stars for food, decor, service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. Tried the enchilada and hard taco lunch special. Great atmosphere with a lot of seating and unique decor. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 rating, but more of a 3 than 4. After much hype, a group of friends and I decided to give Superica a try. For a group of 10, the wait was 2 HOURS, even when we said we would be fine with 2 tables of 5. To say I was HANGRY is an understatement. Once we were seated, things began looking up. Our waitress, Samantha, was amazing! She constantly tended to us and removed plates, cups and etc. from our table as quickly as possible to ensure we would be comfortable.   We ordered a plethora of appetizers to share including the Guacamole, Queso, Chicken Fajita Nachos and Campechana de Mariscos. I highly recommend the Queso, definitely best Queso I've ever had! I also really love their house made sauces for the complimentary chips. For dinner, I tried the Gulf Red Snapper and the Gulf Shrimp and Snapper Ceviche. LOVED the Gulf Red Snapper and the presentation was amazing! They deep fried a giant red snapper and simmer it under verde sauce and avocado. We devoured the entire fish! Market price was $34 I believe, which I thought was a good value. Sadly, the ceviche was extremely underwhelming. It lacked flavor and the shrimp/Snapper were overpowered by the ingredients in the dish. Strange that it was both overpowering and lacked flavor? While our overall experience was enjoyable, most of the dishes didn't live up to 2 hours worth of expectation. Also, prices are pretty high for a Tex-Mex spot (in my opinion). Not sure I'd come back for that kind of wait time, but was worth the try.    Recommend: 1. Queso 2. Red Snapper  Don't Recommend: 1. Campecchana 2. Ceviche   Heads up - a good amount of the dishes had quite a kick to them. While I love spicy food, I know a lot of people do not. If you're sensitive to spicy food, I would recommend informing your server."}
{"text":"Excellent service, outstanding food, eclectic atmosphere- need I say more? Highly recommend the Hot Stacks, best pancakes I have ever had."}
{"text":"The best! I'm in love with this place and the food is outstanding! I had the brisket tacos and the flavor was intoxicating."}
{"text":"So disappointed with EVERYTHING except the actual entree  ( which arrived 1 hr after being seated ) we arrived and put our name in and were told it would be a 45 min wait / no worries,  we figured we would grab a drink from the bar and wait for our table. I gave my cell # and was told I would be texted when the table was ready. We found a spot at the bar to grab drinks while we waited. The bartender was extremely slow . She stopped to unload the dishwasher . Wash out recycled bottles of liquor and stepped to the back bar to hang out for a few minutes . After over a 45 minutes wait to get served at the bar / we were give bottom shelf liquor for tequila shots and when she made our mixed drinks ( placed allllll our  orders at 1 time to save going back up ) she mixed two margaritas in a shaker and then set the shaker with ice on the bar top while she refreshed salsa for a couple folks and took new drink orders before pouring from the shaker into the glasses . Two couples  also waiting during that time decided to walk away and not wait for drinks. What totaled  less than one low ball glass was split into to glasses and heavily iced . When we ordered another round after waiting another 30 min to be seated - the glasses were taller with less ice than our first round had been . Completely inconsistent with both the glass size AND the flavor which made me feel we over paid for the ice filled shot size we got in the first round. If $14 for inconsistent poorly made small super ice filled margaritas is to be the norm, I would not recommend the establishment , no text for our table had been given yet so I went to check the host stand - they were already three tables past us with out having texted - gotta watch and hassle the host to keep her in the ball  and in order I guess.... so two hours after we had arrived we got seated - took another hour before our entrees arrived . Slow to get order taken, extremely slow service - had to ask for waters to be poured into the preset water glasses and that took about 20 min. I had brought a group excited to have them try Suoerica but I was apologetic that I had brought them there... A Thursday night , not even a weekend .... if my friends hadn't been lovely to hang with , I would have walked out before the entree , probably before the first drinks. In a town like Charlotte with so many great options, I don't know why anyone would settle for such a poor experience."}
{"text":"I went to Superica on Friday night with a friend. We did have to wait about an hour for a table, but were able to grab some of their margaritas at the bar. The margaritas were delicious! You could tell the bartenders were very busy and working hard, but nonetheless had incredible service. Because they were so busy, the bar manager told us to have a seat outside and he brought our chips and guac to us outside on the patio- even though it was supposed to just be bar service.   Once we were able to sit, I ordered the shrimp tacos. Service was really fast once we were sitting. Our drinks made it to us within 5 minutes, and our food within 15ish minutes. The tacos were incredible and so filling! The bottomless beans were also incredible, and I love that they are bottomless. The bar manager that had served us earlier even came over to us a few times to check on us and make sure we were situated okay.   Overall, food was delicious, restaurant is beautiful (but yes, very crowded), and service was very attentive and personable! I'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. The restaurant is large and airy. The service was excellent! Our waitress did a great job explaining menu items and gave us great recommendations. The food was by far the best Mexican (Tex-mex) I have had in Charlotte. We started with the five cheese queso and it was really good. The house made tortillas that came with it were amazing. I got a crispy shrimp taco and a vegetable enchilada (our waitress let me get them a la carte as i couldn't decide between the two) and both were super tasty. My friend got chicken enchiladas and said they were the best she has had. I got plantains for desert and they were good but could have used a little more of the sauce they drizzle on top. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty but the service was challenging to say the least.  This place has soooo much potential, but is obviously still working through some of the new crew jitters.   The wife and I stopped in for what we thought  would be a quick and easy lunch. On top of our server making recommendations that weren't available, our food came out wrong twice. Then were uncharged for the stuff that we thought was standard lol.  What a cluster.   Given the amount of time they got my wife's food right, we had to ask for a to go box so we could get back for work.   I won't say we wouldn't go back here, but it would definitely have to be later down the road once they've worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"So thrilled this place opened near us. The atmosphere is awesome. Great design and overall vibe. The staff is attentive, helpful and friendly and food was awesome! The fundito queso with chorizo is unreal. Drinks were delicious. Love the outdoor patio as well. We'll be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Everything here was amazing and the location is very cool as well. This is nicer than your average Mexican place so be prepared to spend a little more (it's beyond worth it)."}
{"text":"Delicious food with generous portions. My husband and I are both vegetarian, and our waitress was knowledgeable about the options and substitutions. My husband had the puffy tacos and I had the chili relleno, and we were pleased with our choices. I should add that the salsa is amazing too. We will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"High 4 stars for this one. We had a few of their margaritas and it's the only thing holding back from a full 5 star review. Their OG marg was pretty standard but sub par compared to some of our favorite Mexican spots. The Matador was better in flavor, but all around their margs lacked in the strength department. The food and service was excellent. You'll get Tracy if you're lucky. All the host staff and managers we encountered were well trained and friendly but Tracy was our server for the evening and was superb. We tried the queso, guac, chicken verde enchiladas and carnitas tacos and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I went to Superica on a Thursday evening around 6:15 for dinner.  There was a small wait for a table, but we (2 people) were able to grab the last two seats at the bar for immediate service.  The restaurant did fill up very quickly - by 7:00 there were probably 25+ people waiting for tables.  The bartender was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about all of the cocktails options and food recommendations.  For cocktails, we started with the Red Headed Stranger and The Highwayman.  Both were AWESOME.  After our cocktails, we switched to wine/beer.    The chips are served with 2 salsas made in-house.  A smoky salsa and a green avocado salsa - both were outstanding.  For an appetizer, we opted to try the campechana de mariscos - a tomato-based ceviche with octopus, crab, shrimp and avocado.  It was slightly sweet and oh so tasty.  This is definitely a repeat order!    For dinner, we ordered the whole red snapper and the vegetable fajitas with an addition of some chicken.  The red snapper was juicy and pulled easily from the bones.  The vegetable fajitas were amazing - they have a rich smoky flavor that is really unique.  Both are served with rice and beans and a side plate of lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, guacomole and flour tortillas.    The portions for the entrees are really large.  I would recommend ordering one appetizer and one entree to split between 2 people, or skip the appetizer and limit your chip intake!  This will also help keep your bill in-check, as the prices are a bit higher than expected for a tex-mex restaurant.    Overall, we LOVED our meal and look forward to checking out brunch next."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience! I have been to the Atlanta location many times. Some of the worst margaritas I have ever tasted! The lime juice was so sour, I pointed it out to the bartender who tried it and agreed that it was bad. They did nothing to correct the issue. Good atmosphere, food wasn't terrible, but please fix your margaritas!!"}
{"text":"We are from Texas and we have been living in the Carolinas for about 9 months now. I love living here, except for two things: 1. You can't find good beef in the deep south. It's all pork all the time.   2. They don't know a damn thing about Tex-Mex in the deep south.    Well, I can cross number two off that list now. After our visit to Superica yesterday I finally have a Tex-Mex place to go in the Charlotte area. Since we have only been here once I'll give you an overall impression and a blow by blow on the things we tried.  Overall The food is really good. The Chef knows what he is doing, and the food is prepared in an authentic way using high quality, authentic ingredients. Now, that's not to say that everything is perfect, because it's not, for me. This Chef has a sweeter palate in Tex-Mex than I prefer. For example, the enchiladas seem to be finished with a chocolate sauce. It's good, but it's a little sweet for taste. I prefer red sauce on my enchiladas.     The service was over-the-top excellent. The staff were all super friendly, attentive and helpful, as was the manager on duty. They took the time to explain the food and then menu, which was a little odd for us, but it makes sense when you consider that the food is probably unlike anything the locals have every had. After all, most Tex-Mex in the deep south is really bland and consists mostly of tacos and enchiladas.  The restaurant is very cool and has an authentic southwestern feel to it. The tables and chairs are nice and comfortable and there is plenty of seating. The space is very open with really high ceilings and lots of windows. There is lots of parking across the street, which I think they will be needing in the future.   Specifics I had the Parilla Deluxe which is grilled steak and chicken and camarones brochetas. The steak fajitas were among the best I have ever had. They were perfectly marinated to maximum tenderness, but not to the point of being chalky. They had a great grilled flavor as well. The chicken fajitas were super tender and juicy. They had some kind of BBQ sauce on them that was a little heavy on the poblano(?) and bit too sweet for me. But they were still very good and perfectly prepared.  The camarones (shrimp, wrapped in bacon with cheese and jalapenos inside) were really good. They could use a bit more jalapeno bite and a little less grill time, but they were good. The fajita fixins were a little on the small side, but that is easily remedied by asking for more. The tortillas were good and looked as though they were made in house and very fresh. The refried beans were outstanding. If you are a fan of refried beans you have got to try these!   My wife has the picadillo enchiladas. They were very good, however, as I mentioned above the chocolate sauce is too sweet for my taste I would recommend that they add an option to get them with a red or green sauce as well.   My son had the BBQ Brisket sandwich, holy cow was that thing huge! It looked beautiful and he said the taste was amazing. I would have tried it, but it had a ton of guacamole on it and I hate that stuff.   If you are looking for authentic Tex-mex in the Charlotte area this is your only option, but it is a good one and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. My margarita was great. Service excellent. It was a touch pricey though."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had since being in Austin, Texas! Guac, queso, margs, salsas and fajitas were all incredible.  Fun atmosphere and great, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Upscale tex-mex without the high prices. Outstanding food, ambiance, and service! Best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here during the first week of the grand opening. We arrived around 7 and had a 15 minute wait. Once seated the service was excellent, no complaints there. We ordered guacamole and it was delicious. We liked that it came with tostadas. I ordered the Matador margarita and it was unique and delicious. My girlfriend ordered Tommy's Margarita and really liked it. We both thought they could be served in larger glasses. I ordered the Chili Relleno and it was awesome! My girlfriend got the Shrimp Tacos Dorados and loved them. We love this place and will definitely be back! Great atmosphere, food, drinks, and service. Doesn't even compare to the other South End Tex mex restaurants - it's the best!"}
{"text":"Y'all, I promise this is my last update, but I had to brag on how great Superica's customer service is. After my first review, I got a really nice message from the manager. After my updated review with the bill overcharging shenanigans, I got a message from the food group manager who refunded my entire bill. Holy moly!! This is obviously a company that puts a high importance on customer service, which is incredibly rare these days. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"O.M.G. This place is amazing!!! The queso fundido alone is worth traveling from Florida to NC for. The Chile relleno, margaritas and roasted tomato salsa were all on point. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today as a first time patron and would definitely recommend this place.  Nicely decorated and a great vibe all around. Great flavors in the tacos and enchiladas. Endless chips and 2 different kinds of their homemade salsa. The waitress (Sam I believe) was super friendly and knowledgeable. The staff was very attentive when drinks and chips need to be re-filled. Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Finally got to come see what all the hype was about! Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth giving a try? My wife and I came in around 4:50 and were told they weren't seating for dinner until 5, no biggie, I get it, so we just sat at the bar to have drinks, then just decided to end up staying there. She had a pineapple based margarita served up, it was good, but the juice to liquor ratio was a little high. I had a couple Paloma's which were good, can't go wrong with tequila and a bottle of squirt. We liked the two salsas they brought out, and even gave us a small bottle of what tasted like a chipotle \"spicy\" sauce. We had the chicken fajita nachos and the chicken tacos al carbon. The nachos consist of 8 pieces each individually topped with beans cheese and a piece of chicken, with guac/sour cream/pickled veggies/whole cilantro stems in the middle. Only thing that was odd was the cilantro, I get the idea, but most of them had brown/dead leaves so we just took the whole clump off the plate. The tacos also weird, I'm assuming they make their own tortillas, but the tortilla to meat ratio was way off. Each taco is like the size of a burrito almost, and comes wrapped up as a roll. The unlimited beans and rice on the side is a nice touch, though. The main thing I was wary of was the chicken in both items...it was tender to the point where you question if it's cooked all the way through or not, didn't help that the skin on the outside was stretchy/weird so I just peeled it off.   You really have to be able to execute well if you're going to open a Mexican restaurant in a part of town where you are surrounded by similar Tex mex and authentic Mexican, especially for the prices being charged here. For now, I'd attribute most of the faults to growing pains, but we'll probably wait a while before returning."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional, everybody worked together as a team and I was shocked to also see the general manager Shawn busing tables as well. The team was very pleasant, attentive and inviting; especially my servers Lexi and Olivia. To my surprise my whole party meal was comped due to my meal not being ready under 30 minutes (unheard of) but I didn't notice it was long at all because of the great frozen margaritas and fondido lol. The space was very warm and inviting, very hip and family oriented; more importantly the food was amazing and a breath of fresh air for Charlotte foodies...Kudos!"}
{"text":"Calling all people who came from Texas, New Mexico or Arizona!  I have a major announcement.  When someone asks you \"where can I go to get good Tex Mex in Charlotte?\", you will no longer have to tell them to \"go to the airport...where you can catch the next flight out to the South/Southwest\".  Instead, you can drive on over to Superica to get your fix.  Let's discuss...  First off, the dishes have a slightly modern flare to them, but the authentic flavors are there.  I happened to enjoy the smoky salsa, while my boyfriend enjoyed the mild avocado based salsa.  They keep a stash behind the bar, so if you have a long wait, just ask for a basket and they will give it to you for free.  Next we got the Tampaquena and the Picadilla enchilada.  The entree comes with unlimited rice/beans.  Rice flavors were very authentic.  I had to try the puffy queso taco.  Totally not a traditional Tex-Mex dish, but it looked so funny that I had to try it.  Corn masa was made from scratch and on point.  Queso was super yummy.  Second, the place is huge and the decor certainly has a southwest feel to it.  Pictures and deer/horse sculls make you feel like you're in one big Georgia O'Keeffe painting, just more updated.  Third, don't skip the drinks.  They have a nice selection to choose from, and right now, their huge back patio is just for overflow waiting.  Until they get the back area organized for table service, grab some drinks and chips and relax with some friends while you wait for your table.  The real test of success or failure will be on their fajitas and Carne Guisada.  I'm excited and skeptical all at the same time, and I'll absolutely be back to give it try!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!... the service is slow and the bathrooms were not up to par."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place! The food is a little pricy but delicious and unique. Recommend the ceviche."}
{"text":"I went to Superica today with some friends around 6:00. There was no wait and they were able to seat us immediately, and we were greeted by so many employees there that welcomed us and thanked us for coming. We had a very comfy booth. The decor was great and I appreciated that there was a bartender in a designated area to just make drinks for the dining room. That guaranteed we got our drinks quickly!  First, the drinks. I ordered Tommy's Margarita. It was super tasty, but sooooo tiny. In 3 sips it was basically gone. Sad face.   Second, the queso. We were going to order both queso and guacamole, but the waitress suggested we order a different queso that had sausage, guac, and sour cream in it. That queso was incredible!!! I would go back just for the queso and chips.  The main meals were all good. I had the Carne Guisada. It was a stewed beef in a tasty sauce and two warm tortillas. It was very tasty, but I had no idea how to eat them. Do I put them in the tortillas and make a wrap? Do I use the tortilla as a spoon alternative? The tortillas were soooooo good. They felt like they made them right there. I wish they had brought out a plate instead of the wrapped tortillas and a small bowl of my meat served on a wooden tray. I had no place to mix them up or anywhere to put the rice and beans that were family style. I wish they gave more rice and beans for the family style. We were 4 people and were given the same amount one person would get at a traditional Mexican restaurant. Oh well. Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food. My husband ordered Tacos al Pastor and loved them. They were kinda small, but he was surprised how filling they were.   The service was really fantastic. Our waitress did a great job of checking up on us, refilling our water, and giving us time to enjoy the experience. We paid our bill and then sat there for another 20 minutes catching up, and the wait staff continued to refill our waters and never once made us feel rushed. We felt bad when we left and saw a huge line of people waiting to be seated, but the staff never once made us feel like we were an inconvenience.   Overall, it was a good experience. It was a bit pricey, but I think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Food Super duper yummy.  I tried the chicken enchiladas. They were on point - even if a little salty. The entree comes with rice and refried means.  Atmosphere Very cute and quirky. There was a massive crowd on a Saturday night (avg wait time around 1 hr for 2), so we grabbed a seat at the bar  Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Everything we tried was amazing. Salsas, guac, quest, multiple tacos.....def have to go here! You'll be glad you did. And the restaurant is very large so you shouldn't have to wait!"}
{"text":"Such a great concept! Loved the interior and freshness of the food! Great service and not a long wait for a Thursday night! Staff was friendly and all. Food was made pretty efficiently and guacamole was . The ONLY thing I really didn't like was how expensive everything was... $24-$30 for fajitas?? That's a little steep in my opinion. Also, you can't order individual tacos, which is a bummer for people like me who can eat a WHOLE meal. Will definitely go back, but split my meal with someone next time!!:)"}
{"text":"Truly a 5 Star restaurant . Food is outstanding, atmosphere is fun, and service is friendly and warm. This will be a regular spot for me ."}
{"text":"Sunday night, sat at the bar. Amazing salsas with the complimentary chips. Especially the avocado one!   Drinks are small and on the pricy side but nonetheless good! Hubby got a Noda hop drop 12oz for $6 bucks and my Tommy's margarita was $10. My drink was 3 good sips and done! I could of drank 3+! But unfortunately not for $10+.   Hubby and I shared the puffy chicken tacos with endless, yep! I said endless rice & beans. The Refried beans smothered in cheese were amazing. Rice with small chopped vegetables was good as well. Puffy tacos are a must try as they are unlike a soft or a hard shell taco. It's almost a puff pastry filled with taco ingredients fried. It's delicious!! Puff tacos were $14, but after filling up on the fresh salsa and chips, we left plenty on our plates.   Wish I had room for more of the endless rice & beans!  Will be back for food, drinks are justifiably but food was worth it!!"}
{"text":"Really dope spot! The steak fajitas were amazing! You could cut the steak with your fork.  Try the cheesy puffy taco as a side.  The two salsas they bring out with chips are really solid. Go with the chorizo, queso fundito if you're looking for an app.  They also do a great brunch.  Anything with their brisket is worth a try.  Spicy margarita has some kick to it...in a good way."}
{"text":"We visited for drinks on the second night they were open and again for lunch the following day.   As for drinks, we had La Paloma (El Jimador Blanco, fresh lime, glass bottle of Squirt and salt) and El Frio (El Jimador Blanco, Stirrings triple sec, fresh lime, served frozen).  Both drinks were great and I especially loved that you get the whole glass bottle of Squirt with your Paloma!  You can tell they use fresh ingredients in their drinks.  For lunch, we had the lunch special which included your choice of two lunch items (taco, salad, soup, enchilada, or nachos) plus family-style retried beans and rice.  The mole on the chicken enchilada was phenomenal; very rich with amazing flavor.  Nachos are stellar as well; they dress their nachos individually, so that every chip is sure to have beans and cheese on top. That's the kind of attention to detail that makes this place so good. Even the house salad isn't your run-of-the-mill house salad; it has toppings like crispy tortilla strips, radish, cheese, cilantro and cucumber.   The staff was very friendly and attentive during both visits, which is hard to do in your opening week.  This place is kid-friendly with kid menus for food and drink, crayons for drawing and a louder ambiance that will make parents of smaller kids a little more likely to relax! We live close by and can see this place being a staple!"}
{"text":"Popped into this place on a Saturday afternoon. My date and I were seated extremely quickly. Superica has two different types of complimentary salsas. Both were delicious, but the spicier of the two was my favorite.   Our waitress was patient with us as we looked through the menu. The prices skew toward the pricey side. This isn't your neighborhood Chilis. I had a difficult time deciding between their brunch menu and regular menu.   We ordered the shrimp tacos (comes with rice and beans) and the queso fondida with chorizo.   FYI: For those who don't eat pork, the beans are rendered down with pork.   Everything is served family style. The food is GOOD! If you're a cheese lover, the queso fondida is AMAZING! Order it!!!   I can't wait to try their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Great Tex mex place - they are working out the kinks as they just opened recently, but it seems promising!  We wanted to sit on the patio, but it wasn't available/open yet. The service was excellent once we tracked down a waiter (this is where it was apparent that they're new :) ) . . . The atmosphere is fun and light and open.  I ordered the OG margarita, and be warned - it's small but strong! We also opted for the queso fundido after reading reviews which was good, but I wish I would've gone with my gut and ordered guac. The queso was delicious but hard to eat since it's so thick.  I ordered the camaron tacos which were flavorful but a bit on the salty side. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Get there early on a Friday because this is a popular spot, with great reason! I sat at the bar and the bar staff was nothing short of attentive and amazing! The Vegetarian tacos and NoDa Hop Drop n Roll beer were a Great combination! They subbed my refried beans for beans & brown rice because the refried beans have pork in them!"}
{"text":"This was probably wasn't the worst experience I've had here but I wasn't the best, they didn't know how to make a Texas marg. The margs were crappy. Like gross. The food was over priced for such a small amount that honestly didn't even taste good. The food was bland and over cooked. I was no impressed. I was excited for a place to eat near my home, but was soon mistaken for an over priced crap taco place."}
{"text":"I checked out Superica on their opening day, and honestly expected it to be pricy with small portions. I was very wrong! The menu is more expensive than most Mexican restaurants, but it turned out to be a steal for what you get. The extras that come with meals make a $11.99 lunch special more than worth it.  You get chips and two salsas to start out with. They're free! The chips were crispy, fresh, and plentiful. The two salsas were a green tomatillo/avocado (fresh, light, tangy) and a more traditional cantina salsa (with just a little heat). You can turn up the heat to your liking with their addictive house hot sauce.  Lunch specials give you the option of two items for $11.99. Ther are enchiladas, soft and hard tacos, soup, salad, and more to choose from. I opted for a beef enchilada with a brown chili gravy and chicken mole enchilada. Both were divine - a serious step up from your run of the mill Tex Mex, and a decent size too. On top of that, you get bottomless refried beans (which are made with pork, btw) with melted cheese, and rice. If you enjoy it as much as I did, you'll end up mixing the leftover enchilada sauces with the beans and the rice, and using a few chips to scoop! There really isn't any need for the beans and rice to be bottomless if you are eating by yourself, because they are both huge sides served in separate dishes than your entree (they may be shared when eating in groups, but I was by myself).   I will certainly be putting Superica in my regular rotation for lunch. The staff were welcoming, friendly, and attentive. And the service was very fast (in and out in 30 minutes). The food is step above what you'd expect from most Tex-Mex joints, and the servings aren't chintzy - you will leave very full! And this was on opening day, which was impressive!"}
{"text":"I had been given a heads up by friends in Atlanta that I was going to love this addition to the Queen City.   Finally went on a Monday night before a NC Music Factory concert. There is a cool bar seating area when you walk in that has a cool vibe and it is pretty large. There is a huge dining room behind the bar area too. It's was busy but got a seat right away.   Went with the OG margarita which wasn't too sweet. Loved it. The chips and salsa options on the table were very good and I loved the squeeze jar of hot sauce. Couple of drops will do it. We had friends who wanted the guac so we got that and also the chorizo quest fundido. The fried chips that come with the guac are superb. Crispy but not heavy. The queso fundido was a stringy spicy bowl of goodness with the tortillas it comes with we're perfect. Of course eating your weight in chips and salsa plus apps meant I couldn't order the fajitas I saw going out constantly from the kitchen so will have to go back.   I had the tacos Al pastor which has sweet grilled pineapple and pork belly. 3 small tacos that were a perfect sized entree after all of those chips. Wife had the shrimp salad which was pretty sizeable too and she loved it. Can't wait to go back. Best Tex Mex in Charlotte no doubt. And wife lived in Austin for a time and remembers the original Chuy's."}
{"text":"Pro tip: Come during non-peak times because this place is BOMB.  I am in love with their veggie enchilada. In. Love. The tortillas melt in your mouth and the flavor profile is really top notch. Many tex-mex restaurants shine in the meat department (carnitas, steak, etc.), and it's difficult to find a truly phenomenal veggie option. Superica wins.  Their nachos were also really loaded, which I was a huge fan of. They have lots of melted cheese, green onion, and more.  We were able to be seated right away at 2pm on a Friday, but we tried another time at 6:45pm and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. So, plan accordingly, or you can try to wait until the hype dies down. I'm not convinced that it will!"}
{"text":"We are from Texas but moved to NC 2 years ago. Despite numerous attempts we have not found Tex-mex until Superica. Awesome. I feel like I am home!"}
{"text":"I had the best lunch here today.  I met a friend at noon and we were seated immediately.  It was popular but the space is large to accommodate the crowd.  We debated whether to start with guacamole or ceviche and went with ceviche. When our waitress brought the ceviche she also brought us the guac to try.  Both were really good but the ceviche was so fresh and delicious.  Just then right spice.  I had the salad with chicken for my entree.  Also, really good.  It was really fresh, just the right combination and balance of ingredients.  Our waitress brought beans and rice but I couldn't touch them after so much food.  My friend said they were delicious.  Service was also really good.  Our server was training someone which can sometimes be distracting but this was not.  I am really happy they have come to SouthEnd- a great addition."}
{"text":"I had lunch there recently andvitvwas very good.  The restaurant has s great look.  I will return soon."}
{"text":"Just GO HERE! Everything I put in my mouth was disturbingly delicious. We showed up at 830 on a Saturday night and they quoted us an hour and 45 minute wait. I was not deterred, and we went to OMB for a beer; 45 mins later our table was ready. The avocado tomatillo salsa and the smoky red salsa were delish. The classic queso was spicy, cilantro-y and velvety rich. I ordered ground beef tacos, which were everything I ever wanted in this life - crispy housemade shells, delicious picadillo beef, and all the right toppings. The BEANS. They are how refried beans should taste - and topped with blistering cheese. The RICE. Smoky, umami, perfect. My boyfriend ordered the carnitas which were actually pork belly fajitas, and they came with melted butter... with hot, fresh house-made tortillas. He died. Even the Dos Equis we had on draft tasted suspiciously delicious. It's like this place has made the perfect version of every tex mex food/detail there is. And I'm from Texas! I was skeptical y'all. But now I'm back home and dreaming of the day I can go back here! Go!"}
{"text":"Great service, food was on point, and really cool atmosphere! There's cheese on nearly everything (at least what I ordered) which is amazing. The food is not presumptuous like so many places in South End, it's true to what makes it taste great. Fun decor, beautiful plants around the restaurant, great lighting."}
{"text":"After moving from Texas I found it impossible to find good Tex Mex .... quo angels singing. This place is out of this world!!! Flavors are unreal! Do your self a favor and go now! Handmade tortillas make all difference, some of the best tacos I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this new Tex Mex restaurant but couldn't. I had the soup which was not very good at all. It tastes like I was eating a can of red enchiladas sauce, very salty, inedible. My daughter has three tacos, the worse tacos we've ever had and it's hard to mess up tacos. Plus it's was expensive. On the plus side the chip and two sauces were excellent , so it gets two stars for that."}
{"text":"A hangry girls night out...  I'll keep it short and simple.  The food here, is absolutely amazing. To start out with the chips come out hot, and the salsa is some of the best I have had.  If you like playing with your food, go for the queso fundido, and have a \"pull\" contest at your table, taste great too.  We all ordered the fajitas and were extremely pleased (split them).  The not so fun part started with the water that was clearly collected from the drain pipes.  This made our extensive wait for a drink order all the more miserable.  The whole service line of Superica was clearly in \"sloth mode\". We ordered a guacamole app with our dinner, and told our waitress to bring it out before the main entrees. 30 minutes later and the first signs of hanger started to appear - Staring down every waiter carrying food, mean mugging every table that had their food, and checking our phones every minute.  Our waitress was no where to be found, so we flagged down a manager to ask the status of our order.  He gave us \"the 5 more minutes\" line, and then we started checking our phones like maniacs again (hanger). 10 minutes later we asked the waitress to cancel our guac, and after a whole hour we finally received our fajitas, with the wrong beans.  We then had to flag down another manager to get our order of beans, and spent the whole night with no refills on our drinks.  ***Totally would have been 5 stars, if this was all about food*** - Pro tip, bring a protein bar to hold off the hangry."}
{"text":"Date night last week was at the new Tex Mex place  in Southend. Nice atmosphere.. good food!  Our order was - Chilli corn queso, crisp shrimp tacos and vegetarian fajitas! All very yummy. Even the chips and salsa served at the table also very good.  Go prepared to wait a bit.. they do not take reservations, but have a nice patio and good bar to wait it out. For dessert the Tres Le Ches looked heavenly, saved it for next visit!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite Mexican place in town! Everything we had here was amazing and they have some really unique options that you can't find anywhere else in Charlotte. The atmosphere is awesome and it is definitely a great spot to hang out with friends. The price point is a little higher than I'd like for a Mexican restaurant, but this is definitely upgraded from your basic Mexican cuisine. I highly recommend the puffy tacos! They're a bit difficult to eat but definitely worth it- chicken tinga was by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch today with friends. It was not initially my choice because of friends that went two weeks ago, received slow and poor service only to have their entire meal comped. They also specified that the price point was a little high for the food. Still, I'll give anywhere a chance. Unfortunately, my visit confirmed the poor service and the high price point. The restaurant really should have $$$. $11.99 lunch special for two items (I had enchiladas) plus \"family style\" rice and beans. While the food was good, the price point was about $2-3 too high. We went at the tail end of the lunch rush so kitchen volume was low but still didn't get the appetizer until we reminded staff twice (which was then comped). We also had to ask for the craft beer twice only to have the response be the name of a brewery and not the kind of beer so had to ask a third time (bartender and server issue especially at the end of lunch). On the whole, I can't recommend the restaurant and do not plan to return. It pains me because I love TexMex food and usually complimentary to any good restaurant (as can be seen from my other reviews). Charlotte also has some good TexMex but could alway use more. While the restaurant is new, if the service doesn't improve then I think it will struggle. 2 stars only because the taste of the food was decent."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have a group of 20 family/friends coming into town in August. I was interested in reserving a few tables at Superica to hold a dinner in August. I spoke to a hostess and a manager and both informed me that under no circumstances do they take reservations. I also inquired about renting out a portion of the restaurant, and they informed me that's not something they are \"currently doing\".   Seems to be a wildly ridiculous policy for the restaurant. I mean throw out a number at least - even if you charged me $2k to reserve 2 tables I may be interested but instead you just state you don't take reservations. This seems to be a poor and short-sighted policy for a new restaurant that's hopeful to gain recognition in the community."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We had a little surprise party of 8 and had just the best service! The queso appetizer, fontina, and bottomless rice and beans for the table was a hit! These puffy tacos were amazing, both the chicken tinga and the spicy beef.  The lomo sampler platter was amazing too, great flavors! For preggo moms ask for their agua fresca, delish!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  The salsas were unique but very good.  The queso was excellent and everything we tried for our main meals were soooooo good!! I had the Barbacoa tacos and they were delicious. Tender meat, great flavor, served at the perfect temperature. Others tried the skirt steak fajitas and cheese enchiladas and both were awesome.  They served bottomless rice and beans family style to the table which was a nice change from the traditional.   Our server was friendly and there were so many other items on the menu I would love to try.  We waited over an hour so be prepared as this place will likely stay packed for a long time.  Parking is a little tricky if you don't want to pay. Overall, great experience. Can't wait to come back. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Superica is worth the hype! I have been twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. I got the lunch special which is a great deal and there are plenty of options to make your pair of lunch special items. I went with the carnitas taco (which is more of a pork belly than shredded pork) and the enchilada verde. Both items were great, especially the carnitas! I got the carnitas taco entree for dinner. I love that you get rice and beans for the table with your order."}
{"text":"Great Tex mex, very nice and friendly staff. I had the Huevos Rancheros and a El Frio for brunch. The sauces were top notch. Mo the bartender was very nice and provided super service. It was a team effort from all staff."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!! We came in for dinner a few nights ago and it met all of my expectations!! Heard amazing things about Superica from family in Atlanta and was so excited to try!! The Light Rail was my favorite drink; our incredible waitress Anna told us about Michael Craft creating it and the story behind it which made it 10 times better!! Big nod to Michael Craft for an amazing drink and bar team!! Our fajitas and tamales were impeccable!! Great suggestions from Anna!! Will absolutely be back and bring friends!! Check this place out!! Managers, give my new friends Michael and Anna a raise!! They made our experience worthwhile!! Thanks for a great time and wonderful food, glad you've made the move to Charlotte Superica!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME! Absolutely love the decor and ambiance. We sat at the bar however i was also interested in the table seating. Everything and everyone is very inviting and warm. The bartender Mandy is AWESOME. The food was fresh. Everyone was happy to be there. Highly recommend and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Easily one of my new favorite places for tex-mex! Their staff is well trained and there is nothing on the menu that I don't like! The atmosphere is very nice and is perfect for a date night or a group of friends. They also have great lunch specials! The chips are light and crispy with the perfect amount of salt. The salsa are also delicious! (But be careful with them - the entrees can be hard to finish if you've filled up on chips)."}
{"text":"Everything you would want in a TexMex restaurant. We arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday evening and were sat within ten minutes, even though the bar was packed and the restaurant was already crowded. We had great service throughout the night.  Recommend: the steak fajitas- the steak alone was  and the chorizo con queso was flavorful, a little spicy but not overwhelming, and a nice addition to the complimentary salsa they provide. We also tried the puffy taco trio (chicken, beef, guacamole- you can choose to mix & match) on a puffy taco (bc I needed to know what a puffy taco was) and it was good, but not as great as the other dishes we tried. If you do decide to try it out, the smoky hot sauce at the table is recommended and helps liven it up. We will be going back. Great option for any size dinner party."}
{"text":"Aesthetically, a beautiful looking restaurant. The decor is great, a new western ~*vibe*~  Entrees are pretty expensive but then you'll realize they're actually for two people and come with sides. So, $25 for two to eat in this pretty place is good. This place does come up as a suggestion for \"cheap eats\" ...That's really not gonna be the case with this place, considering you're probably going to order a drink and appetizer. If you want cheap eats go to Tacos El Nevado ( good al pastor tacos, homemade tortillas,  and better, no frills queso -but, no atmosphere).  First time in, service was great and food was GREAT.  It was lunch. Queso was OK but the heritage pork belly was amazing. It came out sizzling on a fajita plate with warm, soft tortillas. The sautéed onion with the fiery grilled peppers and butter slathered in the tortilla with pork belly was just heaven. They hadn't been open for even 72 hours and it was impressive.  Second time in, for dinner we felt that our server was trying to rush us out, and the same dish came out different than the original visit. The plate wasn't hot so not the same theatrics with the ~*sizzle*~ the temp came more like warm so half way through it became cold. The tortillas they gave this visit were not like the first time, they were not fresh and were quite tough/stale.   First visit was perfect, 2nd was disappointing. Thankfully, if things aren't going so good, management is involved and cares. Worth a revisit just because of that. We all recommended this place after the first visit to everybody and we will continue to because of customer service."}
