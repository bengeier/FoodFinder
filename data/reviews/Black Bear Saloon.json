{"text":"Great place to eat and have a drink before a concert. Tater tots and sweet potato fries are awesome. My buffalo chicken salad was topped with good, spicy chicken but the salad part sucked. Highlight was Kodiak sandwich-turkey bacon Swiss with coleslaw and Russian dressing on rye. Best part was they were playing a CD of the band we were going to see at amphitheatre next door."}
{"text":"Been to Black Bear twice now. Once for drinks and the other, most recently, for apps and drinks. Great happy hour specials of half off beer and 2-1 apps. Order the fried mac & cheese and the chicken tenders. Fried mac & cheese is what you'd expect...heaven...ha! The chicken tenders were good, but a little bland. Bartender was very helpful and prompt. TV's everywhere including the booths. I'm not over in this neck of the woods often, when I am, stopping in for a beer at Black Bear is a common occurrence!"}
