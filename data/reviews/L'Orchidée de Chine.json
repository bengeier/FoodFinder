{"text":"We are from Miami Florida . This restaurant was highly recommended by a friend who had visitedMontreal and ate at this restaurant. He said the food was excellent, in fact, ate there twice during his stay in Montreal.
I felt the  food was good, not great as I had hoped. The restaurant's ambiance is pretty and very clean. The employees were efficient but not too friendly."}
{"text":"We're staying at the Omni which is close by and wanted something easy. We decided to stop in even though Im dubious of Chinese restaurants as so many of them have poor quality food. This place had some of the best Chinese food my husband and I have had in awhile and so fresh. We ordered the vegetables and the pepper chicken and we couldn't believes how flavorful they were. Most importantly, the chicken wasn't the usual gooey, slimy chicken. The staff was friendly and we spent the next four days of our trip talking about how good this restaurant was."}
{"text":"A waiter called tommy provides poor services. 
Never be there again"}
{"text":"A pure chinese experience; the deco food and service were superb. I had the hot and sour soup, it was spicy but the right amount. Then we had the chicken w almond, my mom does not like spicy,  so they made a good job w the right amount of spicy and great flavour.
I would come back on my next visit to Montreal.."}
{"text":"I am a Montreal native and l'Orchidee was a standard hit in our restaurant repertoire for many years. Tonight, both my mother and I agreed that this family favourite has sadly lost its lustre.

The food was satisfactory overall and included crispy spring rolls, bean paste, general tao, fish with bean sauce, and a moka ice ream cake (from Baskin Robbins);
however, the ambiance was sadly lacking. The waiters had a tendency to speedwalk/sprint between the tables and the kitchen, which made us feel rather rushed ourselves. Much of the clientele was badly dressed - as if cargo shorts were the designated uniform for the evening! I am not one of those people who eat to be seen (as is the case for those dining at Cavalli across the street) but maybe it's time that l'Orchidee introduced a dress code to maintain a level of class."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant during our visit to Montreal, the service was really bad as the waiter argued with us about the table we wanted to sit at. The food was not that good either, our dish was suppose to have spinach and peppers but peppers were missing. I would never eat here again because of the poor service and overall bad experience."}
{"text":"This is really just average Chinese food. I suppose if you are in downtown and don't have other choices, this might be a decent option. If the price was about half of what it is, I would give it 3 stars. But whatever the price, it's just average. You can get equally good food at your typical carry-out place. We had mu-shu pork, a wonton soup, and a dish with peas, mushrooms and tofu. All were average. Unless you just want to eat Chinese, and have lots of money to throw away, skip this place. Average dish price is right around $20. Unlike many Chinese restaurants, rice is not included with dishes; it's $2.50 extra. Fortune cookies are not included either."}
{"text":"Very good quality, delicious food. Excellent service. The duck was excellent. The dumplings great. The fried spinach, slightly sweet was a revelation. Even during F1 week they came through with the excellence I have come to expect."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch.  Accommodating staff and waiter put us at a comfortable table in main dining. We sampled the Capital City chicken and Szechuan pork; both dishes were phenomenal and very freshly put together; you could taste each individual ingredient and the combination of them along with the delicate, delicious sauces- perfect.  White and brown steamed rice as sides.  Dishes were Spiced just right.  Will eat here again, likely!, on our visit to Montreal.

Update! Take out last night including hot & sour soup, wonton soup, ravioli dumplings and beef satay stir fry; STILL five star, delicious, super hot & fresh take out - perfectly executed, such great flavors and attention to detail. They knew us immediately on second sight our waiter and the hostess giving us a friendly \"hello\"! Nice place."}
{"text":"Everything I ate was exceptional.  The quality is evident in every bite. The veggies are fresh and cooked to excellence and the service is outstanding.  Manager dealt with extremely rude customers with the outmost grace."}
{"text":"Great food, probably twice the price of most Chinese restaurants, but worth every penny! We were four and the bill came out to $184 excluding tip. I'm generally not a fan of Chinese food, as I find it very greasy and can never eat much of it. But at Orchidée, my stomach was a bottomless pit! The food is practically grease-less! And I've never had food served directly to my plate by a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. We ordered general tao tofu, shrimp with vegetables, pan-fried noodles, duck pancakes and sauteed lamb with shallots. Every dish was a delight!

The service was excellent, except  my waiter was a little too loud-talking, like a close-talking Asperger with a lisp, and accidentally spit on me at one point. Also, when we were trying to leave, my friend lost her coat-check ticket and the coat-check girl would not let her have her coat and did nothing to remedy the situation. She did not call over the manager or have my friend pay and/or sign a waiver form for losing her ticket. I got fed up and grabbed my friend's coat from the girl. Orchidée needs to put in place a lost-ticket policy for situations like these - I'm sure most people have lost a coat-check ticket at least once in their lives."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a crowd, great food and drink. 
We tried the sea bas which was devine, flaky, soft. The duck was a bit dry for my taste but came in a delicious sauce that compensated nicely.  Decent selection of wine. Be careful if ordering by the glass, it's a hit or miss - some cheap Italian Pinot noir next to very nice Argentinean cab. The service was attentive, friendly, welcoming. The restaurant is well lit, warm. Prepare for a sticker shock, when you get the bill, but I liked it anyways."}
{"text":"A 2 star review seems a bit rough, but I didn't enjoy very much about my meal here. 

To start, it took a long time to order. I am not sure about their system, but the server who took and delivered our wine order made eye contact with us several times, but we had to wait until (maybe?) a manager came over to order food.

As a family, we ordered the steamed dumplings with pork, general tao's chicken, \"rainbow \" style shrimp, and fried rice. The chicken was cooked well and had nice flavour, but everything else was really lacking in flavour. The food also came out very quickly, which always makes me slightly concerned.

The prices are not bad, and the food may suit some, but I was looking for something with more depth in flavour."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The Crevettes salutes  a la Shrimp was cooked to perfection with a light sauce. And 48 sliced chicken with setzchwan pepper and crispy spinach was amazing."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. I love Asian food, but I find it much harder to get good Chinese compared to other Asian such as Thai. This place is Szechuan, and if you like that, you owe it to yourself to try it out.

I usually get the same thing here - General Tao chicken, lemon chicken, spicy shrimp, hot & sour soup and spring rolls. Their general Tao and spring rolls are the best I've had in Montreal. Best of all, they are consistent - the food is excellent every time.

As for ambiance and service, they're average. But the food is so good it doesn't matter!"}
{"text":"Spent Christmas/NYE break on an eating/walking vacation in Montreal. Had been to LODC on business before, and like the colleague who revealed it to me, I wanted to show it to my family.

Even though we weren't hungry, we were close, so we stopped for the crispy spinach that surrounds one of their chicken dishes. Sweet, crispy/crunchy, fragile, delicious. Ordered two chicken dishes before learning they do the spinach on the side...so ordered one of those, too.

Appetizer ribs are distinctly smoky and excellent. 

I suggest Cavalli's across the street for nightlife (and the world's best bread pudding) after."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance and food. Our group had delicious smokey, spicey spare ribs as an appetizer and I had a lovely, chicken and vegetable dish.  The service was a bit slow but the owner explained that they were short a server or two. I'm always impressed when an owner is in an establishment and sharing the load.  If we ever return to Montreal, this will be on my list again."}
{"text":"Les plats sont bien présentés, l'endroit est assez plaisant même si le décor est un peu banal, surtout à l'étage.  J'ai trouvé par contre que leur cuisine manquait d'intégrité, le \"Porc à la Setzchouannaise\"  par exemple:  rien à voir avec le \"Sichuan Gong Bao\".  Le poulet à la sauce à l'orange est beaucoup trop sucré...  j'ai l'impression que les sauces sont adaptées aux goûts occidentaux.  Le coût du repas, ma foi, au Chinatown on aurait payé la moitié du prix pour des plats chinois plus authentiques et mieux cuisinés.  Donc, pas pour moi...."}
{"text":"I was surprised that they did not have the decency to put up a sign to inform people  of the opening hours.   When I asked I was told that that is how the boss wants it.   I thought that was a rude and disrespectful.   

 The lobster did not taste like lobster I do not know what it was, I will never have lobster if it is not in its shell ever again.  I am really wary of what it really was.  the chow mien noodles were like spaghetti it actually had two slices of regular mushrooms and bokchoi that was  cut in half and two broccoli, really????. and tons of MSG on all three dishes.  the spring roll had hardly anything inside.  

The food was below average.  I will never ever go there again even if I am starving"}
{"text":"A must stop each year we visit Montreal for the Formula 1! The food is multilayered and always has a great twist that makes it memorable. We had wanton soup, peanut butter ravioli (delicious), five spice smoke spare ribs (possibly the best I've ever had), generals chicken and Szechuan style beef.  

I cannot say enough about how much I love this place"}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout meal with since I was staying in a nearby hotel. One of the owners helped us pick the dishes that fit our taste best and boy was it spot on! The eggplant was super yummy and flavourful! Looks like a very classy restaurant inside, will make time to sit down next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant foods are for foreigner taste, not an authentic Chinese food! Waiter only serving food, didn't feel welcome at all! Expensive for food court meals!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for years (around 30 according to the owner) and it has been a family favourite for a long time.  It's the kind of place you come to when you want an upscale Chinese experience.  The ambiance is that of a high end restaurant with cloth napkins and white table cloths and prices to reflect that.  There is even a coat check which is great in winter when you don't want to have to deal with your big coat.

In any Chinese restaurant I almost always start with a spring roll and hot and sour soup. I love their hot and sour soup.  It's actually got a bit of kick to it and it's packed with vegetables and tofu making it very hearty.  The spring roll is always crisp and never too greasy but the filling can be a little on the bland side.

Here you order multiple dishes and share them with your dining companions.  Usually if you're a small group your best bet is to order one dish per person because then there will be enough food so that everyone feels full when all is said and done.  With the exception of a handful of dishes most of them are a good bet.  

On my most recent visit we had General Tao chicken, crispy beef in a pancake, crispy duck seasoned with five flavoured salt and vegetable fried rice.  The duck was tough and dry and wasn't my favourite but the other dishes more than made up for it.  The crispy beef in a pancake is well seasoned and the frying is done right just like it is for the General Tao chicken.  I also liked the seasoning they used for it.  The vegetable fried rice was just what you would expect for a solid one, loaded with vegetables and nice and salty.

Service is generally on the ball and it is usually speedy and attentive.  Despite its age the restaurant has done an excellent job at maintaining its consistency over the years.  While I have had one or two off visits the rest have always been up to expectations.  You can be sure that I will keep coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese Cuisine. The ambience was lively yet cozy and quiet. The service was friendly and quick. The food was amazing and the presentation made it even better. The prices are fine; for the experience, it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"1ere impression,  tout le monde est bien habillé.  Lors de notre visite, la moyenne d'âge des clients étaient d'au moins 60 ans. Nous étions les plus jeunes de loin. Mais cela ne m'a pas découragé puisque souvent les personnes plus âgée connaissent les meilleurs spot. L'ambiance est tout de même décontracté et pas trop bruyante. Étant sur plusieurs étages,  cela aide. 

le menu offre plusieurs choix incluant des choix sans gluten. 

J'ai essayé le général tao et la soupe hot  and sour . La soupe n'était pas pour moi,  Mais c'était la 1ere fois j'essayais une tel soupe.  Ma compagne la vraiment aimé par contre. 

le général tao était vraiment bon. de grosse boulette de poulet avec un peu de panure,  une sauce riche et épaisse,  quelques légumes et du riz sur demande. 

Ma compagne à pris les nouilles Shangai avec crevette.  elle a bien aimé mais elle l'a trouvé épicé. 

La formule est 1 facture pour la table,  Donc préparer cela avant d'y aller. Ils amènent chaque plat dans une assiette différente pour permettre le partage et sert chaque personne une fois. 

le service est rapide et efficace.  Je n'ai pas manqué d'eau une seul fois de la soirée et mon étage est plein. 

honnêttement je recommande et c'est certain que j'y retourne soit pour un général tao ou pour autre chose de nouveau à essayé."}
