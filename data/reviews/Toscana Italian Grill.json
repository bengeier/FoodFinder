{"text":"We went to Toscana on Sunday night for supper. Based on the website and the menu, I expected something a bit more classy. 

The look of the restaurant is half restaurant, half sports bar, with big screen tv's over the bar and in the corner of the dining room. The coat racks all had packing tape holding them together, which would be such as easy thing for them to fix. The restaurant was clean, but it's casual atmosphere does not mesh with their menu pricing. Even the bathroom had a Cellphone company ad on the wall, seeming much more like a pub than a nice restaurant. It feels like they are cutting corners in all areas - even having some tablecloths to cover the cheap pub-style tables would be a step in the right direction.

Service was prompt. The food... meh. We started with a few appetizers, which all tasted fine, just a bit bland. The olives were pretty good, but the bruchetta and the asiago dip could have been from any grocery store deli. Our Caesar salad had wilted lettuce that was browning on the edges. The salad itself was unremarkable. For our main, we shared a pizza. Again, just ok. The dough was tough and chewy. Mismatched plates, but not in a warm, cosy family way, just... mis-matched. 

Overall, the pricing of $75 for two people (having a shared entree) did not match the bland quality of the food, nor the atmosphere. Quite disapointing, and I will certainly not go back. The folks at the table nearest us had sent back their dish, so I felt like our experience was not unusual.

Calgary has no shortage of Italian restaurants, but this one misses the mark on food, ambiance and overall experience."}
{"text":"Quite bland food overall. I had the veal stuffed pasta special. It was not bad, but just plain tasting. I like that they give you warm bread and a bottle of cold water to start. I also tasted the seafood pasta. Simply tasted like tomato sauce.  They have a huge bar, faux fireplace, lots of clean renovations after taking over from the nasty  BBQ place that used to be there. If you don't know what to eat and are on McLeod Tr S, you could give it a shot."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood risotto and calamari which was delicious and was prepared in a timely manner. Clearly, the kitchen staff is doing their part wonderfully. However, the worst part of the experience was the service. Just after sitting down, My husband and I asked to get moved to a booth to which the server responded in a disgruntled manner that she would have to clean it. She did not offer to refill our drinks or glasses of water or offer dessert. In our bill, she also charged regular price for a drink that was on daily special. Will not be coming back and would not recommend this restaurant solely based on customer service."}
{"text":"Went to eat here over the weekend as my friends and I were craving good pasta. They were somewhat busy so that was a good sign.
We ordered a couple salads, the \"catch of the day\" and some other pastas. They started out with a plate of bread. I mean, I know I shouldn't complain about complimentary food, but really, it would have been better without. It was extremely dry and try tried to hide that fact by drizzling oil on it before it got to the table. The salad wasn't much better - red lettuce.. Gross. And our entrees were tiny! I'm sure I could have made any of those dishes at home. The \"catch of the day\" was an ahi tuna which they claimed would come out medium rare, but it was well done... Like tuna out of a can.
I usually don't order dessert, but I was still hungry so I decided to try out the creme caramel. My friend also got the tiramisu. Creme caramel should melt in your mouth.. This stuff was like hard tofu. And tiramisu was a disappointment as well.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here based on some advertising we had seen, and once we were there, we checked the reviews.  We should have done that first. 

My fiancee had written a review on here and it was taken down.  So now I will write a short one.  

Why was it taken down?  Because we had such a terrible time and I'm willing to bet they didn't want our bad publicity.  

New Years Eve, 5 pm the restaurant was empty.  Our server was atrocious - taking way to long to come over, hovering at our table, not coming back after we ordered our food.  The manager seemed to be on a power trip and the staff were arguing with him.    My food was terrible, the most bland boring chicken parmigiana I've ever had.  My fianc√©e's dish was an excellent lasagne - until he found shards of broken glass in his salad.  * They tried to say it was a chunk of salt  * 
WHAT ???  Salt in a salad... FFS. 

 There was no apology given, and we were basically shoved out the door.  
 Way to run a business, buddy. 


I won't ever come back.  And I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I work close by and had lunch here on Friday. The server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and daily specials. We had Bruschetta to start and it was fresh and tasty. My guest and I shared the Beet Salad: roasted purple & gold beets, tomatoes, arugula & feta - if you like beets you must try this dish! My friend had the Penne Toscana - the sauce was good but the pasta was chewy. I had the catch of the day: pan seared Arctic Char with gnocchi and a pureed veggie sauce - outstanding! While both the service and food were very good, I took one star off because the food took so long to arrive, and another star off because $80 for lunch for two (no alcohol) is a bit steep in my estimation."}
{"text":"Missed it by thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat much!

It is a nice enough setting, they serve Peroni and the waiter was ok.

Beyond that, it should be closed.  Toscana bills itself as an Italian Grill.  Really?  I have been to Italy, and quite a number of Italian restaurants.  Toscana resembles none of that.  It would have to be much better to compete with Olive Garden.

The bruschetta looked like it was bought at Safeway or Co-op and served on toast.   I ordered a veal parmigan with pasta, a classic Italian dish.   The plate appeared and was covered in red water.   The sauce was bland, as many others have mentioned, and the soggy veal was frozen and heated to room temperature.

Who is in charge?  Have they ever had an Italian meal?  Seriously, do not go here.

The Redwater grill has better pasta at about the same price.  Of course if you want amazing pasta go to Abruzzo or Da Guido.  

I suggest that Toscana change their name from Italian Grill to Toscana Hospital Cafeteria.   It would at least be honest.

Get it together guys."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for their \"cheap meal\" days and was tricked. When you got to Chiantis on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday for their cheap pasta deal, they don't hide anything. It is cheap and a ton of options. Toscana only allows you to pick a lunch sized pasta with basically only sauce. My wife ordered a cream sauce pasta and it was bone dry. I ordered the \"cheap\" pizza but they really get you when each topping is an additional cost. I'm sure the main menu is fine but don't expect anything special during their \"specials\""}
{"text":"Great service but disappointed with the meal. Standard run of the mill food nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch with my brother and his girlfriend on their suggestion. They live in the neighbourhood and they've been making an effort to check out more local places around their house, which I love. I looked up the menu for this place online and it looked decent, plus Italian food is my favourite. Seemed like a match made in noodle heaven.

But...it didn't really turn out that way. There are some really good things about this place. The space is nice, classy but not too classy. I liked the big window at the front to let in natural sunlight - made the whole place a lot brighter and happier. Our waiter was quite nice. Our appetizer, bruschetta, came out very quickly after we ordered.

And here's something to say about attention to detail. The four of us ordered our meals, and then right away my bro's gf had to run out quickly to let in the furniture delivery guys. The three of us chatted and our meals came out together, but the kitchen put a hold on her meal she it would still be hot when she came back to eat it. Nice work.

But seriously, the food was lacking. My pasta was really bland. I had to load it up with cheese, and even then, a serious meh. I tried a bite of my husband's pasta and it was definitely better than my meal, but neither of us were blown away by that, either. And usually, mediocre food plus good service would pull three stars in my book. I mean, nothing was terrible about this place. But $19 for that average-sized bowl of below-average pasta? That just turned the whole thing into a major bummer.

I don't think I'll come back. The best part of the experience was the company I was with. We'll meet up somewhere else next time I'm in Calgary. You can't go wrong with beer, right?"}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday night. Service was great and fast. The food was flavorful and abundant. I found it to be a little on the pricey side but it was an ample portion. I would definitely got back in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for date night and were quite disappointed. The pasta sauce and meat tasted like it came out of a can, quite bland and nothing special. I could have made the same thing much better at home for half the price. Great service, but we def wont be back."}
{"text":"Three of us ordered pizza, one Capricciosa and 2 truffle.  The crust is authentic topped with quality ingredients like real prosciutto, but unfortunately the crust was too thick.  Since the truffle pizza is without sauce it was too doughy.  There wasn't enough truffle oil on the pizza to offer it flavor. This is something that's easy to improve but kitchen staff don't get it."}
{"text":"Had the caprese tomato salad, huge mealy tomato slices with a feta dry mozzarella circle 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the tomato

Opted for the Italian sausage, coarse ground, spiced but not spicy as in hot

Service was good, everyone new and eager

3 stars is not for the food, it was service and the fact I never tried the pasta, will give them one more try one day"}
{"text":"Everything that I had here was amazing and very well and reasonably priced! 
I ordered a greek salad but I don't like olives so I asked for them to take them out and they did which shows how fresh the greek salad is because it is not remade and the dressing on it is very delicious. Then we goethe spaghetti or pasta primavera which is very simple but it came with tomato sauce on it and basil. As well, they bring fresh parmesan cheese to the table to go on the pasta. 
My family ordered a cheese pizza for my niece and it was so cheesy and fresh that it was wonderful! 
The best part and this was a surprise- I checked in on YELP and when you buy one entree at Toscana at regular price- you get a free dessert! I got  the Nutelle and Banana Crepes and they were so delicious and chocolatey!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch date, the truffle pizza was incredible and with a side salad and glass of red to complement it was perfect. The service was good but it would been five stars of my server knew his menu. I'm sure that will improve with time."}
{"text":"I reviewed the restaurant and wasn't too sure about going here. We arranged for a lacrosse team with 20 people to go. The place was amazing and the owner was equally great. Everyone said the food was great. 

Top notch service, great food and accommodating owners. 

Go to this place. It's big enough that the people at the front weren't bothered by the group at the back. 

Well done owner!"}
{"text":"On top of being terrible- i thought i was eating speghetti with tomatoe siup on it - the host argued with me that his customers loved the food. Obviosly not by the reviews"}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout from here and it is delicious. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it is a bit pricey. I will continue to order though :)"}
{"text":"I loved the pizza, very tasty. The wife and I wanted to try something different as far as a pizza place is concerned. When I called for delivery I was told their drivers were unavailable that evening, so unfortunately I had to go pick it up."}
