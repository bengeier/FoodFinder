{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've been to! The menu had so many options, above & beyond your typical breakfast choices. Portions were HUGE and everything was delicious & so fresh! Will definitely be back & highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Chicago roots, Greek heritage hospitality, flat out get how to cater to guest's orders. I'm fussy about eggs. They made them right, with a smile and no attitude. Highly recommend you breakfast here."}
{"text":"Maybe this was just an isolated incident, but for my wife to say she absolutely hated a breakfast experience is something that I've probably never heard from her mouth. The server was completely absent the entire meal - no check-in, no coffee refill, nothing. The food was bland. One of the poached eggs on the benedict was cooked through, the other barely runny. Didn't matter too much though since the meal was only luke-warm by the time it made it to the table anyway.  The owner came over and asked how things were and my wife said \"disappointing,\" then she left and never came back. A bit later a manager came back to say it was our fault for not complaining while we were eating. Would have been an option had the server ever stopped by.   Never. Again."}
{"text":"The menu and food was outstanding but the noise level is so loud a large group doesn't work too well; you can only hear the person on either side of you.  Something on the walls to deaden the sound might be in order."}
{"text":"Food is flavorful. Service is prompt. I don't recommend for a breakfast meeting spot. Omelette are yummy"}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. It's our favorite breakfast spot. They have a great menu and the portions are huge you can actually share.  The freshly squeezed orange juice is the best in town. It gets busy on weekends for breakfast but getting seats at the bar is a bit quicker."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's bright, sunny, and modern inside with an excellent menu. The service is lovely and coffee to die for. They even have stevia on the tables. The manager is warm and friendly and remembered I'd ordered their lovely gluten-free protein pancakes on my previous visit, and today just brought me some for dessert, his treat. These nice touches will keep me coming back. Happy to see this place and can't wait for the patio to open."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast on a Sunday. We were seated at a tiny table crammed in like sardines. The noise was deafening from the people  and music playing. Got our orders, the food was just ok. They had the bay at the bar open and there were flies everywhere. It was September, so it was also extremely hot inside also.  Really see no reason to return."}
{"text":"We went in to Eggstasy after seeing an add on a local Scottsdale paper and we're interested in trying the place out. We went in Tuesday morning around 11 am and the place was quiet. The entrance has no markings on it so it's kind of hard to tell where the actual entrance is. After we went in, we were greeted by a hostess who took us to a table near the end of the restaurant. Our waitress was Selena. She was awesome! She was the best waitress we've had in years. She was always on top of everything! She patiently took our order (since it was our first time, we had some questions about the menu). She answered all of them. We opted for the Cheeseburger, Dali's omelette, and the regular French toast. The potions were HUGE! The burger was pretty good. The only thing bad to say about it was that it was a bit overcooked. Having asked for a medium, it was well done. He omelette was delicious and the French toast was great as well. Overall, we had a great experience and will absolutely return in the future! Hopefully we get Selena as our server again"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this, but our experience was less than the \"surreal dining experience\" promoted on the menu. Our party of two waited 25 minutes to be seated at the bar alongside people who arrived after but we're seated before us. We were greeted by three of the 8 or so people working behind the bar, none of whom offered us any beverages until I had asked three times for water and coffee. (Our server actually argued with me about my request stating that being seated is not a guarantee of fast service.) The beef brisket biscuits and gravy we ordered was actually sausage gravy, and the truffle French toast with asparagus and fried egg was good but not great. The highlight was the coffee, but not even that was worth the wait and poor service."}
{"text":"Eggstasy is an okay restaurant. The 1-2 times I've been there have been okay. The service is mediocre and so is the food. There portions are pretty big, and they aren't amazing. The one thing I will say, is that there outside seating is pretty nice. Couches and the inside space is humongous. Its located in a convenient place!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was bright and relaxing. The mimosas are made from fresh squeezed oranges. If you like pumpkin then go for the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. Yum!  The only reason I didn't rate this place higher was because of the cleanliness (or lack thereof).  On a not-so-busy Tuesday morning, we were sat next to an unbussed table that remained that way through our entire meal. The outdoor couches needed a good wipe and the fixtures were void of any light bulbs giving the space a very unfinished look. The restrooms were also in need of attention and they always say the cleanliness of a restaurant's restroom is an indication of the cleanliness of its kitchen. Just a listing sprucing up would make the experience much more pleasing."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on around me.com the menu is great, the prices is great, and the food is great. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place around!! The place is cool!  Awesome lively atmosphere!  I love the thick smoked bacon and fruit kabob's.  Cool decor!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Arizona I dined at quite a few really good restaurants but this one stood above the rest.  Usually something has to give - either quality, service, or price.  I was impressed on all accounts. Everything exceeded expectation.  The menu was varied and creative, food was fantastic and served in generous quantity. Service from the hostesses and our server Tara was prompt, friendly, and attentive with genuine friendliness that one doesn't find everywhere.  I have never before been personally thanked for my business by the owner (manager?) and sent away with a fresh to-go coffee but it happened here.  Five stars without hesitation for Eggstacy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go. When I come up to Scottsdale to visit my family this is where we go for breakfast. The Staff is awesome, food is very good and always comes out on time and is nice and hot. We use to go to Butterfields down the street but this place is way better. I got the hash and eggs last time and it is spot on. 5  from me!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, service impeccable! Everyone should eat here! Top notch class act, home run ouitta the ball park, breakfast & lunch at its finest."}
{"text":"Really neat space, but SO loud.  Could barely hear the person sitting three feet away from me.    The service was super slow and there were obvious kitchen / server / management issues.    We waited nearly 50 minutes for our food.  We weren't offered a discount, a drink or anything while we painfully waited while the staff was imploding.    At least the food was really tasty when it finally arrived!!  Perhaps I will give them another shot, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place by chance on a Sunday morning. Long wait is usually a good sign. The food was excellent. Very creative spins on the usual stuff. I had the stuffed brioche French toast and my wife had the salmon omelet. Both were excellent and had so many side dishes we have enough leftovers for dinner!"}
{"text":"We've been there twice and everything has been great! Love the pumpkin pancakes and their crepes. The servers were always checking if we needed anything. The place is noisy and wait time is kind of long on the weekends. Great place, great food, good service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come to! The food is great, people are fantastic, the atmosphere is fun, and there just isn't enough good things to say! I've introduced this place to my friends, family, and work! They all tell me thank you for the recommendation and now they keep going back as well. You will not find a more unique selection for your taste buds or fresher ingredients. The coffee there is so bold and the juices are so good! One if my favorite dishes is their crepes with mangos with toasted coconut on top!"}
{"text":"If I closed my eyes and pointed to anything on the menu I bet it would be as amazing as any of the other items I've already tried and thought were fantastic. Crepes- delicious! Mimosas- awesome! Not a huge pancake fan, but even their pancakes are EGGSTASY- AND super close to my house. BOOM! So good :)"}
{"text":"This place needs to hire people who actually have serving experience, instead of confused hipsters who match the decor. The servers, the food runners, the bussers, it's like no one has EVER worked in a restaurant before. They all run into each other, there's NO \"behind you,\" \"on your left\", there's no helping each other out, they have NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING. They disappear for long stretches of time, they lie to their tables, they are just completely incompetent.   Never, ever going back to Eggstacy. The food is amazing but the service is ATROCIOUS. Two weekends in a row, our server (a different person each time) disappeared for 15-20 minutes. Last time he disappeared right before our food came out, and I had to wait 10 minutes for him to reappear so I could send back my omelette to get it with no mushrooms...the way I ordered it to begin with. Ok, no biggie, stuff happens, but the food is so, SO good I'm definitely going to give it another shot.  The second time, she just didn't even put our order in before she disappeared. First she didn't put our appetizer order in, then she took our main order and didn't put THAT in either! So we sit there, for OVER 40 MINUTES, as tables get sat around us, order from their server (not ours, we didn't see her at all for 20 minutes), GET THEIR FOOD, and eat all of it, and STILL WE DON'T HAVE OUR APPETIZER.   Then she comes rushing over to \"double check\" what we ordered and she flat out lied about forgetting to put our order in, and that's what pisses me off the most. People screw up, fine, but OWN IT and APOLOGIZE. We're not stupid. She finally admitted it, and of course my eggs were undercooked because the kitchen had to rush the entire order. UGH.   Never, ever again. Two visits, two instances of terrible service. Done."}
{"text":"First time visit , food average and cleanliness average. Service is friendly but I came to eat good food. I had the steak and eggs Benedict , overall was below average, steak was little tuff and eggs runny for Benedict. With that said overpriced, tired looking breakfast place. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I'm torn. Food is great, but inconsistent. I have had crepes all sizes. I've had egg omelets not cooked all the way, then had a fantastic one. We've gone back multiple times but I am done. Service is also inconsistent.  Every busy shift, we never know when we'll get drinks.. and although our servers are very nice, they seem overwhelmed with tables and it's just not worth the wait. Food is lovely, just wish everything else would fall into line. Best of luck."}
{"text":"Great new breakfast spot. The menu is very elaborate and the only bad thing about this place is everything looks delicious. Lives up to how good the food looks. Great espresso machine as well. Very happy and will definitely be a frequent visitor to this place! My wife and I give it two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Great food, horrible wait time and ambiance. Indoors, the layout and poor airflow along with the open kitchen means: hot in the summer, cold in the winter. Noise level and proximity of tables is deafening. But the food taste and selection is great, order to go."}
{"text":"Coffee was great, food was great as well. I had the asparagus, ham and gruyere Crepes and my husband had a ham and cheese omelette (which came with a huge side of pancakes).  Very tasty and plentiful, enough food for four! Owner very engaged with customers and interested in a great experience.  We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"They need a bit of work on their service, and the food is pretty good.  Lots of options, which is always great! The patio is very nice, but it might need a bit more shade options. The portions are huge, so you do get a lot for your money!"}
{"text":"The food selection was vast and creative. Had a hard time making up my mind on what to order! Delicious food and the best orange juice I've ever had. The wait staff could have been a little better, but we did go on Father's Day so they could have been overwhelmed by the crowd. The prices were very reasonable for the huge portion sizes. Recommend the macadamia nut banana pancakes and the chicks in a blanket. The chicken sausage was flavorful with the perfect amount of spice!"}
{"text":"Great menu with some great breakfast dishes. At times the service is lacking in details, but overall highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just ok food, not on my short list. The place is new, bright, and clean with good service - unfortunately the food is disappointing. We had brunch as a party of four: two of us ordered the Greek Huevos Rancheros and two ordered the Dali Skillet. At the end of the meal everyone's opinion was that it was average. I found my Greek Huevos Rancheros to be a disappointing as the eggs were not cooked very well, or as ordered, and the rest of the dish was one dimensional in flavor - all jalapeño (which I love!) but it was overpowering. A more complex flavor profile would have been appreciated.  The coffee was good though and perhaps another dish would be better. I would give it another shot but it's not on my short list to revisit."}
{"text":"This is probably only the 4th review I have ever written on yelp. I found this place because of yelp. Every time I have gone here it has been amazing. Great food and it's always fresh! The coffee is the main reason I go and the portions are out of control! A huge omelette with two pancakes and hash browns! Can't beat it ! The omelette a are great the skillets are great and again the coffee coffee coffee! Check this place out! Good vibes all around."}
{"text":"What a fun atmosphere! My boyfriend and I tried the banana macadamia pancakes and the dali's omelette. Both were very yummy and both were big portions. The customer service very good! We will be returning :)!"}
{"text":"This place is completely fabulous. The soup was excellent, the panini's- perfection. Kids menu is great too, with a s'more's pancake to die for.  My kiddos will no longer eat regular pancakes, tyvm.  The waiters were so nice and on top of things, even with all the Scottsdale snobs, and the owner/manager was there, making sure everyone was happy. Highly recommend, and will return as many times as possible!"}
{"text":"We love it; kid friendly and great food :)  SO we are regulars - the best!"}
{"text":"First time visting the location. I was impressed with the offering of the menu.  I ordered the two eggs with canadian bacon, hash browns and a side of pancakes. With coffee the meal was great and for $12 it was so much more than I could handle.  They are still in the start up phase with the patio and bar opening soon.  I certainly will head back to try another of there offerings.  I got a tast of the Banana crepes delicious.   Can't miss. Need more places that we can explore for great breakfast."}
{"text":"We come to Arizona every March for vacation. We had a very good brunch here last year. This year I noticed from other reviews that they offered truffle egg toast, which I can get at Davanti Enoteca in Chicago and it's delicious. So I ordered it here today--and it came on cinnamon brioche. Not plain brioche . I don't know about you, but I don't find cinnamon to complement the taste of truffle oil and fontina cheese and asparagus. The waiter never came by to ask how things were so I picked off the egg and cheese and ate that. My husband had the breakfast burrito and it was okay, not great. I guess we won't be returning next year."}
{"text":"Server was very friendly but slow.  The menu is quite eccentric for breakfast but everything we tried lacked flavor. The eggs were over done, the hashbrowns were like warm. Overall just underwhelming. I was very excited when I read the other reviews. Oh well :("}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I have been going here since it opened. They just catered my daughters Breakfast at Tiffany theme 1st birthday.  We always love the variety and somehow all of if is always amazing... Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast here last weekend that I can't stop thinking about... Savory pop tart with fried chicken, it was magical!  The owner recommended it to me & I'm so thankful I listened, not that I've ever had a meal here I didn't like!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have tried this place.  This time is no better than the first.  Service is terrible.  I love breakfast out but I don't like to feel like an inconvenience. Food is a little slow to the table,  not sure if it's due to the kitchen or the server. I like more of a traditional breakfast so I got the ham and cheese omelette. It's hard to screw that up although it was a little bit crunchy. Bottom line if you're OK with regular food it's not terrible but the service keeps me from returning."}
{"text":"For starters... The bacon is fabulous. I had the avacado Benedict, also fabulous. Great tea selection.... I do take away a star because the music was so loud. Which can be ok, but nothing ruins a fabulous relaxing breakfast like having to scream over a bad counting crows song"}
{"text":"Been here 9-10 times.  Shout out to Michele who got my order perfectly.    Upbeat atmosphere, a little sparse.  It is noisy, but hip vibe.  Everything from your basic eggs, toast, bacon to exciting omelette combinations like swiss chard/swiss to fig jam & goat cheese. I always order the Skinny Bitch which is a whole wheat tortilla, tomatoes, spinach, lowfat cheese & egg whites with a tasty fruit kebab.  My son ordered the apple dutch French toast.  Hoping someone with me will try the nutella/banana pancakes sometime.  Flavored iced teas & water carafes filled with cucumbers.  Great service on refills."}
{"text":"Uggh! If you love mimosas, DON'T go here! It's 7$ for a shot glass worth of champagne. I even got the orange juice separate and the champagne was literally in a tall skinny glass and was the size of a shot. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"When asked what ingredients were in the hollandaise sauce the waitress brought me the box of Knorr mix so I could read it for myself! (So, the sauce is not from scratch.) When asked if the grapefruit juice was fresh squeezed she replied that they purchased it \"pressed\". (So, the juice comes from somewhere else.)  When asked for fresh coffee she brought more that was just as bad--which was not drunk--then charged me for it!  (Yes, she did adjust the bill when I asked.) The scrambled eggs were dry.  The avocado was brown.  The bacon was delicious."}
{"text":"came here for the first time this morning for a birthday brunch. the chocolate milk was pretty good and the service was fast. for a group of 10 girls we got our food out within 20 minutes for everyone. I ordered the toasted coconut papaya crepes and a side of crispy prosciutto. the prosciutto was really good and was the highlight of the meal. the coconut crepes were nasty. the actual crepe tasted gross and there was no coconut flavor. my friend had the strawberry Nutella crepes and she said hers were like dog food. overall I wouldn't come back. I can get a better meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! This place is huge, and has a great open air patio- with heated seats! Somewhat pricy for breakfast, but the food didn't disappoint & tasted incredibly fresh. Would definitely recommend checking out... we'll all be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Although we got seated right away which was rare for a Sunday, service wasn't great. I immediately recognized it was quite warm when we walked in.  Disappointing when it's July in AZ and people are looking to escape the heat.   Ordered the Brioche French Toast, came out way undercooked. Very rarely do I send items back, but this was not edible. Not to mention the fear of consuming raw eggs when you're pregnant isn't very comforting...  They offered to remake it and I kindly declined but they did it anyway and it arrived when my family was done with their meals.   Having been in the food and bev business for years, it's common courtesy to remove an item from a customers check when they are clearly unhappy with it. Not the case here. Guess they need the money more than returning customers."}
{"text":"Just had brunch...nothing eggstraordinary (pun intended)!  Hot chocolate was cold, service was a tad slow and Dali's omelette was boring!  If you are wanting brunch, there are many better places in this part of the world."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot and I've been to them all R&R, Breakfast Club, Over Easy, Daily Dos, etc.  Wait staff is knowledgable and makes sure to recommend new things.  Always tons of parking.  Great value for food, you buy a steak and eggs and you have an option for Red Velvet French Toast as a side... I mean come on!  Doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Always willing to try something new, but we should have paid closer attention to other reviews. let's start from the beginning  Upon arrival not only was the place blasting house style remixed music (on a Sunday morning) but we could hear the full roar of the place from the parking lot. yes, other yelpers said it was noisy, didn't think it would be that bad. we opted to put our name down for a patio table. not only did the hostess have to ask three times how many people we were but she kept asking if we were other parties she had talked to that were already waiting, even after I told her no we just arrived.  she also kept turning around to yell at other hosts about various tables and things. it took almost ten minutes just to get our name down. we were told about 15 minutes, great no problem.  thank god our party was late because it actually took 25 minutes to seat us, at which time we were told they were out of high chairs but they would bring a booster seat over. sounds good right, no... they sat us on a couch! how do you put a booster seat on a couch?! we asked to be moved to a table with chairs and were told they were reserved for other parties. thankfully one of the hosts remembered and brought us a high chair a while later when one became available.   Avoid the couches on the patio if the sun is out, they are plastic and get very hot very quickly.  I'll keep the rest short, server did not bring enough water for the table and offered no refills, splashed mimosa on my husband and didn't bother to help clean up or apologize, and we only saw him 3 times the entire meal. Crispy pancakes were burnt, salmon eggs Benny ; salty. Skinny bit*h burrito was bland. chocolate covered bacon had too much chocolate. side of bacon was not \"thick cut\" and was similar to Denny's bacon. all around just disappointing.   won't be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Eggstasy is a local breakfast concept with a chic and refreshing interior, coupled by a surprisingly unique menu. The staff are young and friendly, serving an increasingly larger clientele. On the weekends, it's not uncommon to find Eggstasy customers queuing out the door, hoping to get a table inside.   This area desperately needed a local breakfast place worth going to. Now we don't have to commute south to Arcadia to find palatable breakfast cuisine    Make sure to try the Dali Skillet if you like spicy chorizo and eggs!"}
{"text":"I'd like to try this place again. They have a wide and unique menu, a good atmosphere, and the service was swell. I got the prosciutto chocolate chip waffles. Essentially some of my three favorite things put together. It was okay. I expected it to primarily be mixed in as bits. Everything (chocolate chips included) was literally just thrown on top which I found a bit strange. My friend got a crepe which I tried and it was quite good. While my own meal could've been better, I still think the place is worth going to and would like to try it again."}
{"text":"Had Friday Brunch here today. First time. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. Seated immediately, served ASAP. Restaurant was busy, noise level kinda high...but that's due to the open kitchen, open seating and...all of my fellow diners having a blast noshing, talking, just enjoying the excellent food/service!! Our waitress was the bomb, actually all of the servers, as well as the sweet manager were my ideal of well-trained, accommodating, friendly yet unobtrusive perfect servers!!   Oh and the food? Nom-nom deliciousness!  I had the Berry Blintz. Omygoddess, had a li'l foodgasm with the first bite. The crepes were the just right combo of tender/crispy, but, the Mascarpone filling was the BEST I've ever tasted. Going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Positively, one could say the menu is extensive (and somewhat adventurous) and much appreciated in the area. Truthfully, it means the kitchen is over-extended. Over an hour to get our food on a Sunday morning, and it's not worth the wait. While the omelet filling was tasty, the eggs themselves tasted powdered.  French toast was dry. I think the name refers more to the tripping cooks (who probably used a toaster for the French toast) than how you'll feel.   The patio is nice. And the decor is nice in a CB2 kind of way."}
{"text":"I Love breakfast here! I wish I lived closer......Every time I'm in town, we go here for simply the Best breakfast around! Awesome Pancakes, Amazing Eggs and Bacon too, you really can't go wrong. Easy location in Scottsdale, yummy food, great drinks! My go to breakfast location! My favorites are protein pancakes, or the Nutella crepes and lastly they have great coffee to seal the deal! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  Thanks Yelpers for giving us the idea.  The food was great, the service was awesome, and I loved the design overall."}
{"text":"Brightly colored walls and upbeat music, perfect way to start your day! Eggstasy was EGG-cellent!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I have given this restaurant so many chances because we really need a good breakfast brunch place in the area but this place is horrible. First our waitress told us how slammed she was while every other waiter was standing at the service window. Then the gusset is walking around chewing as he cleans up. The bosses mom runs the place and you can tell the servers have had no training. The waiter came up with our water glasses with her dirty finger nails and hands touching the rim of every glass. We also watched the gusset grab the water pitchers with glasses and stick it under his arm so we would have been drinking out of their arm pit sweat. I was thoroughly disgusted and will never eat there again."}
{"text":"This establishment is excellent. The variety of food and the presentation of it makes you feel like you're on vacation. It's decorations and designs are very artistic and creative. Definitely a place to enjoy for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here. Great service and excellent atmosphere. Lots of room in the patio and comfortable couches/chairs. Good food."}
{"text":"Great vibe and great food. Protein pancakes and chicken sausage on point. And the eggs Benny are some of the best in the valley. Will be coming back to this spot."}
{"text":"House made sausage was legit. Corn beef hash was also really good. Part of the meal did come out way undercooked though. Server was young, very nice, super busy but obviously expected on a Sunday morning as the whole place was packed. Really need to turn the air conditioning on the place was hot as hell.  Big portions overall pretty good and will try again."}
{"text":"Pomegranate Mimosas are delicious! The corn beef hash was more hash than beef but pretty ok. Service is always really great here."}
{"text":"The menu is amazing, each time we dine here is better than the time before. Service is great, and the coffee rivals any we've had in Europe. The only thing that saddens me is there isn't an eggstacy in the Midwest."}
{"text":"I has the prosciutto omelette with mozzarella, tomato and red peppers. Really great flavors, hot and fresh. The hash browns were hot and crispy. The fresh fruit was a little meh.  The fresh squeezed OJ was also great.  Otherwise, service was good. The place is LOUD though."}
{"text":"My first visit today. What a great 7 innovative menu. The pancakes are wonderful. Really friendly staff. The tile floors do make it noisy, but you do not have to worry about the table next to you eavesdropping. It will become a regular stop"}
{"text":"At first glance/ taste it's an ok place...  We showed up about 10 o'clock on Saturday my mother in law and sister in law got there first so they got us a table we came in sat down seems pretty nice they had cucumber water on the table and a cute little plant in the middle. The music was a little loud and for the size of the big round table I couldn't hear what was going on on the other side of the table. There were six of us total my husband and I and our two youngest children, and then my mother in law and sister in law. My mother in law ordered 8 chorizo omelette with fruit skewer, my sister-in-law ordered corned beef hash and a banana pancake thing. Husband ordered steak and eggs and had stuffed brioche which had banana and I had the corned beef hash and the stuffed brioche also. My son had  mickey mouse pancakes. And my 18 mo just shared from my plate. I will say that they do offer a ton of food well worth the $10+ plate price. Little tasted pretty good cook corned beef hash was a little bland for my liking. Service was good enough. The tables are not set up well it is hard to maneuver especially when it's busy.  There were a few table side issues that I normally just move on from, there were fruit flied all over our table... it was a battle while we ate but  this is a thing when you have food so I usually don't write anything when th is happens however it may lead into why I rate this a 1 star. The other thing is they don't grow in their strawberries and one of my strawberries had spider web or possibly just a dandelion fuzz either way I just question over to the side of my plate and ignored it. Again I'm usually not picky with natural imperfection its food  it grows outside, whatever. The coffee was okay but I like strong coffee nobody else at the table was impressed by the coffee. So we ate we paid we walked to her car.   Here is the reason for 1 star review* details not for squeamish  My in-laws do not live with us and we haven't seen them for over a week so all of the following  directly relates to our dinning experience. . My mother in law was already starting to not feel so great. We drove home and she was sick (headache, stomach aches). She rode with me and my husband and sister in law went out to go shopping. My mother in law experienced diarrhea the moment we got home. Being Saturday I had errands to run so I left to go run my errands while out my stomach began to hurt pretty bad and I came home, to experience the same diarrhea. My son also came down with headache/ diarrhea.  My husband returned from his shopping early because both him and his sister were not feeling great. The baby also came down with the same illness.  This is a classic food born illness. I'm not sure if this was just a bad day or if other people have experienced the same thing but when an entire family gets sick I feel like it's important to write a review so that other people might be wary. We won't be returning to this restaurant. Eat with caution."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Scottsdale by far. Reasonably priced too. Servers really good. Creative choices, not just the usual here. Yes, it was pretty noisy but the food, prices and friendly staff make it worth the noise."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out after hearing many friends talk it up. You get a lot of food for a great price. I ordered the veggie omelette and it came with a good portion of fruit on the side, as well as two pancakes... all for about $10. I liked how you can add protein to the pancakes. Service was good too. I think Krista was waiting on us. Thanks for the coffee Krista!"}
{"text":"Always an awesome experience whenever I go here! You really get your moneys worth! I really enjoy their pancakes, and they have the BEST hash-browns!  The only thing I would change is they have more booth seating options."}
{"text":"Parking can fill up fast as that whole plaza is very popular - arrive early if you can. The staff is courteous but the music is too loud. You'll have to raise your voice and lean forward to listen since they keep the music at club decibel levels.   The food is excellent. Great menu, lots to choose from. What I especially like is the spacious dining room. They don't mash the tables together as tightly as some diners."}
{"text":"Had brunch at Eggstasy today. The menu is phenomenal with so many original choices we really had to study it to make our decisions, because we did not want to miss anything. Our server was a super nice guy, right on top of refills and provided great service. I got the \"skinny b&$*%h\" burrito and the hub got a spinach omelet with gruyere and pine nuts with a side of fluffy pancakes. We both loved our selections and the portions were gigantic. I could have eaten the leftovers for dinner. Best part was the price, for the money we have not seen better and we have hit a lot of breakfast places in town. The only reason this was not a five star is the atmosphere looks a little rough inside. Decorations have fallen off of the walls and the paint and dry wall could use repairs. Conceptually cute, just needs a little love. Still, this is our new fav."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW their Pancakes are delicious there Omelets are AMAZING and their prices are reasonable. First thing I always get is their Strawberry Orange Juice it is delicious and it is a must if you haven't had it, get it. This place is always busy especially on weekends but it is worth the wait they have a great outside patio where you can take in some rays and eat your breakfast too.  Their Crepes are great and so are their pancakes if you haven't had them before bring some buddies and an appetite to make sure you taste a little bit of everything. My favorite part is that they offer great choices on the menu as far as omelets but if you want to do your own thing they let you do that too.  Perfect breakfast spot for the whole family moderately priced."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and for a Sunday morning the wait wasn't too bad. I called to make reservations and then when I got there they said they don't even make reservations for 2 people so that was annoying and the waitress was a little off. But other than that its a cute and clean place! The portions are very big and they have unique breakfast selections."}
{"text":"What a joy! The food is not only fantastic it is good quality. There is something on the menu for everyone. Has lots of health smart choices if you're cutting calories and it has something for those who don't care. Candice was our server, she is very informative, knows her menu, best personality and brought our food out while it was hot!!!! I will definitely be back and intend to have my morning meetings there, for those who know Butterfields...this is your new place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and HUGE portions!  Wonderful addition to N. Scottsdale!   We were able to taste a little of everything and we enjoyed everything we tried.  The Nutella Banana Crepes were amazing and I can't wait to have them again.  My friend loved the Pumpkin Pancakes.  Be prepared to walk out with a doggy bag!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for really good breakfast or brunch in a great atmosphere...this is your place! They have a huge menu so there is something for everyone. If you want to eat healthy, like my girlfriend, there is something on the menu for you. If you want to not eat healthy, then there is something for you too and everything in between. I normally get their omelets and create my own. Their omelets come with a side of 2 massive pancakes! They are the best pancakes that I have ever had! And you get an option for a side...whether it be has browns or fruit...get the hash browns..you won't be sorry! They offer freshly squeezed juices and other great drinks. Their service is fantastic! This place is always busy when I come so expect to wait a little bit. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"New place my daughter and I decided to try for lunch.  Upon entering, we immediately noticed the noise level was very high.  I ordered the traditional eggs benedict, my kid ordered the Shea panini.  My Benedict was meh---eggs were overcooked, muffin mushy, and barely a teaspoon of hollandaise.  My daughter loved her sandwich, however, which was pretty and huge. Service was fine, within 15 minutes of ordering, except I would have liked my coffee refreshed.  Manager came to our table and I told him nicely and politely about the Benedict.  He apologized profusely and offered a dessert or a coffee to go and overall could not have been nicer.  I will wait a while and then give Eggstasy another try."}
{"text":"First off this place has AMAZING food. So what makes great food even better? The service of course! we had such a wonderful server, Junior, who took great care of us. He was friendly and so excited about the menu; that says loads about an establishment. It was clean and I love that you can see the kickass staff making scrumptious food in the kitchen. This is for sure my new breakfast place. Will be telling everyone to come here"}
{"text":"If you don't like eggstasy, then I don't like you.  Honestly, best breakfast I've ever eaten.  Steak and egg skillet was fantastic.  If there's two of you, split one.  Then order a SMALL PORTION off the \"eggstasy\" selection in the back of the menu, I highly recommend the brioche French toast or the pancakes with pumpkin cheesecake sauce (make sure to order the pancakes crispy.)  I've never tasted anything like either.  The chorizo grits are also tasty (just like chilli), but you won't have any room for sides.  So obviously I love the food.  Service:  been there twice, Candace and Michelle are GREAT.  Michelle actually insisted on sending us home with to go cups of coffee (for no extra charge.)  Everything comes out so fast, it'll boggle your mind.  The owner, Pete, gave is extra pancakes out of the blue, on the house.  I honestly felt like I was a part of some social experiment where scientists were studying my reactions to insanely delicious food at fire sale prices.   Price:  30 bucks for a fantastic meal for two?  Including coffee?  Hell yes. Wait:  been there twice, waited 20 min at the bar the first time (the bar tender kevin is now my boy), sat right away the second. Ambiance:  too loud, but I didn't really care.  There were flies because it's an open air restaraunt, honestly the only thing that bothered me at all. Pretty sure this is the first review I've ever written.  That's because this place is the shiat.  Not really sure how they're gonna stay in business for very long with those prices, so you might wanna get in the car now.  I SAID NOW! Ps if anybody happens across any of the recipes for any of the dishes at this restaraunt, I will pay you one million dollars. Pps Pete, if you're reading this, why aren't you open at 11:21 pm?  Also, I would consider nominating you for the Nobel peace prize if you implemented delivery.  Maybe if you delivered to Syria, ISIS would chill the phuk out."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Looked great. Tasted healthy. But still good. It was super crowded and the menus was huge! But the staff was very very nice and overall pleasant experience. Just not good enough to go back a second time"}
{"text":"Not what I expected. The service was soooo slow and the food was just OK .   It took about an hour to serve us our food."}
{"text":"The restaurant was so loud that it made enjoying a conversation with the people at your table impossible without raising your voice.   Our server didn't know the menu, had to come back to the table for clarification, and still got the order wrong. The place was really busy and we had a really hard time tracking down our server so we just gave up and ate our meal.   The food was the only redeeming part of this whole experience. But with so many great brunch places in the area, we will definitely not be going back there."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, fantastic food, and some really great healthy options! I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I went to Eggstacy in Scottsdale today for brunch. The food was excellent. I had an asparagus and almond omelette and banana pancakes and my wife had an omelette and lemon/blueberry cake. The omelettes were tasty, but the dessert/pancakes were even better. I'd recommend the banana pancakes to anyone looking for a sweet breakfast. The coffee was excellent. I would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"Great food, massive portion however - service forgot our orders, coffee was way to sweet like drinking suger and no AC."}
{"text":"Eggstasy seems to be the younger crowds breakfast joint as an alternative to Butterfields down the street. Their menu is so extensive that I took so long to decide. Their mimosas are amazing and my boyfriend loved his Bloody Mary. Any breakfast place is going to be busy on the weekends but they were apologetic and brought waters out to those waiting.   Candace was our waitress and she was very outgoing and went over the top to ensure we had a good experience. Again, I think it might be geared more toward younger adults or a couples morning out than a family gathering place but it's a refreshing change! Just wish they served beer. ;) (they might actually, guess I'll just have to go back and find out)"}
{"text":"I'm new to Scottsdale and I decided to venture out for breakfast one morning. This place is pretty close to home and I thought I would check it out.   My first impression - this place is LOUD. The acoustics in this place make general conversation by diners echo and it sounds like a high school cafeteria in there. I could barely hear my server. So, if you're looking for a quiet breakfast, this won't be the place for you.  I must have just missed the main breakfast rush, because the place was full, but I only had to wait a few minutes for a table.   Bonus points - the regular coffee is really quite good.  If the coffee was that good, I was very excited for my meal.  I ordered the Steak and Eggs Benedict which came with hash browns or fruit (I chose hash browns) and I also ordered a side of the Chorizo Cheesy Grits, because I was curious.  I requested the steak be cooked medium.  My food arrived fairly quickly, and it was almost perfect.  The steak was juicy and flavourful, the eggs were poached perfectly, the sauce was delicious. My only slight complaint was the English Muffin was a little under toasted, so it tasted a little gummy. The hash browns had a slight hint of heat to them, which made them fantastic.  The Cheesy Grits were fine, but not what I was hoping for.  I wouldn't order those again.  There were so many menu options that I deciding what I wanted to eat was a challenge.  I will definitely be back to sample more of their options."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this place. The food is decent but the service and management is beyond horrible. Never once have I been to an establishment where the waiter is so unprofessional that he throws peoples bills at them, while throwing a tantrum like a 2 year old bc he can't handle a party larger than 3. When I called the owner over to speak w him abt the poor service , he not only disrespected me in front of the entire patio but proceeded to tell me off saying nothing was wrong w his staff or service. Really? That's why two additional tables left after seeing how rude he was to our party. I brought in a party of 20 ppl-- they could have made a killing off of us! But taking 30-45 mins just to get water (while baking in the sun) and an additional 30-45 mins for our drink orders to be taken is not ok. It really is a shame."}
{"text":"I tried this wonderful new breakfast and lunch spot in Scottsdale for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The menu is excellent and the food preparation and presentation was superb.  I had a terrific breakfast burrito with fruit which was fresh and served with a generous helping of sliced avacado.  Every plate I noticed being served looked exquisite.  My servers, Britni and Chris were also wonderful which just made the experience all that more enjoyable.  Also, unlike many other breakfast spots Eggstasy does accept reservations.  If you're a Scottsdale breakfast person you'll be pleased you gave Eggstasy a try."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try Eggstasy based on the reviews.  I ordered the omelette with prosciutto, Swiss chard, mascarpone and one other ingredient. Boyfriend ordered the Dutch apple french toast. We also ordered Bloody Mary's, his was spicy and I ordered mine regular. We also ordered coffee.  The good: quick seating despite how busy it was. The waiter was prompt. The presentation of the drinks was fun-- it came with chocolate covered bacon. Portions were humongous so the \"good\" is that at first you feel you're getting bang for your buck. There was almost no room left on the table to set all the food and drinks. The coffee was satisfactory-- a little stronger/not watered down.  The not-so-good: My omelette was pretty dry. The ingredients were there, but the mascarpone didn't really shine at all.   The Dutch apple french toast was just overwhelmingly monstrous. Once you got to the center the intense sweetness calmed down a little, but still really, really heavy.   The bloody mary was not good. The chocolate on the bacon was overwhelming after a bite. The mix itself was mediocre, and the vodka in it didn't taste all that smooth. It was also $10! I would rather get a $5 bloody mary deal at a sports bar for the taste quality alone!   The drinks also came to our table spilling over, which I think if I were the business owner I would be concerned about the waste. As a customer, I just didn't like that it soaked the whole napkin coaster. Thanks for filling it to the brim, but I don't want the mess.  Disappointed and would probably have to read more reviews on what people liked, to decide whether it's worth returning to try those things."}
{"text":"Such great food could not stop eating! Drinks are delicious and creative as well.  Make sure to go early as there can be a wait."}
{"text":"We had the best breakfast yesterday. They started out with 5 stars due to the cucumber water and LaVazza coffee and espresso and never lost a star. The mimosas were delicious with the fresh-squeezed OJ and then the food came. We split a two egg breakfast with turkey sausage, since we like a light breakfast, and it was delicious and cooked perfectly. The hash browns were crispy and the turkey sausage was amazing, not your typical Jimmy Dean sausage link. To top it off, the sourdough toast is some of the best we've had. We will definitely be back. If you want a leisurely breakfast, sit at the bar - it gets busy and they are quick to turn tables."}
{"text":"Such a nice breakfast place! Went with my family on Saturday and super happy we went. My kids enjoyed their pancakes and I loved my omelet."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast EVER!!!!! VERY disappointed you're open on Christmas Day! I would love for my family member and others to be home with family and not at work! The Jewish deli is even closed! COME ON!"}
{"text":"Everything from the eggs and chicken sausage to the lemon ricotta pancakes were delicious! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this location with my family & family friends (group of 8). Our server was very kind and friendly (only reason I'm giving a 2/10). Is due to the fact that our overall experience was not pleasant. Before we had arrived we had called to make sure that the menu had vegan options... The staff has told us there were many, when we sat down at the table the waitress had made us aware that they had no vegan options. Secondly, It took 20 minutes for us to get our orange juice and another 10 for the coffee.. after she had taken our food order. She was clearly slammed so not her fault...but hire more servers. We finally had our food arrive.. they had no clue where the food was going, and had made mistakes with our food. After being sent back to the kitchen they kept saying that it was correct (there were still errors but we just ate it). Overall not good but again with the exception of our server who was friendly, apologetic and busy throughout the time we were there."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that we won't be coming back even though the food was good. The service was pretty inattentive... After we got seated we waited about 5-7 minutes until anyone brought us water and we made eye contact with several people working there and we were ignored. We saw a couple tables seated after us get their drinks and order even before we got our water. We tried a couple of the eggs benedicts and the crispy pancakes and everything was delicious. The fresh squeezed and pressed juices are extremely refreshing as well. However, the subpar service and crowded room was enough to keep us away. It took several minutes to get to the exit weaving and asking people to scoot in and with a massive crowd of people blocking the entry it must be a fire hazard!"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday and it took over an hour from the moment we ordered to get our food. Our waiter was horrible and the manager did not do anything to make up for the slow service and long wait. People were walking out because the food was taking too long. We ended up getting our food to go because we had lost our appetite. Although the food was good we will never come back. No concept of hospitality/customer service."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch when I was in town visiting my parents and we loved it! We didn't have a reservation but the hostess Samantha was so sweet and accommodating and had us seated at a table in less than 10 minutes during a busy time. Kenneth was our server and he was great. I had the BLAT and it was to die for. Everyone loved their food and we'll definitely be back on our next visit to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Three attempts at cooking eggs over medium.... Fail. Asked for a manager and they never came over. Still sitting here waiting. If you have \"egg\" in your name, be able to make an egg."}
{"text":"Service was fine but the worst corn beef hash I have ever had. Really ruined the whole meal. The server was polite but didn't seem to know what to do. There are so many better options around here."}
{"text":"Gave it two tries and the service and operations were so bad that we are not going back.  Waited 15 minutes before we were even served water the first time...food took just as long.  Didn't plan on returning but they gave us a gift card because we had to wait for so long.  Went back again today and the same service issues.  Food was fine but not great...we had the smoked salmon Benedict and a breakfast flatbread. Ordered a kids breakfast for my kids and they brought out both breakfasts on the same dish?!?!  Maybe the cook doesn't have kids but children don't really like to eat their meals off the same plate...had to get a separate dish to split the breakfasts.  I will say the pancakes are good and it has a nice indoor outdoor trendy atmosphere but not enough to make us return."}
{"text":"The food is great. I've had the gruyere, Swiss chard and Carmelized onion omelette and the goat cheese and fig panini. Portions are huge and everything is very tasty. Also, Junior is a great waiter who knows a lot about the food. Only problem is the club music they have blasting. Why such terrible, loud music at breakfast? If they turned off the music it would be perfect."}
{"text":"Heaven on earth. If you're looking for a real good breakfast fix this is your spot. Nutella French toast is to die for. It's delicious and you will be back for 2nds, and 3rds on another day. We look forward to coming back again since it's close by to our new place. It seems as if we would be regulars here. :)"}
{"text":"I walked in and was immediately seated at their bar.....had I wanted a table it would have been 1 hour....most likely due to church peeps and everyone wants to try a new place out. Service us very friendly and prompt. I had a large OJ which was fresh squeezed....and the water is delicious. ..you can taste the cucumbers. Only thing missing was  mimosa's....still getting their liquor license approved.  I had the crepe's which inside was eggs, spinach and some cheese.  The dish is to have mushrooms but I substituted tomatoes which was delicious.  I ordered a side of bacon and only was able to eat one crepe out of three because it was so big. I definatily will come back after a few weeks of them settling."}
{"text":"After I finished at my dentist, A Reason To Smile, in the same shopping plaza, I finally made my way to Eggstasy.  Cute and hipster type of bfast place.  Nice menu and great service.  Can't believe I waited so long to go there.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you want great pancakes get the lemon ricotta, so good! Also the hash is done traditional shredded with is how I always remember getting them as a kid.  Will be back for sure and will try out the lunch fare."}
{"text":"Pumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes may be one of the greatest things I have ever eaten in my life. They are a perfect combination of sweet but not too sweet. This is going to the top of my list of breakfast joints. Eggs were fluffy and nice large portions were served. Nothing like enjoying breakfast outside in the beautiful Arizona weather. There are some issues with service, not fast and not all that attentive but the pros greatly outnumber the cons."}
{"text":"So glad SNOOZE is just up the block. I've been to Eggstasy multiple times and unfortunately it got worse each visit. I will not return again. Service is slow, management is unorganized, and food is average.  Check out Snooze at Kierland if you want a great breakfast with great service. Might have to wait, but it's well worth the wait!!  If you want a below average experience then Eggstasy is for you."}
{"text":"A lot eggxcellent options for brunch! Had the skirt steak & eggs with hash browns & fruit kabob. A wide selection of beverages including mimosas and spiked sweet tea. Great service from Kenneth our waiter! Very pleased to have this breakfast & lunch establishment in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place. Our first visit didn't go so well because we were confused that a pancake would come as a side for an already large meal and there was just overall miscommunication.  We have been back twice since and have enjoyed both of the other visits.  Good mimosas, good breakfast and an assortment of things to choose from.  It's great because my mother-in-law can get something super healthy and my father-in-law can get his not-so-healthy choices.  I love the avocado benedict but also enjoy the skinny b as well.  Cute decor. The inside can be really noisy.  There's a lot of concrete/tile/metal so noise kind of bounces around. I think it's better when the windows are up on the one side of the bar because the noise has an outlet- but on a day like today when it's 112 and not practical to open the windows, it gets noisy.  Not a huge deal though because the great food makes it worthwhile and normally we sit outside if we can anyway.  Nice breakfast place that we enjoy on occasion."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh... We came one morning and we were very excited to try this place because the food looked so good! The wait wasn't too long which was nice, the bloody mary with the chocolate covered bacon was interesting and tasty, and our server (tall, light brownish hair) was very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend isn't picky with food and enjoyed his although admitted it wasn't the best.. he had some type of omelet. I had the salmon benedict. GROSS!! And I loooveee salmon with a passion and honestly had never tried a salmon I didn't like until we came in this morning. It either tasted way too salty or just too \"fishy.\" Was it a bad batch? Or do people actually like it to taste like that? I may never know, but I couldn't even finish it. We love other breakfast places and will probably just go there instead."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Our sever Wendy was excellent. I had the Crispy Prosciutto Benedict which was out of this world. The atmosphere is rather modern and extremely inviting. Do not miss out on this place!!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent service & food preparation are the main reasons I gave three stars. If not for recent improvements it would have been two stars.   The food is ok most of the time, but a couple of times I had horrible eggs. As in not edible.   I've never had a five star experience here, with either food nor service. Mostly disappointing. But worth three   But alas, in the name of saving time, in a rush to get breakfast on the way out of town, I recently went back.   BUT....This last time I visited they seemed to have better knowledgeable staff that knew what they were doing!! Amazingly different than before!   My order was correct! as in I got the meal I ordered(most of time there are mistakes)   My eggs came out over medium just like I ordered! (NEVER  happened before in approx 5previous visits)   The waitress checked on us throughout the meal!  Again, this is new.   I was delighted at the transformation they seem to be doing.  The place seemed cleaner. The staff is different & more professional.  Good job on the improvements.  Thanks eggstasy I will try again, and hopefully have better experiences. I'm actually rooting for you!  The 'better quality breakfast business competition is actually very nearby, one across the street and one about two miles away, but with this  being walking distance from me, is why I hope for eggstasy, to get it together.   If they would just play appropriate, less jarring music, it would be a more comfortable place to eat. And I'd be less inclined to drive for my morning meals."}
{"text":"Beware! From the outside it looks real nice. The inside appears to be clean however... Gnats and flys because the door wide open all the time. Had to return full meal to be re-cooked. Then an apology but rest of party all ready had eaten. Young staff, no real mgmt to speak of. Emailed the manager after returning home and never heard back. Very expensive and simply not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"My salmon flatbread was pretty good, but the edges were too crispy to eat easily, and it was somewhat too salty for my taste.   My wife's savory crepes had a good savory filling, but the crepe itself was sweet. This made for a combination that neither of us cared for.   The menu was full of interesting sounding items. I suspect the best things here are the omelettes and Benedicts.  I'll try that next.   The bacon was the best bacon I've had in my whole life!"}
{"text":"The creativity involved in these pancakes deserves some recognition. Simple and enjoyable environment."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! The wait was a little long but it was worth it. Portions are pretty big so I would definitely share/split next time. The servers are extremely helpful in answering any questions and know the menu very well to offer any suggestions. Can't wait to go back to try something else :)"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and attentive and they had a large menu. Everything sounded great that I wanted one of everything! I ordered the chocolate covered bacon but was pretty disappointed. The bacon was thick and chewy, and $7 for only three strips. I took one bite and was done but didn't say anything about it and took it home, hoping someone else might like it. I also had the red velvet Nutella pancakes which were exceptional. I will be returning for sure! Lots of seating and isn't cramped."}
{"text":"As you may know, I'm a huge breakfast guy and this was my first  experience at Eggstasy.  My finance and her family have came here before and really like this place.  To me, this place is OK, I can't say I was impressed with the food.  The ambiance  was nice though, it was well decorated and had a lively atmosphere.  The service was good and they constantly fill up your water and coffee.  The place had a diverse menu alot of variety.  As you may know, I'm not a sweets person and not a huge fan of waffles, pancakes, or crepes, which this place is know for.  I'm more of a biscuits and gravy guy or meals that are hearty.  I ordered the brisket and gravy, but was eventually told they ran out of brisket, so I went with the standard biscuits and gravy and two eggs.  I also ordered the chrizo  cheddar grits.  The biscuits were whole and had gravy on top.  It didnt have enough gravy for the whole dish.  I felt the dish was very dry and bland.  The cheddar grits were nothing to rave about either and for the price, the portions were small.   If you ask my fiancee she would give this place 5 stars.  She's into the fancy fresh juices and presentation.  I'm all about the food.  I was told they have big portions, but it was nothing to rave about.  I did see an omelette dish the person ordered next to us, it did look good.  Anyways, I'm always open to try out breakfast joints, but I dont think I would go back to this place again...Who am I kidding..my lady loves this place, I'm sure I'll be back and hopefully will try something better and give it a better review."}
{"text":"My family went there as a celebration so there were 6 of us.  The service was slow and we had to keep looking for our server and then flagging her down so she would come to our table.  Three of us ordered the eggs benedict and all agreed that the english muffin was very gummy and soft.  The pancakes were good though which seems to be the safe bet there.  It seemed very warm in there and we were seated inside.  Our bill came and it seemed extremely expensive for the quality of the food.  I can say that the coffees and the fresh orange juice was good.  Would i go back... I don't think so..."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved it here! The food is great and huge portions! Its a great atmosphere and our waitress Nicole was great. She was on point and happy to be there. I had a latte and being someone who worked at a coffee shop it was a good latte and made correctly. My husband had the orange juice and it was so fresh made to order. Honestly I don't know why we haven't been here before but we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place cause my friend recommended it highly and I was not impressed.  The food was mediocre and the atmosphere plain.   They have unusual items, which I tried and it wasn't very tasty, just blah.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went on the third day they were open. The food was wonderful!!!! Everything tasted very fresh and light and healthy instead of a heavy, greasy breakfast. Service was fantastic! We got our food quick. And the restaurant is adorable. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is LOUD. Went hear for breakfast with my in laws when they were in town. We had reservations and were seated promptly which was great. Overall I would give the service 4-5 stars - our waiter was attentive and the staff was courteous the entire time  However, I would say the food was just average - we all got different items and none of them stood out. The corn beef hash could have come from a can, the croque madame needed way more bechemal for the mountain of bread, the bene was fine and the eggs OK. THe standout was the bacon which was fantastic overall - I would come back to try the chocolate bacon but that would be it.  Definitely better options for bfast in the area but not a bad spot by any means."}
{"text":"Love the food portion sizes.  The food was great.  Really don't like the cucumber water and it took awhile to actually be seen once seated.  The call ahead reservation thing is convenient! All in all its one of our favorite spots to go before church"}
{"text":"Pumpkin cheesecake pancakes were good but the sauce didn't taste anything like cheesecake to me, and 4 giant pancakes is really too much for one person, especially with how sweet they are, so I'd suggest sharing. Also tried a special of the day which was an omelet with a sweet corn relish and braised beef which was really tasty. The omelet was super fluffy but hash browns were crispy to he point of being dry so I wasn't a fan. And my boyfriend said the toast, despite looming really yummy, was weird and not good. Service was good!"}
{"text":"My barbacoa omelette was incredible and so was the churro waffle with nutella dipping sauce. Very attentive waiter. My only disappointment was the size of the tables and chairs, not fit for big breakfast lovers like my boyfriend and I. He's 6'4\" and was very uncomfortable in all the chair options we tried, and our table was so small we had to put our condiments, salt/pepper shakers, and sugar pack block on the windowsill when our food came out. The very feminine styling and size of the furniture was even more confusing when our giant-portioned, delicious breakfast came out. I hope to be back but I'll probably have to drag my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great variety of quality food and a fun atmosphere. The pancakes are out of this world"}
{"text":"The omelettes are made with 6 eggs.  Clearly, this plate is destined to be split.  My wife and I split a Gruyere, Swiss chard, onion omelette.  We also split hash browns, had a fruit skewer AND 2 banana pancakes.  All this for under $14 with tax.  A couple next to us had bloody Mary's that looked incredible.  We also like Eggstacy because it is dog friendly.  Our server was friendly and diligent.  Her attitude, smile, and hard work made for a very enjoyable and reasonably priced brunch.  There is a plethora of \"breakfast joints\" within two miles of Scottsdale & Shea.  We have been to them all and this is my new favorite."}
{"text":"As a party of six, we were smooshed into a small, long booth. I definitely did not complain, as I realize the restaurant was full. However, I was left sitting less than 12\" away from a customer belonging to another party to my left. We both apologized to each-other several times as we bumped elbows. We both mentioned to each-other that it was unacceptable how closed they had placed the two separate parties.   Second, our arrogant, rude and just plain odd waiter came to our table, about 4-5 minutes after we had been seated. Because I have been here before, I know how the waiter/waitresses typically behave. Typically, they uphold acceptable customer service, know the menu well and are upbeat and pleasant. They make the experience enjoyable. Today, we experienced the polar opposite of that.  I also know that typically the waiter/waitress will ask if you would like cucumber water or strawberry water. Not today... he just poured cucumber water in our glasses and didn't say a thing. I asked if we could have the strawberry water instead (honestly, we don't like cucumber water) and he rolled his eyes. He was irritated we had asked, and made sure that we knew it.   He walked around the restaurant making weird facial movements and looked as if he was drunk or hung-over. It was rather odd. Actually, I have never seen anything like it. My husband mentioned that he continued to \"adjust himself\" as he was walking around. My father in-law saw him picking his nose. He would lean against the bar where the food was prepared for delivery. Honestly, it was disgusting and I was about to ask to switch to a different waiter/waitress. However, we were afraid of the aftermath of doing so. At this point, we were used to being ignored... and honestly, should have left. I would much rather have spent my morning somewhere else.   We waited for coffee to arrive to the table, and he dropped it off without asking if we were ready to order, without spoons, and without cream (we waited over ten minutes). We finally were able to order, about ten minutes later. The facial movements and odd behaviors he exhibited were just disgusting. It's almost as if he was drooling, or unable to control what he was doing. As he was taking our orders, his face was uncomfortably close to mine.  He asked me twice what I wanted. At this point, I was ready to leave. Again, should have done so.  I felt mortified that I had recommended this restaurant. After we awkwardly placed our order with him... we never saw our waiter again. Honestly, he went home.   Next, our food began to arrive... the first dish in a timely manner. Yes, I realize we were a party of six, and that it can't come all at the same time. However, it took about 12 minutes for all of our food to come to the table, correctly. It was continually brought by different waiters and waitresses, who continued to act confused and continued to ask what we were missing. One waitress said, \"hmm... that wasn't written down\". We were also brought two other items that we didn't even order. Obviously, our waiter didn't take the order correctly. Oddly enough, we were not surprised.   Food was okay. Sadly, it was cold because we wanted to be polite and wait for our table to be served in its entirety before we began eating. The food was sub-par. My omelet lacked flavor, so I had to add a significant amount of salt. The pancakes were spongy, and not their normal consistency. None the less, it was just plain gross. It was not Eggstacy's fine quality that I had mistakenly upheld them to. I can never recommend the food to anyone, ever again.   We were never attended to again. No water refills, no service. No, \"How is the food?\". No, \"Anything else I can get you?\". I gathered many empty plates that were scattered around the table, and someone eventually came to grab them and dropped off a check, without saying really anything.  We asked the new girl were our original waiter went. She said, \"oh... oh ya, he was really, really sick and went home.\" What?!?  Seriously?!? Too sick? Too sick to handle our water and coffee? Too sick to lean into us to take our order? Too sick to lean on the counter where ALL the food was being prepared?!? It's a good thing I don't work for the health department, or that would have warranted an immediate shut down, or at least investigation. She didn't say much else, never apologized or offered any semblance of empathy. Should she have told us he was too sick? No. She was yet another employee not trained on proper customer service. here was a clear lack of leadership presence and that was evident in all aspects of what we encountered today.   At this point, I was seriously about to lose it. I excused myself to the restroom to walk away for a few minutes. Queue the next problem: (I'll bet you guessed it...) the absolutely disgusting restroom. Fecal matter on the sides of the toilet, an overflowing trash can. I can't continue, I actually feel like vomiting.  Bottom line: don't go."}
{"text":"So me and three of my friends came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning: first of all they sat us at a big table with other strangers... second our waiter was high or on some drug... he came to the table maybe twice when we were there for like two hours and only filled two out of four water glasses... the food took forever and half of my stuff came out an hour later... when i asked to speak to the manager she was rude and standoffish and then when i asked to speak to the owner he said no... then our waiter mixed up our credit cards for different meals that we had.. they kept bringing us other people's food... get better servers or management this was the most ridiculous experience it wasn't even that busy"}
{"text":"I love the food, but the service is shaky! I waited over 45 minutes the other day for takeout after being told it would be 15 minutes...last week, we picked up takeout and the order was wrong. The time before that, we never got our coffee or drinks, and the food came out before the drinks. We were charged for the drinks, and I said something to the waitress who didn't adjust the check, so I mentioned this to the owners, and they made everything right, which I appreciate, but the servers don't ever seem to care! I love the food so much that I can't lower the stars anymore than 4, but I refuse to go there anymore when it's remotely busy. It seems like 7 out of 10 times there's an issue."}
{"text":"Good place with unique food . I'm not going to say much because it's nice . I wanted more coffee and cream but was slow coming . It was busy but they shouldn't leave you hanging . I mentioned to server several time for more times."}
{"text":"7 of us ate at Eggstasy on a Thursday morning during Christmas break.  The food was very good and the menu had many cool and unique items.  The servers were friendly and tried hard, although the service was somewhat slow, still a nice breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Not only does this place have the best coffee, but it has such a variety of unique food items and everything is SO good.  Even the healthy stuff is great!  Love the 'skinny b@#c*' wrap and the various french toasts are to die for.  The only negative thing I can say about this place is that the wait staff is a little slow, although very friendly.  I have learned to ask them to either come back to the table often to refill my coffee or leave the carafe at the table because their cups are small and they don't come back often enough."}
{"text":"The steak and eggs were excellent and so was the service. They had a wide selection of beverages, and I will definitely go back for the iced vanilla latte. Very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it four stars because, 1. It's about 82 degrees in there (I looked). 2. It's LOUD. That's all on the downers. On to more positive remarks! I want to give it five stars because the food is SO good. I could go back every day to try a new dish. Seriously, I don't want to have breakfast anywhere else. Fig and goat cheese omlette, pumpkin cheesecake pancakes, Brie, cranberry, apple and turkey panini. I think it's called \"the seggxy\"...the french fries are perfectly crispy. Black bean soup...all wonderful. It's clean, cheerful and modern inside. Service has been excellent during both of our visits. All things I love to enjoy without a sweat mustache. Please turn the air down."}
{"text":"Went Sunday mid to later morning and saw the breakfast bar was relatively open so the four of us sat there. The place was a zoo, we should have expected that, and the servers were trying their best but the owners/hostess had the place way overstuffed. We never really received our complete orders and just scarfed down our mediocre meals that took far too long to arrive in incomplete fashion."}
{"text":"This breakfast place was \"as advertised \". Several yelpers complained about service, the fact is that this place has outstanding food and, as a result it is very busy.  We waited 35 minutes (which is what they told us when we arrived). The host staff was very efficient in seating folks and in (what seemed like) a short time were seated. I had a Bloody Mary (with chocolate dipped bacon!) which was great.  Dark roasted real coffee too.  I had the maple chorizo French toast. All good!  Eat here!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! I honestly drove by this place and wanted to try it out just because of its name LOL.  Anyway, I got the brioche croque madame and it was wonderful! A little too much food, but great to eat nonetheless. My friends all seemed to enjoy their foods as well. Also, the drinks that were there tasted great! Would definitely recommend trying their mimosas. Also, the interior of the place was really cute. Loved all the little plants and overall color scheme. Was definitely a great brunch spot."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service. Our waiter Alex did not describe the food correctly and was unable to split the checks evenly. It's pretty easy 3 cards when they tell you to split it evenly you split it 3 ways. Would not recommend, will not return. Overpriced and awful service, no thanks. As an aside get a POS system that has the capability to split checks."}
{"text":"Holy fuck! They give you lots of food so go hungry or hungover or both. The omelets that my husband and I had were both good. My husband ordered his with a side of pancakes which we ended up sharing. The fresh fruits were great too. Oh and they have Kaseri cheese which I saw absolutely nowhere else in a menu anywhere in the state. Not organic."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but feel I have given them the opportunity to correct the issue.  My husband and I lived right by here and made this our breakfast spot, and there are quiet a few just around Scottsdale and Shea.  The food was good, portions huge.  A little pricey but its Scottsdale.  Well a few months ago a server shook some hot sauce and got it EVERYWHERE!  In my hair, on my shirt, my husbands shirt across from me, all over the people next to us.  What a disaster!  They said they would pay to dry clean anything and we didn't care too much about our t- shirts we had one but I did care about my fabric Micheal Kors purse.  I followed up a bit after and they still agreed, cool.  Life was busy but I searched dry cleaners and no one did purses, i was surprised.  the manager said she would look and she fell off the planet.  I even emailed her to see if she had luck, crickets.  I am pretty upset that purse is now ruined and cost way more than the breakfast itself (which they didn't offer to cover just a gift card to come back-nice but our meals were ruined then not later).  I have guests coming in this week and taking them elsewhere this time, pretty bummed-not just bc of purse but the lack of follow up and not going back for the fun food."}
{"text":"What a welcome treat for Scottsdale Ranch to have a \"made from scratch\" breakfast cafe with the flair of Eggstasy culinary delights!  Meals are generous portions served with fresh fruit skewers for breakfast and fresh made soups for lunch.  Try the amazing spinach, mushroom & kaseri crepes or numerous flavors of pancakes.... I love the lemon ricotta with blueberries and lemon curd.  The unique Greek Skillet is delicious, too!  Eggstasy offers several gluten free options, too.  I enjoy the Greek flair and have a long way to go to try everything on their unique, extensive menu.  Come get hooked on this great establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Such a let down. From the service to the taste this place fell so flat. I will say that the inside of the restaurant is really cute. Very open, chic and inviting. But that's really the only thing worthy of stars. Our server was barely functioning- had zero enthusiasm and gave zero shits about giving us good customer service. Seemed like he had partied hard the night before. My boyfriend asked what kind of feedback customers gave about a certain dish and all he could muster was that a lot of people order it. So he ordered the truffled brioche and asparagus toast with fontina and egg which sounded great. And the food even looks really appetizing. Photo worthy for sure. But the food was soo bland. Neither of us could taste the truffle, and I love sweet and savory together but the brioche in this dish did not work. I ordered the brie and apple omelette off the healthy side of the menu which I expected to not taste as good as something more decadent but the eggs were so flavorless.  It seemed like there wasn't any brie inside the omelette, only one big piece on top. I also requested spinach be added, which it wasn't. I didn't want to wait for a new omelette so I asked for a side of vegetables which he declined to accommodate. We did not make very big dents in either of our dishes (which a good server should notice) but ours was completely oblivious to almost everything. He wasn't rude but needs a serious wake up call. This a breakfast place where everyone should have a sunny disposition and at least act like they've had a cup of coffee. For a place located on Scottsdale and Shea this was a pretty big disappointment. Save your time and money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, large, tasty portions, bright open space, wide variety on the menu."}
{"text":"I had an omelette with apples, Gouda, and chicken sausage with a side of pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. There were 10 of us in the party all together (celebrating my mother in law's 80th birthday) and every one of us left stuffed and impressed. The giant fruit kabobs were just the icing on the cake. Jack was our server and did an incredible job! This was THE BEST BREAKFAST I've ever had!!!! I might also add that I am a Las Vegas native, born and raised, and I'm comparing this to many spectacular breakfast food places that I've dined at. Well done!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had such a great experience at Eggstasy! We made reservations for brunch on a Saturday, late morning. When we arrived, we were quickly seated. Every employee that greeted us seemed genuinely friendly. They were attentive without being overbearing. And the menu! Oh, the menu! So many unique options! It took us quite a while to make up our minds. We decided on sharing a sweet and a savory dish. Our fantastic server Elena split our dish for us. We shared the quinoa, kale and sun-dried tomato omelette and splurged on the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. Wonderful choices! The pancakes weren't too sweet. My friend got the fresh-squeezed orange juice. I had coffee which was served with real cream. The carafe of water on our table had cucumber in it. Every detail was perfect! I wish I had discovered this place earlier! I'll be back soon. I want to try the chocolate covered bacon!"}
{"text":"We came in around 9AM on a Saturday morning and got a table for 3 without any wait. By 10AM, is when the place gets crowded and 1 hour waits begin.  By the name Eggstacy, we were expecting an out of this world egg breakfast experience. We ordered coffee, fresh squeezed strawberry pomegranate juice, the fried truffle egg toast, stuffed brioche french toast, prosciutto flat bread, a side of bacon and hash browns. The main dishes ranged from $12-14 each.  Service was great and our food came within 15 minutes after our order. The portions are huge and initially the food looked inviting.  Fresh squeezed strawberry pomegranate juice-Delightful, crisp and refreshing. Highly recommended!  Coffee-Not particularly smooth, a little bland, average.  Fried truffle egg toast-It came out as two pieces of French toast. The first piece had the fried egg, asparagus, fontina cheese, and truffle butter. The serving was large and was sufficient to leave one feeling very stuffed.  Prosciutto flat bread-This was our least favorite dish. It seemed like the prosciutto, roasted tomatoes, asparagus, parmesan, fried egg, and balsamic reduction was carelessly tossed onto the bread. It was extremely salty.   Stuffed Brioche French Toast-This was our favorite dish and works well as a breakfast dessert. I loved the stuffed mascarpone, bananas, and nutella.  By the name Eggstacy, we were expecting spEGGtacular or EGGcellent, but instead it was just rEGGular. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here or wait, but if I were in the area early in the morning, I might try it again."}
{"text":"My family love this place. Food is fresh and  a lot. Pancakes, eggs, crepes is like the name so fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was great,  but the service was a little slow in keeping coffee and water filled."}
{"text":"I ordered the strawberry oj, caprese Benedict, coconut/mango/papaya crepe and chocolate bacon. The juice was too sweetened with the strawberry pulp or whatever. I should have gotten straight oj. The caprese Benedict came on brioche that wasn't toasted making it bland and cold. The fruit in the crepe wasn't ripe. The chocolate bacon just wasn't very good. Ate one of the 3 pieces. Not worth the $7. Service was ok. They took care of the Benedict and gave us a gift certificate to apologize but I doubt I will use it as I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing every time I come and the fresh orange strawberry juice rocks my world! They are also always so sweet to ensure my baby is taken care of as well! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Still need to comeback for lunch but I know you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This place is a clear 2 star how is an alcoholic suppose to live in these conditions where you pay $8 dollars for a mimosa when the glass is like this I know this is supposed to be edgy but the plants on the table is a no go with little flies everywhere. Also everyone is too close together so it's vey loud especially with music. Food is okay nice looking, service okay if you want to sit for 20 mins waiting for your check."}
{"text":"Meh....decent. Went on Sunday around noon and it was very very busy. The service was pretty slow. Had to ask for water and a coffee refill multiple times. Our order also came out wrong, but we were starving so didn't want to send anything back. The gluten free protein pancakes are delicious. Huge portion, I had them for dinner as well :) You are really packed in  and it's pretty loud so hard to hear what the person across from you is saying. Would I go back - sure. But definitely not one of my favorite breakfast places in the area."}
{"text":"Eggstasy was amazing!! Great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Ok.  Yes, this place can EASILY be a 5 star with a couple of exceptions. 1) the expeditor chewing on a straw while getting food out of the window. Really? 2) the 12 year old hostess smacking her gum like a mule.  Food was solid.  chocolate cover bacon a win, house done hash browns were AMAZING! Apple taffy crepes yum!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Love the wide variety menu and the super comfortable outdoor seating area. Great service."}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch   Great patio and service    Fun presentation   Fresh squeezed juice for mimosas  They have great bloody Mary's   Chocolate bacon is a fun treat.   We went there one time and our son asked for no onions. The waitress noticed his omelette had onions and brought us a gift certificate for next time   The portions are huge but the food is he great. They have fruit on a skewer and the pineapple is always sweet   If you come on a Sunday head over early you will have a wait. It's worth it but a wait :)"}
{"text":"Hopefully they will be able to outlive the curse of this location and breakfast joints because the food and portions are awesome! Cool decor, nice service,  great food!"}
{"text":"Not sure how people are rating this place so low..When I went it was a slow Tuesday morning and I sat at the outside bar with my puppy.  The bartender, Alec, was great...perfect mix of professional yet hilarious. Ordered a regular veggie omelette (it was HUGE) with a side of bacon and a mimosa (ok fine mimosas..). Bacon was alright, nothing crazy but still pretty good. Mimosas were of course delicious, they have flavored ones which are pretty good. I overall would recommend this breakfast place and cant wait to come back to try it again."}
{"text":"Usually go to Butterfields 3 blocks down Shea, but wanted to give eggstacy a try,  glad we did. Food is excellent!! Got the skinny b***h burrito with Fresh fruit skewer. Delicious and presentation was five star. Restaurant has an urban modern vibe, and is noisy BUT they are addressing this with plans to add fabric to ceiling, etc.   patio is being remodeled and glass garage door will be open soon to add fresh air to restaurant.  Bar area for dining is nice touch.  Looking forward to going back....we will be regulars"}
{"text":"I was driving by the area and I stumbled across this new store called Eggstacy! The atmosphere in there is just so amazing and fun! The service was terrific and I will for sure be coming back for more delicious breakfast meals. PS: I had the Gypsy steak skillet with the side of Pecan pancakes and it was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food quality and the portions are huge which is hard to find these days!! Love them! Seriously going every weekend now!"}
{"text":"Came to Eggstasy for breakfast with my husband. The four stars are primarily for the service. Our waitress was friendly and accommodating. Because we came in on a Monday morning, the restaurant was not super busy.   I ordered the basic eggs Benedict and my husband had the corned beef hash. The Benedict and hash browns were just okay. Nothing special with the flavor. My husband liked the way the corned beef hash was prepared (not undercooked and with a little crispness).    We also ordered a mimosa and Bloody Mary drinks. The first Bloody Mary drink needed to be redone. There was not enough spice or tomato flavor. The Bloody Mary comes with a chocolate covered piece of bacon. That was okay (maybe too much chocolate coating).  There are a lot of choices on the menu and because this place is new, I believe they are still finding their signature flavor. I'd be willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"It is a fact that I will NEVER go to Eggstasy ever again! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST ANYONE GOING THERE.  The food is actually decent BUT the service is quite terrible. We were a large party, but frankly they did not know how to keep our orders organized. The waiter had no idea what he was doing, the manager could care less that the service was so bad and actually yelled at us, then the last straw was the obnoxious owner who claimed that the staff did nothing wrong!   I'm sorry but I do not think it should take an hour to get a beverage! We were also sitting in the hot sun during midday and had to beg for water!  They never once apologized for the terrible service. They made one lame attempt to give my friend a $20 gift card (this brunch was her birthday celebration with friends & family) but when she tried to use it, they refused to take it! Then the owner violently ripped the gift card right out of my friend's hands!!! The waiter also acted inappropriately many times and got very angry, and then towards the end he actually took one of those leather binders that the checks come in and threw it against the wall as he stormed off!!  The whole thing was soooo unbelievable.  As I've been telling the story, more people have shared with me that they also had very bad experiences with the service! If you have no desire to actually provide customer service and make sure that people can enjoy their food in a comfortable, friendly environment - then GET OUT OF THE HOSPITALITY BUSINESS!  Ok, venting done. Had to get that out and WARN people!  Thanks for listening!"}
{"text":"Delish!! Very happy to have the restaurant so close to home! Had the gyro wrap and a side of (complimentary) soup. Every food item (gyro wrap, fries, soup).- delish! Turkey wrap also ordered was awesome! Bloody Mary was a great pour...very hearty cocktails! Yum!  5 star for food, service (great) & drinks!"}
{"text":"Holy cow!!!! What a great place for breakfast or lunch.  The menu was amazing,  many choices and many healthy options.  Service was great. The portions were big,  definitely enough for two meals.  The White Chocolate Raspberry pancakes were like a dessert. The hash was good. Love the atmosphere- very modern."}
{"text":"Amazing food, large portions, hip vibe, great service. Stopped in for Sunday breakfast and what a pleasant surprise!! Will definitely return for lunch and many brunches in the coming months."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast yesterday, which was Labor Day. Sat at the bar, on the patio side. The guy behind the bar said he was new and apologized in advance for his not being familiar with the bar. Wasn't a problem at all. What was a problem was the old lady wearing a mumu working behind the bar. From previous trips, I assume she is one of the owners. She was a horrible representation of the restaurant. Dressed like she just rolled out of bed, you could tell she had dark underwear on since her clothing was super thin. At least get hair and makeup were done. But this is the worst part. On several occasions, I saw her wipe her forehead with her hands, and then serve drinks. WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS. Then, she collected trash, pushed it down in the bag, and went back to serving customers. Again, WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS. I really hope this gets read by ownership/management, because there is no place for people like this in an industry where appearance and cleanliness are so important. And if she is indeed an owner, she should be ashamed and embarrassed. Have some class and give your employees the proper training and support so you don't have to be hands on in that capacity ever again."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite breakfast place in North Scottsdale.  Stunning decor, very hip and bright.  French toast are delicious and the eggs Benedict were perfect!  I highly recommend this place.  It has a nice courtyard that makes the 30 min wait worth it, and the patio is beautiful too!"}
{"text":"After a thirty minute wait we were escorted to a table for three. The menu is large and complex with a few \"basic staples\" such as a three cheese omelet. We ordered a three cheese omelet, veggie omelet and a spinach and blue cheese omelet with goat cheese substituted for the bleu cheese. We also ordered a side order of Apple Gouda chicken sausage. Unfortunately, as has been noted in previous reviews, the restaurant is extremely noisy. While some might find this pleasant, I go out for breakfast for a social environment and not being able to hear my table mates is a downer. In addition, it clearly impaired the servers understanding of our order because she came back twice to clarify the goat cheese substitution on the bleu cheese omelet and also thought we had ordered Apple Gouda chicken sausage crepes, both of which were clarified. Despite this, somehow I got a veggie omelet with goat cheese. Definitely not what I wanted. It could have been avoided if the server had repeated the order when she took it.   The omelets are huge and when served with two pancakes are more than enough and none of us finished our omelets. I would suggest two people splitting an omelette as an alternative to waste.   Overall, I would have to be in a specific mood to eat, not converse and would have to make sure the order was correct to go back. A shame because I think it has potential but not with the decibel factor is generates."}
{"text":"I have been a number of times and this past Friday went for breakfast and the place was a train wreck in the making. Horrible service, messy floors, over cooked omlettes with barely any ingredients, pancakes delivered twice to our table which we did not order, artwork crooked on the walls, hostesses and servers just standing there and I can keep going...  I even had to point out the syrup on the floor after I watched the server spill it 15 minutes earlier (and yes she knew she spilled it) but never cleaned it up. WHAT HAS HAPPENED?! Open your eyes management and staff, people will start trying US Egg down the road if you don't get back what made you great!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot.  The oj is fresh and delicious.  The red velvet pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever eaten.   Everything I've had here is amazing. Service is great,  especially veronice.  She's the best!"}
{"text":"This changes everything! They have an unbelievable menu here. My wife and I had  crepe items and both were excellent. The variety of crepe dishes and pancakes is the broadest I have seen. Atmosphere is typical Scottsdaleish. The service is better than it needs to be (don't need quite that much attention).  Portions are significant and prices are fair. The big question for us is whether it is worth the drive from Gilbert. Yes, it is!"}
{"text":"I would give them 4.5 if I could. I felt good waking into the restaurant. It's a nicely decorated space. I remember different textures and warm colors (or was there just a yellow wall?) from my last visit. I like the high ceiling that made the space look more open.   My wife and I both enjoyed our food. I ordered corned beef hash, like I always do from brunch menus, and she had chocolate chip waffles with crispy prosciutto. Hers came with a side of fresh fruits and everything on her plate was delicious. Mine was good too, but it wasn't great. My poached eggs came out hard. I guess I should've specified but I'm just used to getting them soft with a runny yolk. The meat was a bit dry but I ate it with Tabasco anyway. I was satisfied but I've had better corned beef hash. We also ordered fresh strawberry oj, which tasted fresh but wish it was served cold.   Staff was friendly and the wait for the food was pretty quick. We left satisfied and I would definitely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Wow I just love this place!! 5 star Customer Service  Great Prices  Excellent Food Very Healthy.....!!"}
{"text":"Went to Eggstasy to celebrate my birthday.  The three cheese omelet with the requested gruyere as one of the cheeses was outstanding-way too much for one person since it came with pancakes and hash browns but managed to eat most of it.  Husband ordered eggs bene and was pleased except perhaps a little too much mustard in the sauce. Daughter mentioned that it was my birthday so also received complimentary pumpkin pancakes - delicious.  Kelsey was our server, and she was the best! Attentive, pleasant, and efficient. Kudos to Kelsey! Yes, the place is noisy but not so much that we were bothered. The food was so good -  we enjoyed a delicious breakfast. Will most certainly return."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm seeing low scores here. This place is AWESOME! They have the best bloody Mary's and s'more pancakes! Had the egg benidict twice and loved it! Great brunch spot!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but the service needs some serious improvements. I do love the fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Scottsdale. Staff and owner were extremely polite. I had 4 different staff check up on me during my meal.  Food was amazing. I had the croissant croquet madame which was one of the best I have ever had.  I also had the banana nutella crepe and chocolate covered bacon.  OJ was fresh and I will probably be going back tomorrow for more. The menu had a lot of healthy and non healthy options. I was torn between about 20 different items.  I look forward to my next visit and will take all visitors there."}
{"text":"If there is ever a time to cry because breakfast is so darn good, this place will have you bawling your eyes out! The food was perfectly prepared, beautifully plated and most importantly, AMAZING!!! The restaurant was a hip little place with enough color to wake up the eyes but the smells of the restaurant is what wakes up the rest! I had the gypsy steak skillet with a side of lemon blueberry frenchtoast. My girlfriend had the toasted coconut mango crepe. Both plates made the table fall silent since all we wanted was just to keep eating! SO GOOD! Definitely my new favorite place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Yesterday we went to Eggstasy of Mother's Day and it was, hands down, the WORST breakfast we have ever had as a family. We all knew it was going to be busy because of the Holiday but the service was so poor. We were missing 4 sides of pancakes, all of which were eventually cancelled because they would've come out 45 minutes after our meal. Our waitress never offered to have the manager come over and never tried to accommodate us for the errors. They also had a little boy, maybe 10 years old, who was working in the back trying help get food out. My chair was diagonal to him and I witnessed him either pick or wipe his nose 10 times. It was so DISGUSTING! I am very disappointed in this place. We will never go back."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar today and had wonderful service from Savannah. I should start with the fact that the coffee was great. I had 3 cups! I ordered the avocado benedict and it came out in just a few minutes. I loved that it had swiss cheese on it. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I'm just here to watch the owner yell at all of his servers and food runners lmao! He's worse than Chef Ramsey! But funny AF"}
{"text":"This place is super super amazing. I had the simple house made corn beef hash with 3 eggs. And oh my goodness. They were delicious. But the best part in my opinion is going to be the Orange juice. An employee was talking to me about it. I don't know if she was the manager or not. But she told me that they literally made the orange juice with a juicer. No store bought or pre-made. But freshly orange juice by a juicer. I haven't had that in ages. And it tasted amazing. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. Not only for the food, but as well. It has a great view of the mountains."}
{"text":"We were in town for Spring Training and came here because the #1 rated pancake house down the street had a 45 min wait.  We were very happy to be seated right away,  have a super great server, and the food was beyond our expectations.  Pancakes came as a side with our breakfast and they were light, fluffy, and scratch made.  Delicious!  Gluten free pancakes were also good.  Portions were very generous.  Will be back next year after we celebrate the 2016 World Series Champion Giants!!!!"}
{"text":"Really loud music, can't hear anyone at your table, horrible service, and over 1.5 hours to get basic breakfast!!!!  Not to mention watching the manager or whoever he was just stand in the kitchen - I suppose supervising.  If you are that short of help, take off your suit coat, roll up your sleeves and hit the grills.  The only good I can stay is when we FINALLY got our food, apparently the omelets were good.  The coffee was great."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Unique flavors in their foods, good atmosphere, friendly staff and the outdoor patio/bar is on point."}
{"text":"LOVE EGGSTASY!! They have the best orange juice i have ever tasted. It's loud and there are these weird benches that can't be good for your back ,but other than that its a wonderful restaurant!! All of the busboys are good eye candy too"}
{"text":"I stopped for breakfast because it was next to my hotel when I was in Scottsdale for work.  I got a good vibe as soon as I walked in.  It was homey, but modern, clean and fresh looking.  I ordered from the healthy section of the menu - a brie and green apple omelet!  I also ordered an almond coffee - unfortunately they were out of the almond, so I got a caramel macchiato.  The omelet came with a fruit shish kabob on the side.  The omelet was fluffy and big and yummy - I thought the brie would be worked into , but it was a big slab of it on the top!!  Perfect - better for the tasting!  A couple of mistakes by the staff - I ordered coffee in a to go cup, and it came in a ceramic cup, then they brought a hot to go cup, I finally asked for a cold cup with a straw, and the waiter said sorry - he couldn't find the right cup before!  They weren't even that busy!  But overall a very enjoyable experience. I also had enough food to have breakfast for the next day!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 10 times.   The menu is a good mix of unique and standard breakfast choices. I'm partial to the old standards and they do them perfectly. Top this off with fresh squeezed juices, great coffee, and for those like me, excellent screwdrivers and mimosas.  There is a nice sized patio that is great when the season fits. Downside is that it is really rundown especially because the place is pretty new.   Service has always been good, fast, and with a smile.  Even if there looks like a long wait, stop in because it moves fast."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Scottsdale! Will definitely add this place to our ~Must Eat At ~ list next time we're in town. Must try the lemon ricotta blueberry pancakes and the stuffed brioche french toast ---delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for the food pun, left with happy tummies full of eggselent food. I had the strawberry oj mimosa, fried truffle egg brioche, and split the avocado toast. Should have split the brioche too because of the generous slices of brioche. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is really good at this location but have to say delivery time to get your food is unbelievably slow. Considered you order 3 chocolate milks and you never get them and watch others that arrive after you get their drinks, really bad.   After we received our food our server never bothers to ask if we needed anything else (I.e. ketchup, Tabasco, etc.) so half of our party didn't even touch our food. Was rather speechless. Now I know I could have asked, but what would be the point. I didn't want everyone to have to wait an additional 20 mins or so to get it.  If possible I would highly recommend going to the original one (Shea& Scottsdale rd. area) better service and definitely better delivery of food. Will not be recommending people come to this location and will not be returning.  Sorry Eggstasy, but you should straighten out the processes at this location or find a manager who knows how to run a kitchen."}
{"text":"Brand new breakfast place with eggcellent selections and great food. They are from Chicago and brought all their skills to Scottsdale. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Both times I have ordered off the healthier menu and the food was great, not only that but the portion sizes are pretty big too. The wait staff is also very nice and very on top of their game. I will definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"Very simple this place has great food HORRIBLE service...Better off going somewhere else for breakfast it's like the most unorganized staff I ever seen."}
{"text":"Steak and eggs are great!!!! We always seem to run into friends here which is a good sign. This place makes good pancakes too. Recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Worst omelette ever!  Eggs should NEVER be BROWN.  My omelette was completely overlooked and dry!  Tasted like sulphur.  Giant chunks of leathery sundried tomatoes!  One giant glob of goat cheese in the middle!  Poorly executed!  Atmosphere was pure chaos!  Hostess was clueless.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Totally love the ambiance, service (Erica), and food was amazing if I lived here would be there several times a week."}
{"text":"Ate here other day and overall was not impressed. Ordered a cheese omelet with pancakes. It was overdone and kind of bland. Pancakes were just ok and they flaked so much I thi8nk they were a little undercooked. Tiny amount of syrup brought out I had to ask for more. For $8.95 it was a lot of food but honestly it was just mediocre."}
{"text":"We went to breakfast this morning and we were disappointed. The food came out at different times and we had to get up to get ketchup for our table from the bar area after asking multiple times. The food also seemed tasteless compared to the other location. I truly hope that they get the operations fixed. We really need a breakfast place at that location."}
{"text":"First time  to this place, very busy an noisy, thats ok.  The cappucino was very weak and took almost 20 minutes to get, almost coffee with froth on top.  The waffle was great, bacon also.  The french toast was also delicous but the canadian bacon was rubbery and tasteless and the hash browns were funky tasting.  The waiter was attentive BUT $42 tip  +  FOR BREAKFAST WITH NO ALCOHOL IS STIFF AND I CAN AFFORD IT. Will i go back yes but no cappuccino at $4 x2 and no canadian bacon at $4 no potatoes at $4 x 2 savings $20 +tax and tip.  There are other options around town like the Breakfast Club which is always consistant.  +-$32.  I give Egstasy a 78%."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We waited 45 minutes to be seated. We were told 30 and that's fine except for when a lady walked in who appeared to be a regular, gave the hostess a hug and asked if she could find her a table for 3 and was seated right away. It was frustrating because they have a limited number of seating for two people so larger parties were being seated before us. Once we were seated the service was very slow and we only saw our waiter twice. Once to take our drink order and once to take our food order. Once we got our food my boyfriend asked for maple syrup and never got it. Also, we observed that the table of four next to us who were seated way before is finally got their food and we were already done. What?! The food was ok. The experience blew."}
{"text":"I had an unfortunate experience this morning at Eggstacy. When I arrived and put my name on the list I was told that it would be about 25 to 30 minutes for a table. We were pleased when we were called after a 22 minute wait. I was going to complement the hostess on their accuracy in estimating the wait but it was so noisey and crowded I just tried to keep up with her on the way to the table. Water came and I asked a bus boy for coffee and he gave me a signal for \"just a minute\". He didn't return and a server hadn't arrived although tables seated after us were being served, so after waiting 15 minutes I went back to the hostess and told her we hadn't had a server yet. She promptly went behind the bar and got one of the women working there to come out to us.  We placed our food order and I asked for coffee. She said she'd be right back with that.  After waiting several more minutes with no coffee I took our cups and walked up to the coffee station at the bar. Seeing me do this, our server rushed up to me and said she'd take care of it and es courted me back to the table. Delicious coffee!  We both finished our cup and I began looking for a refill. During this now 30 minutes that we've been at our table, we've been watching the to-go boxes placed on the window sill between the indoor and outdoor space blow off the sill into the high chair seats with the bus people swirling by picking them out of the seats (think babies in diapers in those seats) and putting them back on the counter. Finally a big gust of wind blows them onto the floor. A good natured bus boy makes a comment about them, gathers them up from the floor and puts them back on the counter to be used. After 45 minutes at the table with still only one cup of coffee our food comes out and it is delicious. The server says he'll be right back with our side of pancakes.  Coffee finally came round again.  It was another 10 minutes before the side of pancakes come out. I spread the room temperate whipped butter on the pancakes and they were completely cold and the butter didn't melt. Oh well. I really didn't need them. We flagged our server down for our bill and gave her our two credit cards. She comes back to the table and informs us that both of our cards had been declined. We had her try again and guess what?  They worked.    The manager came around once while we had been waiting and asked how things were. I was telling her about the service when a gust of wind came in throwing the to-go boxes and she got distracted by the commotion and lost her attention and didn't turn back to us.   While the food was good, the service was so disorganized that we did not have a good experience.  They need some training!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great breakfast and outstanding staff, check out Eggstasy. Highly recommend the omelette and fresh squeezed orange juice. Will definitely be back here next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We went there on Father's Day and although it was busy, there were always open seats inside and the patio was less than half full. We sat at the bar and you'd have thought we were invisible. Nobody cleared the places next to us for 35 minutes and nobody said a word to us for 15 minutes until we finally flagged one of the many workers down. This is not an exaggeration, many people walked by us but nobody made eye contact, or said a word.  We've eaten at many many restaurants in Scottsdale and their service was by far the worst I've ever seen.  Save your time, money, and energy and go someplace else. Obviously they are poorly managed and have no idea how to handle a crowd (and again, not that crowded based on the open tables that they couldn't fill). If customers are important in the restaurant business and you don't pay any attention to your customers, you deserve to fail.  I'd have given them a zero but the lowest I could give them was a one. An extreme disappointment!"}
{"text":"This brunch place has it all.  The menu us extensive with specialty and traditional breakfast, brunch and lunch.  It's bright and cheery inside and everything is delicious.  The only drawback is that it is loud inside and hard to hear any conversation even while ordering."}
{"text":"Eggstasy didn't live up to the expectations I had from yelp reviews. Sat at the bar, the bartender seemed to be flustered and had zero customer service skills. I believe her name was Alexandra? She never checked in on us and when we asked for our side of toast she told us, \"she will try\" & that \"it's just toast\". I completely understand you have zero control of what's going on around you but you can control how you handle the situation. Plenty of competition in the valley; I'd rather give my money to a company that values service while delivering excellent food."}
{"text":"Had great server today, but worst food.  Patty melt sent back as it came out raw.  They literally scraped off the melted cheese, cooked the same patty and half assed it all back together AND threw it on same plate on top of ketchup on the plate.  Came back to the table like an insult.  Owner made excuses and frankly made things up.  Not the first time here -first time back in a while so thought maybe they got better -but it's worse."}
{"text":"Have been here several time and on my last visit it was as good and consistent as my first time.  First, kudos for having fresh squeezed orange juice, not to many places take the time and this one does.  So Fiancee had the crepes and I had the crab and cheddar omelette.  We did share as the crepes where huge!   The crepes had ham, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  Very impressed, the crepe was perfectly done and beautifully presented.  There was the right amount of balance between the eggs, spinach, mushrooms and cheese.   Did I mention the portions size was huge??  Not kidding as we took a whole one home and I have a good sized appetite.   The omelette contained crab, cheddar cheese and had ritz crackers on top.  Couldn't understand the ritz cracker thing until I started eating.  Fluffy eggs cooked perfect with a rich cheddar throughout with a good size helping of crab.  Now this is where the Ritz crackers come in- as rich as the components are, the crackers provided just the right balance and saltiness to the dish.  Who would have thought.  At this point, anything you could have done to the hash browns or pancakes that came with the omelette wouldn't have mattered, but hash browns cooked perfectly and the pancakes I was again impressed.  Light, almost buttermilk but something different and by different I meant delicious.    Service prompt and polite.  Remember to come early or late on weekends as there sometimes is  a small wait  Overall, a great breakfast with a great atmosphere.  Probably my favorite place in AZ so far."}
{"text":"Just returned from early brunch....I know we made a mistake by going on Mother's day, but still....2 out of 4 of us have sick stomachs!  One of us is going on the plane....Not so good.  We are locals, and would never return....Why would we? The smoked salmon was like eating a salt bar, the hollandaise sauce on the benedicts was yellow goop, that  was kind of thick yellow tasteless stuff. I forgot to mention the cheap quality of the tough english muffins...POOR!  Pancakes were large and dried out.  Would we go back.  Heck no.  Right down the street there was an hour and a half wait at a breakfast place, so we went here.  Big mistake.  So everyone tells us they have large portions.  We prefer quality to quantity.  Did I mention the server who almost made us depressed because she was so unhappy!  Poor service, hard to get a refill, or return the salmon Benedict....Couldn't get extra splenda. Thumbs down all the way.  Good food ain't cheap and cheap food ain't good!  If you know and really like quality food, this is not the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful yet the food was mediocre. We left there and we were very unhappy! The food took forever to come out (being with two young kids was not fun with the long wait), our bill came out to $80 with tip ( 2 kids and 2 adults). The omlete was over cooked and didn't taste good at all (don't remember what the name was but it had a balsamic glaze on it). Never again coming her again!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place zero starts if I could. The service was slower than a slug in molasses. I waited thirty minutes before my orange juice came out, they must have ran to Florida and back to pick the best one....they forgot parts of our orders, they brought us the wrong food, and they put extra items on our receipt. Needless to say, I'm not going back. I've been there three times too many. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent huge portioned plates amazing place it's loud which is rest for me because I have kids"}
{"text":"The noise level is terrible.. The restaurant was practically empty just couldn't figure out why it was so loud. I had the mango lime crepe it was alright but too much hard mango it need something more than that in the crepe.. It was still alright.. But I wish I gad something else. My aunt had eggs Benedict and we had to ask for more sauce.. But she said she like them. My friend had plain buttermilk pancakes.. Said they were good. Service was excellent. I liked want I saw on the menu so I will try them out again."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast restaurant I've ever been too! Great menu and everything looks delicious! Must stop place if you are visiting or passing through Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. It looked so cool and had a neat menu. I didn't mind the 30 minute wait for my table, but... First of all the place was absolutely chaotic! Servers, food runners and bussers running into each other. I watched a table get wiped down 3 times by 3 different people with a dirty cloth that smelled like a school cafeteria. There seemed to be no communication with each other bc everyone seemed confused. I ordered a juice which took longer than it should bc they have one juice area and it was crowded with servers.  Now for what I really minded... My food took about 35 minutes to come out and when it did, it was all wrong and tasted terrible. Hash browns are made in house but even after ordering them crispy, they came out wet and undercooked in the center. The only thing crispy was the outside. My eggs were ordered over medium but came out so undercooked. Just white slime on top. The sausage links are butterflied and you get 2 links instead of 3 like every other breakfast place. They obviously slice them so it looks like more. I didnt really mind that bc I can never finish 3, but I didn't like the taste. My English muffin was thick and doughy, not toasted. DISASTER! I just sent it back and asked for a pancake after they offered me something else. It never came... It was a complete waste of an hour and a half that I could have had for holiday shopping!  The 2 stars are for the really nice hostesses up front"}
{"text":"When we walked in for brunch on Saturday, our group of 7 was seated at a table right next to the bathroom hallway. The bathrooms smelled VERY strongly of sewer and urinal cleaner. We requested a move, and the hostess actually AGREED with us that it smelled bad...  When we moved, it took us a long time to have anyone come over to take our orders. My wine glass was chipped, and each of our mimosas came in different sized glasses leading us to wonder if we were drinking the same thing- or not.  We ordered the ham, asparagus and gruyere crepes- which were awful. The ham was diced up very small, it just fell out of the crepe, and there was no filling inside the crepes- just on top- also SMOTHERED in sauce. We also ordered the burger- which was really good. (not enough to redeem the restaurant). The only reason this review has 1 star is because of that burger.  The service was terrible. It was completely dead for a Saturday during a holiday weekend, and our server forgot our toppings for our burger (avocado, mustard, ketchup), and by the time she brought them over everything was cold. When it came time to pay our bill- our server had disappeared, and we were left with our plates in front of us (no one ever came to clear them).   All in all- one of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever had. We were visiting from out of town (we are from Dallas), and our friends were bummed because they said it was like night and day- they had come to Eggstasy before with a MUCH different experience. Hopefully this review helps them to take a look at their food and their service."}
{"text":"We try to get here at least once a month, my daughter was in town from Los Angeles and she had never been. She was totally impressed and sees why we try to come often. Their portions a large so keep that in mind when ordering. Our favorites are the eggs Benedict, French toast and you have to try the orange juice, best in the valley."}
{"text":"After wasting about 30 minutes at this place, I don't even want to dignify it by spending much more of my time on a review. Call ahead for inside seating was useless. Outside patio was filthy and uncomfortable. 5-10 minutes before a server even stopped by. Coffee takes another 5 and comes without cream. Takes another 5 for the server to come back by and another 5 to get the cream. By that time the coffee is cold. No talk of specials or of taking an order. Meanwhile, servers / runners are dropping food around us, coughing on food and generally looking sluggish, unmotivated and confused. Half of the customers around us are complaining about not getting their food. Others are sending food back to the kitchen. Went across the street to US Egg and had a reliable meal with good service and ambiance. Caveat emptor people!"}
{"text":"Our friends introduced us to this place.  I want to go back again!  We had brunch outside in the sun. It was a beautiful day.  The menu was huge - had a hard time choosing - so many amazing options!  I ordered the crepes - which were fabulous. Others had eggs and french toast - which were excellent.  The portions were indeed huge.  I took home the rest of my crepes and enjoyed them the next day.  Service was great too."}
{"text":"Delicious food, enormous portions and great service!  However 83/84 temperature will keep anyone away..... Please fix!"}
{"text":"Their menu looked amazing and I've been wanting to try here forever. Sadly I never got to today. We got there around 12:15 and the host said 20-25 minutes. I noticed various groups of different sizes being called, all that were way after us, and checked twice to make sure we hadn't been called after waiting 45 minutes... After an hour we just left as we were so hungry. Granted it was Sunday around noon, it was still ridiculous with being told a timeframe 1/3 of what we were waiting and the host would only say to me \"I don't think we called you\" any time I asked about wanting to check and seeing how long it'd be. I give him slack because it was so busy but it sucked waiting an hour and then just leaving."}
{"text":"Me and my home girl went there yesterday and had  a decent breakfast.  I will say that the patio looks great and I would return just to hang out on it.  The food was good.  Brown eggs... need to up there game here.  But the pancakes were good.  Training server made a mistake and gave my vegan friend salmon instead of avocado but they corrected and it was ok.  Took off a coffee for the mistake.  The menu is huge.... Too huge if you ask me but it was a good experience."}
{"text":"In my opinion eggstasy is the best breakfast restaurant in Phx. The menu is large and creative and the food is out of this world. The portion sizes are so generous that I'm usually stuffed for an entire day. The restaurant is very cool , very modern and LA-like. The waitstaff is also super friendly. Jared was my waiter. He was great! They have lavazza coffee (so good). Best breakfast in Phx - by far"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast at very reasonable prices!  The omelettes are awesome! So many choices, my son loves the pancakes, the selection is very intriguing? The fresh fruit kabobs that come with your meal are delicious. The lunch is just as delicious as the breakfast.  Best burger I've had in Scottsdale!- the Reuben is off the hook!!  It's a busy place, but if you go at off peak times you won't have to wait!"}
{"text":"When my family walked in, the atmosphere was great, all of the food looked great, they even had cucumber water and very creative menu ideas. However, when I ordered the buttermilk pancakes, about 10-15 minutes later comes pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream, and I just ordered basic pancakes. The pancakes tasted very bland, like they just made it with flour and water. Syrup didn't help, the food itself was poorly cooked, however everything else was great, but the food was such a put off."}
{"text":"Let me start with this... The vodka lemonade is so epic... After that I got the chicken skillet and it comes with a side of pancakes, so naturally I got the pancakes with Nutella and bananas... You literally can't go wrong. The bartender, Aaron, was super sociable and the staff is running around like crazy because it so busy (that's because the food is so good so expect a wait).  If you haven't tried this place yet, do yourself a favor and get to Scottsdale and Shea and try it. It blows Breakfast Club and Butterfield's out of the water and believe me when I say that, I'm a foodie!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat. The food is fantastic and the staff is always welcoming. The manager is very accommodating and makes sure that the guests are always happy! It can get busy on the weekends but is worth the wait:)"}
{"text":"With all the breakfast choices in the area I must admit that we stopped here for the name, but the place was amazing! Asked the waiter what he would recommend, and he told us the omelets were 6-egg. 6-egg omelet with hash browns and pancakes for $10? I thought it was a joke.  Food was fantastic, coffee was good, and wait staff was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. I wish I lived around here, because I'd be back very often."}
{"text":"Love the name! We have tried this place several times because we love the name. Unfortunately, the name is not enough. The service is terrible. If you like more then one glass of tea or a second cup of coffee do not eat here. Each visit has been the same no refills unless you chase them down and beg for another cup. The food is adequate not worth the bad service. The hostess walks around with her cell phone in hand and decides to help expedite food with her long red hair hanging in the food. My advice is there are too many good breakfast places don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Had brunch here last weekend there was a weight but they took us to our table sooner than expected. The server was great the food was delicious especially the prices for how much food you get! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall a disappointing experience.  The restaurant is very trendy looking.  It seems like it should be in LA.  The menu is filled with intriguing options and interesting choices for those who like to not eat a boring breakfast.  The meal started out with rancid \"fresh\" pressed apple juice for my son...obviously not so fresh.  A second stab at it returned another slightly less rancid tasting juice.  At that time I just said forget about it.  My wife and I had bloody marys, described to us as the best you'll have.  They came with a piece of chocolate covered bacon and a useless skewered garnish of 1/2\" thick green and red bell pepper rounds and 1 green olive.  No matter how much I stirred I couldn't get any flavor out of the bloody mary, I even added more salt and it was tough to get \"the best bloddy mary ever\" out of it.  My wife only took about 3 sips.  We ordered our breakfast.  To my surprise the waitress came back a third time and brought me apple juice that was not rancid and was quite delicious.  The savory food was overwhelmingly underseasoned with the exception of the prociutto benedict, which was so salty it was difficult to stomach.  I had the crab dip omlete and again, no flavor, the cheese was only in the the very very center and not throughout the omlete.  We added a cheesecake pumpkin pancake and it was OK.  The pancake was moist and yummy, the sauce could have been a little richer (It tasted like a loose cream cheese frosting).  Finally the banana nutella crepe was very good, but it would be extremely difficult to mess that up.  The waitress was attentive to our needs until the end when we needed to pay, then she couldn't be found.  Our card was sitting in the checkbook, upright, for 10 minutes.  The prices are very high for a breakfast establishment.  The tasteless bloody mary will set you back $10, because you are paying for chocolate bacon and bell pepper that do not compliment a bloody mary.  The icing on the cake for me was being charged $5.50 for the apple juice after being served not one, but two rancid apple juices.  I've been in food and beverage nearly my whole life and I would never charge a guest after screwing something up twice.  I'm not saying that they may not shine, but for the price I would expect nothing short of spectacular and that is not what my family received on August 29, 2015."}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends this past weekend. Food was good but service was lousy. Not even crowded and we had to repeatedly ask for stuff. Looks like a bunch of high school wait staff who are not very professional. However, the food is really good and plentiful."}
{"text":"Updating my review and removing a star for cleanliness. The place needs a good cleaning. Best breakfast menu I have ever seen. Food was wonderful and the service was great. Make sure you add bacon to your entree.  Portions are huge so come hungry. Restaurant is noisy inside do weather permitting, have a seat outside."}
{"text":"So i've been to Eggstasy three times and there are a few things that have been pretty consistent in terms of pros and cons.  Pros:  Really unique menu options and the food is really good. The staff is also very friendly.  Cons: It's really, REALLY loud in there!  I feel like I'm in a middle school cafeteria.  It doesn't help that they play club music which just makes people talk louder. The service can be really slow. I've either had to wait to have my order taken or wait to cash out.   They tend to mess up the order. The first time I was there I got the wrong pancakes. The second time I was there my omelet was wrong. I was there today and although I ordered the banana crepes, I got the french toast.  I can only assume they screw up the order because they can't hear me correctly since it's so LOUD!! They also tend to do a hit and run when dropping off the food. Not once in the three times I was there did the runner ask if I needed anything. As a result, I had to flag down or wait for the server to get ketchup, extra napkins or anything else for that matter.  Overall, if you want good eclectic food options give it a try; just be prepared to shout and get a slightly different version of what you ordered."}
{"text":"This establishment serves typical breakfast/brunch standards such as fluffy pancakes, thick cut bacon, and omelets large enough for two meals. I appreciate the fact that they offer fresh fruit skewers as an alternative to the usual starch staples that accompany your main entrée. Food quality is good, service is very friendly, location is convenient with ample parking behind the building (where the entrance is). The bright interior has cool, contemporary décor but seating is a tad crowded and I found the background music to be a tad loud."}
{"text":"Another AMAZING dining experience! Every time huge portions, great service and feels like you're in Newport Beach!!!!  A \"GEM\" for Scottsdale, AZ!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted a fun brunch for my birthday. We had a good experience at this restaurant for breakfast in the past. Today was not a fun brunch or good experience. The waitress was nice but not very attentive. The coffee had a burnt taste and the meals were delivered cold. We had my wife's pancakes redone, but they were delivered cold. I don't understand how that happened because it was very quick. My pancakes were a mess. I ordered the cinnamon toast pancakes and they came out drenched in this gooey sauce. They were not hot either. I attempted to get the managers attention but she was too busy to acknowledge me. Oh well, there are a number of breakfast restaurants in the area to try. I'm sorry that I had such a bad experience especially on my birthday."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Our waitress Kayla was so personable and gave us the ins and outs of the menu, what's the best deal, and her personal favorites! We actually ordered way too much food but it was amazing! Keep in mind the portions are pretty decently sized. We ordered the Greek skillet with a side of bacon banana crepes, and the Barbacoa omelet with a side of pumpkin cheesecake pancakes! The sides are full portions yall haha we also got a mimosas and booze iced coffee... their bar tender is a little new so if you're trying to get wrecked on a Wednesday shes got you covered haha"}
{"text":"Food was great, Pumpkin cheesecake pancakes especially! I want to go back for the red velvet ones! Service was terrible. Took 30 mins for my drink to come and the food took a while as well. Server barely stopped by. Need to work on that but I will try again."}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times and love the food! It's super close and their hours are convenient. They are always very busy! Expect a 20-40 min wait when you come here! As far as service, I've had everything from the waiter crying and throwing the credit card holder to amazing attentive service. They are definitely not organized but the food makes up for it! I've loved everything I've tried so far, crepes are my favorite!   On several occasions we have had Erin as our waiter and he is very good. If you're lucky enough to get him, you're in good hands! Very attentive in a sincere type of way.   I would love for this place to have a better dress code for the women, they tend to wear club-wear and it's just not appropriate for a breakfast place. Also one of the managers or owners mom wears her nightgown there and it's a bit odd!  I recommend maybe a shirt with your name or logo and some jeans! Simple"}
{"text":"I have tried the Eggstasy on Shea and had a fairly positive experience so I thought I would go back. This time around was a different story. I ordered the brioche french toast and it turned out to be a mess. The bread must have been quickly dipped in an egg mixture as it was barely soaked through and it was like I was eating a loaf of bread and syrup. Not at all french toast. On top of that, it was overcooked and the bottom of the toast was completely burnt. I didn't immediately notice until flipping it over. There are better places."}
{"text":"Came here this morning for breakfast/lunch. They just opened this week so we will call this review \"constructive criticism.\" First off the decor is really nice and clean but yet the staff does match the decor. They all looked VERY sloppy, maybe being new they haven't implemented attire yet? Or a shower for that matter? Sorry they all looked greasy and gross. Service was over the top, almost to much. Couldn't take a full bite without someone interrupting making sure we were okay. Once or twice is good but not every second. Also I like restaurants where you can see the kitchen so I can see the food being prepared, except in this case we were directly facing the kitchen and one guy kept using his hand to wipe his forehead and then was handling the food! Ugh gross!! One out of the 3 chefs touching food was wearing gloves, that reallllllllly bothers me! Gloves should be worn at all times no excuse! Now  to the food, soup was awesome, fries are awesome, but both sandwiches we ordered weren't great. One was the Reuben and we asked what sauce came with it and were told none, then half way through the sandwich we were brought what was suppose to be thousand island and it tasted more like vinegar horseradish. Also the corned beef was not good. Can't remember the name of the other sandwich but couldn't get through that one either. All in all if they clean up in the kitchen (wearing gloves, and not using hands to wipe sweat) I would try this place again seeing the other reviews are good. Gave 3 stars because their new, otherwise would have been 1 or 2."}
{"text":"This restaurant was extremely cute and had a very large menu with lots of varieties from French toast and pancakes to healthy and breakfasts. I had the capris he eggs Benedict and it was to die for. The service was OK, our waitress rushed us out a little bit but it didn't hinder my experience enough to return. The food was phenomenal and very large portion sizes. I would consider splitting a meal next time due to the size and only being able to finish half of it. Overall a great experience and a delicious breakfast"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Scottsdale to visit my mother in law for the holidays. Today we came for brunch. I adored my waitress. Her septum ring was so cute and she was patient with me when I wanted something custom done. ANYWAYS. You have a hostess who is BEYOND RUDE and snotty. Every time my mother in law has made reservations with HER specifically she has said once they got there that they didn't have any. My mother in law is VERY meticulous and organized so I know she made the reservations. Also this is her second time in a row this little girl has done this to her so she made sure she made them. When my mother in law approached her about it she just said \"okay\" and brushed her off. She sounded like one of those valley girls. Other than that the staff was okay. Our waitress specifically was amazing. Get rid of the snotty little 15 year old and maybe we'd come back. Also I deducted a star for each time she has treated my mother in law like shit. So keep it up valley girl."}
{"text":"Good food. But the worst service I've ever had in my life.   Saw the waiter once the whole time. Orders were wrong and had to be sent back but since we never saw the waiter we had to physically walk our plates over to the grill to have them fixed. Their iced tea was just colored water and was never brought Splenda even though I asked four different waiters.   It's sad because the food was good but definitely never coming back. And would advise anyone to avoid the headache."}
{"text":"Cane here for brunch with my girlfriends to celebrate all of our bdays. It was a cute brunch place. I ordered the chilaquiles and it was good. I liked the salsa. However the menu did not say it had onions and I asked before placing the order if there was onions. The server said \" I'm not sure it's only my second day working here but if it's not on the menu it doesn't have it.\" Okay... rude.. One of my gfs ordered an omelette and fruit. She said The omelette was dry and the fruits and the lettuce under the fruit was wilted. Definitely not fresh. The strawberry mimosas are great! definitely something I would come back for IF I decide to ever come back."}
{"text":"Usually we frequent Butterfields - but thought we'd switch it up since we drive by it everyday and the name is cute! So glad we did!   Omlette and hash browns were to die for. Sriracha/ chulula and ranch were also on hand which is a huge plus!   Junior was our waiter and he was awesome!!!! Never short on drinks and extremely helpful. The hostess with long dark hair was a doll!  Such a great experience and the manager also let us try the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. Oh my goshhhh - it was love."}
{"text":"Went today at noon for Sunday brunch.  Service was terrible--never asked if we wanted a beverage, no silverware and napkins--even after the food was finally delivered.  Had to ask two people for silverware before we got any ( a trip to the front desk to request it after the person who delivered the food never brought it back after our initial request).  Was told they were understaffed--  It's too bad the service was so bad as the food is quite good.  Won't be visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable breakfast! Sarah is an incredible server, and has such great food suggestions. I had the Gypsy Steak Skillet which was to die for and my boyfriend had the Smoked Salmon Omelet with a yummy Mascarpone sauce. The water is infused with Cucumbers, they do have regular water too if you don't want anything infused. We didn't have any juices, but they do have fresh squeezed juice available. The little 3 year old behind us squealed in excitement as his fresh orange juice was being made. The coffee is Lavazza and is delicious! Sarah even brought us some to take with us on our trip back home to Santa Fe, NM. I'm definitely bringing my little girl back to eat here to try the Mickey Mouse pancakes! Super glad our friends recommended this to us, we'll recommend it to everyone else!"}
{"text":"Visit was on a Sunday morning around 9:00 parking was not an issue, there were a few parties in the waiting area but the other half of our group was seated so no wait time.   The menu is extensive and both lunch and breakfast were available.  I had the plain crepes which came with 3 and if rolled out each one would almost cover the plate, I wasn't able to eat all three and while this dish did not come with sides it was fairly priced and I couldn't have eaten anything else anyways, the iced tea was great and only required a minimal amount of sweetener as it already had a great taste.  Others in the party ordered standard breakfast fare which came in large portions and was reviewed as above par.  Minus a star as the server while efficient could have been a little more hospitable, she only checked in on us once but the server in training / assistant made up for it and checked in several times."}
{"text":"Sure feels like I've been getting to know the area around Scottsdale Road & Shea Boulevard pretty well of late.  D'Lite, Butterfield's, Hop Doddy, and Zak's Chocolate are a few of my more recent discoveries in this neighborhood.  Now you can add Eggstasy, a breakfast concept spot I'd bookmarked a few months ago.  Empty fridge on a Sunday before the groceries stores were open meant I was in search of a good breakfast to start the day.  Thankfully Eggstasy opens its doors at 6:30am daily.  Let's eat.  You'll find Eggstacy in the Agua Caliente center on the north side of 69th Street & Shea.  Enter through the archway, then turn right into the shopping center where you'll find Eggstacy set near the southeast corner.  I came right at opening on Sunday and grabbed a table next to the kitchen.  Chicago transplant Peter Verros is the man behind this large open air breakfast and lunch spot, which he originally opened in Chicago before deciding to pack up shop and instead move his operation to Scottsdale.  His Scottsdale restaurant can seat at least 200 or more at a time including the patio.  But even the interior restaurant is open to the elements as the bar area is setup in a wide open indoor/outdoor fashion.  The morning was perfect outside so no worries today, though I do wonder how they mitigate the summer heat.  Anyways, onto the food.  The menu is quite vast and contains most of your breakfast standards.  Egg dishes (obviously), pancakes, french toast dishes, skillets, waffles, benedicts, and even some crepes.  And this being Scottsdale you'll also find a large array of healthier as well as some gourmet breakfast items from something called a skinny B***h to a wild smoked salmon dish.  The dish I wanted was the first one listed on the menu.  The Eggasm is listed as an appetizer but for $9 I fully expected something pretty filling.  The description read like a sandwich but I couldn't find any Yelp photos to confirm that so I ordered this in the blind.  I also ordered perhaps their most unique side offering, their chorizo cheddar grits.  Add some fresh squeezed OJ to wash it down and I was ready to go.  The Eggasm was nothing like I pictured.  Instead of a sandwich, it came as a plate full of toasted ciabatta bread topped with specs of prosciutto, chives, and shaved parmesan cheese.  Then at the other end of the plate was a jar full of coddled eggs and potato puree, in a form soft enough to act as a spread for the ciabatta bread.  Basically just grab small spoonfuls of the egg/potato jar mix and throw it on the ciabatta and munch away.  While not what I was expecting, it was truly delicious.  The prosciutto and parmesan cheese helped elevate the flavor profile beautifully while the bread gave it the crunchy texture.  A very pleasant surprise dish I never saw coming.  The grits were also tasty, albeit a little heavy and the portion size of the side is probably meant to be shared by two.  I mixed in a little of the grits with the Eggasm at times and the two dishes really work well together.  My only big disappointment was the OJ honestly.  Fresh squeezed is fine and a little pulp is okay by me, but honestly Eggstasy's OJ was chalked full of pulp.  For others, this may not be hangup.  But for me I don't want pulp unless I'm just eating an orange straight.  When it comes to juice, I'd greatly appreciate some of that pulp strained out.  Total cost for the food, OJ, tax and tip came to about $25.  Service was friendly and prompt (I was one of the few early risers on Sunday so I suppose that was a given), and the food items I chose were a nice twist on the usual breakfast fare.  The restaurant itself is an ideal space for breakfast and lunch during the cooler months in the valley and the bar area in particular provides some great people watching vantage points.  As I write this they'll soon be opening a second location just east of here on Shea & Via Linda.  I came for Eggstasy and ended up having an Eggasm.  The puns here quite literally write themselves."}
{"text":"Ehh, good but butterfields down the road is a much better option.. still worth the trip"}
{"text":"This place is down right awful. Originally I wanted to go to butters and take my daughter out for breakfast. The wait at butters was very long, probably because the food is amazing, so I settled for Eggstasy. When the coffee arrived in was cold and I had to ask for cream multiple times. I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my daughter ordered the avocado Benedict, the eggs were not only over cooked but resembled a piece of six month old gum you would find on the bottom of your shoe, simply disgusting. I informed my server of this and she put in an order for new poached eggs. The new eggs were delivered by the manager, a lifeless woman who seemed to be in an awful mood. She dropped the eggs off and left. Supposedly her daughter was sick and her day was not going great, newsflash, if your kid is sick take her home and figure it out. As I ventured into my eggs I saw not one but several fragments of shell. How the hell do you not see the shells when you poach the eggs, do you have eyes. The fruit was sour and shriveled, the coffee was cold and bitter, the hash browns were undercooked and lacked seasoning and crispness. I will never come back and I advise you, if you want good breakfast in Scottsdale do not eat here!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here on Easter. The food was fantastic. The bacon was thick, crispy deliciousness. Three of us each ordered a different scramble. Another order a quinoa bowl and the iced coffee which is real good. It's a bit pricey for breakfast, but it's unique enough place that they can get away with it, I suppose. We sat outside, because inside was very loud and we had the baby with us. It was nice but when the sun came out it got HOT. The booths make you sweat and your legs and back stick to the seats. They have umbrellas that don't cover enough and no misters or fans, so I'm not sure how they manage during the summer. I will definitely go back. It's a great place to take out of town visitors."}
{"text":"We arrived and there was no line, still waited 5 minutes to be seated. Once seated we sat there for 15 minutes without having wait staff come to the table to take drinks or orders. After seeing three tables sat and attended to we decided it was enough and left. Extremely disorganized and poorly managed. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Seriously the most sinful place to go. Even church won't forgive the sins when you order their Nutella French toast. First off it was the biggest serving I've ever seen. It came with a to go box right away. It was prepared beautifully and I didn't look up from my plate once until I was done. Gasping for air I had to throw in the towel. Amazing."}
{"text":"We have been to Eggstacy a few times and have always loved it.  The food is amazing--fresh and well-prepared, with large portions.   Our server Shea was the best.  Here's a hint--order the multi-grain toast with your breakfast  It's delicious."}
{"text":"Brand new breakfast and lunch place.  Excellent food, huge portions and if I could give them more than 5 stars for service, I would.  Management kept checking to see if everyh thing was OK and kept our drinks full.  A great addition to the Scottsdale restaurant scene."}
{"text":"I just left Eggstasy, with such extreme disappointment.  We took first available, so we were seated on the patio.  It was a beautiful day, so no complaint.  But it went downhill from there.  It took 20 minutes to get water after asking twice.  Got water, took drink and food order.  Water had fruit flies in it.  Not just in my glass, but in the water carafe.  I would have told someone, but there was nobody to tell.  Never got refills on drinks, food came out one at a time.  My husband's omlette, then, my salad, then my grandson's crepes and my husband's side of pancake.    What was suppose to come out warm was cold and what suppose to be chilled was warm and wilted.  The pancakes could have been used as a flying saucers.  It was so thick and dense, it clunked on the plate.  Very, very disappointing.  A party of six got up and left after asking for a waiter three times."}
{"text":"A great place to with lots of options. My favorite was the banana and macadamia pancakes. Great service too!"}
{"text":"This place is the WORST!  The service is terrible!!! The owner, an old man, who needs to remember he is in the SERVICE industry. He has NO issue yelling at staff in front of customers. It makes it very uncomfortable...my daughter actually asked why he was being so rude! The food was nothing special. My wife had the sun-dried tomato, goat cheese & pine nuts omelette, pretty Plain Jane. I had the same problem with the asparagus, ham & gruyere crepes. I'm sure he is just using a Swiss cheese and not a true gruyere. This is the type of guy who seems more worried about prices than quality. My daughter did enjoy her chocolate chip pancakes.  I saw the menu online and thought this place might be a delicious change. It was not. Again, I'm sure that quality is 2nd behind price when this guy does his food buying! We won't be back. We will be going across the street to the U.S. Egg. They at least have an attentive wait staff and FRIENDLY owners!!!"}
{"text":"Ok #oinkcafe, take some notes from EGGstasy on the prosciutto benedicts and brûlée white chocolate raspberry pancakes omg! Anyone coming to Phoenix MUST stop here. Do a \"bene with a half order side\" (that way you still get the side with $2 off same as with the eggs/omelettes).  We added avocado to ours, truly amazing! The pancakes don't even need anything extra- they're amazingly better or equal to the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes which have always been our fav.  Thank you #EGGstasy you're our fav breakfast place in town and we love you so much!  The chefs are so friendly and they're passionate about their food- coming back to try the Dutch apple brioche French toast and protein pancakes made from natural protein starches- NOT a protein powder.  Crazy awesome!"}
{"text":"We met friends for Sunday brunch and thankfully they had made a reservation because the place was hopping. The decor and atmosphere was inviting, so I was looking forward to the meal. Sadly, it turned out to be an awful experience! The service was slow and the guy waiting our table seemed to be annoyed that he was even working that day. He barely cracked a smile. The service was slow! It took 15 minutes after being seated to get water and an hour to get our food.   The glowing recommendations may be from people who do not go on the weekend. The staff here need training! Smile, check on your tables, apologize for slow service, something to show there is a caring human being behind the mask.   The food was adequate, but not good enough to compensate for the unpleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Loved the environment and the strawberry orange juice which was freshly pressed. We sat outside and we felt like we were important celebrities having brunch in L.A. I can't say I was impressed with the food, but I tend to be a very picky eater. I would go back for the environment and the juice. The food, to me, was basic. Nothing extraordinary or special. However, if you're a brunch person, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My poor mom and sister fell forward on the table due to the couch leg falling apart. Several couches had broken legs. The server said the couches didn't survive power washing the day before."}
{"text":"Cool and good place for breakfast. Gets busy on weekends about 930am so go early if you don't want to wait. Menu is quite extensive with different flavors. Mascarpone cheese and Caramelized pears in an omelet? Who'd a thought? Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great selection on the menu.  You may dine inside or out.  Service was great.  Chick's in the Blanket was excellent.  Bloody Mary's were delicious.   We will be going back."}
{"text":"For just opening, this place is outstanding! What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood; I can't wait to go back. The chocolate covered bacon and the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes were to die for! If you are in the neighborhood, I highly recommend stopping in for some delicious breakfast and/or lunch. I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu items. If it's as good as the first time around, this may be my new favorite spot. Oh, and if you appreciate fresh squeezed juice - you will love theirs! Great service, great ambiance and great food!"}
{"text":"Yummy and big breakfast. The servers are so nice and energetic. I love the ambience and how the menu look like. I just wish they serve until 3pm"}
{"text":"Yummy!! What a modern brunch joint, gets super loud but the food is outstanding! In Love with the quinoa porridge mmmmm. The omelettes are great Even the skinny bi:$ch is delicious!  Sitting at the bar is a little weird you can see the mess and clutter of cups but I don't sit there often so who cares?!   Reasonable prices and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for a while. Got there around 9:30 and were seated immediately. That was nice, considering we usually have to wait 30-45 minutes at other places. I ordered the gypsy skillet and my daughters order French toast with bacon and a scramble with mushrooms bacon cheese and avocado. The later was a special order bc they didn't have exactly what my daughter wanted. They had no problem accommodating us. Very nice. Once we ordered we started to wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. The food took a long time to come out. Another two tables got their food before us even though we had ordered first. When our food finally came, thank goodness, it was yummy. The gypsy skillet is delicious and the skirt steak is tender and cook perfectly. Both my daughters were happy with their food also. So even though we waited a long time for our food, it ended being good. We will try this place again. I am giving it three stars because of the long wait for our food."}
{"text":"Truly EGGceptional!  If you want your cake and eat it too (aka large portions without compromising one smidge of quality and deliciousness) (Ummm, of course you do!), then mosey on down to Eggstacy.  Many wonderful breakfast standards including just as many proprietary creations.  Speaking of which, just reading the menu alone becomes an exciting experience simply to learn of seemingly endless, delectable ideas your remaining brain cells have not ever contemplated.    Oh, and for those of you who focus calorie consumption... what you too have here is yet another form of having your cake and eat it to.  Quite a large healthy conscious selection that is surprisingly sizable, delicious and also... creative!    Move over Matt's Big Breakfast.  Your days are over easy."}
{"text":"Visited the Scottsdale location, and it was airy, bright and inviting. The coffee was delicious! Service was attentive and fast. Food was fresh, but keep in mind, whether you order one of the \"healthier\" options or a regular menu item, the portions are giant."}
{"text":"So delicious.. I just went for the first time with my girlfriends today. Fun environment and great wait service. The menu was extensive and the food was amazing. Love all the healthy options. Great for kids too."}
{"text":"One of my fave breakfast/brunch spots in the Valley! The Red Velvet French Toast was a religious experience. The wait time can be lengthy on a weekend but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I really like this joint, with HUGE portions and a really interesting menu....something for everyone. I had a proper eggs Benedict and my date had corned beef hash and eggs....the hash browns are delishooooo and the bread is extra special, certainly from a local bakery and thickly sliced. We had to try the grits and they were really good...cheesy and chorizo, but we could not eat them all. Split them if you have 4 people. Reason for 4 stars? Dirty coffee cup, fork, and glass. Nice bright new place with dirty dishes?!?!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Seriously amazing choices for breakfast! My hubby and I went last Saturday and sat at the bar. The other reviews are right about the service being a bit spotty at the bar, but we weren't in any rush.   We ordered lattes and they were small, but the amount of food you get makes up for that! We had the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes as a side, salmon omelette and portobello Benedict. Oh yeah.....and a side of chocolate covered bacon. Needless to say, I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day hahaha.   Aside from ordering WAY too much food, it was all excellent! When I go again, I will try all new items since there were so many amazing options. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Meh. Disappointing service, slow and incorrect orders for two of us. Omelet was too runny. Horrible organic soft drinks that we are still wondering who approved release of the gross concoctions from the lab! Stick to the cucumber water. The other choices are $5 OJ or mimosas. To be fair, the pancakes were good. This place has potential with the cool decor and great location. Sad it didn't come through."}
{"text":"Natalie made the restaurant! She made my experience memorable and she really took on the menu as her own. She gave great suggestions and was so helpful when we had any questions. I will definitely be back because of her! Thanks Natalie"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in Eggstasy. I've been here a dozen times or so. My husband and I love to go out to breakfast and Eggstasy was in our regular rotation.   Our last visit we went right after our workout. The food is good, portions are large and they have excellent coffee (my demise).  However, on this day, we sat at the bar. The bartender refilled my iced coffee with hot coffee and more ice. I took a sip and the bottom of the glass blew out. A FULL cup of warm coffee spilled all over my pants and nikes. The bartender throws me a fist full of napkins. As I continue cleaning myself off, the bartender moves our plates down a few spots so they could mop up the floor. She runs to the back to consult with the manager (i assume, although no one ever came out). When she comes back she asks if she can make me a fancy latte to make up for spilling coffee all over me, ok thanks.  After a brief sorry and a latte, we get the bill. They comped our coffees. So not only so I have drenched pants and Nikes that are stained and smell like coffee, I got $6 worth of free coffee. Super.   I was incredibly disappointed and baffled with how they handled this siuation. No apology from the manager. This just goes to show how much they value their customers. I will not likely be back.    Me and my coffee drenched Nikes will be at US Egg across the street."}
{"text":"I love this place! Can it be a bit loud. Yes, but everyone is so friendly. Good move having Joe making sure everyone is happy!  I love the Greek Huevous Rancheros and the Skinny Bitch.  The fresh orange juice and delicious coffee make your weekend so special.  It's my way to start the weekend . Please keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ok. So, the food is great. The portions are huge. Those are the only positives. It took 25 mins to get our order taken by a guy that seemed stoned. The food seemed to take a long time to come out, but I'm not sure when he actually put the order in. Be prepared to share food or box half of it up. My 4 yr old ordered the snores pancakes off the kids menu- it would be too much for 2 grown adults to eat. That's not bad because we brought it home. My toast arrived after I was done eating and right before the bill. The set up made it hard to talk while we were at the table. Everyone kept bumping into us. All in all, not a great visit."}
{"text":"Brent ( the guy with the white gages) is an awesome server :) we just came in for breakfast and had an amazing experience. The food was great and the portion were more than enough. I will definitely be back here the next time I am in Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"Start to finish: Arriving the place seemed PACKED. asked the hostess to put our name in  (4 people) and she said it was going to be 45 minutes. Walked around to the bar which was also packed and got some mimosas. Then we started looking around. All though the place seemed packed, only about  1/2 their tables were occupied. We soon found out the reason: owner and/or manager was this old mean lady who was incredibly rude to both customers and wait staff.  Finally a waiter snuck us into an empty table in his section after seeing us standing at the bar for 30 minutes. Manager/owner then proceeded to come over and yell at him in front of all the diners. Despite her actions the waiter held his ground and we were able to keep our table.  Our waiter was awesome! he totally took care of everything we wanted, kept our waters full, joked around with us about, gave us some great advice about where to visit, and talked us through the whole menu. He even brought a sample of the chocolate bacon for us to try! This is what we had: Bloddy Marry- Loved the veggies and chocolate cover bacon that came with this. However the mixer seemed a little thin and tasteless to me. All in all 4 stars Pumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes-Not enough Pumpkin flavor for us personally, but they were still great. Eat these fast! 4 stars Caprese Benedict-Egg was poached perfectly and the pesto tasted amazing. 5 stars Breakfast Burger-Fried leeks were amazing but the burger meat itself needed more flavoring. 5 stars Dutch Apple French Toast-Apples were cooked perfectly and the cinnamon butter was to die for. 5 stars Prosciutto & Chocolate Chip Waffles-Super yummy, but it was bacon not prosciutto served with it. 5 stars  All in all we will definitely be coming back here because of the food and the wait staff. Hopefully the manager/owner will start to understand she needs to work behind the scenes a bit more."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I hate breakfast food so it's never my favorite....my husband and I were starving so we headed here after reading reviews online. We waited about 15 min to get in and there was a lot of people waiting and even more staff onsite. The food and drinks did not disappoint!!! I can't wait to come back here. I did a create your own waffle meal along with the pomegranate punch (champagne and pomegranate) and it was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Well, where to begin... The food was ok. I would rate it a solid 3. However, that's not what prompted me to write this review. My girlfriend and I came here for Sunday brunch and were so uncomfortable that we had to box up our food and leave. The temperature inside was a steamy 87 degrees. We tried to get past it but that was an impossibility. We made the manager aware of our dissatisfaction and were told the owners control when the AC is turned off and on and they didn't think it was too hot yet. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Tasty Eggs Benedict! Orange juice is worth it, squeezed on site. The decor is beautiful.   One thing they should consider is a change of music. When we went (Saturday 11/22/14) it was techno. Nothing wrong with techno, unless you're enjoying a beautiful meal on a Saturday morning, sitting on a lovely patio or comfortable chairs inside. Seemed out of place and harsh. Also, almost too 'expected' in it's Scottsdale location.   The bathrooms are lovely, too."}
{"text":"This place is tied as my favorite breakfast place in the Valley...Morning Squeeze, Snooze and now Eggstasy!    Great atmosphere both inside and out, friendly service and an extensive menu of delicious food.  I tried the leek, goat cheese and chicken sausage crepes and absolutely loved them!  They don't skimp on the portion size either, so you better come hungry.     I will definitely be back to try some more tasty items from Eggstasy!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast for the first time this morning and wasn't too impressed. The service wasn't great, had to wait for a long time for my hot milk on the side and by the time I got it the coffee was cold. The hostess broke a coffee mug as she was trying to seat me and the bill was put on the table way before I even asked for it. The atmosphere is very cold and feels very chaotic. The food was ok I had a fruit crepe good portions but not much taste."}
{"text":"My family just finished eating here this AM. For a late Sunday AM brunch crowd this place was packed. We were expecting to wait for 45 minutes but were seated immediately at a large table that had opened up. The place is open and loud but the vibe is great and energetic.    Now for the food. I have 3 tween boys and they can pack away a lot of food. It is a rare event that a doggy bag is required however this was the exception. The portions are large and filling. The quality of the food we sampled was excellent and without exception. The kitchen staff knows there stuff and can prepare items beyond the standard breakfast fare. Kudos to the protein pancakes for the low carb/gluten free crowd, they were delicious.  I could keeping going on about the food but I suspect every item is delicious and we will be definitely returning to sample more fare. If you are reading this review, do yourself a favor and check out this star amongst the local breakfast fare."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Eggstasy. The first time was their first day so I kind of shrugged off the slow service. Just went again and the service was still terribly slow. We were starving and it took a whole hour to get our food. They were really busy, and I understand that, but that means they need more staff. I give 2 stars because the food really is extremely delicious, you just have to wait a while for it. I hope this improves soon because it is in a great location."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is absolutely horrendous. We are nurses and have tried to eat at this restaurant on 2 separate Wednesday mornings. Both times it took our server 20 min to even take a drink order, the second time after we asked the hostess to see a server! I ordered two drinks at a time for fear I wouldn't see another server again. What a shame to have such excellent food be ruined by such awful service! None of us will go back again!!"}
{"text":"Like an earlier review I am also a frequent patron. I can honeslty say this place is falling apart not just in service quality but also physically. The patio umbrellas are completely broke.  The floors are not kept and I told my group to please wipe there shoes on the pavement before entering my truck.  The food quality was good but not great as it use to be.  I am worried this place may not make it even though it has a huge following."}
{"text":"What a great place that I didn't know existed until my Niece asked me to meet her there. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. If you judge a breakfast place by their coffee like I do, you won't be disappointed.  There are many choices and options but overall I will definitely return again in the near future.  I was there on a Sunday morning and did not have any delay in getting a table."}
{"text":"Eggstacy put me through many emotions on my most recent visit, let me tell ya.   My boyfriend and I arrived around 11am, and we were seated right away. It was a Thursday, and not nearly as busy as it usually is on the weekends. First, the hostess sat us at a dirty table, even though there were plenty of open tables available. Our waitress (her name was Madeliene) came over and looked a little frenzied, but took our drink order right away. I got a vanilla latte and my boyfriend just stuck with the cucumber water at the table. The latte was delicious when it arrived.  It took a while for her to come back and get our brunch order. I got an egg white fig and goat cheese omelette with a side of hash browns and toast, and my boyfriend got the \"Incredible\" omelette with a side of gluten free pancakes and fruit.   It wasn't our waitress' fault, but it took nearly an hour for our food to reach our table on a very un-busy day. When the food did arrive, my omelette was wrong and had to be sent back, so it took an hour and 15 minutes to get my food. She ended up comping my meal, comping the up-charge for gluten-feee on my boyfriends meal, and gave us a side of pumpkin cheesecake pancakes for free.   I won't lie, I was pretty upset when it took almost an hour for my food to arrive and then to have it be the wrong thing. However, our waitress really made it a much better experience with her kindness and excellent service. It was really all redeemed because of her.  I've been here many times before and I'll be sure to go back!"}
{"text":"Just about the crappiest service I've ever received. I took my parents and grandparents and we will never be coming back. It took 1 1/2 hours for them to screw up 3 of 6 orders. I only gave one star because I had to."}
{"text":"A delicious breakfast complete with mimosas.  I had a very nicely prepared salmon benedict.  They allowed me to add spinach to the benedict and the spinach was fresh.  Nice.  Excellent service.  Fairly quiet dining area."}
{"text":"On the first day of our holiday \"Eid\", many people like to go out with family for breakfast. We had plans to go somewhere else, but that place failed to provide us with our expected table for 20. When we got there they said the wait would be 1-1.5 hours! We weren't prepared to have 20 people wait - including kids - for that long  Eggstasy was our second option and it should have been our first! With very short notice when I called and asked for a table for 20, they said, plz give us 10 min! We made it in less than 10 but just as they promised, the table was ready on time! He place was full so we were so pleased that they were still able to have us despite how busy they were.   We all were seated and given the menus. Bottles of ice cold cucumber water were all over the table. We were asked if we wanted coffee, many of us said yes and we all then placed our orders. We asked for separate checks and that was managed properly.   I ordered First Street which is a chicken panini with a side of fries and my husband ordered a veggie omelette with a side of pancakes. His order also came with another side option so he picked hash browns.   The food came out in pretty reasonable time. My order also came with a soup (potato and leek soup) which was creamy and delicious! The sandwich was just good, nothing extra special. My rating for it would be a 3.5. My expectations of a sandwich that has sun dried tomatoes, artichokes and basil as well as mozzarella was much higher. I didn't taste the basil which would have made the sandwich more flavorful.   My husband's omelette and side of pancakes were great as per his feedback.   Kaitlin our server was superb. She was very friendly and efficient. She took all our orders carefully. We had no mistakes at all despite the large group, variety of orders and separate checks!   Overall, excellent service with pretty good food. Temperature in the restaurant was a little uncomfortable. They tried their best however to adjust the AC and window blinds to accommodate us better. Since I am egg sensitive, I unfortunately cannot try their egg options which could be superb. Would definitely recommend it though based on service and overall quality of food."}
{"text":"This breakfast/lunch place is so good. Huge portions and a great price. I love the banana pancakes!  This place has a fresh look and is very contemporary /casual. The patio is great too when the weather is nice. I love eating here! If you haven't tried it, you should!!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Arizona hands down. I feel like I am there just about every day. The menu really is a great and original menu and there is so much to choose from. The portion sizes are generous and the food is nothing short of amazing. The atmosphere is like none other with really good music playing in the background in a beautiful setting.  The staff and service couldn't be better, you can tell they love what they do and they are passionate about the food they serve, they give great recommendations and are so nice and easy to talk to. The greek skillet with a side of lemon ricotta pancakes is the way to go, or better yet, the breakfast burger with a side of hash browns and green chalula splashed generously to your liking will do the trick. You are going to love this place."}
{"text":"This is a very fun restaurant with amazing food. I go to the other location just about every day and wanted to give this one a try so I did and was very pleased. It feels like a different restaurant because of the size but it's the same great food and same fun vibe. The staff is great and I will definitely be coming back on the regular to see them.  Come in twice a week till you've tried the entire menu,  i promise you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Best breakfast experience in North Scottsdale. Huge portions & very affordable. Giant omelets with a side of pancakes & fruit included. Excellent Bloody Mary's & Mimosas. Fun atmosphere. The one place in Scottsdale I see a mix of couples, groups of friends & families with young adult children all enjoying a fun breakfast experience."}
{"text":"I was so happy we chose to go here at first. Eggstacy offered a wonderful brunch, full menu with lots of exciting choices, and friendly service. We sat at the bar where there was only one bar tender - apparently the other left sick - and for the most part the service was very accommodating. I got an omlette that was massive, and they give you the choice between toast or pancakes. The sourdough toast I ordered was paired with fresh whipped butter and an individual sized jar of jam. If you order pancakes as your side, be prepared for a full, two-cake plate with whipped cream.    The wait was not bad at all at first - maybe 15, 20 minutes. The more we have visited, the worse the wait times have become. Expect to wait 40 minutes for your food to arrive, and then watch the waiters ask every table on the way if the order is theres or not. The staff is so poorly trained and managed that its almost comical. The only other downside is a question of the general cleanliness of the restaurant and an odd restroom set up. The bang-for-your-buck factor, along with the quality of food, is great. Just not sure of its worth the circus that ensues."}
{"text":"We waited for over an hour from when we sat down to when the first plate of food was put on the table!  We had to ask three times for silverware.  It took them 20 minutes to bring me the check so we could leave!!  We approached the manager and told her about our discontent and asked her why this had happened.  She gave us excuse after excuse about what was not going right at the restaurant.  She never once asked how she could rectify our situation.  We told her we would not be back and she watched us walk out the door!"}
{"text":"What consistency. It seems like ever since this restaurant opened I've gone every time I've been in town. They have a ton of options but the menu doesn't make it difficult to order. I'd recommend the steel cut oatmeal, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great food, great service. I'm in Scottsdale for a week-Plenty of time to eat my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Chocolate covered bacon was delicious  Fig & goat cheese omelette with side fruit & pancakes was great  Nutella red velvet pancakes was amazingggg"}
{"text":"I'll admit I was a little skeptical of trying brunch at a restaurant with a name like \"eggstasy\"- it just sounded kind of cheesy. At the same time, the pun of the name sucked me in and we had to try it!   The challenge of weekend brunch is always finding a place to go that doesn't have a 45 min wait. I was pleasantly surprised that we only had a 10 min wait on a Sunday around 9:30/10.   The ambiance is trendy with a bright, semi industrial and loft like feel. There's a white tiled wall that gives the entire place a clean, fresh feeling. The light fixtures are modern and inviting. The layout is spacious. It's a bit loud with the hustle and bustle of servers and people but not uncomfortable.   The menu! That is what impressed me the most. The sheer variety and unusual options make it worth coming here. The portions are huge also! My hubs and I could easily share a plate and be satisfied but we usually opt to try two and share for the variety and take the rest home.    Of the two times I've been, I really enjoyed the brie, apple, and chicken sausage omelette. I've also had a savory crepe which was delicious! Like the rest of their menu, the crepe section is extensive.   They serve Lavazza coffee and offer to-go cups- such a bonus.   For me, the value is definitely here for breakfast/brunch. The prices are comparable to other brunch places except their menu is much more interesting."}
{"text":"The food was great but the portions were way too large for normal human consumption.  I suggest sharing!!  The atmosphere is upscale, fun, clean etc but there was no A/C so it was hot and extremely uncomfortable.  I would recommend the place highly and i will definitely go again but i would make sure it's not 105 degrees outside."}
{"text":"Service is terribly slow and sporadic. Seems completely disjointed from hostess desk through the meal service. Although there were plenty of tables empty and clean, it took 15 minutes to be seated. Waited over 45 minutes for food after order was taken. Waiter never checked in the whole time. Would not recommend unless you want to wait all day."}
{"text":"I had the best experience today. Reese my server suggested a dish different to what I normally get and to add the sausage, I'm so glad she did! She's an awesome server, she took the time to have a conversation and actually listened to what I was looking for in a meal.  She even would ask her fellow severs how she could help them with their side work. I would come back to this location after my experience with her. I've stopped going to the Shea location after I saw the way upper management treated their servers. At this location you can tell the vibe and energy are positive."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here...but today made me think again after the way I saw how management treated the servers. I always sit at the outside bar which is always nice when we have beautiful mornings. This morning as I was sitting at the bar servers were working hard making the vegetables that go in the bloody Mary's. Then out of the blue one of the kitchen managers came out yelling at the same two servers! Yelling at them to stop what they were doing, immediately...to shut it down, because she was getting yelled at!  This was the same job she had told them to do! I've never seen any manager yell like that infront of customers. I felt so bad for them. It was so demeaning and sad. After that the owners mother was yelling ordering servers around while she is wearing open toed sandals in the kitchen and behind the bar area, even when she was running food out. I always thought open toed shoes violated AZ health code."}
{"text":"Our waitress Lola was wonder helping us decide how to get exactly what we wanted from amazing menu unique menu choices.  Menu had eggs all over it not happy, but waitress and taste of food mde up for it.  They should was down menus before putting back in pile to give out.    Ok lets get to the food. We order Incredible Omlette which was amazing. See pics.  Hot, fresh ingrediants and just as I ordered!  Service was quick and people around us were very friendly."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I came in with a large group of about 15 and we were split up, understandable. The large group was sat first, a table of two second, and our table of 4 last. By the time we were sat the first table had ordered. We were ready to order right when we sat but when I told the waiter he said \"I got you\" and then walked away. He came back around and we told him again but he still didn't take our order. When he finally got our order we waited 30 minutes and then told him we had a hotel checkout in an hour and might need everything packed up and brought with the check. We waited another half hour and still no food so the group of two said they would bring the food back and pay the checks, they checked with the hostess how much longer it would be and she told them the kitchen was backed up. They stopped the waiter and let him know to bring the food to her since we had to run back to the hotel. When we got back to the hotel we were told that the hostess saw us leave and went to the kitchen and cancelled the order and when they tried to reorder everything they would not make the food. After an hour of sitting there..... No food..."}
{"text":"My favorite of the many great breakfast spots around town. Bigger portions than US Egg across the street, excellent menu and service, and the food is just outstanding. Probably only the third 5 star review I've given lifetime on Yelp. Go here, it's great."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place on my way home so many times and thought to myself, \"I should try that place for lunch.\"  Last week I finally did. I was pleased by the pleasant atmosphere and was promptly greeted and seated. My experience took a left turn from there.  The place was relatively busy, but not packed by any means. It took longer than usual for a restaurant in the area at lunch time to be approached for a drink order. Whatever, no biggie, there is an extensive menu and I was going to need a minute. I had time to review the entire menu, be indecisive, go back over the menu several times and finally arrive at a choice, and then sit and sift through FB before my drink ever arrived.   I promptly gave my order for one of their lunch panini sandwiches . The panini comes with fruit or french fries, soup and coleslaw. This puzzled the waitress when I pointed that out as she was trying to walk away and I asked what the soup was. She told me the soup choice, I said \"that sounds fantastic\" handed over the menu and she left. Eh, maybe she's new.  It took 10 minutes for the soup to come out (by someone else) and 20 minutes for my food to come out (by someone else). I'm starting to panic a little bit and think maybe I should just ask for a box but instead, I just asked the person leaving my food for the check.  She seemed a little put off by that request.  I've got patients to see and I can't be late so I need to pay so I can get out of there.  The food is marvelous. The French fries are so crispy, the soup was fantastic, the panini was really good and I have no idea about the coleslaw because it wasn't included and I didn't have time to ask for it. I'm scarfing down my food and I'm about half way done and the check has still not arrived. My server finally appears just as I'm putting sandwich in my mouth and asks how everything tastes, no smile. I say \"one second\" with food in my mouth, chew, swallow some and garble \"it's really good, can I get the check as soon as you have a chance?\"  She just nods and walks away.  I'm watching her now because it seems to me that everything is taking entirely too long. I've been a server so I can understand when you're running crazy. In this case, I watched her stroll about with zero hustle from task to task seeing what appears to be 3 tables including mine.  Typically when a check is dropped there is at least a nicety exchanged, \"thanks for coming\" or \"have a great rest of your day.\"  In this case, nothing, not even a smile. She strolled by and slid the check across the table without a word or even a look and walked off to the table behind me. I was floored. I have NEVER experienced that. I was already prepared with my card out when she dropped it because I didn't want her to leave again, but to no avail. She didn't even give me an opportunity. I finished my food and sat there waiting. Now I'm really panicked because I have 10 minutes to get back to the office and she's not coming back. I walk over to the hostess and ask her who takes care of the check. I watch as she takes it over to my server and taps her on the shoulder. The server gives her a \"can't be bothered look,\" rolls her eyes and processes my card.  I've worked in this area for almost 4 years. I don't typically choose fast food when I want to grab lunch and most places are able to get you in and out at lunch with plenty of time and are at least somewhat time sensitive. Usually I'm with 4 or 5 coworkers and we still get out in plenty of time. It is also common to ask for the check right away to speed up the process.  The food here was fantastic, the restaurant is beautiful and has great outdoor seating. I was thinking how great it would be to have a team meeting here. Not now, no way. I'll never go back there for lunch and my coworkers are aware and won't be either. If you're not on any time constraints and aren't necessarily concerned with customer service I recommend, otherwise, hit up U.S. Egg across the street. I have never had such terrible service and have never been inspired to leave a negative review."}
{"text":"Horrible! More often then not the temperature is awful and it feels like the A/C is broken. We have witnessed a staff fight every time we have gone in and usually with management involved. It is far too sad to watch and certainly ruins my meal. I hope they get help because its a great location, great decorating, even the food is pretty good once it actually shows up. I hate having to give a 1 star review, I really do! I just can't bring myself ever tell anyone to step foot in here or even support them by ordering food to go."}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant out twice now. First time we sat inside and the service was not the best. Everything took much longer than it normally would at any other restaurant.  We decided to give it another try. This time we sat outside at the bar hoping for faster service.  It took 25 minutes from when we sat down to have our order taken.  It took more than ten minutes to get a cup of hot coffee.  The quality of the food is good but the service is not the best and we will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Poor service... food spilled on one of us by a server with no 'sorry', food brought with no silverware or napkins, not enough room on the tiny outdoor table for the food, both orders were incorrect, and excuses from the staff. Food was fine."}
{"text":"Best place to eat.  Everything is fresh.  Food is fantadic and cooked properly.  Elizabeth is a great server.  Pumpkin pancakes are delicious!  My new all time favorite place to eat breakfast hands down!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Large portions, fun innovative menu. Atmosphere is phenomenal with luxurious outside seating. Even inside feels like you are outdoors.  Couldn't have asked for a better experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing menu and food!!  High quality food and healthy options if you're watching what you eat......there is something for everyone on this menu. .....it took awhile for me to decide what to order there is so many items to choose from. ....wow!  The food was fabulous and the staff is great!  This will definitely be my breakfast place from now on!  This is a family owned restaurant and I love supporting local businesses :)"}
{"text":"The chocolate covered bacon is a hands down crowd pleaser! The prosciutto omelette and granola french toast are amongst my favorites that keep me coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I know when a new place opens up it's easy to get all caught up in the hype and newness of it.  Looking at all these other 5 star reviews leaves me to believe that it's the hype more than anything that is blowing people away.    I went here yesterday morning and found out that yesterday was their actual grand opening and that the week prior was their soft opening.  That left me wondering if all of these 5 star ratings were just to get the word out about this place. Our server Dan was a really nice guy. He kind of looks like a bootleg version of Ryan Gosling in The Notebook when he had the beard. Yeah, I've seen The Notebook. What guy with a girlfriend hasn't? Anyways bootleg Gosling really took the time to get to know us.  The cucumber infused water was pretty good. And they do have some of the best orange juice I have probably ever tasted.  The chocolate covered bacon i had was pretty good. But maybe had too much chocolate on it. I was hoping for a salty sweet taste with the chocolate covered bacon and I mostly tasted chocolate and not much bacon til the last bite.   I will agree with some of the other reviews that their attire was all over the place. But that's not really a big deal. It seems like places that only cater to breakfast and brunch the staff wears pretty much whatever they like.   The main issue I had with the place was what I ordered. I drove all the way out there for Red Velvet French Toast. And what I got was Red Velvet cake with some kind of brulee it looked like put on top. It was ok. But considering the distance I drove. I was very disappointed that it was just cake. My girlfriend ordered the stuff french toast binoche. And instead got the Nutella banana french toast and hashbrowns. But she didn't notice until half way eating it cause it was so massive she didn't know that it wasn't stuffed. She really enjoyed the food that she ordered The portions they give you are very good portions.  Eggstasy has the look of being a hipster place for sure. The decor is cool even though the bathrooms don't have his/her signs on the doors. They still got some kinks to work out. But all in all it wasn't bad and I would recommend them and give them another try. Next time I'll try their sister restaurant attach to them called Sausage N Crack! Ok....I might have made up that one."}
{"text":"I have been searching for another special breakfast spot for awhile. I finally found it. Awesome selection,  great service,  delicious food. I have been won over."}
{"text":"Yelp Breakfast Club UYE here this morning (thanks for setting this up Monica). I had the Belgian waffle ($7.95) which came with a skewer of fresh fruit. The waffle was warm, not hot, and was crispy on the outside, but slightly spongy instead of fluffy on the inside. I could barely get the butter to melt. The syrup was warm and there was a smear of whipped cream on the side of the waffle. I also had a cup of hot chocolate ($2.95). It was a small cup with whipped cream and chocolate syrup on top. It was average in taste.  The noise level was a real problem. The physical setting is one huge room (like a high school cafeteria) and carrying on a conversation was problematic. The wait staff was friendly and waited until we were ready to take our table of 17's orders--however, the food came out at two separate times, even though the orders were taken at the same time. I felt bad eating before everyone had their food, but waffles and eggs get cold quickly and are only edible warm. Parking is tight for this small shopping center.  Overall, slightly better than the average breakfast place."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start! The food was amazing everything was so full of flavor and presentation (not that this matters too much) was beautiful too! 3 out of the 4 of us at the table had eggs Benedict. I switched out the ham for bacon on mine...still delicious (better in my opinion :p). I also ordered a side of the homemade corn beef hash and everyone at the table agreed that was good too! No one had any complaints about their meals. Every order that we saw come out of the kitchen looked drool-worthy. I'm pretty sure everything you order here is good, at least it all looks delicious!  Our waitress was fast, efficient, and helpful! She even offered a solution for us with sides we ordered to get it at a cheaper rate! Good looking out and much appreciated!  The place is hip and for a younger crowd maybe...music was pretty loud making everyone have to yell a little to speak to each other. No inside voices here! I loved it! It was new up to date music and put me in a great mood to start the day."}
{"text":"For a Sunday morning the wait was fairly short! I wasn't a fan of the decor..the patio is pretty but the inside is like a cafeteria. I ordered a Belgium waffle with a side of eggs and I loved the presentation!! Devin was attentive and gave good service. My friends and I will probably be back but maybe we'll stick to the patio next time"}
{"text":"Thanks to all the great wait staff  you are all great ! Kudos! The food is the best around by far ! I've had at least 8 different dishes here so far and no one can top the cooks ability here. Fruit is always fresh and sweet and the veggies are alway crisp and flavorful. Great eggs and French toast and pancakes and Bloody Mary's and ........... well you get the idea , I Love This Place"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, the price is on the $$$ side, but overall you owe it to yourself to try this place. The fresh juice bar is definitely a plus."}
{"text":"Watch for clever waitresses you over a bill you, food was ok, but nothing special. Nothing more to write about not a very memorable experience except I was over Billed"}
{"text":"Avoid this place if possible. The only positive part was Berkley the girl in front who was nice enough to help us with the table. Unfortunately that is the only good part since the wait staff is either inexperienced or understaffed because we barely got water, napkins, utensils, etc. To make matters worse the new items that the chef added are sub par at best   1. The spam sliders are mushed together sloppily and the taste of mustard is very overwhelming   2. The cotton candy pork belly is mainly fat and they over did it with the sugar  3. The Eggasm was the only decent plate  4. I asked for a strawberry mimosa and got a regular mimosa   What made matters worst is when the waiter asked I let him know the problems to which there was no comp'd meal since most of the food was left on the plate, no management was called, and no apology or attempt to rectify was made.  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE. There are plenty of better places like Hash where they know how to properly treat a customer"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:30 on a Sunday morning expecting this place to be packed, but surprisingly only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. The ambience is good, the menu is extensive, however the food was lackluster with style over substance.   We ordered the gyros hash with poached eggs, fruit and pancakes. The eggs were swimming in water and were barely cooked. I'm not sure what made the hash 'gyros', they were just potatoes with red onion and some random bits of meat thrown in. They were also massively under seasoned. The pancakes were weird and dry and the maple syrup was more like maple flavored syrup. Not sure if they use the real deal, but I've had better elsewhere. The one redeeming feature was the fruit skewer which isn't exactly hard to get wrong.   My husband ordered the pork belly Benedict, and I have no idea how you can mess up pork belly which is delicious however you have it, but it was tasteless and boring. The table next to us ordered their food then left half of it behind so I'm guessing they felt the same way. The coffee was good, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, along with the service and nice decor. There are so many delicious breakfast options in this area, there's no way we will be returning here."}
{"text":"New breakfast place on the Shea corridor. They have some real unique dishes with a European flavor. Really good coffee tho it can get a little loud in there. Get there by 10am or you will have a wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this new breakfast spot in town and such a great location. They are a friendly bunch with fast service and good food. And holy moley-ridiculously large portions! Nobody at our table could even put a dent in the plates they were served. My husband and I agreed that we could've shared a plate and still been stuffed. They have a big menu with plenty of options (think Cheesecake Factory). Prices are moderate, but really affordable when you consider the amount of food.  The dining area is a large open cafeteria style with open kitchen-so loud, loud, loud.  For reference, a crying toddler could not penetrate the wall of noise. May not be an issue for some, but worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Came to this place for a Sunday brunch.  Had about a 15-20 minute wait on a Sunday at 10:30...not too bad,  The restaurant was a little warm inside.  Nice large menu.  The whole place was a bit chaotic.  We placed our order and my wife ordered a bloody mary...they were $10.  The waitress dropped the bacon that came with the drink...not a big deal...but then did not even attempt to bring her a new piece.  After asking the waitress to, she did.  The portion sizes are HUGE!!  (see my pictures)  The prices were good too.  Plenty of positives with the place, but overall the whole experience was mediocre at best.  Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"This is one of my wife and my favorite places to brunch. Good food each time. We drive down from Cave Creek to eat here and it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Stuffed French toast terrible! Very dry, sent it back and just got yogurt with fruit, nut bread that came with it dry too! Not happy with this place and it was my first time!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Service was good even though it was very busy on Sunday morning! They have a lot of healthy options and all the omelets sound delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential - interesting menu, great location and decor, fantastic patio seating, and great mimosas and bloody Marys.  BUT... I have been here 3 times and the service has never been good.  The bar can take forever to make your drinks, which doesn't really make sense since they only have a limited bar menu.  Two out of the three times I have been here, they have forgotten someone's order, so the rest of the table is waiting and letting their food get cold while they prepare what they forgot.  The service in general is very disorganized and slow.  Last time I ordered the crunchy pancakes which my server told me were like donuts, and they came out burnt and super greasy.  They are literally fried pancakes - skip them.  I really wanted to like this place, but 3 strikes and you're out.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good!!! I have lived in Phoenix/N. Scottsdale area for almost 20 years and have finally found THE place to eat! Forget the plain jane chain eateries. At Eggstacy, its like a spectacular food network find! The entire menu is unique, the portions are generous, the food is made from scratch,  and the presentation is gorgeous. Best of all the food is decadent. Prices are reasonable, and its clean and inviting. Busy here which speaks volumes. Absolutely fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's definitely one of my favorite breakfast places in Scottsdale!   Today we walked in there was a 30 minute wait but we walked up to the bar and got full service right away. Lona took care of us today and I must say, she was pretty awesome! We ordered, coffee, water and a Bloody Mary to start. Let's say she knows how to pour a good Bloody Mary! And of course it's topped with chocolate covered bacon, you can't go wrong with that!   Lona was on it and took our order right away, made suggestions and talked me into the cinnamon swirl pancakes (not on the menu). I loooove cinnamon rolls so this was an easy sell for me. I ordered the gypsy steak skillet again. Lots of protein and added the cinnamon swirl pancakes to share with my friend.   My friend ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. She isn't a big breakfast person (I had to convince her to come with the enticing Bloody Mary!) The buffalo chicken in the wrap had a maple syrup flavor. Which seems appropriate for a breakfast/brunch spot, but it didn't taste so great in combo with the buffalo sauce. We let Lona know and she was super friendly and took care of it, no problem!   The atmosphere is super friendly and upbeat. And I enjoyed watching all the dishes come out. Sitting at the bar added to the fun as we got to talk to fellow breakfast lovers :) they have a bar that is both indoors and outdoors.   Only downfalls, in the past we have waited forever on a Sunday after church. And the patio after about 11:00 the sun is BEATING down on you. No shade if you aren't under the cover. They definitely need some umbrellas or a shade cover if they plan to use the patio more.   Other than that. I love this place!! :) enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was surprised, considering the reviews are mixed. For me I got the veggie omelette, with fruit and the gluten-free pancakes. I'm strangely picky about my veggie omelette. It bothers me when it comes out with little tiny pieces of veggies, unlike this one. Big pieces of veggies and a big omelette. Fruit was a skewer of mainly pineapple, but it was good. Gluten-free pancakes, still hard to find, were very good and they gave you two of them. Service was friendly and very quick. The room is also big, open with a very large outside patio. The only negative is it's a bit confusing to get in to the plaza (at the end of it). That doesn't seem like a big deal for what I think is a five star breakfast. PS, I did go at an off time, which was 10:30 on Monday so maybe that's why things went smoothly."}
{"text":"Bacon smothered in chocolate does not typically pair with a Bloody Mary but the fact that Eggstasy just \"goes for it\" is an admirable feat. Sweet and salty mixed goodness is a true and tried recipe that seldom fails. Even without the Bloody Mary, I would just order the chocolate covered bacon on its own.  I've been here a few times, and the first time, our group was give pumpkin pancake with cream cheese type icing for free to sample. It was very dessert like and pleasant!  The corned beef hash is pretty good to order when hungry. I thought the crispy pancetta Benedict was a bit more memorable. Then again, I'm partial to the richness of Hollandaise sauce.   If you come here on a Friday morning close to when they open, then service is amazing. The waitress even told me to take a breath of fresh air instead of looking at my phone and focusing on taking foodie pics and actually enjoy the food. She was so hilarious and on top of everything.  Coming here on Sunday's especially around \"11am-noonish,\" good luck. There's usually a list to wait for a table and service will be hit or miss because there's just too many d@#n people to wait on. I'm not blaming the staff, it's actually really good that they're that busy but I can tell there's a little more stress around. Food remains un-compromised and just as tasty."}
{"text":"The food is incredible. The menu is so many options. Lots of options for a very healthy eating . The places really modern and clean. The staff is wonderful and inviting. Great place for breakfast and lunch anytime"}
{"text":"This place gets it right! Great food in gargantuan portions, always served piping hot and fresh. Interior décor is modern and hip, without being too ridiculously over-the-top. Its always very clean, and the staff are always great!   The only cons are the outdoor seating is too exposed, even with umbrellas on the patio. In the warmer months, you're gonna burn sitting out there. My biggest gripe about this place is the music volume. Way. Too. Loud. Its nearly impossible to carry on a conversation with someone across one of the larger round tables they have in the corner."}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable. We had a party of 4 adults and 5 kids/babies. They were above and beyond courteous. Restaurant was clean, food was good, iced mocha was DELICIOUS. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The staff is super friendly and the food on both times we have been here has been so yummy!!! The best breakfast place we have been to and we travel for work!! This time we split a meal because the portions are HUGE!!! You will have left overs, so make sure you get something that will last in the car."}
{"text":"Wow!! That food was incredible! With every sandwich not only do you get your choice of fries or fruit but you also get soup with it and it was great!  Atmosphere is good, they have a great patio that's large and perfect to sit outside when our weather isn't so hot. Service was very slow but food made it worth it. Deff going back!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, as it is a nice change from our usual place First Watch. We went on a Tuesday at 10am and it was not crowded at all. The decor is unique. The waitress was really nice and told us the portions were big so my daughter and I choose to split a French toast.   The food was cooked perfectly and the whip cream tasted like cool whip, which reminded my of my childhood. I liked it but I know some people don't.   Overall service was quick, the food was good, and it was a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Eggcellent breakfast place;) Small place with sort of a modern hipster vibe.  Great menu with something for everyone on it. And they give you cucumber infused water, which I thought was nice.  I ordered the Brie, Apple, pecan and grape crepe which was good. The crepe was REALLY good but  I barely got and Brie in it which would be my only complaint there. I also ordered 1 poached egge which was PERFECT.  Like seriously it was probably the best egg I've ever had. And the hashbrowns as well were soooo good. My friend got the red velvet French toast which, I think she thought was good but REALLY rich.  She ate about 1/3 and then gave up and ate some hashbrowns and her eggs. They should offer half portions of the French toast. Place was clean, though the salt and pepper shakers were half empty which only bothered me because I work in a restaurant and I just think it's tacky.  Our server was friendly, and made recommendations. I think his name was tony.  He talked pretty quiet but was still very nice. Gal working at the front door was SUPER nice and very welcoming.   Overall I was pretty impressed expecially since they've only been open a week, I feel like things will only get better.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"New favorite brunch spot!!! I've heard such good things about this place too, so I was very excited to try it. I wanted to try one of their many pancake options, so I chose the jelly donut pancake. Tasted just like a jelly donut!! I also tried one of their omelets, such unique combinations! The menu has so many options so I can't wait to go back. I didn't care for the hash browns, they were undercooked, but I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone! Ps. I went back for the French toast too"}
{"text":"So want to like this place but disaster. 40 minutes for food, server friendly but overwhelmed, food came out piece meal half hot and half cold."}
{"text":"HUGE MENU looks incredible.   I will have to come back and try some other options from the menu.  I had a barbacoa omelette which was okay.  Interesting flavors, but I would not get it twice.  The side of fruit was amazing -- fresh pineapple, strawberries, and other berries were fresh and flavorful.  Loved the presentation of the fruit on a skewer!  Crispy prosciutto was really good.  Corned beef hash was not especially flavorful, so would not get it twice.  Pancakes were amazing and full of sugary flavor.  Coffee was good so I would definitely get it again -- I dont like strong coffee."}
{"text":"Use to love this place when it first opened. The food was great and could never finish it. Service was always just ok but the food made up for it.  Went in today for the first time in a long time and wow. Service is so bad and the portion size has shrunk a lot!! It tasted ok not great. I guess it will be gone soon by the way it's heading it seems it already peaked. To bad. Had high hopes."}
{"text":"I had a nice little quiet breakfast by myself here a couple of days ago. It was around \"brunchtime\" midweek. I don't really know where my expectations were before I walked in, but either way, this place exceeded them. It's on a second story, with really big windows, open floor plan, and really cute rustic decor. It's nice to have all of the natural lighting come in. It's quaint and enjoyable.   I was greeted by a very nice host, the restaurant had a decent amount of people, but not too many where I couldn't have a say in my seating. It was a nice little spot in the corner, looking out the windows. He told me the name of the server who would be taking care of me, and I appreciated that.   My server came over in a timely manner, was friendly, bubbly, and asked me what I would like to drink. I took an orange juice and it was delicious. I appreciate little things like how they put a nice big orange slice on the side of my glass. I then ordered the chicken breast skillet with rye toast. When it came out, I was blown away by presentation! It was beautiful! The portion size was large, maybe too large, but prefer that over too small, you can always take it home! The toast was thick cut, and served with butter AND a mini bottle of jam. Again, little things like that, where you can see effort and the establishment going above and beyond, are things I appreciate. The eggs were cooked perfect to the over medium I requested, and I enjoyed, very much, the flavor of my meal. They also added a fruit skewer, which I wasn't expecting, and was pleasantly surprised.   Overall, this place does a lot of things that most breakfast places do not, and that's awesome. The menu is large, and there really is so much variety, that there would be a meal everyone could enjoy. I left very satisfied with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"So I've had to update this review because I feel like y'all listened to my last one. The service has been incredibly improved! They have their off days but most of the time we are well taken care of. We love this place so much that it's hard to try anywhere else.  My husband cheats on me by sneaking here mid week without me. I introduced him here, and now he comes without me! The hostess even knows his typical order!  I love their skillets - I get the veggie skillet minus onions (yuck). It's a great combination of broccoli, collard greens, tomatoes, and mushrooms under some crispy hash browns topped with Swiss and American (I think?) Cheese topped with scrambled eggs. Comes with choice of pancake or toast but i gret the English muffin because they're the best I've ever had. This meal is enough for me to have a 2nd breakfast.   Hubs orders the chorizo omelette which is fit for a giant. He never has leftovers.   We just love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The portions are huge. Jonathan W was our server and he was great. This place reminds me of snooze and will be great competition for snooze. I highly recommend this place. The service was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Finally a new breakfast place!  But oh, the disappointment... Have tried Eggsasy 3 times, hoping each time that the next visit would be better.   The decor was great, but wish they would have put as much effort into the food.   Hostesses dressed like nightclub cocktail waitresses at 8:00 in the morning?  Um, ok. Menu was very large and had lots of options, unfortunately it has gotten them in trouble, as nothing I have ordered was any where near delicious.  Super loud in the dining room.  And very exspensive for sub-par food.  This kitchen needs to revamp the menu so they can focus on quality, not quantity!"}
{"text":"Great experience as always, food is off the charts amazing,  bartender today was very attentive. The hostess though, she kept coming over to a table next to us, drinking their drinks eating off their plates  she probably knows them but it was very distracting and kind of disgusting."}
{"text":"Took friends from out of town. Everything was good. Tried the chocolate bacon...they must use really good chocolate like Belgian, but could not taste the bacon so felt like extra fat grams for no reason.  Hash browns were great.  Everyone liked their food, fresh squeezed oj good. Would have had a mimosa if I didn't have a cold.  Will go back. Want to try the banana Nutella crepes."}
{"text":"New favorite Breakfast/brunch place! Lives up to its name!! Try the pumpkin pancakes. Delish! Everyone who works here is friendly and accommodating! We will definitely be back. Pure Eggstasy"}
{"text":"Horrible! Sat outside, the patio was so gross. Took forever for the waitress to get to us. When she finally did we ordered coffee, it took forever. So we decided to just leave. It wasn't even busy. Probably will never go back."}
{"text":"This place offers a great variety of breakfast dishes from sweet to savory and their portions are as generous as the pricing.   Don't miss the fresh squeezed OJ and the pancakes melt in your mouth! The bacon is pretty awesome too.  On my most recent visit I had the pretzel croque madame, which I would recommend requesting open faced, because it was a LOT of bread.   I haven't had to wait long for a table, the place is pretty big.  Inside can be a little noisy, but there is a nice patio, if temps are cooperating.  Be careful to not drive past it. The parking lot (and the restaurant) fronts on the north side of the building."}
{"text":"Great first experience here. We sat outside at the bar. Awesome bartender; even though they were extremely busy, he took care of us. Bloody Mary's are a must have, specially when it comes to the chocolate covered bacon. We got the garlic and almond omelet but we're coming back for the skillet."}
{"text":"The orange juice and water are great. Food is average. Zero, I mean ZERO service. The orders are all messed up. They try to serve the wrong orders to the wrong tables. It was actually funny that they were insisting pancakes belonged with us. There was literally nothing else on the table at that point. Even common sense would indicate that these orphaned pancakes had a family somewhere else. It took 45 min to get 3/4 of our table's order out; About 60 min for the 4th. Zero recognition of the service delays. None of the sides like bread or salsa came out at all. No coffee refills. She did ask three times and we kept telling her, but they never came. Oh, this was funny; the waitress told one of our party that he \"could not get bacon\" with his order.  So, he was like, really?..... ok. No bacon. Also, why even ask what size juice? They all came out the same size. We had to wait another 20 minutes after it took an hour to get our food to get the cc back to sign.  We are a pretty mellow group and fortunately, we'll eat again. So, it's not that big of a deal. But I kinda feel like they actually hate running a restaurant and having customers. They really just wanted to design a restaurant and menu."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for about a year and I used to LOVE this place! Without a doubt, my Sunday plans included coming here for breakfast. But the quality in consumer service has drastically changed and it got so bad, I've had to walk out. Just right now, one of the girls that work at entrance had quite an attitude, threw the menu onto the table and just walked away. We then waited for a while to get water, and keep in mind that it wasn't busy to get someone to come to our table. I got so agitated with not getting any service, been sat at a table with dirty cups and the bill from the last customers that sat there, that we walked away.     It's sad to say that y'all have lost a loyal costumer. This is just one of many examples of the slip in costumer service."}
{"text":"They have a really cool layout with an open kitchen, an inner dining area that is kind of industrial-like in design and an outer dining area that is open to the inside, separated by the bar.   Try the juice; it is DELICIOUS. Freshly squeezed and no additives, just plain pure fruit pulp. Yum.  I had the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes, which were okay.  They tasted kind of pumpkin-y, and the cheesecake \"sauce\" was a nice change to the usual old maple syrup routine.  The problem I have with sweet pancakes, though, is that they're mostly indistinguishable from one another.  All the \"fruity\" sweet pancakes taste the same, and same goes for all of the \"other\" types - chocolate based, dessert based, what have you.  The good thing is that the pancakes are ginormous - like the size of a regular dinner plate - and you get FOUR of them.  Probably will go again, and I'm thinking of either getting something savory or going for one of the fruitier sweet breakfast options, like the lemon blueberry compote french toast.  The wait is LONG. You might as well just suck it up and chill at the bar, unless you have a ginormous group or a bunch of kids.  Parking is decent since this brunch place is located in one of those weird plaza areas like EVERYTHING else in Arizona."}
{"text":"First time here what a fantastic experience, especially being my birthday today. From the moment I walked in the hostess was amazing and our server was fantastic. She had tons of recommendations and the hardest thing was to choose one of them.  The food is a perfect fusion of American contemporary food with traditional elements with a modern creative and fun to eat spin on it. The pumpkin cheesecake pancakes are a definite must.  The chorizo Maple French toast was also a huge hit if you love sweet and spicy, what a perfect blend.  This place is amazing! You have to try it out"}
{"text":"Food pretty good and service friendly just poorly managed.  Second time they couldn't make change because no cash drawer and none of the five servers brought a bank.  Really?  Pretty basic"}
{"text":"Was a little tempted to give this place two stars, but thought there were enough good things that they deserved a three. The interior was pretty hip and cool, definitely fun to look at ha. The service was also good. Overall I was somewhat disappointed though. I was excited when seeing the variety of vegetarian friendly omelettes! It always sucks to go to a breakfast place where only one omelette is just veggies and the rest are meat. I went for the swiss chard, caramelized onion, and gruyere omelette with a side of pancakes and fruit (no pineapple because I'm slightly allergic). The omelette looked unappealing when they brought it out, but I didn't judge it based on looks. I don't know if the cheese was just too sweet for an omelette and I didn't like that or what, but it left me with a stomach ache lasting the whole day. The pancakes were kind of favorless, not as soft and fluffy as I prefer my pancakes. They also brought me fruit out with pineapple, which i requested no pineapple, when I told the server she was apologetic and happy to fix it. She handed it to her coworker to fix and he said \"Can't I just take it off?\" and she said no, which I am glad about. They brought me a nice bowl of fresh fruit, but it was more than my friend had on his skewer! It was a little pricey as well. Expected though, as it is a nicer breakfast place in Scottsdale! Overall, not very tempted to come back, mostly because of the stomach ache. There might be something much better on the menu though that I did not get so I have not completely written this place off yet."}
{"text":"Beyond good.. Its just perfect ! Whoever gave this place anything less than 4 stars must have woke up on the wrong side of the bed or be on a sex drought..  Its my second time here ,both on sundays and each time has been perfection ! Menu is both traditional and unique The service is great. The music is a tad loud inside so i sit outside. I was for many years a Butterfield's gal, but i just have to follow my heart...all the way to eggstacy :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Friendly start to finish. Our waiter was fabulous, answered all of our ridiculous questions and very patient. I'm high maintenance at a restaurant when I order my meals, just sayin'.  Your meals are made to order... and that's exactly what they mean.  A stack of pancakes is 4. I wanted to try two different kinds as I couldn't make up my mind, they split the order for me and didn't charge any extra! $ 10.95 Other meal was an order of crepes. My friend wanted to try 3 different ones... no problem. $11.95 that's amazing service right there! Ton of good quality food made fresh for you on the spot plus great prices. Doesn't get any better than that. We will be back!  Seriously look at all the food we got and our bill was $23"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Mimosas make it even better. Ask for Sarah, she is great!! Very considerate and makes sure your meal is up to par. Made fresh and ready to order. Mimosas are served in a unique glass. Not your typical champagne flute. Fun place!"}
{"text":"This place was completely under-whelming. My experience varied from mediocre (at best) to unhappy (at worst).  Our group of 3 arrived at 12:30 - well after the breakfast, brunch, and lunch crowds, as evidenced by the fact that there were only about four or five other tables occupied. We were seated at a small table in the southeast corner of the dining room, at a table that had food on the floor underneath the table. Despite the low attendance, the place was so noisy that we could barely hear each other.  There were flies in the window, and the black grout on the floor showed all the schmutz that had not been adequately cleaned from between the tiles - many of which were lifting and even more of which were cracked.  I asked for the 1/2 sandwich and soup order, but was told that it was not available with the sandwich I preferred (the B.A.L.T. - bacon, avocado, lettuce, and tomato sandwich). So I just ordered the B.A.L.T. - only to discover it comes with a small bowl of soup! Why didn't the waiter (who was attentive, by the way) let me know that?  Not only did the menu NOT state the the B.A.L.T. comes with soup, but the menu did not mention that the B.A.L.T. comes with a dill pickle. I really do NOT like dill pickle, and I would have asked that it be eliminated if I had known it was included. To make things worse, not only was there a pickle on my plate, but it was swimming in several teaspoons of dill juice which completely soaked the bottom half of my B.A.L.T. - making it soggy and - to me - unpalatable.   I enjoyed the content of the deconstructed sandwich which I ate open-faced.  The soup, by the way, was warm but not hot.  So, a noisy and dirty restaurant with incomplete information on the menu and luke-warm soup.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Totally in love with the food here. The menu is perfect for my husband and his traditional taste for breakfast like eggs benedict, but extra great for my more eclectic taste for a more adventurous palate. It gets busy for Sunday brunch, but I think it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This location used to be some other breakfast restaurant before and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw a familiar name \"eggstasy\" two weeks ago when I drove by. I love Eggstasy on Shea location and couldn't wait to try here.  It was Sunday 9:30am, wait was about 30 minuets. Fortunately they had bar seats available immediately and decided to sit there.  I love egg benedict and can't help myself but order one every time I see one on the menu. They have so many different kinds of benedict available, I decided to try barbacoa one. Of the meat was cooked so perfectly soft and tender with great flavor, after eating one, I became full. Lots of calorie pack on this plate and requires  a nap after eating breakfast here.  I also tried their pancakes as I remember being really good from their other location and sure enough, it was so fluffy and soft.   Service is very good, hostess and server was very prompt and friendly.  This place is much closer to my house and I will sure to be back!"}
{"text":"The food was so good I couldn't stop eating after o got full yesterday.    I saw this restaurant on my way to hike, I actually so a few other breakfast restaurant within a half miles radius. I chose to stop by here for its name after three hours of hiking.  When I walked in, I stepped back a little as it was nothing what I expected. I thought I came to have breakfast but inside it looks like as if you are in an island somewhere in Caribbean. The use of orange, light green and yellow color as well as a huge open bar area made me think I just stepped inside a bar or restaurant in tropical island.   When we arrived around noon, the wait we were told was 20-30 mins but they were able to seat us in 10 mins.  Server greeted us right away with cucumber water, just what I needed to quench slightly dehydrate body after a long hike.  I liked the freshly squeezed juice selection. Not just orange juice, but grapefruit, strawberry with pomegranate...   Full order of pancakes comes with four large fluffy packages. The server suggested to split to two plates for us. I had no ideas how big the pancakes plate was going to be. I am glad she explained otherwise I would have been taking leftover home and it doesn't taste as good.  Pancakes were very fluffy and generous portion of fresh fruits complimented the dish very nicely.  Flat bread salmon plate was also big but tasted so good. They proudly serve Lavazza coffee (my second favorite Italian coffee) and they kept coming back to refill my cup. I don't think my cup went down more than a half as a coffee person and our server kept coming back for more coffee.  They take reservations for a group of 8 or more. Their food and service was so good, I wanted to make reservation for Mother's Day. They suggested I call ahead to leave my name when I am ready to leave my house as they expect wait is going to be close to one hour on Mother's Day during peak hour.   They were busy but I never felt being rushed. We enjoyed leisurely breakfast on weekend and had a very relaxing time with great food and service. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Eggstasy is an awesome restaurant with absolutely fantastic food and great service!! Every plate I've had here has surpassed my expectations by far, and the waiters & waitresses are always so friendly! The food they serve is fresh, and they will modify any plate to make you happy. Props to the owner, this restaurant is A++!"}
{"text":"Tried for first time since they opened at this location. Service?  Waited longer than necessary for coffee, only to wait longer for cream. And don't ask for straws, add another 10 mins if lucky. Had banana macadamia pancakes and ham/asparagus crepes. Pancakes are tasteless and smothered in whip cream. Doesn't work. Crepes are tiny grocery store bought ham and tiny asparagus wrapped in paper. Doesn't work?  Doesn't work at any level. Food and service horrible. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant. It is always crazy busy but that's how you know it is great food and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of my biggest complaints is to be out of menu items.   Ate here this past Sunday and based on a couple of other reviews, here, I could hardly wait to try the Pretzel Croque Madam.  Ordered it. Next I ordered what sounded quite refreshing:  Fresh Squeezed Apple Juice. Ordered it. Out of it. Damn. So I went for the refreshingly cold Apple Cider. Delicious.   Then my Croque arrived. The bread didn't look pretzel-y yet I held out for my first bite. Nope. It wasn't. I asked the server what was up. He checked with the kitchen. Pretzel bread was not available so they substituted an unknown, white, homemade bread of some magnitude without his knowledge.  Damn. Two thick slices of it. I deconstructed it by ixnaying the bottom slice with the mid-squirted glob of dijon mustard and finished it off. The server made-up for the bread faux pas with a comp'd glass of the delicious Apple Cider.   Another bugaboo I have with restaurants is staff members hanging-out at either their stations; the host stand or at the kitchen counter. Here, the kibitzers were at the kitchen's counter and the bartenders were chatting endlessly. McDonald's says it best:  \"You got time to lean, you got time to clean.\"  In closing, the decor is TOO WHITE.  The windows were wide open...the flies were overly aggressive. (The one fly that bugged me and The Beau the most left us to join the diners at the next table when their food arrived.).    I'm just not liking the vibe of this place. It was no Eggstasy for us."}
{"text":"We sat outside and enjoyed breakfast.  Our first table was being dripped on from the misters, so our server helped us move to another.  The food was great!"}
{"text":"I've sat at the bar twice now for breakfast and had a good experience both times.  I can see where they can get packed on the weekends but I like to go midweek to avoid the crowds.  My favorite is the incredible omelet with bacon, sausage, ham and some veggies.  Make sure to order your hash browns crispy or they can be a little mushy.  It also comes with a couple delicious pancakes on the side.  Their coffee is above average.  Overall, I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy prosciutto egg Benedict. Honestly, it was too dry and salty. I also ordered pancakes but they were way too flaky. My brother ordered scrambled eggs and they were also too dry. The only good thing we had were the hash-browns (one star for the hash browns).  I won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. While our server was very well versed in the menu options, all I wanted was a pancake and a couple eggs. Options included protein, fruit, potatoes and what seemed to be a host of other decisions that frankly took away the joy of having breakfast.   But so did waiting for what seemed like 20 minutes to get pancakes and eggs. When it did finally arrive, the portions were shameful.  One order of pancakes with berries came and there were 4 or 5 large pancakes on the plate. My order was 2 pancakes plus a skewer of fruit that should have been cut down to size prior to be served. It really was insane since we could have shared an order of pancakes and we still would have been unable to finish them all!    Our server was really on top of providing anything she could to make the meal pleasant but it wasn't her fault that it took so long. It might make some sense if there was anyone else in the restaurant but it was sparsely populated.   Finally, the pancakes had no taste which might be why they suggest you doctor their cakes with different toppings. This was a bust of a meal when it should be the easiest, tastiest and most reasonable breakfast possible. Big disappointment and wasteful too. Too many other options in the breakfast space."}
{"text":"Way too much food for anyone to finish no matter what you order by server assured us that he's seen little old ladies polish off what we ordered lol! Place was packed when we arrived, but they had plenty of tables and no one ever seemed to wait. Food was delish, I ordered a leeks omelet (and tons of other ingredients), hubby ordered fruity omelet (again tons of stuff) which was also amazing. Came with huge pancakes on the side. Which I promptly took home with half my omelet! Server was nice and attentive and coffee is da bomb (very good brand, name escapes me). Place is loud so be prepared. Cost for what we got was really good I thought. Come with an appetite please or you'll walk out with lots of to-gos!!! ;))"}
{"text":"The ambiance and the food at this place are top notch, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. As I said, the food was incredible (I had the best omelette of my life). I loved the bright indoor/outdoor space and the modern details. Our waiter was very friendly and was clearly trying hard, but the whole staff seemed to struggle with the volume of customers. The kitchen timing was way off - for example, all of our dishes came out as once except for one, which took more than a half hour to arrive after everything else. At one point, a second waiter brought over some plates. We started explaining what went where when he rolled his eyes, slammed our plates on the table and said, \"I'm too busy,\" before running off. It was so inexplicably rude. At the end of the meal, our waiter kindly explained he hadn't charged us for our coffee, but \"didn't hear\" when we responded that we had purchased our coffees at the car prior to being seated. I would probably go back for the food, but I will expect to have a long wait and potentially rude service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was the best part of this place, my food was ok. I really wanted to love this place. My friend and I sat outside, and it was very pretty and then it got super hot we asked our waiter to move and he forgot about us. We then gave our order, my friend got the skinny burrito and I got the steak and eggs. I was excited when the food came, only to find a hair in my eggs. I told the waiter, and he did not apologize, he just said, \"that is a hair\" and took my plate with the eggs. He came back and said that he would have a new egg out shortly... it never came. I had to ask for water 3x because he kept forgetting, along with ketchup. My friend said her burrito was amazing, meanwhile my food was okay. I think the service put a bad taste in my mouth. The bill came, and I still tipped the guy because that is who I am. I told the manager and she was very friendly, and apologized to me for the poor service.  She even gave me a 20.00 gift certificate to make up for it. She was very professional and I appreciated that. However, I am a first impression kind of gal, so I gave the gift certificate to my friend. I probably won't go back. Also there was no chocolate bacon, which was my reason for going in the first place after reading the yelp reviews. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Super bummer that the menu is so excellent and the food is pretty good too...but the service is soooo bad and soooo slow. They need new management for sure!"}
{"text":"Pricey food that is simply not outstanding.  We had very long, confused wait times to get in, and when we were seated, it was outdoors under the burning sun with no shade. When we finally found our waitress, she did move us inside to a cooler table.   We both ordered Eggs Benedict and the eggs were watery, which is just not good. The service was slow at best and the bill seemed unusually high at the end."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  They modified an omelette for me and it was spot on.  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"So i love to come here for brunch on the weekends and always has fabulous food and service. Although my most recwnt visit there was a spill on the floor and a bit on the bar and for the longest time noone cleaned it up. Once somebody did the guy cleaned the floor, tbe counter, then though same rag on top of bar. Bartender then cleans around it, and grabs the rag looks at it questioning whether it was clean or not but decides to put it of to the side but still by drink station. I love the food here and my food was amazing today but cleanliness is questionable. C'mon guys."}
{"text":"If you're feeling hungry this is the place to go.  They have large portions and you can add-on one of their signature pancake items for just a few more dollars.  I've been here a few times and they somehow seem to make a mistake on the order each time.  The \"cooks\" screwed up is the excuse.  If you can get past the spotty service, the food is pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning, there was a small wait. The only negative thing I have to say is that they would not seat us because our whole \"party\" was not there yet... 2/3 of us were there, but they ended up seating a incomplete party of 4/9 people who arrived after us and the whole party wasn't even there yet! Other than that odd rule- the food was great, good atmosphere & the waiter was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Decent food, great service, modern décor.    Belgian waffle was light and tasty, mimosas were okay (a little tart for my taste), bacon slightly undercooked, eggs were light and fluffy (asked for scrambled/well done), and hash browns were okay.  Overall, we were happy enough and plan on returning to try some other menu options."}
{"text":"There is only 1 reason to rate this place anything other than 1 star, and that is, their food. They do a very good job with making large, delicious meals.   With that being said, they don't deserve anything more than 3 stars, at this point in time, because their service, wait time, and patio dining, are all subpar.  Service: After coming here 3 times now, I've had to wait 30+ minutes each time for my food to come out of the kitchen. Each time, I had to wait additionally after that for a set of silverware.   Wait time: It seems that 30 - 40 minutes is typical on a Saturday or Sunday morning here, which is fine for a busy place, so I can't really blame them for. They're just busy.  Patio: It's November, and still fairly hot on their patio. It wouldn't be so much of a problem if they had shade coverings to keep their patrons cool. If you choose to move inside after something has opened up, you may be in jeopardy of losing your food, cause they have trouble keeping track of the table numbers and their patrons.  Overall, I'd still recommend a friend to give it a shot, because their food really is good. Each time I've been here, I leave with a full and satisfied belly. Just frustrated through the process of getting there."}
{"text":"Waffle was amazing. Went here with a sorority sister and the interior was so cute! Staff was friendly and great atmosphere! Highly recommend especially for Instagram pics!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 for a bachelorette party and they sat us in 30 minutes on a busy Sunday morning. The service was fast and friendly. The food was delicious!! Churro Waffles, Spam Sliders, Chocolate covered bacon are just some of the things our party ordered. The bloody marys and mimosas were delicious as well. The atmosphere was very welcoming and fun. Highly recommended! Will definitely come back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"HUGE menu for breakfast / brunch.  Order a Bloody Mary.  Thing is a work of art and comes with chocolate bacon!  Great start to the day!!!"}
{"text":"Jr is one the best servers I have come across in a long time. And the food was so amazing the banana nut crepes was so good I don't have words to describe.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"No clue who could give this place a bad review for food. I believe it's Chef owned, not corporate, creative dishes, huge portions. Open kitchen so you can peak into the kitchen, Now, this place is so busy, weekends expect to wait, look at my pictures and you'll see it's like this all day on weekends, food is incredible...  best espresso too,"}
{"text":"Me and m y daughter eat at eggstasy at least once a week I have recommended it to many of my friends and they love it. I was on a couple weekends ago and received as always exceptional service and attention from lona. I always try to get in her station. My.friends love her too she remembers what you like, your name etc....thank you lona .."}
{"text":"Today was my second breakfast trip and I have also been for lunch. First time was with a large party. This time was right at opening. Each time the food has been good, as has the service. Today the garage doors were up so plenty of fall cool air. When the place is full it can get pretty noisy. Definitely a place I will go back to and continue to recommend."}
{"text":"Under new ownership since I last visited and that is the only reason I chose to return! The decor has been upgraded and the menu is extensive. I ordered a gypsy steak skillet and the portion is more than generous for $16.20. Cooked to perfection!  Ingrid looked after me so well. She was very knowledgeable about my dietary requirements and extremely pleasant. It's my new neighbourhood favourite! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Don't order Vanilla Latte here. It tastes horrible! At that price I can get a much better latte actually 2 lattes at McDonalds. My boyfriend ordered blueberry pancakes and I just had regular waffles and both were very dry. The amount of syrup they give is not enough to cover all of the food and it's not warm syrup as you would except it to be. Very busy place and I am not sure why because the taste of the food here as well as the service is mediocre. They do serve a lot of food but I personally would rather have a smaller portion but taste good than the other way around."}
{"text":"Headed on down to Eggstacy on Saturday morning to have breakfast with my daughter & grandson, it had been awhile since I last had been and I was ready to try them again.  The menu still can be overwhelming, so many choices to choose from, before I got there I was thinking nope not doing an omelet, those things are huge, but after checking out the menu I went ahead and ordered me one haha.  I ordered the Dali's Omelet, it had chorizo, jalapenos, onion and queso, this omelet was the best omelet I have had in a very long time, and it was flavorful, spicy and cooked perfectly!  So dang good!   I also ordered a side of one raspberry white chocolate pancake that is what I originally was headed there to try. It was a fluffy pancake drizzled with white chocolate and topped with raspberries, but it had a brûlée sugar coating on top of the pancake, oh my this was pure sweet bliss!     Another great breakfast down at Eggstacy!"}
{"text":"VERY, VERY loud. I ordered breakfast panning, which was very good, if a bit soggy. The fruit kebab had a rotten strawberry and blackberry. My friend ordered traditional Benedict. The hash browns tasted funny, like the oil was old. There was not enough hollandaise and the waiter never came back to offer more coffee or see how the food was. 2 stars only because my sandwich was tasty."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast joint in the area!! There's a reason why it's ALWAYS SLAMMED. Word has apparently spread..."}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast in the Shea area. The food is very delicious and is served fairly quickly. The crapes and pancakes were amazing as well. Our server was great, she came promptly and was very informed about the menu. It's good to have someone who enjoys their job and people help you. Thanks Sarah for your great service. I will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's bday breakfast!  It was a slight wait for a table of 5.  They got us a table right by the door.  So it was a bit cold every time the door was open.  The service was awesome...  Food was good....  1.  Chocolate pancakes - HELLO!!!!  It is slightly crispy and way to yummy! 2.  Ham & Cheese Omelette - My brother said YOU NEED TO TRY IT (apple gouda chicken sausage) so I added to my omelette.  I have to say, yeah it was great but the omelette itself was ok.  I need to come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Greatest breakfast spot in Scottsdale!  Amazing service, food and atmosphere. Breakfast or lunch, never disappointed. Manager was awesome and surprised us with a homemade strawberry balsamic poptart. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Me and my family were going to eat at Butterfields but the line was ridiculous ridiculously long so we decided here instead. A party of 6 plus 2 babies we only waited a little while. Service was amazing (bianca was our server) and the food was incredible and decently priced. A special shout out to one of the other servers (I didn't catch her name) who went above and beyond to make my 18 month old nephew happy! Even ran after him and his daddy outside to give him a special treat. Whatever your name is thank you! Definitely going back and bringing more next time! Most eggscellent"}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast in Scottsdale and hardly the wait you expect in Old Town. Friendly staff, great food, and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the Dutch Apple French toast. It was amazing.  The service was fast, friendly and our food arrived very quickly. The atmosphere is relaxing and tasteful done, the music wasn't too loud and my party was able to hear each other easily."}
{"text":"Eggstasy was delicious. I want to go back until I can't try everything on the menu or at least a lot more things!! I had the apple brie grape pecan crepes. The combination of fruit and the brie was creamy and sweet, the crunchy apples and pecans mixed with perfectly made crepes. Homerun for the tastebuds and tummy. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Talk about a great menu! Fresh fruit skewers and healthy options like the 'skinny bitch' omelet and the 'super skinny bitch' omelet, I like a restaurant with moxie!They also have banana bread French toast and sweet treats. The bloody Mary's are the bombdiggity! They also have lunch items, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had! Hands down. The cheese Blintz are epic! Coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Second time at eggstasy and it's a great breakfast spot.  Both times our server was great, happy, full of personality and attentive.  The food has been really good and the portions are insane!  I had enough food to make at least 2 meals!  Their menu is extensive and has a lot of great choices so you'd never get bored there.  The food is fresh, tomatoes were ripe and flavorful, lettuce crisp and fresh, breads are great.    One of the best things about the place is that it is very open and light with lots of windows making the ambiance very comfortable.  It's going to be our \"go to\" for breakfast in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow...this place has such potential! Great atmosphere and patio, but poor service. I hope the owners read the reviews and take them to heart....location is perfect, patio is a great place to hang in the Arizona weather, nice large bar. They have a long way to go with service and professionalism. Will not return until I hear they have improved."}
{"text":"Everyone I know raves about this place and now I know why. The service was wonderful - super friendly and helpful. The coffee excellent and the food fabulous! The lemon blueberry French toast was superb! My kids loved the hash browns and Mickey Mouse pancakes too.  The only negative is that it is super loud but everything else makes up for that."}
{"text":"We will not ever eat here. Got out of church on Sunday and called at 12:40 to see how long the wait would be since with the kids we are a party of 5. I was eager to try this place but with 2 kids and a toddler we can't wait 45 mins for a table.   I KNOW Sunday is their busiest day, and having run restaurants many years I also know that they should STAFF FOR IT. I called the restaurant no kidding, a DOZEN TIMES and NO ONE EVER WOULD ANSWER THE PHONE! I don't care how busy you are, you answer the phone when you run a restaurant! As a GM I always had a three ring rule on incoming calls, you have to answer it by three or you might lose the customer. A few times I called, someone picked up and hung up immediately. WTF.   I guess that means they are too busy for my party of 5. FORGETTABOUDIT!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum,yum!   Great atmosphere, wonderful service, with a large variety of healthy food options. I had the protein pancakes which were also gluten free, and they were spectacular. We sat outside on the patio which was a lovely February experience!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"So this is my third time here. Both previous times I have complained on yelp about how slow the service is. On the weekends, forget it, you will wait for an hour if you are lucky. But the other two times it was middle of the day on a weekday. Not too busy. Food took 45 minutes for one thing. Today I was told 15 minutes after I ordered a Turkey burger that there were no more. So I ordered a shrimp salad. A few minutes later the manager came to me to apologize but they are out of shrimp. Im not sure how a kitchen doesnt communicate this to staff???? Anyway, I gave them 2 stArs because they are friendly and the food is usually good. But I wont be coming back again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Huge menu and really nice staff. They also freshly squeeze their juice on the spot. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"My friend invited me to try this restaurant with her since it got such great Yelp reviews. Let's just say it didn't go \"over easy.\" Sadly, my visit wasn't as I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't great either. For all the hype I heard it was a huge let down.  The interior of the restaurant is designed very well and the overall setting is comfortable. The staff was friendly and the service was fine.   Let me start by saying breakfast is one of my favorite meals. I ordered the breakfast panini with fruit on the side. The food was ready within a average amount of time. The sandwich itself was the most depressing part. My eyes gleamed with excitement as they placed it in front of me. I took a bite and confusion immediately set in. The meal looked so wonderful but the taste told me otherwise. Was this a wolf in sheep's clothing deceiving me? The only way I can describe it was that it just tasted bland, it was missing every flavor it listed on the menu. Specifically the eggs, they just didn't taste like eggs should and I'm sorry my poor vocabulary knowledge can't give your imagination a clear picture of how it was. It included avocado, peppers, onions, and bacon I believe. I'm not sure why, maybe because they cooked it with the other ingredients and it affected the taste? I found myself dousing it in Cholula sauce to help give it some flavor. The bread was perfectly crisp and was the only satisfying crunch. The side fruit came out on a skewer and I only had like 6 half pieces of fruit which was disappointing. The sandwich just wasn't that great, I only ate half and I'm a non-picky starving 23 year old. My friends pancakes looked tasty but I didn't try them. I'm sure something else on the menu would be better. It was my first time there, but I would only return if someone else suggested it."}
{"text":"Fast service, amazing food, bubbly, personable & energetic wait staff. We will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Shea. We got to sit outside in the gorgeous weather. Our eggs and bacon were spot on with our request to be scrambled soft and other was over medium. I absolutely loved the coffee, I could not stop drinking it!  Our waiter was new, but I hope this business does well!"}
{"text":"After a little wait fighting off the Scottsdale cold we were sat down at a table in the sun to warm up before the meal. My girlfriend ordered the eggs, corned beef hash, and pancakes while I decided to go all out with the Dutch Apple French Toast with a side of chocolate covered bacon. Let me first say that the strawberry mimosa and fresh squeezed orange juice were just incredible but back to the main event. The beautiful presentation of a half chocolate covered piece of crispy bacon with chocolate drizzle, whipped cream and strawberry was a great start. And then the French toast arrived...Thick French toast covered in caramel, sautéed apples, and graham cracker crumbles, best French toast this side of France, if they even make French toast over there. More food than we could reasonably handle but it won't deter us from returning again. Next time, crispy pancakes...in the eternal words of Arnold Shwarzeneggar, who is not French, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Eggstasy, one of my favorite breakfast spots. Great atmosphere and great food.  You have to try their homemade apple maple sausage.  So good.   Nice patio if you want a quieter atmosphere.   Everything I've had has been so tasty."}
{"text":"My husband loved the house made maple sausage patties. Our juice order was very delicious. Good flavors and very good service. Our server, I think his name was Jake. He was very attentive and super friendly. He made our experience even better."}
{"text":"Just left after having breakfast here for the first time. Arrived at 9:53 on a Sunday morning. I expected them to be busy, and with a party of 5, I also expected to wait for a few minutes. We were told 15-20 minutes. Just before 20 minutes was up, the hostess sat another group of 5 that arrived after we had. I went and asked what was happening. The hostess pointed to a table in the back and said they were waiting for that group to leave so they could seat is there. Not wanting to cause a scene, I said okay and sat back down. 15 minutes passed, during which I watched them seat a group of 5 and another of 6, both of which arrived after us. I went back to the hostess stand and asked why other groups were being seated before us. All the girl said was that they were getting our table ready now and she was sorry, but it's only her third day. I repeated my question, which she had not answered, and they just hustled us along to a table, ignoring my question again. At this point, we were ready to walk out. The only thing that kept us there was the fact that if we went someplace else, we would have to wait again.  The 5 of us were jammed into a 4-top table. I ordered a veggie omelet with no mushrooms and a side of hash browns. My son got a veggie omelet with mushrooms and a side of fruit. When they brought the food, they appeared to have put the wrong omelet with the wrong side dish. I asked about it and was told that the one with hash browns was the one with no mushrooms. A few bites in, I discovered he was wrong. My supposed no-mushroom omelet did, in fact, have mushrooms. I guess the runner just wanted to avoid the hassle of double-checking. Good thing I'm not allergic to mushrooms.  I was incredibly disappointed with the apparent lack of caring demonstrated by the hostesses and the runner. The only reason for the two stars rather than a single star is that the food was indeed good, mushrooms not withstanding. I will not visit again, nor will I recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is their food however I would be cautious as to who handles your food or if they wash their hands. We came to this place a couple of times before and didn't notice how disgusting it was until recently. We sat at the bar and watched the chaos unfold as one waitress yelled at another waiter and then burst out into tears and then continued serving tables slamming and throwing things, followed by an entire staff under the age of 25 who had no idea what they were doing. They did not clean up anything after themselves and some of them didn't even look old enough to be behind a bar handling food and fruit with their hands. Behind the bar was a complete disaster everything all over the floor, trash, flies...absolutely disgusting the kitchen didn't look much better but at least the food was okay. hopefully you can cook out the disgustingness of what I saw. Absolute disgrace, the manager of this place really needs to clean up his staff and run a tight ship. Service was incredibly poor as well. Not Scottsdale material."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place.  Menu is creative and on trend with both guilty and healthy options.  Today's breakfast flatbread was inedibly salty.  The restaurant was really apologetic.  The chocolate covered bacon was also a miss.  First time our family hasn't finished an order of bacon.  It was cold and soggy.  Will definitely give it another try bc service and effort on behalf of the staff were great but it will probably not ever be on my go-to list."}
{"text":"I watched the bus boy grab glasses from inside glass with hands that just cleaned tables, and hold stacked coffee cups up to his sweaty shirt chest. The food is tasty but seriously question health ratings! Mgmt needs to pay attention"}
{"text":"Unusual breakfast dishes with large portions and beautiful presentation.  Love coming here!"}
{"text":"The clever name of the restaurant had me sold before I even walked in!  EGGSTACY was a great place for brunch! I ordered the Incredible omelette with hash browns and pancakes. I enjoyed my meal accept the pancakes were extremely sweet even without syrup.  My favorite thing was the Strawberry Mimosa...refreshing and strong. Perfect drink for my meal.   I highly recommend EGGSTACY!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place for menu, atmosphere, quality and speed.  We love that there usually isn't a wait and the menu had great classics and trendy items that are all Delish. Colorful open dinning area with open kitchen is inviting and fun. The only reason it didn't  get 5 stars is because it's hard to get a refill on coffee, I've had to get up and get it myself from a carafe, it'd be great if they could just leave a carafe on the table."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday for brunch not knowing what to expect, and now its my favorite breakfast spot! I got the Belgian waffle with strawberries and it was so tasty! They get an A+ in presentation too. When you get your food you automatically want to start digging in. Our waiter was so nice too! She went above and beyond for us and I really appreciated it. When my friend and I got there they did not have much service and that could play a toll in why we got really great service so I am curious too see what it's like on a busy day. All together, my breakfast was perfect and I would totally come again and again."}
{"text":"Eggstacy has Officially Jumped the Shark.  I can only hope the leadership cares enough to read each and every word of this review.  So I was a BIG fan of Eggstacy in the early months but the last five times I have visited, the service, food and ambiance have imploded.  I mourn for the loss of yet another Phoenix restaurant.  I don't know the inner dynamics of what has gone so horribly wrong at this place but just watch the interplay at the open kitchen window between the expediter and wait staff and you can witness that all cylinders are misfiring.  The wait staff is victim to the kitchen fails and the kitchen is getting flooded with a failure of the front to professionally manage pacing, menu descriptions and simple bussing of tables.    But you, reader, want details so let's organize and paint the picture from tip to tail.  Reception stand: Somehow the restaurant industry has managed to carve a special place for pretty young girls with little capacity for common sense.  The front desk has become something to suffer rather than welcome.  This last visit was for my wife's birthday breakfast.  We made a reservation for 8 one week in advance.  The weather unexpectedly turned cold, so I called in two hours ahead to inquire if we could ensure an inside table.  The desk could not find the reservation at first and later revealed that they kept a separate book for reservations and walk ins.  With the reservation now found, they were accommodating on the phone.  We arrive 10 minutes early and checked in at the desk.  I could recognize the bubbly voice of the gal at the desk from the phone...and again she cannot locate the reservation...until I ask if it may be in the reservation book.  At least the table was set and ready.  Other people, however, were visibly upset by the desk.  It is set just inside the main entrance and creates a choke point.  The is no civility in the mob rush of the desk and this crowd mismanagement further impedes the ability of patrons finished with their meal to exit.  Additionally, During a lull I asked the hostess how they s at the tables and her answer was simple, \"We just seat the next group once the table is set.\"  But when I asked if they consider the load upon the servers in seating 2-3 tables in a section all at once, she replied that she didn't understand what I was asking.  I am sure there's an app that could remedy this.  Ambiance: Just read the better reviews and you can tell the public is keenly aware this place is just too loud.  The decibels rival pit row at a NASCAR event.  Even at the end of my last visit when I was talking to the manager table side, I found that both she and I were yelling at each other just to be heard three feet away.  Perhaps the interior designer is a retired rock star or jackhammer operator with major hearing loss.  The tile floors, arabesque tile walls, steel beam ceiling and total absence of soft structures is simply dumb.  To the owners, spend a little coin on some heavy drapes to frame the Windows, baffle the ceilings and  you will immediately change the decibels to a pleasant range whereby patrons could leave feeling good about the conversation and the food.  At the Table: Be leery of ordering drinks ahead of your meal.  The staff routinely greets you promptly but once that drink order is in, you typically loose sight of your server for 5-10min.  On this last visit, four hot chocolates, one coffee, one latte and two mimosas took 15 min to deliver.  Made worse, the hot chocolate was missing the \"hot\" and the coffee was bitter or burned.  The second cup of coffee (30min later when the waitress finally brought a pot around for refills) was worse.  Also, a simple tip to all those wait staff out there: if you are filling a cup, leave enough room for your diner to add cream or sugar to their liking.  Nobody wants a piping hot cup filled to the rim spilling on the table before they can make it the way they like it.  Move on to ordering.  Nobody should be set free on the public if they don't know the menu.  For at least six months, many of the items on the menu are described one way but now churned out of the kitchen in that manner.  This happens from time to time but it is the waiter's responsibility to represent those changes.  Once upon a time Eggstacy served a pretzel bun croque madame...that is still inaccurately haunting the menu.  For the last six months, they have been \"out\" of the pretzel buns yet they continue to appear amazed the kitchen serves this flavorless bechemel-drenched mess over flavorless brioche.  So the \"Food\": Mehh....perhaps they have changed suppliers or the original owners turn keyed their restaurant to a soulless corporation riding a wave of popularity, no longer resembling quality.  With eight people at the table, statistically they couldn't ALL be terrible...could they?  1.  The Rueben -  I am certain that a Reuben has corned beef and sauerkraut typically on rye.  The meat that was served contains approximately 10% of the fla"}
{"text":"Cute little gem in Scottsdale. It gets really packed but that's because this place is awesome. It's got a neat decor very upbeat. The waitress said they are going to put in a new ceiling to address the noise issue because it is pretty loud when it's busy. They have a cute patio area that wasn't open yet but I can already tell will be a hit. Food portions are huge so you can probably split a meal or take leftovers."}
{"text":"This place was a real surprise. Was super crowded but we were seated on the patio right away. Great breakfast food and had turkey and chicken sausage options. Check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place, including the impressive options on the \"healthy\" and \"healthier\" menu. Sat at the bar and ate the most incredible \"healthy\" berry crepes I've ever had. The blackberries are the size of my thumb - they do not skimp! Luckily it's a weekday so not too busy because this place has a line out the door on weekends. The coffee is strong and today was not a mimosa day but those are awesome here as well. And I'm not a Bloody Mary drinker but here, they are works of art and can include bacon!! Back to the crepes again...I'll be dreaming about them."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are insane! Got a whole lotta food for only 10 bucks! This place is a must go for breakfast."}
{"text":"My go-to for breakfast been coming here for years the pancakes are to die for and the omelets are delicious my girlfriend likes to get the skillets. The mimosas are also very good and fresh OJ. I recommend this place to anyone. It's never too busy either"}
{"text":"Really good service and friendly staff. The menu is so big it's almost overwhelming so ask for suggestions. Depending on what you like, sweet or savory breakfasts there are tons of options for both. I however like both so I got the steak eggs Benedict with avocado and the macadamia banana nut pancakes. Both were good but the pancakes were phenomenal. I mean, so good. But like, straight up dessert haha we devoured it all and will be back.   Oh and the Oj is literally fresh squeezed which is why it's lol $5 a glass"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a year now with the best corn beef hash I have had to date!  Food is great and on top of that cannot even finish the portions. The service was great and manager came by to check on everything!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been at the club, feelin' fly in your shortest dress and sparkliest hooker glitter makeup, and been like, \"dang! I could really go for pancakes right now\"? But, if you went for pancakes, you'd lose your buzz and maybe your random hookup? No one should have to choose between getting drunk, being seen/getting laid, and pancakes. Thank the sweet baby Jesus for Eggstasy.   Housed in an innocuous appearing strip mall in Scottsdale, Eggstasy is truly like having breakfast in a nightclub. The \"hostesses\", who clearly look to the Kardashian family for fashion guidance, look at my handbag when I come in, not me. The space is pure Ikea, sparsely decorated, cheap and cheesy. While walking to your table, everybody is checking everybody else out hard and not trying to hide it. It is a goddamn fashion show -- stupid, but entertaining.  The coffee totally sucks and is barely edible -- super burnt and bitter. The servers are nice but overwhelmed; orders go in and come out wrong; empty cups go unfilled of shitty coffee. Twice in row, they've given us food that was ordered by mistake, saying \"oh, just have it, don't worry about it\". It is noisy; it isn't cheap. It is crowded; be prepared to wait.  So why the hell four stars, you're asking. One: The OJ is juiced on site and is incredible. Two: the whole wheat and berry pancakes, from the HEALTHY part of the menu, are literally the best fucking pancakes I've ever had. It must be the whole wheat, it gives them a little more heft and texture and allows them to get all perfectly crispy around the edges. Then they pile on mountains of fresh berries. I mean, really -- I am powerless. Three: It is way too much fun to play \"let's traumatize the Scottsdalites\" by showing up in pajamas and no makeup just to see the looks on their buffed and powdered faces. Four: the owners, a Greek family from Chicago, are always there, checking in and getting their hands dirty to help out. I love that. Plus, Greeks from Chicago? They make the world's most amazing food.  Lastly, the Bloody Marys look amazing. Is that chocolate covered bacon in there? If I hadn't already resigned myself to be so uncool as to admit to disliking day drinking, I would be all over that."}
{"text":"Very busy when we arrived with Sunday brunch crowd. Told us it would be 50-60 minute wait, but they seated us in less than a half hour.   Service was hectic and awful but our server was nice enough. He was on his 3rd day and was not familiar with the menu. We ordered two breakfast items and two lunch items.   Wife ordered a signature Bloody Mary and it looked terrific with the chocolate covered bacon and all. But was way over spiced with horseradish.   The orange juice was not cold but did taste like fresh. The water was sadly filled with cucumber. Upon request, they brought regular water too.  In the final analysis, we can't give it more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"How this place has 4 overall stars is beyond me.  I took my son here a few weeks ago & I'm still ticked off about our experience.  First off, let me start with the only positive thing I have for this restaurant...it has a very cool modern look and feel, which I like. Now for the rest of our experience...the music is so loud you can barely hear anything else, so I opted to sit outside.  The patio is quite large, but has absolutely no shading from the sun, it's Arizona, the sun is out 95% of the year!  I had to move my son 3 times to try & keep the sun out of his eyes.  Next, it took over 10 minutes for anyone to come over & greet us, and take a drink order.  When the waiter finally came by, I could barely hear him or understand him because he was talking so soft, I swear he was on something by the way he was acting.  I asked if we could go ahead and place our food order since my son was getting really hungry & restless.  I ordered buttered noodles for my son and bacon and eggs for me, it took 40 minutes to get our food!!!  The place was not even that busy.  I will say that the eggs were really good, but when I picked up the bacon, the grease dripped off in a huge puddle, like it was not even drained off, yikes!  Now for my son's food, he will eat just about anything you put in front of him, but as soon as he put the noodles in his mouth he spit them right back out, I have no idea what they did to them, but he just wouldn't eat them.  I told the waiter when he finally walked by again that he just couldn't eat them & asked if I could I order something different & he said that was fine & he said he would take it off the check.  I asked him to see if they could rush it & 25 minutes later, still no food for my son, I called the waiter over & he said the kitchen was really busy & couldn't give him a timeframe as to when the food would be out (again, not a ton of people in there at this time), so I said to just cancel the new order & asked if I could have the check.  He brought the check & it still had the buttered noodles on it, so I called him over again and reminded him that he said he would take it off, he then proceeded to argue with me about taking it off the check, I asked to speak to a manager & he told me that no managers are employed there...what?!?!?!  He finally got snarky and said he would take it off. Not a good experience at all for us or for the other 4 tables around me from what I observed."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a go-to breakfast place in the area and finally came across Eggstasy on Yelp. A group of us met here on a weekday morning, and were fortunate to find seating immediately. The large interior was clean, with tables spread across the large floor coupled with great natural lighting. The ambiance was relaxed, casual, and the noise level was high. They have an enticing breakfast menu, with the support of a juice and espresso bar, and a kitchen that delivers an array of savory and sweet dishes.   The Heart Healthy Omelette ($10.95) was gigantic, with plenty of egg whites to wrap around an abundance of turkey, artichoke hearts, red onions, and low-fat cheese. The dish also included fresh fruit on the side to give breaks to the savory flavors. It was delicious, healthy, and satisfying.  The Red Velvet Cake French Toast ($9.95) was made with a dense and moist red velvet cake. However, the buttermilk flavor was hidden from the warm sweet icing that also competed with the chocolate shavings. All together, it was better than the version at Wildberry, but also very rich and too sweet for the morning.   Crispy Pancakes ($9.95) came with large in-your-face pancakes deep-fried to crisp that still carried a nice chew. It was served with a delicious caramel dipping sauce that nicely complemented the burnt crispy part of the pancake. It was highly addictive and I had to have the last bite.   Service was friendly and attentive. Santi and I tried to return on the following weekend, but the place was so packed that we decided to go elsewhere. As a lesson learned, interested diners should consider calling in ahead of time to get onto the wait list. To date, Eggstasy is my top place for breakfast and brunch in the area for its large portions, creative dishes, and unassuming ambiance. I would be interested in returning to try their Pumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes, Stuffed Brioche French Toast, and other Omelettes."}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast I have ever had the egg whites were still running on the eggs I ordered, they got my boyfriends order wrong twice, and never ended up getting it right so we just gave up and they never brought him any utensils even after we asked for some. Definitely never coming back and others beware. Terrible experience!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place I've found since moving to Scottsdale! The food, service, and ambiance are all quite enjoyable. The service is very friendly and the servers seem to know their menu. The food is simply unbelievable. I couldn't ask for a better breakfast anywhere else.   The owner (possibly manager) greeted my friend and I and after discovering it was our first experience at the restaurant he brought us little samples of crepes. I wouldn't ever order crepes on my own but after trying these my mind was blown! I don't remember the name but I'm pretty sure they were banana and Nutella. My favorite part of the meal had to be the teas though. To say the food was amazing is one thing, but this little place was on point with everything, even that delicious tea!  I can't wait to go back to Eggstacy for another amazing breakfast and experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town from San Diego, so we went to lunch with my cousin and her family who live in Phoenix, and they recommended Eggstasy. I was pretty impressed by this place! They have a huge variety of breakfast and lunch items to choose from. I ordered the yogurt parfait, it was perfect! It came with a side of blueberry bread, it could have been better; I wasn't a fan of the powdered sugar on top, it made it taste kind of bland. Every time my cousin and her boyfriend come here they get the same thing: steak and eggs. The steak was cooked to perfection and it was juicy.  We ordered the pomegranate juice which was pretty good, and I love that they give you a pitcher of cucumber water so that you can fill your water glass up so you don't have to keep asking for more. The service was great! Our waitress was extremely friendly and sweet so we appreciated that. The atmosphere was pleasant and it's a great place for families. Overall we enjoyed our visit here!"}
{"text":"Eggcellent menu options with really unique dishes! They have omelettes, French toast, skillets, paninis, sandwiches, wraps, salads, pancakes, waffles, crepes, and so much more. I had an omelette with mascarpone, quinoa, swiss chard and prosciutto. I also tried the side of waffle & and it was deliciously crispy and not dense. It came with a side of fruit, some powdered sugar and maple syrup. I had the fresh strawberry orange juice and thought it was good but a bit sweet. I also tried the pomegranate juice which was also a bit too sweet but had a great tart flavor. My brother said the pancakes were fluffy and delicious. I'd love to come back to try their other dessert breakfast options.  There's plenty of parking and I'm unsure if they take reservations. Your party has to be 100% present for you to be seated. They have an outdoor patio area and a large indoor dining space. They also offer a bunch of coffee options like espresso, lattes, americanos, etc."}
{"text":"First time at this location and had the same experience \" fantastic\"! I actually like this location better than on Shea because it's less noisy.  Our waiter Niki/Kiki was excellent, she was so sweet and had the patient like a saint despite we came in a big group with different personalities.  The food was delicious, everything was just great!  Thank you Eggstasy and see you soon!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here more lately and we usually come in a big family group of 8-10. We really enjoyed every meals that we had here and the service is excellent!  Briana was our waitress today for our brunch and she was super nice and helpful.  We had a generous compliment from the owner's mom it was red velvet pancakes, delicious!  Thank you a Eggstasy!"}
{"text":"I order from Eggstasy a lot via Postmates and Uber Eats. I always get the Eggasm and I always love it.   Today was my first time actually going in, and I've refrained from coming in because of the reviews I've read about the not-so-great service. After my experience today, I'm very aware of why people complain about the service and I probably won't eat from Eggstasy again.   We sat on the patio and waited over 15 minutes for someone to come over and greet us and take our order.   I brought my Mom here, and I ordered the Eggasm and my Mom ordered the Eggs Benedict. My food was except, minus the extreme amount of oil on my plate, but I was able to save my toast by removing it immediately.   My moms eggs were completely raw, as soon as she cut the eggs, they were slimy and raw and really gross. When I got up and brought the plate to the bar, the bartender was nice but our waiter was really rude and made me feel inconvenient. They remade my Moms meal but 20 minutes later mine was now cold, waiting for hers to come out. Her eggs were then hard boiled. I guess they don't know how to cook eggs. The ham on the Eggs Benedict was also thicker than the English muffin, which i found a bit revolting, but even cut in small slices my mom said was gross.   I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite spots! Food is amazing and customer service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Gross. The place was in disrepair and disorganized. . At first it didn't look too bad but the more you paid attention the more you saw and the worse it got. Sat on the patio on a beautiful Sunday morning. We were seated at a table that had food & napkins and trash left under it from the last people who had sat there. Several of the patio umbrellas were broken and falling down. Some were tossed off in a corner obviously unusable. The food was just ok. Our waitress Christa was nice and did a good job but I think we got lucky. The bathroom was disgusting, dirty, broken trash can so that you couldn't even throw your hand towel away. All making me wonder how does the kitchen look. Yuk."}
{"text":"This place lost me was I watched several health code violations occurring across from our table and nobody seemed to care. This included the dog eating from the plate."}
{"text":"5.50. In many countries that is the annual wage of a migrant worker. In this country, specifically at the brunch destination so fondly called \"eggstasy\", that is the price of an orange juice. The juice of an orange, the sweet, pulpy substance found within the thick rind of one of Arizona five C's. While I, along with every other living breathing mortal to set foot in a brunch establishment, enjoy the tart nectar, I have my limits. 5.50 exceeds those limits. It goes so far as to test my faith in humanity, my certainty in the sanctity of our children. Yes, our children."}
{"text":"The food here is good and affordable, the service was excellent!  Very friendly staff and very efficient.  We didn't feel rushed which is a pet peeve of mine.  The eggs I ordered were cooked perfectly and not greasy. The coffee was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars.  If you want to eat alone and not converse with anyone, then this is the place to go. Certainly not a ladies lunch out place if you want to actually hear each other.  They truly need to improve the sound level.  Also, throwing in a few dividers in the place would be nice.  It is like walking into a middle school cafeteria."}
{"text":"I wasn't even going to waste time in writing this review, but after I left the breakfast 'nightclub' known as eggstacy I had to. I have no idea why this place is so busy, except that while looking around at the high school age filled tables, I can guess. The only bright point in this adventure was our waiter, a young kid who was trying his best to salvage the disaster of food the kitchen had sent out. I'll spare the description of food, it's not worth it. We sent it back and it came back worse (did not eat it). The noise level in place rivaled the interior of a crashing jet, but the food would probably be better on the plane. Save your time, your money, your hearing and make just toast at home, it'll be a better experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The outdoor seating was nice and misted, definitely a cool ambience! I got the lemon blueberry French toast and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Update, 19/1/15  Pros Can't stress enough how good the food is and the big plates that are full with goodes.   Cons However the service is very slow and not good enough.   Plus it gets very very loud for some reason."}
{"text":"Average food. Above average expense. Nice wait staff but just not organized."}
{"text":"Eggstacy is a great spot for brunch! It has a fun, open layout with colorful decor! The omelet and coffee have never disappointed and they have fruit kabobs that come as a side for a dishes - Delish!!"}
{"text":"The crepe we has were tasty, good size portion, prompt delivery. That is all that is pertinate"}
{"text":"We love this place for Sunday breakfast.  Good food for everyone!  Love all the omelette choices and kiddos love the pancakes.  Service has always been quick and good.  Love that they have the patio too!"}
{"text":"Heard positive things about this place so I was happy when a friend suggested it for our breakfast today. It's in a nice area and has great decor with an open setting. We didn't notice they had a patio until we left, and it was really nice. We would've rather eaten there! Everyone was friendly and the waiter checked up on us plenty of times.  This is probably one of the longest menus I've seen at a breakfast place, which usually overwhelms me. Just give me one page and limit my options! But seriously, a great selection and lots of lunch choices too. I ordered the sun-dried tomato, goat cheese and pine nut omelette. Delicious combo! I got hash browns and pancakes on the side, both great and the cakes are huge. Overall I really enjoyed this place and hope to come back."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I think I am still full from Sunday Brunch last week! From the street you dont even notice this amazing Gem off of Shea! Its a must visit but get there early as they get a long waiting list early. We were a party of 3 and found a seat at the bar. Don't know how the service was but seemed a bit slim.  TIP!!!!!!-- The bar is all open seating, if its a small group, place your name on the list and go stand by the bar for people to leave, turns a 1.5 hour wait into a 15 minute wait.   For their food.. Watch out for the portions, they are massive, Had the corn beef hash and eggs, I dont know how I finished it but it was massive. The pancakes are the fluffiest ive ever had. We defined them as ..... Fluff-tastic !! Yes we made up a word because they were so good.   On top of that, you have to try the chocolate covered bacon. Its a must!  Down side, no drink specials and nothing too fancy, its all about the food not the drinks  When I feel like I can eat that much again, im going back but will make sure to workout all week leading up to it.   A must try!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for  an anniversary breakfast.  Sara was our server and she was amazing Food is always great"}
{"text":"Intense menu. Long list of breakfast favs with little twists. It would take a long time to try them all. And I bet they would all be tasty. Had the chiliquilis, yum!"}
{"text":"Huge omelet portions and fresh squeezed OJ. If only I wasn't working I would have loved to taste a mimosa. The food was delicious; the menu is quite extensive. They have a pretty big outdoor patio that from what I heard gets pop'n for brunch. A must try while visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"Breakfast lunch mimosas. Ok, but where are the mimosas on the menu? Besides the fact that we didn't order any mimosas because they weren't on the menu, we enjoyed our breakfast here. The portions are huge so if you are coming with family I would strongly recommend sharing. The food could have fed three of me! I got an omelette with caramelized pear and brown sugar and it was delicious. As was the raisin walnut toast it was served with. The butter was freshly whipped so that was nice touch. Hash browns were just ok and could have been cooked a bit longer but it's hard to mess up hash browns too bad. I will ask for them crispier next time. Husband ordered red velvet pancakes which again could have fed three of him. He really enjoyed them as a special breakfast treat. Basically dessert! They were topped with chocolate sauce too. They have nice outdoor seating here too. Please just put the mimosas on the menu though haha."}
{"text":"The name says it for itself... Eggstacy which is Eggcelent. I can't tell you how many times my boyfriend and I leave super impressed with the food and service. We always request Jr. As our server."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place after seeing the reviews on here.  We waited for about 30 minutes for our table, which isn't too bad in general, but upon being seated I figured out what the break in the chain is: the kitchen.    Our waiter, Luke, was competent and friendly.  As we waited for food, I couldn't help but notice large gatherings of servers standing at the food \"window\" waiting for the seemingly missing dishes from their orders.  Plates would appear one at a time, which was odd since the average table size was 4+.  It became obvious that food tickets weren't being completed a ticket at a time, instead, they were batching meals.    Our appetizer, chocolate covered bacon, came out just before our meals started to be delivered...which took about 20 minutes after ordering.  One side of pancakes (regular) were delivered.  Then, a few minutes later, the second and third side of pancakes (pumpkin cheesecake).  Then, yet another few minutes later, the french toast entree arrived.  It took almost 10 minutes for the omelets to come out.  One side of pancakes never came out, so we got them to go.    The food was very good!  The kitchen manager was seen speaking very \"animated\" to the waiters and line cooks, which was unprofessional and, from what I could tell, he was the weak link (in the white shirt on the left facing away in the picture).  Ticket times were all over the place, and orders were not being delivered all-at-once.   The restaurant has been around for 5 weeks, so they should be over growing pains like this.  We will be back for the food, though.  For those complaining about the noise: I feel you.  No carpet, no cushions, all hard surfaces!    They take reservations, which is good!"}
{"text":"Modern and nice. Just sat. And no other customers here. Early or ?  My second breakfast experience past couple days and nobody here but myself. Cool. Should have great service. So I have asked for a variety. Crepes of banana, bacon, chile, and a grilled grapefruit...hmm. Interesting idea. And housemade maple sausage. Orange juice drink is excellent.  Sausage is very good and portions nice with 2 large handmade patties. Grapefruit actually really good also. The crepe is large portion and beautiful and really good. Definitely to return for more."}
{"text":"Beyond heartbroken...This place was amazing when they first opened. Sadly, it appears to have already jumped the shark.   The quinoa asparagus skillet was once balanced and delicious. It now lacks quinoa. Except for the 12 pieces we were able to excavate from among the undercooked potato hash.   The brisket and gravy wasn't actually brisket at all. When asked about the brisket, our server assured us it was made in-house and was delicious. Well, maybe the grilled steak was made in house, but there was no brisket. And given how early we came in for brunch, it's not like they had time to run out of it this morning.   The lemon blueberry french toast was so bland even my kid pushed it to the side and asked if there was something else to eat.   We would have ordered something else except that our order took almost an hour to come out and we were so disappointed in the slow service and drop in food quality that at that point, we just wanted to pay our bill and leave.  Finally, we very clearly requested no fruit to be placed on any dishes because of a severe pineapple allergy. Remarkably, it came out on almost every plate. All that was done to rectify the issue was removing the fruit. Not helpful when you're that allergic to pineapple. Like hospitalization allergic.  What a disappointing turn for a spot with so much potential."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The pancakes are to die for. They're huge so get a stack to share. Also they have a healthy breakfast burrito called the skinny b****. Full of flavor but doesn't make you feel disgusting and full. The service is always been fairly good. It is really loud inside so I recommend you said outside."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was not made correctly and for being my first time the owner argued with me instead of fixing my order.  The waiter was kind enough and took care of it for me.  Very disappointed in the owner of the restaurant.  Ruined my mother's day for my mom.........never going back again."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Great healthy options and a variety that can keep you coming back fo0r weeks  without ordering the same dish - gyros skillet was right on point . Service was excellent .This is now on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I got sick for days after eating here. Never again! My boyfriends eggs smelt like fish. I got sick first, he followed shortly after. Some staff were friendly, the rest were lazy."}
{"text":"WORST breakfast ever! The only saving grace was the bartender. He was a nice guy. Asked for avocado toast: not difficult. Soggy toast, tasteless Ava ado and little of it. And if you are vegan, skip the Bloody Mary because they adorn it with chocolate covered bacon. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I start?  Finally hit this place up yesterday for brunch with a girlfriend and our sons.  Convinced the friend I was meeting today for brunch to go there instead of Postino!  The menu is fantastic.  We tried the prosciutto and asparagus flatbread and the pumpkin pancakes yesterday, and shared.  You get HUGE servings.  We had the prosciutto omelette today with a side of pumpkin pancakes because they were so good yesterday I had to have them again, and we shared again.  The kids tried the chocolate chip pancakes and were thrilled.  Couple suggestions:  -Don't sit at the bar unless you are in a hurry.  The service was WAY better in the restaurant.  Not thrilled with our service today at the bar. -The strawberry mimosas are great but only when stirred.  Ask for a straw and stir it up before you take a sip.  YUM. -Yes, it's loud, but that's part of the awesomeness.  It's super kid friendly and also adult brunch friendly.  Something for everyone.  Baby crying? That's okay!  Arguing with the husband?  That's okay!  This place will drown it out and you'll be so happy with your full belly and amazing food when you leave that you'll forget your woes. -Do NOT go there for the first time and not order the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes.  They are light, fluffy, and have a tad bit of salt so they are not as heavy and sweet as you would think a dish like this would be.  I can see why they are the signature.  WOW. -Their hash browns are off the chain.  Go with a friend, order any omelette (which comes with hash browns) and get the pumpkin pancakes.  They split it for you with no upcharge and it's enough food for 4 people. -Chocolate covered bacon.  Order it.  No questions.  Need I say more?  It's chocolate covered bacon!  This is our new brunch spot.  We've been loyal Four Peaks brunchers for years.  Glad to have a new spot to break things up a bit."}
{"text":"Ok so I found this place on Yelp and the food pics looked amazing. Got there at lunch time on a friday afternoon, got seated right away, and drinks ordered. First, drink order seemed to confuse the waiter and the bar staff, they were both lost on our mocha, oj, and 2 kids chocolate milk??? ok, is that hard? Geez. Fine, food ordered. Our waiter seemed young and confused (not the best, but he tried I guess). Food took forever due to \" well done skirt steak takes a long time\" umm why? Got the food about 40 mins later and I received a burnt piece of dry thin steak and my 6 yr old received raw burgers. Food got sent back only to receive 1 of 2 burgers raw again, My steak was fixed and much better, however food had no seasoning. Steak, burgers, and hash browns were super bland and cold might I add. Oh and the cherry on top? No AC and no fans on! It was 100+ degrees out. This place has so much potential and I do want to come back. Pancakes and french toast were very good. Staff and cooks need to be improved. Overall meh experience. They did take the kids burgers off the bill, but still doesn't change my review."}
{"text":"This place is great! Gave up Good Egg for this morning spot! Peter is awesome already knows our orders and you can see they really want their customers to be happy! Big shout out to Iliya he is a good employee there."}
{"text":"The very fact reviews vary between good and terrible speaks to the inconsistency and we believe the ultimate undoing of this restaurant. Walked in and seated promptly. The menu looked incredible. That's it. Fell apart from there, 1) the service is horrendous. Our waitress and all others were unsmiling sourpusses who moved glacially. Had the restaurant been busy, then the wait to see a waitress and the wait for food would have been understandable especially if the food is great. They were not that busy. Call me quirky but I like a smiling pleasant waitress. 2) the poor service was not for want of staff. They were all chronically aggregated at the side doing nothing and when the food came out,  no one was sure where it should go. There was no expediter. Compared to restaurants like Butterfields which always has a line to get in, this was pure amateurish and clearly without a manager. There was a very young lady in the front that was pitifully unknowledgeable.  3) worst coffee I have had in years. They claim it is premium stuff. It was bitter and overly strong suggesting machine not cleaned and proportions wrong 4)never got to the food because watching this whole thing was painful and very slow  Spoke with someone that claimed to be the mother of the owner and she may have been the cook. She blew us off  Too many other options out there. A shame as menu appeared very promising"}
{"text":"The service made our experience an agonizing headache.  I sat down at our outdoor table before my husband came in with our son. From our young, inexperienced server, I ordered our two mimosas, a strawberry pomegranate juice in a kids cup, and a kids scrambled egg breakfast with sausage and hash browns. Once they came in, we settled in and enjoyed the open patio on the Sunday morning. The kids drink came out (no mimosas yet) and it was a very thick juice, so I diluted with some water and my son couldn't get enough of it! I then ordered eggs over medium with extra crispy bacon and my husband asked for the Incredible omelette with no mushroom and extra crispy hash browns. The server wrote everything down and even repeated a bit of it back to us.  This is where it started getting annoying.  - Kid's breakfast came out with bacon. Was sent back for sausage. - Had to ask for silverware. - Asked for straws for our waters and an extra napkin, which was thrown on the table. - Asked two extra times about the location of our mimosas. - Hash browns were not crispy, as requested. - (omelette actually had no mushrooms, so small victory) - Bacon was soggy.  By the time we got to my bacon, I was pretty much through with this place, but my son had eggs, which are his favorite, so we weren't going anywhere. I sent back my plate for the chef to get my bacon to extra crispy and then.............................. it never came back. My husband didn't touch his gigantic plate of omelette (that thing's seriously huge. split that shit) because he's a gentleman who waits for everyone to get their meal. Our server uncomfortably sees I still don't have my plate and makes a beeline inside. We notice him continuing to help other tables, so we just wait. He sees our table again, stops and says he'll go check on my bacon. When he comes back out, he looks a little frantic, saying that my plate must have gone out to the wrong table. So I ask for the manager.   The manager comes and asks us how our meal is. We explain that I don't have my meal and that my husband hasn't even tried his yet. We tell her about our wait for mimosas (which ended up coming out about when we got our food) and all other issues which led to this moment. Not saying anything to us, she turns her head and calls out to the server to begin asking him if this is true. She walks him inside. Uh, what? I thought this was going to be a conversation between us and you. I am but a human being - I need closure! And THEN you do your managerial thing in your professional way to a server who doesn't know what he's doing because this is a learning experience. But, no. When my husband walked up to her to ask what was going on, I chugged my mimosa and asked the server for our tab for only the mimosas and the kids meal. He tried to explain to me his actions in a very unprofessional way (it's really busy, it's Saturday, you didn't tell me you wanted mimosas, you never said the bacon needed to be extra crispy!) until he finally left, effectively making me very uncomfortable. When the the server finally came back out, he told us to \"just go\" and that he's getting chewed out by his manager now, so thanks. No, kid. Thank YOU for this experience.   As we were gathering our things, the manager came back out and turned into the woman that I'd hoped she'd be from the get-go. Apologetic, understanding, and caring. She even handed my husband an envelope, saying she would really like us to come back and try them again. Maybe, he tersely replied.  When we got to the car, he opened the envelope. A $10 gift certificate. For wasting my time and a beautiful Sunday morning?? What a joke. We gave it to a waiting couple and will never ever come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was thoroughly impressed! My sister and I went in on a Monday morning and had excellent service! If you like pancakes, I would highly recommend the lemon blueberry ones! The menu is Full of different options and healthy alternatives all for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"A good pun for a name will always have me interested in a at least giving the place a try. So when meeting some friends for brunch, why not try Eggstasy? To sum up my experience eating there; Pretty good food, but length of the dining experience was unnecessarily long.  My group of four adults and a baby walked in at 10:30am on a Sunday morning, but didn't leave until about 12:30pm. Like at any breakfast place, anywhere, I expected the 30 minute wait to get a table on a weekend morning (especially a Sunday). But what I didn't expect was to wait another 30 minutes for my food to come after I ordered it. One of the best parts about going out for breakfast is how quickly it can be cooked up. It was obvious the kitchen was in the weeds. We could easily see all the runners and servers standing around waiting for orders. And an apologetic waiter could only do so much."}
{"text":"I am writing to express my disappointment with today's service, ironically this is not my first time eating here. My first visit to Eggstasy was quite pleasant, and this is why we decided to pay this place a visit again. Based on today's service, I don't that I will be back here anytime soon. My server was not only inattentive but seemed very apologetic when she made a huge error on my wife's order. My wife and I are always very explicit when it comes to not having any pork or pork products in our meal; I let the first 4 mistakes slide (steak not cooked appropriately; hash browns not cooked correctly (to her defense, she did correct this after I told her); other tables being served before us; and having to hunt my server down to explain the mistake on our order). Finally after I expressed my disdain for the service we received, our sever did finally right her one wrong. But what bothers me is, she only righted her wrong, because I had to tell her how disappointed I was with our service. I am not willing to give this place a 1 star, because of our service the first time, but I would hope that management understands that servers need to be extra cautious when it comes to food allergies and requests, because this could be a law-suit waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Food is great...portions are generous(best OJ anywhere), service was impeccable(Michael was our server) BUT in the summer the A/C is HORRIBLE...we were hot the entire meal...they need to repair the A/C or get new units...what a  great way to ruin a wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sad to post a negative review as this is usually a great experience for us. Hopefully someone will read. We waited 40 minutes for brunch, food was delivered room temp and not all at once for our party of 6. When arrived we had no utensils and waited 10 minutes for those. In all fairness, it was busy; however it's always busy on weekends and we have never had such a poor dining experience here. Hopefully with the volume this restaurant is producing, staff will be increased for efficiency and to promote more friendliness."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and today was an experience to warn others about! Eggstacy has a beautiful patio so don't be afraid to sit outside however be careful in asking where you want to sit! I got seated in the one table that had NO shade. With it being Mother's Day it was packed so we couldn't seat anywhere else. I had never eaten a meal so fast in my life. The service has been so so and with us being in the sun I eventually got up and walked over into the shade. I had to find my server in order to pay which was annoying. If you can put up with so so service and eat inside its worth it as the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"First visit today, and I was not impressed by the food.  Service was very good, though-- look for Shea, and at least for this morning, he was at the bar/counter.  I came in and was surprised by the number of people waiting outside (it was very chilly!), and even more amazed to see the line of people waiting to be seated inside.  And then it hit me, it's a Saturday-- I'm usually at work at this time.  A Yelp friend even warned me last night about the long wait times on the weekends, but I was dining solo, so I figured I could wait for a spot to open at the bar.  I ended up waiting for four minutes-- not too shabby!  Found out that the chocolate syrup in the cafe mocha is Hershey's (corn syrup), so I opted for a cappuccino. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggstasy-scottsdale?start=100&select=LQ43uEfOvZzDUBGcY_q4hA#LQ43uEfOvZzDUBGcY_q4hA  LavAzza is the coffee sold here, and I like LavAzza, so far, so good.  Shea was nice enough to provide me with some receipt paper so that I may jot down a few of the entrees I had questions about, and he gave me his suggestions from the list of items I wanted to try, and I ended up ordering the Lemon-blueberry French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggstasy-scottsdale?start=100&select=CXV8FUkYF-yixQdKW1BIIA#CXV8FUkYF-yixQdKW1BIIA and Fried truffle egg toast. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggstasy-scottsdale?start=100&select=J1on-3kAP9IHxQNws194sQ#J1on-3kAP9IHxQNws194sQ  As I mentioned, I wasn't impressed with the food.  First of all, the presentation of both items wasn't pleasing.  There's a reason I posted so many of the Fried truffle egg toast, and that's because no matter how many times I spun that plate around, I couldn't get a decent shot!  Also, the plates were not staged in the best way, but then again, perhaps there was no way to make them appear any better...  The pancakes were sweet on their own, but I added the last bit of pure maple syrup that the kitchen could spare, and it tasted a bit too sweet after.  They usually come with blueberry compote, so I'm assuming it was omitted due to my corn (starch) allergy.  This dish needed a cream sauce to add another layer of texture.  Otherwise, it felt like moistened and heavy pound cake to me.  The Fried truffle egg toast needed more salt, but I was hesitant in adding any more, so I added Tabasco sauce, instead.  The two eggs were sunny-side up and gave the brioche a nice color, as well as good mouth-feel, with the combo of fried bread, egg whites, and melted gruyere.  This dish needed something else, though, besides seasoning.  Some Canadian ham, perhaps?  Or a few slices of extra-thick bacon, or two, or more cheeses?  Yes, this dish, as well as the pancakes, had the makings of something great, and today's offerings do not make me want to order them again.  Two lackluster entrees at the same sitting normally wouldn't make me want to visit again, so why am I eager to go back?  Because of the cool service Shea gave me, of course!  First, he never made me feel like I was an imposition, asking so many questions and sending him to the kitchen with a list of concerns (better than asking him to memorize the questionable ingredients and the four entrees I had my eyes on).  Second, when I asked him what kind of chocolate enrobed the bacon I spotted on a neighbor's Bloody Mary http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggstasy-scottsdale?start=100&select=iiKKb5DG5ApDBjBUEq3-pQ#iiKKb5DG5ApDBjBUEq3-pQ, he guessed Hershey's syrup, as well (I guessed Valrhona, or something similar), but offered to double-check with the kitchen and came back with an apology that it wasn't Hershey's (I kinda knew), but a Belgian chocolate.  But wait, here's the kicker... he excused himself while he grabbed a saucer and napkin and reached into the mini-fridge for a slice of chocolate-covered bacon for me to try (shh! don't tell anyone)!    What service!  Now, I haven't had a chance to taste the said bacon slice, but I plan to ask for Shea's section- hopefully it will be at the bar, where the wait time is shorter- whenever I stop by!  Oh, and third, Shea offered to give me a cup of coffee to-go, which is probably a standard service here, but still a nice touch!  p.s.  The cappuccino was very good!"}
{"text":"Bright, clean, fun decor, extensive menu, great food, decent pricing and a FABULOUS server named Candace, makes for a pretty good morning. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and was throughly disappointed. We came on a Thursday afternoon and the place was pretty much completely empty. Our waitress seemed very disorganized and messed up multiple things with both my order & my sisters.   She told me the roasted veggie scramble came with mozzarella cheese, but it came with cheddar. I was too hungry to send it back to be fixed. My sister's \"skinny b****\" (healthy breakfast burrito) was completely soggy and soaked through from the watery egg whites. And instead of getting turkey sausage in it, she got turkey bacon. Very odd. Overall the food was okay, but definitely nothing special. There are plenty of better options in the area.   Lastly, we sat outside and it was a really hot day. We waited for a long time for our waters to be refilled multiple times, even though other tables had carafes of water on their tables. I really want this place to be good, but it's just a disappointment. Don't waste your time and head somewhere with better service & food."}
{"text":"Love the savory crepes!!! Nice place to get quality bfast and good portions too. They serve 4 to 5 crepes on a plate. Today i tried the ham and kaseri which was delicious."}
{"text":"Seriously the best potato leek soup I have ever had. Great friendly service with an unique menu. Been there 3 times and I liked every thing I've tried. Pumpkin cheesecake pancakes?! Oh so gooood"}
{"text":"We came here on opening day.  Staff and food were just great!  I got their dali's omelette, which I heard was really good.  The taste along with the salsa was really good. My only beef woudl be that I'm not a fan of crunch jalapenos.  Note to self to keep them out next time!  Their pancakes were fresh and their bacon was delish!  I could eat a pound of their bacon...   We were seated very quickly and our server was just great.  I loved that they kept coming by to make sure all is well.  Why not 5 stars?    If I could change one thing it would be the booth seating...  the two-seater booths felt as though were seated a foot above the tables. We moved to a regular booth.  As cool as the seating looked for the booths, I was not a fan of how hard they were.   Will we be back? Oh heck yeah.  Glad to see this place was open just down the street from us!"}
{"text":"We waited 40 minutes on Sunday Brunch April 3rd the place was packed. We waited another 20 minutes for anyone to come and allow us to order food. A party of 11 we we're seated outside and they we're nice to put another umbrella for our group. EVERYONE was very nice but the service was not great. The chairs stunk like heated plastic and was dirty. To be expected being outdoors I guess. We ordered our food and we got it over 30 minutes later, and they kept trying to convince our party that we ordered an egg Benedict even though we didn't. They forgot an order my daughter waited another 30 minutes. THE FOOD WAS GREAT THOUGH! We all enjoyed our order. A lot of food for the price!  We got our water, and utencils after are food too!  we were at eggstacy for over 2 hours. We thought it was just our group being big. BUT THE PARTY OF 3 BY US HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. Even with all the problems we had, I think it was worth the wait. When it was time to leave and pay they also sneaked in an order we didnt make ( yes the egg benedict!) Thank you to everyone. Next time we will avoid Sunday! Maybe things will be better. Have recommended to many already. TASTE WAY BETTER THAN BUTTERFIELDS. BTW."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time with a co-worker...it was excellent! I love waffles, and these were light and crispy, with fresh strawberries on top. And I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a large skewer of fresh fruit on the side. We only had coffee, but they have a pretty extensive list of fresh squeezed juices I'm looking forward to trying. Atmosphere is bright and the vibe is great! Very friendly staff that were right on top of everything we needed, despite being packed with people. Extensive menu that will appeal to just about anyone. Love this place!"}
{"text":"So bummed!  We've been here several times before and it's been pretty good. It started with us calling ahead to put our name in and we should have been seated quickly.  After 20 min we checked in with the hostess stand and our name was crossed off the list?!  They gave our table to someone else.   After we finally got seated it was at least an hour before they brought 1 item of food out.  5 min later another single order came out wrong.  Basically staggered food for a table of 4.  Terrible!  No manager came over and when we asked for the manager- she never showed."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!  Seriously, if I didn't live so far from it, I'd be here everyday for breakfast. (maybe it's a good thing I live far then)  Nice ambient style breakfast diner. Original, yet comfortable and ordinarily fitting. From the moment you walk in the door, everything is EGGcellent! 5/5   [ Keep up the good work guys! ]"}
{"text":"Place was clean and good the food was pretty good. Orange juice was really good fresh squeezed. Cucumber flavored water. I got bacon eggs and hash browns with. Pancakes the pancakes weren't my favorite they tasted like from the box but okay. The orange juice was my fav. Waitress was nice . They took long to notice me at the bar cause I was alone. It took around 4 for them to even say hello. Which is why I gave a 4 hospitality is very important for this type of restaurant. . I would come back they have interesting items on their menu."}
{"text":"There isn't anything on the menu that I don't love.  Best breakfast ever.  The whole wheat pancakes with fruit are heaven!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, the food is amazing, and have been here 10 times or so, but the last time I was there with my girlfriend, we both could agree that the service was absolutely ridicules. I didn't catch our servers name but it was some kid with white gauges.  It was about 2 in the afternoon, and we get there and it is fairly slow. Our server comes around to ask for our order and I tell him that we aren't ready yet. He revisits us about 10-12 minutes later, which is a littler longer then usual but nothing I would really complain about.  We put in our order and the food comes out fairly quickly and is good as always. At this point out waters were empty and were never filled for the rest of the time we were there. We are both fairly quick eaters and finish everything in about 10-15 mins. I'm a server myself so i was putting plates stacked up on one side of the table to kind of give him a hint that we were done and could use some service. But we ended up not seeing our server for FIFTY MINUTES after he dropped off the food. He did not check up on us or anything, we could watch him as he was doing all his side work as we sat there with no food or water left in front of us, contemplating if we should just leave. Finally at 2:55; five minutes before they close, he drops off the check. Finally i give him the 2 cent tip he had earned by neglecting us the whole time we were there, as I leave I thought, finally we are done here.  But that's not all... He literately comes out to the parking lot to confront me about his shitty service, and I told him how he didn't check up on us for 50 minutes and we were ready to leave after 15, then he complained to me about how he's losing money off this crappy tip, and quite frankly, I don't really care. Learn to serve or find a new job, I will not return unless I know this guy no longer works here. Sorry"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and service was meh. The hostess/server was in a bit of a frenzy the whole time despite there not being very many people. The atmosphere was overall every chill-too chill almost. There really wasnt much professionalism and mostly just experienced a lot of friens like behavior, like calling us 'bae' and 'omg'.  There was four of us ans our server was pretty nice, but he forgot one of the orders and ended up comping it. The food was okay, the pancakes were definitely my favorite part of the meal. Prices arent bad depending on the item. $10 for a large omlette plus hash plus pancakes.  The one thing that really bothered me was the fact that the server really insisted we try the chocolate covered bacon. It was very pushy and not just a suggestion. He ordered two plates for us, which I thought wasnt right of him to do. Also, it was not good at all. Chocolate was soft, bacon was floppy and cold, the flavor was just strange."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambience!  The chef was kind enough to make me a specialty item. Instead of the wild smoked salmon bagel, I asked for it as a crepe. SO DELICIOUS!! Light yet filling. The apple cider bacon is so flavorful. I also had a bellini, which seemed small in size but was made to perfection. The restaurant is full of light and is fun enough to enjoy with friends while also chill enough to read a book."}
{"text":"This place is SO UNDERRATED. I wish I could give it 6 stars! The Greek huevos rancheros is such a tasty spin on the original. I went after a hike in Scottsdale and our group of ten ordered ten plates with a few sides and devoured every last bite of our orders. If you like eggs in any way, check this place out! Also very cute decor and great for group brunches.my only tip is to get coffee from elsewhere before because their drip coffee is just mediocre."}
{"text":"Walked here for breakfast and it was absolutely delicious!!! I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict and although egg was a little over done; not runny at all.. it was still very good! Delicious Bloody Mary that had chocolate covered bacon in it!!"}
{"text":"Our friends suggested Eggstasy for Sunday brunch when we were in town visiting because of the diverse menu. The place was busy, but we called ahead to get on the list and were immediately seated on the patio and served fresh coffee.   After much deliberation, I ordered an egg white omelet with goat cheese and fig preserves, fruit and an English muffin. The portion sizes are massive, so come hungry! It was fantastic, perfect ratio of cheese and preserves, the fruit was fresh, and the homemade English muffin was delicious.   Our waitress was lovely and made sure our water stayed full. If I had to nitpick, I'd say extra umbrellas outside would be nice because it got HOT, but it's Arizona. Duh. Our orders came out staggered. One person at the table had to wait an extra 5 minutes or so to get his food, but whatever. It happens. Other than that, everything was excellent. I would love to return and try everything on the menu, it all sounded so good!   Side note: extra points for them being dog friendly."}
{"text":"Tried going again for take out even though I was so disappointed in the service the last time.  Sure enough... I get home, and every single item is wrong.  EVERY ONE!  These guys are terrible.  Out of principle alone, please pick another spot.  Their service is horrible and their manager was extremely rude about the whole situation.  This place is being ran by amateurs."}
{"text":"Just had lunch. Our first time here. Come hungry because the portions are very generous! Lunch for me was the camelback panini which came with excellent fries and an unexpected treat of a bowl of their freshly made soup! My wife had blueberry filled pancakes (4 large) which she said were very good. She brought two home. Other then a few start up training things which we really did not notice I would say this place is a home run for the owners. Great service, great food, great staff and reasonably priced! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday morning and had an awesome breakfast! I had the 2 egg breakfast with the house made sausage which was amazzzzzing! My friend got the Dali skillet and we split the French toast. The awesome bartender/server told us to get the half order so it was cheaper but still enough to share. It was all awesome. Over heard some crazy lady literally yelling at our server and the gm. Get a life lady it's just food! Anyways keep doing what you guys are doing! Food and service was great"}
{"text":"Really good food but not worth the terrible service. Definitely poorly managed. Hope they see this review"}
{"text":"Eggstasy restaurant is finally open! Had a nice, BIG, breakfast there this morning, just to be sure.  The hash browns are the best, nice mix of crunch and generous seasoning for excellent flavor. The Benedict with crispy prosciutto was recommended by my server and was a great selection, prosciutto was thinly sliced and cooked up like bacon, only crispier, and smokier. The poached egg (just the very teensiest, slightest bit underdone) and hollandaise (very lemony, yum!), over a monster of an English muffin from a local bakery. Portions were HUGE - half of my Bene and most of the hash browns are in the fridge for tomorrow. Service was excellent! Hostess, waiter (Junior), co-owner/manager, and water servers were very attentive, friendly, anxious to please, and delighted to share all the details on anything related to the menu or local restaurant biz. Like that the terrific and spongy English muffin came from Strictly From Scratch bakery, who are also the suppliers for Scramble and recently bought Chompie's. Who knew? Can't wait to return and try some of the funky crepes and omelets on offer! Also:  Coffee is strong and good and plentiful, but needs to come with a spoon for stirring in cream."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! We ate here twice in 1 Weekend during our stay in Scottsdale because it was so good. The only reason I am not giving a 5 star review is because the music was a little too loud. Otherwise, excellent service and food! Lots of fresh and gluten-free options too."}
{"text":"The food here is eggcellent! Portions are very large, we actually split an omelette and it was so fresh and yummy and the service was amazing!! This is our favorite breakfast spot now...(BYE BYE Butterfields!)"}
{"text":"We wanted to hit up a new breakfast joint and we had heard of Eggstasy opening up so we made our way there at 8:30 in the morning.  It appears that we just beat the morning rush on a Sunday morning because 20 minutes after we arrived it got noticeably busy.  We waiting 5 minutes to sit outside in the patio area.  Love the patio layout and the colors.  They have a large patio that can accommodate large groups.  They also have a pretty extensive menu,  If you're in the mood for good breakfast this is the spot.  I order the stuffed brioche french toast and the prosciutto eggs Benedict with a side of maple sausage. The french toast can feed 2 people easily.  4 big slices of bread stuffed brioche style.  The prosciutto eggs Benedict would've been better if the prosciutto wasn't so salty.  It was very over powering while eating.  I would defeinitly come back here to try more of the menu.  It's hit or miss if you show up any time before 9am."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great presentation as well which I appreciate. Coffee amazing. Now here is my concern. The meals are way too big and I can eat a lot. They are big enough to split and I do not this place to go out of business. Cut your pineapple in half. Make the pancakes smaller."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Service was good and quick. New favorite spot in Arizona for brunch. So many food options and healthy breakfast for good prices. Fluffy omelettes and fresh fruit/veggies.  Bloody Mary's are on point too. Great Atmosphere.. Cute patio and interior design. Definitely check it out if your in north Scottsdale"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very, very, loud.  I'm usually ok with noise but we had to shout across the table to talk to each other and that was annoying.  Let's get to the food: The menu has a fun variety of egg dishes as well as some creative pancakes and waffles.  I had the cinnamon roll pancakes and my husband had an omlette.  The portions are huge!  If you don't do dairy in your coffee they do offer almond milk.  I based my stars on the wait time for our meal and our drinks were never refreshed. I had finished my coffee well before our food arrived. I had water, but i really would have loved more coffee.  Nice decor!"}
{"text":"The presentation is great here: cucumbers in the water, good coffee, fruit skewers and the pancakes were all great!   But the roasted vegetables skillet was no bueño.  The veggies were just barely roasted so my wife commented that it was like a salad with eggs.  I mean it has kale in it, roast it!!  To their credit they took it off the bill.   I had the Dali omelet.  Very good and it's my usual.  Similar to the veggies the toast was barely roasted.  Not even hot enough to melt the butter."}
{"text":"I'm 30 years old and this was the best breakfast I've ever had my whole life. My husband also agrees the best. I had the fig jam and goat cheese omelette and it was everything I've ever wanted in a breakfast. My only complaint is the huge portions which really isn't even a complaint.  The dining area is one huge dining room so it does get a bit loud but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious with generous portions. My friends and I knew that this place would probably be busy on a Sunday morning so we came early and got a table out on the patio. Everything we ordered came out promptly even though there was a large crowd, and we all loved our entrees.   The only reason why I didn't rate this place higher was because of the service. After being seated and our drink orders taken, our waitress did not show up to our table to take our order for almost half an hour. Additionally, when our food was brought out the servers forgot my friend's pancakes and toast. We were also the only table in our section without a water pitcher on our table and my friend had to ask our waitress three times for water until she finally got someone to bring us a pitcher. While we were eating our meal, a server came to our table with a dish that we did not order. I don't necessarily blame our waitress per se because I also work in a restaurant and understand that things get busy sometimes, I believe that this was due to poor and uncoordinated teamwork/communication with the cooks, servers, busboys, and waitress.        In the end, my friends and I agreed that we would come back and give it another try! We've already kind of decided on what we would like to try next time."}
{"text":"Wow. Probably my new favorite breakfast place. We came in a little late so we missed any wait times which was nice. We started with the lemon blueberry French toast (which everyone should try), I'd recommend it to share not as a dish just for you unless you're really craving something on the sweeter side. Then I got the Eggasm - and I've been craving it for the past 3 days. It's listed as an appetizer but if you share the French toast like we did it's perfect as an entree. The omelettes are huge and there is a really nice selection of Benedicts to choose from.   TL;DR: get the eggasm and the lemon blueberry French toast and thank me later."}
{"text":"The place was freezing cold.  The service was very poor, we almost got up to get our own coffee we sat so long waiting.  The Whole Wheat French toast is to be avoided, it came off the light menu.  It is a whole wheat bread in egg whites with fresh fruit.  What I got was 3 thick pieces of bread VERY lightly toasted with almost no egg on them at all.  The fruit is dumped onto the bread (not mentioned in item description).  So what you end up with is toast with syrup.  The decor is, well there is none.  The walls are all completely blank of any and everything.  I do not even remember a mirror in the bathroom.  As I was leaving I almost got knocked over by a waitress as she bulled past me without even looking up or acknowledging she almost hit me.  I was sad because I really wanted to like this place.  I may go again and see if it changes or if it was just a bad day.  Oh and the place was so insanely loud and noisy that it was hard to speak to the people at my table."}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be one of my favorite spots. The food was delicious and everything that we ordered was amazing. They have a great selection of food and the atmosphere is casual and authentic. I got the barbacoa omelette and it was outstanding. All of the food had great flavor! Everything was EGGcellent and EGGstraordinary. A very unique and fun experience."}
{"text":"This place has a cute atmosphere and a very extensive menu. I've been here twice - service has been consistently friendly but on the slow side. Don't go if you're in a hurry. The food has been good during both visits and portion sizes are huge, good for sharing.   The restaurant gets very crowded on weekends - there has been a wait both times I've visited. The space is open and can get pretty loud.   They take their chocolate covered bacon seriously - they even put it in your bloody mary."}
{"text":"The food is good, however  the complete unorganization was inexusable. We got there and I was told it would be a 30 to 35 minute wait for an outside table. Thirty minutes later  four people came in, request an outside table and were seated in less than 5 minutes. I went up and said we had been waiting 30 minutes, we were seated within 5. Our pancakes arrived after we were done with our eggs. Extremely loud. Our waiter was very good, so it wasn't his fault.  Too many points against them, I would go anywhere else. Needless to say, we will not go back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast place to try yesterday and decided to go here after driving by.   The restaurant is fresh and clean appearing and very lively. We were greeted quickly and sat down immediately.   I ordered a cappuccino and mimosa, mmmmmm! The cappuccino was well done and the mimosa was mostly champagne with a splash of orange juice - AWESOME!  For breakfast I tried the skirt steak and eggs. The steak was cooked to medium (what I asked for) and was really good. My friend tried the corned beef hash and eggs with pancakes. The corned beef hash looked like the canned version, but you could tell by the taste it wasn't, had good flavor, but not my favorite texture. The pancakes were delicious, nice and fluffy and very sweet, almost like cake.   I will definitely be back and looking forward to trying one of the benedict's with another mimosa!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch there during Memorial Day weekend and we loved it!! The place is surrounded by Windows so it has great natural light. The menu is very diversified and the food was delicious. I had crepes and my husband had omelet; go hungry because the portions are big. The only thing I did not like is the coffee size, they are small but the coffee is good. We are in East Mesa and we cannot find a dissent place near to go for brunch so it is either scottsdale or Gilbert. We will go back to this place for sure!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to eggstasy for about a year now and although the food never disappoints the service often does, however today me and my friends had the pleasure of having Nikki as our server/bartender. She was on top of her game, got us waters, was laughing and joking with us. She truly brought a smile to our faces and made our experience amazing! I am very excited to come back and have her wait on us! I think with her setting the example for the service standards Eggstasy's service will truly be amazing! Thanks so much Nikki!"}
{"text":"Overall a fun experience. Right off the bat, i noticed their decor resembled Snooze's with all the fun colors and shapes. The wait for a table is reasonable before 9 am on a weekend-- maybe 20 minutes. The bar made delicious fresh orange juice-- great for mimosas and screwdrivers. The coffee was also nice and strong. My only gripe is the service seriously moved at a snail's pace! The wait just to take our order was at least 30 minutes, and then another 30 minutes to get our food. Though, I have to say the food was worth waiting for. Everyone was raving about it around the table."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Place came recommend by friend in CA, and I stopped in on way to airport. Too bad, because it felt terrible to let all the uneaten food go to waste. Portions are huge! I knew the owners were Greek so I went with Greek Skillet which was fantastic. I had a side of gluten free lemon pancakes that could have easily been their own meal. My daughter had what was on menu as  chocolate chip pancake (as in singular) but there were 3 gigantic pancakes on plate. My son ordered Dali skillet, which was spicy and, also huge. Also appreciated the AC wasn't on full blast which is an AZ thing I can't stand."}
{"text":"This is a great new breakfast spot!  The atmosphere is super cool and the patio is amazing!  Yummy food and huge portions!!!  You need to visit this place!"}
{"text":"We tried this location this morning for brunch. The wait was short at 11:30. That's the only positive thing I can say. The service was bad. We had to ask for everything several times. When the food finally came it was cold. The food wasn't anything special if not disgusting. I wanted sausage links but at the recommendation of our server I went with the sausage patties. I had to ask for them three times, and when they finally came they were these two disgusting lumps on a plate. I ate one, trying to give it a chance, but it left me feeling disgusting the whole day. This restaurant should not have 4 1/2 stars!!!! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Just Ok. Yet another breakfast place attempt to be trendy. It's very noisy because of the interior, nothing to absorb sound. So if you want a Sunday brunch where you can sit and enjoy you coffee with conversation, this isn't the place for you. If you want decent breakfast food, a modern utilitarian decor, and tables filled people wanting to be seen, this is it. Popular with the post Saturday Night hangover crowd."}
{"text":"April 27th way to go Nichole!! Excellent customer service I told her about my drive to San Diego she brought me 2 cups of water to go and ice when I asked for one.  Food delicious, coffee excellent!   Wish we had one in San Diego!"}
{"text":"It starts with the attention to little details you wouldn't expect to find in a breakfast style eatery. I love the touches of cucumber in water and the carefully skewered fruits. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly and had an outgoing positive vibe. I thoroughly enjoyed my Reuben sandwich which came with a soup of my choice. I opted for a delicious chicken soup. I liked the patio seating. Spacious and relaxing... I had a lot of privacy to myself. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"We arrived and were seated promptly.  The restaurant was already busy at 8:30 am on. Sunday morning.  Our server took our drink order and returned quickly.  She was one of the best servers I've ever had -- attentive, friendly and courteous and she followed up regularly to top off coffee and ask if we needed anything else.  The food quality and flavor was excellent and reasonably priced.  There are several great breakfast spots on the area but I highly recommend Eggstasy for breakfast.  We will repeat whenever we return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was running some errands on a Saturday morning so we decided to get breakfast. I've been wanting to try Eggstasy for awhile. So today was the day.   We walked in and thought great we're gonna have to wait cause there was so many people waiting. Luckily, it was me and my wife and they seated us right away. What a relief.   The place very bright with bright yellow and green bring color to the room with cool light fixtures. Very welcoming and warm but really busy and loud.   Anyways, I ordered the Lemon Blueberry French Toast with a side of homemade Hash Browns. I got three huge pieces of French toast with fresh blueberries sprinkled around with fresh whip cream, strawberry, butter and syrup. First bite and wow. Loved it. It had the lemon flavor with blueberries inside the French toast. Really tasty and thick. The homemade hash browns did not disappoint. Really good and crispy the way I like it. I'm a pretty big eater and I could barely finish it. Portions are huge.   My wife got the two egg breakfast with hash browns and pancakes. She loved it and was talking about it on the way home. That doesn't happen too often. She loved the crispy hash browns but was crazy about the pancakes. She thought the pancakes were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Cooked just right. She thought the pancakes had a different taste than all the others ones she had before.   The service I thought was good. Our waiter poured glasses of water and they leave a pitcher of water with ice & cucumber in it. Out waiter kept an eye on us and took away our finished plates very quickly. One thing that impressed me was how quickly then can clean a table up. One person cleans, one person sets the table, and one person sweeps up for those messy people.   I thought this was a really fun place to eat. Very lively. Huge portions. Good food. What else could I ask for breakfast. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and they have a great selection! The prosciutto omelette is amazing! The service is fantastic. Our waiter was Owen and he was so sweet and really attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times. The food isn't anything that great. Pumpkin cheesecake pancakes were good. I had to send my food back once. Last time I ate here I got the crepes. They were dry around the edges. I can get better crepes elsewhere. They had the roll up doors open that lead out to the patio. I really wanted to drink hot coffee with my breakfast but it was too hot to do that. It was 99 degrees that day. It was way too hot to have them open, not sure what they were thinking. Or open them in the morning and close them when it gets hot. My mom did not like her food either. Service was mediocre. I won't be going back. I'll stick with Butterfield's."}
{"text":"This a total hidden gem of a place right next to my favorite kid's store(kids stop) on Shea Blvd.  They have one of the most unique and creative breakfast and lunch menus. They have chocolate covered bacon need I say more? I have to order it  next time just for fun. This is a cute and super busy place on the weekends. By far one of the most creative breakfast menus in Scottsdale!   The serving sizes are huge! The price point is amazing and you will definitely take food home. I love the fresh squeezed orange juice and assortment of creative crepes, pancakes, skillets, bennies, omelettes and french toast. The menu is large with extensive offerings. There is literally something for everyone.   I have been here 2 days in a row. My favorite is the apple sausage, hash browns and the epic pancakes, most of which are gluten free but not all of them are gf. I do not believe they have gf toast which would be a great add especially because they have an amazing looking avocado toast.   They also have some very healthy breakfast and lunch options as well for those on a strict diet. Seriously though this place is worth ditching the  diet and just diving into some of that food decadence!  Everyone here is super nice and helpful and I found the service and staff to be on par. I can't wait to come back and do lunch,  but this place is now in my favorite breakfast rotation!"}
{"text":"Come hungry! Its a great place for brunch and has so many amazing options. The portion sized are massive and you can easily split between friends. Service is very nice as well. Tried the pecan pie pancakes and I would happily get them again. They were the size 9f my face so I was able to take half home. Also tried the maple sausage which were the perfect amount and add."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times during the week and the food is excellent.  On the weekend, we waited over an hour to be seated.  They were very short staffed and didn't have busers to turn the tables quickly.  Owner was busing tables and informed us two staff did not show today.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Always delicious and fresh. Portion is big and prices okay. All of their juices are fresh and delicious! I love this place ."}
{"text":"Best service, incredible amazingly delicious food.  I have tried many breakfast places but this will definitely be my new forever home. The menu is for everyone from gluten free, healthy, to kinda bad and just straight so dang good it's bad for you!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and checked out this place. It's great. Open air, welcoming staff and a unique and creative breakfast menu. Thumbs up.  Update: I love going out for breakfast and have been to most of the hot spots in the area - but I always come back here. This restaurant is a real standout and has a personality and character all it's own.   Something new: not a big fan of how they've started playing loud music in the morning. It's a very large and open space and the muffled pop music adds a lot of extra noise."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you have any hearing issues whatsoever. I am sure the food is very nice, but we didn't get to the food.  We walked in, and walked around the restaurant looking for a quiet place, but the ambient noise was way too high for me to participate in any type of conversation.  We ended up going to another nearby restaurant, which had music playing, but at a very reasonable level."}
{"text":"We came here today for the first time. The reviews looked great and it's super close to our house. The experience started out really well. There was a 30 min wait for 11:15am on a Sunday and the host was very nice, we told her we were going to look around in the kids store (KidStop) to keep our 4 & 2 year old occupied, she was so nice to walk down there to get us when our table opened up she sat us and our waitress greeted us promptly. We took about 10 min to order because it was our first time and the menu is pretty big with lots of delicious looking items. We then ordered, nothing complicated but this is when the problems began....an HOUR went by and we still didn't have our food and ALL the tables around us that ordered after us were getting their food. I was a restaurant manager before and I know that's not acceptable.  I went to try to get our waitress but she was avoiding us like we weren't her table. Another server brought my meal by itself and we waited 5 min before I sad anything to our waitress and she assured me the rest of the food was on its way. I told her just get my kids food out (it was just 2 Mickey Mouse pancakes) b/c they were hungry. Well we waited another 5 min before the rest of the food came out. The manager walked by and asked how everything was so we told him nicely and his response was, sorry! I know it's not an excuse but our kitchen is slammed! Said nothing and did nothing. After waiting for over an hour and for how hungry we were I would have expected the food to taste amazing but it was bland and disappointing. We will not be going back for $70 for 2 adults and 2 kids! If you want amazing breakfast food go to Butterfields. Their wait to get a table might be longer but Butterfields food comes out in 5 min from when it's ordered and the food is delicious and consistent. I don't know how Butterfields kitchen is so efficient but Eggstasy needs to take note from their operations and table turn. Long story short Eggstasy was not worth the wait or $ for the quality of food and the lack of care with the manager and server. And the thing that made me most upset is the issue was never addressed or acknowledged. We had to say something in order to get a lame excuse."}
{"text":"Food was great, the server was great. We get there and there's a 45 min wait and we had a larger group so that's expected. After a bit we are told that we will have to wait 1hr 15min for a table outside in the shade, which we are still okay with. We decided to get bloody marys at the bar while we waiting and we see a party of 7 who had been there for maybe 30mins get seated in the shade outside. The hostess then tell us that our table is almost ready and points to one in the shade. Alright!  5 mins later they move the umbrellas to a different table of 7 leaving ours in the sun.. Really!!? We ended up waiting almost 2 hours for a table in the shade. I wouldn't have cared where we sat but my friends from Chicago were in town and really wanted to sit outside. Then the manager tells us we would get a discount since we were so patient, which they never gave us. This is not my first visit here and I'm disappointed we had this experience with our friends who were visiting. Again - great food, great server - just poor management."}
{"text":"Five stars for all of their breakfasts, but only one for the chicken club today pounded flatter than a pancake and served on monster toasted hoagie that was more moist than the chicken. Haven't had any other lunches, but stick with breakfast and you'll love this place! Mimosas are good too!"}
{"text":"The eggony and the eggstacy. You know I had to go there. I don't need to be egged on.  We went here with some friends and fellow Yelpers for a later breakfast. Portions were good and the food was tasty.  The service was really good as well.    I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Total fail, i have been here before and the food is good, but they lost this guest. Place was not busy, 2 servers and 10 minutes went by and nobody acknowledge my presence,  even the hostess could gave over coffee or water. Never gain"}
{"text":"I ate here the morning before last, and it was very good. There was a lot to choose from on the menu. I was a little surprised that when my cousin ordered a cafe-latte, they said \"Sure.\" Till that point, I had only heard of Starbucks offering that, but I'm not a coffee drinker.  I had a 3-egg, ham and cheese omelet, hash browns, bacon, and toast. I also finished my cousin's plate of pancakes. All of the food was very good, and the service was very good. The portion size was also very good. I was full when I left the place, so that's always special."}
{"text":"i really enjoyed breakfast here! the food is very tasty. the menu has so many options it is almost overwhelming. my omelette was delicious! and the pancakes are nothing short of awesome! real cream for your coffee is a bonus at any breakfast joint! this place is worth the long wait on a Sunday morning.   **the one downside...the volume! IT'S SO LOUD IN HERE!! there is very loud pop music forcing everyone in the crowded dining room to scream making it even louder as the sound echos off the walls and high ceiling."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Service friendly and accommodating. Italian coffee to go. Definitely want to try more items on the menu. Got an omelette entree with a Side order of fried truffle egg toast. HEAVEN! So many options for benedicts as well- traditional, smoked salmon, crispy prosciutto, avocado, caprese and more! Atmosphere and ambience are inviting and energetic."}
{"text":"Very good spot to have a chill meal. Nice current music playing with a very clean feel and look. Food was good too! I had the steak & eggs (6oz steak, hefty portion of eggs and the hashbrowns were seasoned just right! My daughter had the pancakes they were not light and flaky a little on the over cooked side with made them dry. Loved the cucumber water in craft that they leave at table, nice touch. The staff is nice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast place! Eggstasy offers an array of menu options, from breakfast to lunch; and some items have very fun names. I tried the chocolate covered bacon, which was good... although the taste would be so much better if the dish was warm (it is served slightly chilled). I also ordered an omelette with garlic, almonds, mushrooms and asparagus - it was marvelous! I want to keep going back to try the other interesting menu items. Eggstasy's orange juice is quite tasty, if a bit overpriced. I wish I remembered my server's name because she was kind and genuine. Breakfast arrived in a timely fashion, and the overall atmosphere is convivial. I give Eggstasy 5 stars, mmmmm!"}
{"text":"This a great new restaurant at Mountain View & Via Linda next yo Goldie's. I had the spinach & feta omelette... yummy yummy. We ate on the patio... it was awesome."}
{"text":"First time here and the menu is a little overwhelming with so many options! Loved the food, okay coffee, great service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food. Really creative omelette's, I've not had anything bad.   This place only gets 2 stars because the service here is atrocious. I don't think there is any management going on and all the servers just running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  There really need to hire someone with management experience to come in and turn around the service."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  Great prices and food is second to none.  Our waiter Justin was the best!   We had a party of seven and I wouldn't go anywhere else for breakfast!  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is an awful place & crowded, no place to sit, your sitting on top of people. A friend of mine went there to eat & got Sick, throwing up. Too noisy & seats are too close."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back here!  When we arrived there was a wait to get in, and I can understand why. The food is amazing! The décor is minimal but colorful. The place is a little loud, which I actually thought made it more fun.  The menu is large and everything looks delicious. I ended up ordering the Camelback Panini with broccoli cheese soup. WOW, the soup was heavenly and the Panini was grilled to perfection. I also go to sample an omelet, a pancake, a side of sausage and eggs benedict. Every bite was better than the last.  I plan on dining here as often as possible to try as much as the menu has to offer!"}
{"text":"Eggstacy is a good trendy spot to go for young people who want brunch. It's not as bumpin as R&R, and not as family-oriented as Butterfields. It's a good mix.   The food is pretty large, but it's not as tasty as other breakfast spots - drier, less fresh, doesn't have the same feel. Overall, good ambiance, decent food, and a nice place for young people to get brunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to have breakfast here last Saturday. It was packed but they seated us right away...Yay!!  First off, the place is very cool, loved the hip design. They have an extensive menu, very hard to decide! But none the less, we made up our minds. I ordered the prosciutto, red pepper & burrata omelette, it was DELISH! Loved how the flavors came together. Not only is the dish tasty, it is gigantic! Can easily share....it was a 3 egg omelet with hash browns and 2 pancakes!   The service was good and the good delish! I'm only giving it 4 stars & not 5, because it was a bit too loud & crazy."}
{"text":"Amazing asparagus crepes! I would get again but split with someone. The strawberry orange Mimosa's were good but small....a noticeably disappointment for us both when they came delivered to our table. Eggsllent service. Enjoyed the patio."}
{"text":"The menu looked good, the space and atmosphere was big and inviting but the food was lackluster.   It's not easy to mess up brunch, but my table of 4 - none of us really enjoyed what we ordered. It wasn't horribly bad, but it wasn't satisfying. I stopped eating my Benedict after the first one and just left it there. I didn't even want to take it home.   The pancakes were weird. When I cut into it, it was breaking apart. Almost as if the texture was hard and crunchy? Not pancake like at all.   Also this place has the most expensive orange juice ever. My friend ordered a large orange juice (with no free refills) for $5.50. How outrageous is that?"}
{"text":"I've been here about 20 times, and still I rate it \"meh.\" I went for these positives:   (1) drinks - great bloody marys, mimosas, and they serve illy coffee (2) ambiance - I love that it's light, airy & open  (3) decor - modern clean lines (4) service - very attentive and prompt (5) outdoor patio access with a great outdoor bar.  The only thing I'm not thrilled about is the food. I've been pleased with the basics - an egg and toast or a plain waffle. But I can make these things at home - the point of going out, to me, is to eat something that's too troublesome for me to make myself.  My main complaints are that the food simply is boring to taste, and they seem to think that tweaking classic dishes is imperative to their brand. But sadly, to me, their take on these classics isn't even close to how good the original is. Some examples- their BLT, Cobb salad, and baked steel cut oatmeal. The only steel cut oatmeal they offer is baked and sliced in loaves. I tried it, and it was impossibly dry - gulping water didn't even help.  Same with the BLT - it was oddly dry. It also had avocado on it, which is great, however, assembled, the bacon was too dry, the bread too dry, and the other veggies in the sandwich couldn't counterbalance that excessive dryness. I didn't like the Cobb salad because it was served on field greens lettuce, instead of romaine or even iceberg. Swapping the field greens out didn't work, to me, because the texture of them didn't hold up to the other ingredients. Field greens are too delicate for the traditional Cobb salad ingredients. Again, I found the salad DRY! (How can a salad be dry!?!?) I asked for more dressing, which still didn't seem to make the plate any better. I wasn't impressed with the omelet I ordered either, on another visit. I had the veggie omelet (onions, peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, cheese), but it had minimal cheese and there wasn't anything special about it - it simply wasn't flavorful.  I know the issue isn't me because I never complain about food being dry elsewhere - I enjoy the food at First Watch, Snooze, and others and don't find their food dry at all.   I loved taking my out of town guests here just for the ambiance and vibe, but I've since stopped because I'm just plain sick of paying for food I don't like. I end up wasting more than half my meal because after so many bites of attempting to resurrect the dish, I just give up and my appetite is spoiled. No ambiance is worth that price. I hate that I don't like their food because I love the idea of visiting with my dog on the patio, how close it is to my home, etc. The only other negative is that they don't accept reservations.  I've not been back in over a year, but the menu I see online looks to be the same. If the food was better, I'd probably visit every other week because it's so close to where I live, and I truly love the decor, ambiance, and patio."}
{"text":"Absolutely do not recommend. Let's start with the food: I ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict. Several things were wrong. One: it came out at room temperature. Two: They used ham instead of Canadian bacon. Three: The ham was overcooked and chewy. Four: The poached egg was overcooked. Five: The hollandaise sauce was lacking in taste and had solidified on the plate due to the temperature of the dish itself.  Atmosphere: this place is incredibly loud. Not just loud for a restaurant, loud for a rock 'n' roll concert. Do not recommend going here if you would like to have a conversation with the person sitting across the table from you.  Service: our waitress was kind,  but ineffective in dealing with the above-mentioned eggs Benedict issue. Neither was either the manager on duty, nor the general manager able to do anything other than ask me to come back and try them again...WHICH I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE DOING!  With so many great breakfast place is available in the Scottsdale area, this is certainly one to be avoided."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So many delicious options. The food is clean and has plenty of gluten free dishes, gotta try the gluten free protein pancakes! The service was very friendly and nice, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the unbelievable breakfast and terrific waitress, Nikki, that we had today. This restaurant just opened up 3 weeks ago, and this was the first time we've eaten here. Food was fresh and delicious, presentation beautiful, and wait staff friendly and attentive. We needed a restaurant like this in our area, and I hope that they remain here for many more years."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Amazing Gluten free pancakes. The lemon ricotta pancakes were the best I ever had. I ate the gypsy skillet scramble with the skirt steak cooked to medium. The lavazza coffee was perfect. The strawberry mimosa was good. They recommended the Bloody Mary that sounded one of a kind. I hope to try that next time."}
{"text":"We probably won't be returning to this restaurant again. While the kids menu is pretty great (hello Mickey Mouse pancakes), the food that the adults ordered left a lot to be desired. I ordered the lemon and blueberry \"French toast\" which looked beautiful, but one bite into it I realized that it wasn't toast at all! It was literally cake, that was battered then pan fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar! It was so sweet that it was nauseating. The other person I was with ordered an omelette. It did not taste good! The hash browns were cold and they had a greasy taste to them. I was not impressed. The pl"}
{"text":"Reading the menu gave me a food orgasm. The actual food made our taste buds go limp. (Insert laughing/crying emoji here)  Enough said."}
{"text":"I swear the intersection of Shea and Scottsdale is home to so many awesome places.  Eggstasy is yet another to be added to the list.  Stopped by here with a group of about 10 for a Sunday brunch and it was pretty spectacular.  To put it simply, the place is VERY popular on a Sunday morning.  I would definitely come in with a reservation like we did.  The atmosphere inside reflects its popularity.  It was bustling and there was a lot of action going on.  I was honestly pretty impressed by the speed and attentiveness of our waitress during our meal.  She came by and took our orders very quickly and our food and checks arrived just as fast.  Incredibly efficient, which was great considering how many people were looking to get inside.  I ordered the Denver omelette with hash browns and wheat toast.  It was quite possibly the largest omelette I've ever received at a breakfast restaurant and it was very delicious.  I typically have no trouble finishing a meal, but in this case, there was so much yummy goodness on my plate I couldn't even finish all my toast.  Talk about first world problems!  Eggstasy lives up to its name - I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! We've become regulars here and every time we leave fat and happy. The service is always great and the portions of the food are huge. You can even substitute specialty pancakes for toast!!! I tell every one I know to come here- it blows every breakfast place in Scottsdale out of the water."}
{"text":"There was a 4 minute delay bringing one of the dishes, maybe their POS needs upgrading?"}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in a long time!! Huge servings, the staff so friendly and on top of everything! Definitely going back for more !!"}
{"text":"GREAT new restaurant!! For once, I didn't feel like I could've done better, had I stayed home and cooked for myself! Have really been tiring of the \"meh\" breakfast eateries my husband and I have been trying.  This place is outstanding in it's food prep, service, and ambience! I had Avocado Benedict! Scrumptious !  Hash browns were actually homemade not out of a bag! So good!  Try this place! Keep them in business!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here. Ambience was casual, place was packed and food was delicious. I had the Nutella banana stuffed French toast and liked it a lot. The pancakes are tasty, too. They definitely make their own batter as it tastes great! Service was great!"}
{"text":"I give the food a perfect 5 star rating. I never have had such a great menu of food that has such a wide range of variety and innovation. The owner, Joe(?), is very accommodating and understands what it means to have a new concept in Scottsdale restaurants. Unfortunately, he needs better staff. Being from the east coast I often criticize how customer service is a dying breed but maybe it's simply because I'm more towards the west coast and everyone is just used to giving only 60%. I rarely witness Quick To Serve experiences. This place is one of them. The hostesses will be two young girls looking around not knowing what tables are available while what appeared to be Joe's mother yelling at them in a thick foreign accent and they just don't even budge. Our sever was awful and as excited as we were to bring our friends to this restaurant, they were so upset about the service that they will not come back. It upsets me because I know yelp is an easy access for bad reviews and rarely do you get a good one, however, I hope Joe takes the coaching and witnesses the staff and makes changes. Our server not once refilled our drinks, when I had to tell her to refill the drinks she didn't even clear the empty ones. Food was forgotten and not brought out and we had to ask to remove it from our bill, and then when she brought the bill after not clearing our dishes, it was one check. We asked her to split it three ways and she throws the empty plates back on the table to walk back and change the bill. It took everything in me not to coach her on the spot and I just felt it wouldn't go far enough had I not given the owner the direct experience. I was embarrassed. I love this restaurant but if we keep receiving bad service, it won't be worth the trouble to come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Owner Joe is hilarious, people-oriented,  welcoming,  and just down right awesome. Portion sizes are huge,  the food is excellent, service all around fantastic!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Me and my wife waited 20min for the bus boy to bring us a glass of water on our first visit.  We got our food about an hour after we ordered it abd it was mediocre at best, cold small portions and not the correct items but at this point we didnt feel like waiting another hour for a remake.  But the manager came over and gave us a $20 gift card.  So we though maybe it was an off day since it was saturday and we would try it again on a weekday when it wouldn't be so busy since we live close by.  And it was ab exact repeat.  But this time when we asked to speak with the manager they said he wasn't in today.  How can a restaurant have no management. We walked out before we even ordered.  Maybe we'll give the gift certificates to our kids cause we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cool little place! Love their patio area, perfect place to sit and enjoy some yummy food."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, and involved owners.  I highly recommend Eggsatsy for anyone looking for a new place for brunch and lunch.  So many great choices you won't know what to order.  The Stuffed Brioche French Toast is the best.  Portions are very generous so you will be left in a food coma by the end."}
{"text":"Our first time here and holy crap this place is good! OJ is like eating an orange....unreal. Dalis Omelette, pancakes bacon hash browns all excellent! We will absolutely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I come here often, absolutely love the menu as there is plenty to choose from, and everything I've ordered is cooked to perfection. The fresh orange juice is the best! The only reason I gave 4 rather than 5 stars is because the service is not always quick. But is nice!  Other than that I truly love this place."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Great place. Service is incredible. Food is incredible. They're super accommodating. If I could give six stars I would.  The omelette I had was amazing. They somehow get them fluffy and not too heavy. Highly recommend. I chose roasted garlic, toasted almonds, and grilled asparagus. The balsamic reduction on top was delicious.  Hash browns are homemade and top notch.  My wife got the Melt Away and it was equally delicious. The veggies were really good.  Orange juice is fresh squeezed and tastes like heaven.  I cannot recommend enough."}
{"text":"Sadly this place has gone downhill since my last visit.Quite simply there is a lack of management and expediting in the kitchen. Also they are skimping; for example fewer ingredients in an omelette. Sadly, they are no longer competitive with other venues . The patio is very pleasant. Their pancakes used to be great; now they are hardly  edible  ."}
{"text":"Management must not care... Staff was rude & unsanitary. Hostess was wearing a crop top...."}
{"text":"Awesome food fast service and all around excellent service we have been here multiple times and have never once had a bad experience with anything love this place !"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday breakfast with a girlfriend. Had the classic eggs benedict. It was good, but not the best I've ever had, although I can't really tell you why-maybe it was their hollandaise sauce?  The place is very modern but it kind of feels like you are in a cafeteria the way the tables are situated. And I can see it getting very loud if it's really busy. The portions are enormous! Good potatoes too.  Definitely enough to share a couple things. I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place!! I've been coming here since they first opened up! They have a great selection for breakfast, GREAT SERVICE, have an amazing portion size for what you pay and a fun upbeat atmosphere. I recommend getting the incredible omelette that comes with a big pile of hash browns and 2 pancakes! This is by far my favorite breakfast place in the whole entire valley. Hands down. If you are in the area check it out! I travel all the way from Gilbert to come and eat here so that's saying something :)"}
{"text":"Went on opening day and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our waiter had a few kinks with the ordering system and they didn't have all of their menu items available but I'm not going to nitpick.  The place was decorated very nicely with a clean modern look. The patio area also looked good but I don't think it was in use yet. It was very spacious inside and the tables were not cluttered like in many other restaurants to seat as many as possible.   The menu has lots of great sounding options and they have a good variety of freshly squeezed juices. The food was incredible! I ordered 2 eggs with sausage links and my girlfriend went with the breakfast quesadilla. We were definitely not let down with the food. They have nicely seasoned hashbrowns which were outstanding! The pancakes were also amazing! Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. I will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was really good overall, a few things better than others. Omelet was awesome and my girlfriend liked her benedict. It seemed like a lot of people were working there but the service didn't reflect it. We had someone come by for a drink order, then another person came by for out meal order. Had what was called \"the incredible omelet\" and it was... pretty darn incredible. Ordered the hash browns and they brought me fruit. They offered to bring out hash browns as an extra side, which is so much better than places that pull the dish back and correct it. After getting the whole order, the fruit would have been a better choice, but hash browns are... well hash browns no matter where you go. The fruit was a skewer of pineapple and berries, which was really unique compared to a bowl of fruit. I ordered a bloody mary, girlfriend ordered a strawberry mimosa which was recommended by the waiter. When the bloody mary came out, I had to take a moment to say \"wow\". Saying it was garnished would be an understatement, as there were the usual celery and lemon, but an added skewer of olives and two kinds of bell pepper (did I mention they must own a skewer business?) across it. I saw in other reviews that there was chocolate dipped bacon with this drink, and there was indeed... chocolate on bacon. It was an interesting add-on, but not one that really worked for me. Some may like that, but I was kind of \"ehh\". The bloody mary was more of a jalapeño taste that horseradish, not really anything unique. Girlfriend's mimosa was good, not great. The \"strawberry reduction\" was more like strawberry syrup, and it was not exactly a big glass to start with. Decent pour on champagne, OJ tasted fresh squeezed. The funny thing is the brunch type drinks aren't anywhere on the menu, so you kind of have this \"well what do you have for adult drinks\" moment with the waiter. Even more shocking is the price when the bill comes. Would not order them again for the $8 and $10 each. Other places offer a better drink for the same or less. I don't mind a $45 breakfast for two, but it usually means more drinks at that price. The place is bright and open, the atmosphere was really inviting. As mentioned in the other reviews, there were a few flies, but nothing that made me wince (we sat inside but the doors were rolled up and the patio was 20 feet away). The real disappointment was the service. Our waiter was working several tables, and it didn't seem like he had a busser as a backup for him. Ice tea glasses sat empty for long periods, plates that were empty sat for a while too. There had to be nearly as many people working as there were customers, but it didn't look like people were doing much. I am not sure if there was a 'manager' working, there were a few people who looked like they could have been something other than waitstaff, but we never had anyone ask if things were ok with a table-touch, which would have been nice. Our waiter looked like he was really busy, so cannot fault him, but since we had encountered 4 people from the time we walked in (host, drink gal, waiter, guy who brought plates out, same waiter again for check) a busser would have really been called for and it seemed they had them to spare. I would have gone to 4 stars had the service been there, but don't see me going back. Someone asked me later \"have you been to any new breakfast places lately that you recommend\" and my answer unfortunately was \"not really\". Good food, 'meh' drinks, kinda poor service means no repeat."}
{"text":"Another noisy yuppie Scottsdale breakfast spot. There are no booths just wide open room AND open kitchen which makes for a very noisy breakfast, shouting across the table at 9am on a Sunday and the place is only have full. I`ve read how the portions are huge, yes in deed, like Denny`s huge. Personally, I would rather have a balanced breakfast with enough food for the meal. I did not go here to have a meal AND get take out. Instead of 4 enormous pancakes and no sides, I prefer 2 pancakes, sausage/bacon/ or fruit. Why am I paying to have leftover pancakes that will be gross afterwards. Most other breakfast places I will get a cloth napkin. Here its one cheap paper napkin similar to mcdonalds. Those don`t work very well cleaning up syrup.   About the sanitary conditions, I did see the bartender put fruit garnish in a drink with her bare hands, GROSS! With what sounds like a culture of unsanitary conditions I would prefer my coffee creamer in sealed portion cups. Who knows how many of those silver, open portion cups they condense to serve new ones.   Food was meh. Banana macadamia pancakes just crumbles into pieces. Maybe because the stack was 4 high, its impossible to get a nice cut and not have mush. The sauce just tasted like pure white sugar. Why are my sausage links cut in half length wise? How about the presentation of nice golden brown sausage? Most up the staff looked under 20 years old and it showed in the service. Ugh never again at this place."}
{"text":"Trendy Brunch with Big Portions  Eggstasy is a beautiful, modern restaurant that serves tasty food and a lot of it! My first visit I ordered the Greek omelette, which was a little odd, but yummy. Most plates can come with a side of pancakes, and there's the option to upgrade them to certain flavors! Because of the amount of food, I split the Steak and Eggs plate my second visit. It was just the right portion for us and cooked well. For the pancakes, we upgraded to raspberry white chocolate, which were very sweet but tasty. We also ordered the Eggasm (easy egg over potato purée). Potato over bread was a bit much for me, but the egg was cooked perfectly, and the presentation was beautiful. The menu is extensive, so I'm excited to go try something new here!"}
{"text":"The servers at Eggstasy are exceptionally, eggceptionally?, nice and helpful. Even the manager twice checked in on our table during our recent visit. I would suggest that you take the advice of your server when ordering. The menu, as structured, is a little confusing. Their advice is not the typical effort to encourage you to trade up or add on expensive extras. It's actually helpful.   Any complaints about Eggstasy? It is loud. On a Sunday morning you can hardly hear yourself think, much less your tablemates' conversations. A few well placed acoustical panels might help, Much better on weekday mornings. The Eggstasy section of the menu, which contains all of the restaurant's unique featured items, appears last in the menu, a curious choice. The portions of these items are huge. You do not want to order them unless you are sharing. Server suggestion that you order an egg oriented menu item and then select a side from the Eggstasy list is the way to go. Why not just lay that out on the menu?  Love the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes, although the cream cheese topping is a bit overwhelming after a few bites. The lemon blueberry French toast is delicious, but is heavy and resembles a banana bread. Not what you might expect from the description. I'm anxious to see what other surprises there are in the Eggstasy portion of the menu. Everything there is dessert-like, however, so be forewarned. A side order, as part of an egg dish, is definitely the way to go unless you have a massive capacity for carbs and sugar.  Have not eaten here with kids in tow, but they do have a kid's menu.  The total tab, for two of us, was $33 including tip. Not unreasonable. Just Scottsdale pricing.  The restaurant décor is a bit mid century, a bit industrial, a bit hipster, a bit modern; that is, a bit fun. The outside patio, which was full when I first viewed it, actually made me laugh when I saw it empty. A good thing."}
{"text":"My new spot. Mimosa mimosa mimosa mimosa.. Did I say mimosa? Lolz TWO THUMBS UP.  You can't go wrong with anything here. But what you need to get is the vegetarian eggs benedict, the hash brown was crisp and my eggs was on par!  My sister got fruit pancakes,  she said it was fluffy and very tasteful.  My daddy got the skirt steak eggs. He thought the steak could be more juicier, but other than that, he like his entrée."}
{"text":"just an all around good vibe, good scene, great food. will repeat for sure."}
{"text":"I tried eggstacy this weekend and it was great. The menu was huge, which is great for picky eaters. There are a ton of things I could have tried. I went with the waffles, eggs and bacon. Great all around. I loved that the fresh fruit was in big chunks and nothing gross or wimpy like those generic little fruit bowls with Honeydew.    The look & feel is great. The only exception is the group of tables next to the large kitchen opening, I wouldn't want to sit there, or at the tables that are essentially right in the doorway."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here regularly and love it!  Great service, amazing coffee and even better food!  Always fresh and delicious.  They also have hands down, the BEST gluten-free pancakes on the planet!  Soft, fluffy and sooooo good!!! My husbands favorite is the skirt steak and eggs.  My usual is the Veggie Skillet.  Most plates are served with fresh fruit or a large mound of fresh berries.   Highly recommend you give this place  a shot!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. They just opened so I know the first few moths for a restaurant is hard. I like the vibe, loud and popping. My husband ordered the lemon and blueberry french toast. I was there was a description because he doesn't care for banana bread and that's what it was, so it didn't really taste like french toast at all. I ordered the eggs Benedict it looked amazing but I was super disappointing because my eggs we over cooked basically ruined the meal. I've never gotten them served that way I thought the point was to have the yolk runny. Whatever I'm just going to Ive them the benefit of the doubt on being new."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this place. We brought in our family so a total of six in our group. Unfortunately my sons meal in my meal or forgotten and never brought out so I had to go and ask the manager what's going on. I was surprised that the waitress did not even ask or say anything when she brought out everyone else's food. The manager finally said they would bring it right out but by that time my family was more than halfway finished with eating their food. It was a very unpleasant experience and I never got an excuse on why my food was never ordered or brought out. Management should have come out and said sorry or something but that never happened.  I do not plan on eating here again as it was a pretty bad experience for the first time going."}
{"text":"Before today, this was my all time favorite breakfast spot. However, after seeing some of the unsanitary food handling methods, I am not sure I can ever go back.  We were seated near the kitchen and observed a male and female worker handling the plates and doing the final prep of the food before it was delivered to customers. Neither were wearing gloves. They were consistently using bare hands to add seasonings, toppings, sides, to the dishes. Both were seen touching their face and hair and then using their hands to manage the food. That lovely piece of mint in your yogurt? Handled by bare hands after wiping her brow. The fruit kabob? Put on the plate by bare hands after wiping hair.  We called over the manager and pointed out this poor practice. She walked away from us, went to the kitchen, whispered something to the male food handler, who then instructed the female food handler to put on gloves. She made a face and did put on the gloves. Five minutes later they were off and she was once again adding food items to plates using her hands to gather seasonings and sprinkle on omelettes. The manager even observed this and said nothing. So, they either don't care or don't know that this is a health violation. It kind of makes me wonder what goes on in the areas I can't see?  I have reported the violation to Maricopa County Health Dept. Funny, as I was filling out the online complaint form, I notice this same restaurant has had the exact same complaint once before. Glad to know they believe in process improvement. NOT.  So, for all of you who have written fabulous reviews about how great the food is...just know that the secret ingredient is sweat, hair, and whatever else was on the bare hands."}
{"text":"I drive by this incredible breakfast spot every day on my way to work, so when I finally got to try it out this morning I was eggstatic!! Eggstasy did not let me down.   To start, the staff was very welcoming and friendly. We were sat right away. The coffee was strong just the way I like it and cucumber water...refreshing! We were randomly and happily served the banana macadamia pancakes on the house. Not overly sweet and very hearty.   I ordered the prosciutto benedict and my boyfriend ordered the avocado benedict. So we did a lil swap and had one of each. I fell in love with both but the prosciutto really stole my heart! The hashbrowns were crispy just the way I like em!   Then some man with authority, perhaps the manager or owner, stopped by our table a couple times checking in on us, realizing we were newbies. He was very nice and accommodating.   Basically, I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"So happy they've opened closer, in my neighborhood.  Same GREAT menu, friendly employees, generous portions and options... I'm delighted.."}
{"text":"We tried this place yesterday for breakfast & everything was delicious. Service was excellent. We got a chance to sit outside since the weather was fab. We would say this place is the best new breakfast spot in Scottsdale. We will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast/brunch place. I want to try other things on the menu. They have A LOT of options!"}
{"text":"This place has a very cool outdoor patio with misters and shade that is awesome almost all year, I suspect. The atmosphere is very hipster-scottsdale-classy. This is a popular spot due to its prime location on Shea & Scottsdale so it is a bit more noisy than average. The prices are on par with most other Scottsdale locations, a little bit on the pricier side. I had the Dutch Apple French Toast ($12 after tax). The French toast was just two huge pieces of Texas toast with some apples on it, no sides. The French toast was very good, albeit a little overpriced. So all in all, a solid Scottsdale Breakfast spot with a hipster atmosphere similar to Hash Kitchen."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning and must have just beat the rush, got seated right away.  The food however was not good.  The Pretzel* Croque Madame was cold untoasted bread covered in a beschemel sauce which was actually not terrible.  Unfortunately they failed to inform that the pretzel portion was not availabale.  When I mentioned that the bread was untoasted and quickly got soggy to the waitress she took my plate and had the chef microwave the plate.  This created a sloppy mess.  Despite my plea to simply just get a side of eggs (which I was ready to pay for)  I was rudely informed that the Croque Madame was up to the chefs standards and that I was being picky."}
{"text":"Good service, excellent fresh squeezed/pressed juices, but only so-so food and higher than normal prices.  The omelet I ordered had great filling, but way too many (overcooked, rubbery, greenish) eggs surrounding the good stuff.  My boyfriend had some decadent stuffed french toast and he was happy in sugar high heaven.  We also ordered coffee and bacon, as those are our litmus test items for breakfast places.  The coffee was just ok and the bacon was decent.  The restaurant itself was clean, bright, and had a good vibe (very friendly wait staff).  I did note that the main dining area was really noisy.  Definitely won't be bringing Grandpa here.  Huh? What?  Never mind.  Overall, *shrug* - we're 50/50 on this place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  Junior was really great as well, even though he isn't a fan of the Seahawks:)    The food was as good as it gets, Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"The kids like it here and we have had some good experiences when they're not busy- but it seemed understaffed when we went during peak hours. We were told 30min but then waited about an hour for a table. While waiting we noticed lots of empty tables that were not been cleaned. Our server was super nice and fantastic with the kids but she had to run around the place to get to every table."}
{"text":"The husband and I joined about 15 other Yelpers here for the breakfast club UYE. This place graciously accommodated our large party, which was much appreciated. Our waitress was incredible, she was friendly, on top of things, and willing to help me navigate their huge menu. I don't think there are many breakfast items that aren't on their menu... this thing is huge, with pages and pages of items. The waitress had to help me decide between 4 items (ha!). I ended up getting the asparagus skillet (asparagus, bacon, garlic, cheese, quinoa, hash browns, and over medium eggs, about 12$ ish), which (to my surprise) comes with a 'side' of pancakes... and I had to try a specialty pancake (the macadamia nut) which was a 4$ up sell. The husband got the nutella crepes. I will be honest, I wasn't overly thrilled with the food. My 'skillet' came out in a bowl.. a little odd for a skillet, and just didn't have as much flavor as you would think from the ingredients. It wasn't bad by any means, it was good, but kind of boring. Maybe some fresh herbs or something would make it pop more. The side of pancakes was ridiculously large... I ate less than a quarter of them... and they really were nothing special. I have a little bit of a problem with restaurants that serve huge portions like this.... I feel like it's just wasteful.... very few people could possibly eat this amount of food, making so much food go to waste (bigger is not always better people). Why not give size options for the breakfast like 'small' and 'large' plates of the same food... then you can choose what you would like (and I know, you can share the food, but you don't always want the same thing, ya know?). Anyway, on the flip side, the husband's nutella crepes were delicious and even good as leftovers. The coffee was also good here and came with real cream... yes, you heard me... real cream... LOVE that. I would like to come back here and try something else, as many other items looked tasty. Will update the review at that time.    PS yes this place is loud, but not as loud as I thought it would be.... pretty normal for a restaurant this busy."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a friend of mine.  The weather was perfect so we sat outside on their patio. They have a super cute patio. I started with their strawberry/orange mimosa. It was a pretty small size but it tasted good. I wish it was a little bigger. lol. I ordered the prosciutto, red pepper, onion, cherry tomato, buffalo mozzarella omelette. This was really good, and was a pretty good size. I only got through half of it. It also comes with pancakes. So I definitely couldn't finish everything. lol.   This is a super cute brunch place. I really liked their outdoor patio. I wonder if they're dog friendly? They have a pretty big menu and everything is on the healthier side I thought. Customer service was also very friendly. =)"}
{"text":"Well... This place was recommended as a new breakfast spot in my neighborhood. I'm always down for a delicious breakfast but the overall experience was less than stellar. The hostess greeted us immediately with a smile and sat us at a table near the kitchen. Great start. Our service was ok. There were maybe 5 other tables taken at 11:45am on a Tuesday but got as much attention as if the place were packed. The servers all looked bored and less than thrilled to be there. I'm giving 3 stars is for the food. The Salmon omelette was HUGE and pretty comparable to similar dishes I've had elsewhere. Fruit was fresh and hash browns were perfectly cooked (in my opinion). Might give it another go on a weekend morning to get the full experience :)"}
{"text":"The owner Peter was very helpful, I am out of town from Boise I came in and there was an extra charge by accident and I called in and the owner Peter fixed the problem the first time and was very helpful this place is a must it has amazing food and amazing staff. & of course an awesome owner thank you Peter."}
{"text":"I was unsatisfied with the meals I had at this location. I went with 2 other people so I was able to try 3 dishes. I tried a breakfasr burrito and a breakfast sandwich--both very bland in flavor. Then we decided to give the French Toast a try. It was ok. I have not gone back since."}
{"text":"Debating between a 3 and a 4 - lets call this 3.5 Stars :)   Eggstacy gets the bump because of their food - however the rest of the experience left something to be desired.   We went for the first time for Sunday brunch - around 11am and there was quite a wait for the larger groups. Luckily our table for 2 was ready in no time and my friend was seated by the time I finished parking and joined her. Then we sat for the next 10 minutes with no drinks or even waters and virtually ignored by all the staff busy bustling throughout. Now it was busy, no doubt about that, but I was really hoping for some water at least, it was a hot day!   When the waitress did arrive, we were ready to put in our drink orders and she did bring us some much needed water. However, about 5 minutes later the waitress came back and asked me if I ordered the Apple Cider drink - which doesn't exist on the menu - and I clarified how I wanted the Boozie Iced Coffee. Another 10 minutes and both of our drinks were ready and we were onto the ordering. She again confused my friend's order and had to clarify, which I did appreciate as the wait was long and getting the wrong order for a Vegetarian would delay things quite a bit. Overall the waitress seemed really overwhelmed and confused throughout the day, which is unfortunate.   Another thing - this place was full of families eating big meals together - but the music was some loud techno noise. I don't get it, the volume and the type of music did not go with the atmosphere or clientele at all. Very strange choice and was honestly distracting. This, paired with the waitress and waiting had us discussing how we'd likely not be back - unless the food was great.   Well, the food arrived and it was AWESOME.  My ham and cheesy crepes were incredible and a portion so huge - 3 giant crepes filled with scrambled eggs, ham, and creamy cheese. My friend got a truffle butter brioche toast with asparagus and added mushrooms - it looked as good as it tasted. So in the end, we loved our food and the drinks were good too - always nice to have booze as an option. I would go back, just maybe not during the Sunday brunch rush - perhaps a weekday meal would be a better overall experience."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! really great service and HUGE portions. Very fresh and hip atmosphere. Lots of attention to detail. There is a huge out door seating area lots of interesting flavors for pancakes. I really wanted a coffee but didn't and the espresso smelled SO GOOD. This place is great!!! We went on our lunch hour and it was quick service for a large group!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have tried so many unique items, some of my favorites are the gyro hash breakfast and the churro waffle.  The private room is fantastic to reserve for events. Have been to a work function and a baby shower and it's a great space."}
{"text":"The food here is really, really good.  Went for breakfast and had CHOCOLATE COVERED BACON and a yogurt parfait, strange, I know, but I love a place where I can eat 'naughty or nice'.  Saw a few french toasts around that looked very yummy.  Coffee was great, juice was fresh squeezed, this place is a great addition to the neighborhood.  Love the bright colors & decor, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awful!  From the overly noisy to the hard beat of the techno dance club music, ambiance is horrible. Ordered simple eggs ( over medium) and bacon. Breakfast arrived with eggs cooked hard and simply over fried. With a name like \"Eggstasy\" you would think they would at least get the eggs right. The place could use a good scrubbing too. Never again!"}
{"text":"I went in today for breakfast and the hostess was just so nice. I believe her name was Maddy and she just made my experience! Definitely will be coming back. Was attentive to when I needed my drink filled and was so polite"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service I have ever seen. You walk in there are three adolescent hostess at the door. They are snotty and rude and dressed in clothing that would scarcely be appropriate in the home environment. You then wait agonizingly long on what is supposed to be contemporary furnishing. For the amount of time you sit there though it is uncomfortable while you watch the what appear to be incredibly stupid hostess adjust the waistband of her tights for 20 minutes but never seat one freaken person. Finally I get up to survey what the deal is and note no less than five open tables clean and ready to seat. When an inquiry is made we are amazingly next to be seated. They bring us to a table the seats are dirty the floor around it is covered with trash. You have to move the cheap ass furniture to even sit down. We had to share our menus with the table next to us who ended up seating themselves because they were like what the heck. There were not enough clean glasses for them to have one each they shared a water glass. This place is at best a bad joke. Bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Fabulous healthy menu and great patio with music Strawberry orange mimosa to die for Delicious and funky relaxed environment"}
{"text":"Now that the snow birds have gone home, get here for anything on the menu if you have not been here yet. I am trying to figure out how to get a few to go orders and stick them in my travel bags next week!!!"}
{"text":"It's a winner!! From the moment you walk in the door, the customer service, delicious food, and positive energy makes this new spot fantastic. The hash browns are crunchy and cooked to perfection, while the breakfast items are equally delectable. My mom and I shared the oats creme brûlée, which was the perfect combination of filling and sweet. Our waiter, Brent, and Holly added the egg-celent extra touch. We can't wait for more delicious meals to come!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Why go anywhere else for breakfast or lunch?  So many great options beautifully presented in such a cool looking place!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with great service. The staff is really friendly. The food is delicious. And the scenery is great. I like that it's Tucktaway behind everything and there's so many good-looking people that are here"}
{"text":"We've had a lot of great experiences here but today has been incredibly disappointing. We called last night for a reservation for our party of 11+ a baby hoping to have a nice breakfast with our family from out of town. This morning, because of how large our party was, we called to verify that they really did have our reservation and they said they did. We arrived 15 minutes early to make sure they wouldn't give our table away. They told us they had a table but they were just waiting for some people to leave so that they could push a couple more over. We expected 15 minutes of waiting in the heat, we could manage that, but it was bordering on 30 minutes with a four month old baby in the Arizona heat and it was far less than ideal. The whole reason we waited that long: they gave our reserved table away. Knowing we had a baby with us. They finally got us into a table in a less than ideal space but at least it was still inside. The service was good but it doesn't exactly make up for having a hot and cranky four month old, two hot 83 year olds, and three hangry teenagers with their 6 parents. Plus one breakfast was overcooked to the point of inedibility and they neglected to listen when our grandfather asked to bring the bill to him and instead left it at the opposite end of the table."}
{"text":"The banana cream waffle was amazing! The omelets were okay. We got the ham and cheese omelet and it came with American cheese, which is not something we expected or enjoyed. The pancakes were okay, but not the best and took forever to come out. The butter isn't salted. The other omelets from our table got were just okay - apple and Brie and the fig and goat cheese."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for brunch. Very large and open inside with tons of seating. Large menu selection but not overwhelming. Beautiful plate presentation as well!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the atmosphere was inviting and comfortable but my God, the service was slower than a slug race! Don't go there in you're in a rush to dine and leave. Waited 10 mins for creamer for the coffee.. Coffee was already cold by then. Meals arrive, server quickly left before I could speak up and ask for hot sauce. Was then able to flagged her down, but it took another 15 mins to get my hot sauce. By the time the hot sauce came, food was already eaten because I was hungry. There was another table who sat down 5 minutes after I sat down and 3 different servers kept asking them if anyone helped them yet and they kept saying no, not yet. Sigh... The food was good however.............. #HmmNotSureBoutThisPlace"}
{"text":"Still love the food-but we had a rather weird experience there on our last visit!  Our waiter started out great:  brought us waters, got our coffee, took our order, pleasant and courtesy.  Then after he served us, he came back for our obligatory \"how's everything?\" and DISAPPEARED!!!  We flagged down another waitress who re-filled our cups, got a box for my leftovers and she apologized saying she didn't know where our server had gone. About 10 minutes later we were ready to leave and STILL never saw our server!  Hated to do it but flagged down the nice waitress who had helped us before and asked if she could find our bill.  She did and apologized again, but we never saw the original waiter again.  Lucky the food was good."}
{"text":"Went this weekend on a Sunday always really busy on the weekend but the service was still good. It is noisy inside but the outside is awesome if the weather is nice. The food is always really good and the pancakes are good. The serving size are more then enough and enough food to Have for the whole day. Recommend this place on the weekdays if you don't want to wait or if you have time on the weekend."}
{"text":"Chocolate covered bacon was heinous and the french toast was not made with bread it seems but something that resembled 3 large pieces of pound cake....no bueno for me"}
{"text":"We had to check this place out after everything we had heard about it.   We got there and were seated outside and there were misters above us that were leaking.  The service was a bit unprofessional and scattered, and I started to get worried.   I ordered a skirt steak meal, and when it arrived I understood why everyone has been talking about this place. My steak was a bit cold, however it was absolutely delicious.   SO- if you have the patience for it, it's definitely worth taking a chance on it."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast spot! Love the vibe inside and never had a bad meal. Prices a little higher for breakfast but definitely worth it, and by far the best coffee around !"}
{"text":"For a place called Eggstasy, the scrambled eggs taste really weird. We didn't bother finishing ours.  Wonderful creative menu but fails on execution.   English muffin - dense and bitter tasting Hash browns - not crispy and little seasoning Scrambled eggs - tastes like some kind of egg substitute Chicks in a blanket - sausage not a good flavor Coconut mango crepe - amateur crepe with non ripe mango and coconut thrown in with little thought  Essentially an add-your-own spices kind of place with big enough portions and low enough prices to attract repeat customers. For foodies not so much."}
{"text":"This brunch place has so many options it's hard to choose! Tried the skinny B and it was great! The fruit here is a huge surprise. No cantaloupe or honeydew here; it's berries and fresh pineapple. The coffee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"The wait kind of sucked.  I wonder if that was because it was New Years Day. Anyway,  the portions were humongous. I ordered the b.a.l.t. (bacon, avo, lettuce, tomato). It came with yummy  french fries, a chicken veggie tortilla soup and a pickle. I had the strawberry o.j. which was fresh squeezed  and delicious.  Bacon was a little overcooked but good. Soup had bomb flavor.   My love had the meat omelet (not what it's  called).  Not sure what all was in it but it was a pretty  hearty portion.  He had hash browns and pancakes with it. Pancakes were kind of dry. The hash browns were a little burnt. Plates had nice presentation.   Nice,friendly staff. Not sure what the decor was trying to achieve but I didn't go there for that. I went for a tasty meal and that's just what we got."}
{"text":"By reading the other reviews we knew the service was expected to be bad. But we didn't know how bad! We were a table of 7 during brunch and it was busy. We were asked to sit at a table that was dead in the middle of two other tables. Not even my 8 year old daughter could fit to get to the table. The hostess just looked as we struggled to get to the table. Bumping everyone next to us. Even during our breakfast we were bumped while others left and more came. It was very uncomfortable. We waited for our server. Our appetizer (or foreplay) came with the rest of our food which both took forever. Two of us were missing pancakes and other side orders. My daughter didn't get her meal until we were almost done with ours. I kept asking but he said it would come. The food is cool to Instagram and it taste good. I just wouldn't be back. The bad service isn't worth a mediocre plate of food."}
{"text":"Delicious food + grapefruit mimosas + a bartender that looks like Jon Snow = an amazing Sunday.  I typically don't comment on servers/bartenders looks because that invites all sorts of attention, but DAMN the bartenders here were some good lookin' boys.   Anyway. I'm engaged. Ahem.  My best friend lives a couple blocks away so we walked over on Sunday morning. It looked like there would have been a lengthy wait, but they had 2 seats open at the bar outside, which was perfect. We made friends with the salty old gent to my right and proceeded to peruse the menu, which had MANY options. I was almost overwhelmed.  We ordered:  - Chocolate covered bacon: Do it. Don't ask questions. Thank me later. (You're welcome.) - Joe P's Protein Cakes: Gluten free! Berries! FOUR OF THEM! (Too much, if you ask me.) They were very thick, so if I had known there were 4 of them I might have ordered something smaller. - Chicks in Blankets: Chicken sausage inside pancakes. Yum! - Coffee: my first cup wasn't that hot but the second one was, and both were delicious. - Grapefruit mimosas: Just the right amount of bitter and sweet. I could have had a few of those without thinking twice.  A great thing about the bar: there are hooks underneath! I always loath having to hold my purse or put it on the bar, so this was welcome.  My ONLY complaint is that it was sometimes difficult to get the attention of the servers/bartenders. But they were nice to look at so it really wasn't an issue.  TL;DR: Decently priced, delicious food and drinks, but sometimes the wait might be long."}
{"text":"My horrible experience started when was ordering my drinks. everyone got their drinks except I. We waited 20 minutes for our food while other people who got here after us got their food before us. Finally, our food came out and we had no silverware to eat it with for 20 minutes we had to stare at our food and use our hands to eat. Finally we had to get up and go ask for silverware and they gave us one silverware when there was 3 of us who needed it. While all this was happening our waiter never came to our table after she took our order. Finally she came back to the table and when we asked for our iced tea, missing side of bacon, and silverware we got a sassy \"sure\". Then after we asked it took 10 minutes for us to get our missing items. Overall bad experience and I will not be  returning ever again even if i'm starving. I didn't want to give it a star but to share this post with you guys I had to  Update: the checks came and she divided everything wrong and acted mad at us for her mistake   Update 2: she gave us our reprinted checks and they are STILL not correct. Also she's not wearing a bra and that is not something i want to witness while i'm eating with my hands cause they didn't give me silverware"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I always have our Sunday brunch. This time we decided to try this place. Catchy name, we immediately loved it. There's a sparkling trendy atmosphere as you walk in. I was afraid for the waiting time but nope, we got seated right away. Yeah! Mimosas are great, they serve them in a cute little cylinder-shaped glass, be aware you're gonna need another one soon. Ask for a straw. As the precipitate of the orange pulp sits on the bottom, shake it a bit to taste both the orange and the champagne. I didn't get our waitress's name but she greeted us as we sat down and took drink and food orders with a smile. That's the attitude I want to see. (Always) But let's get down to the food part: we both got French toast. My girlfriend the stuffed banana and Nutella and I got the chorizo maple one. Divine! I thought they would come with eggs but I guess you have to ask for a side. We'll be back to try the eggs and other amazing dishes!! ;)"}
{"text":"This review is for the newer Scottsdale, 10155 E. Via Linda, Via Linda location.  I am one of 10 - 15 people from Logos church, who come here once a month on a Wed at 10 am for breakfast.  Eggstacy assumed the previous Egg and I at this address in 2017.   I always order pork belly eggs benedict $10.95 and they do not chrge me for extra hollandaise sauce like some places do.  but next time I wanna try the corned beef hash with 3 eggs and more.  We sit in a separate room.  Service is attentive and fast.  Place is packed and full of seniors.  Food is good but not any different from other breakfast places such as First Watch.  If I order poached eggs, soft, Eggstacy delivered it just right, but some places (Denny's) deliver hard boiled, is what I am saying and factored in the 4 stars I give this place."}

{"text":"Got to put our name on the list before we got here. Only waited about 10 min. Bloody Mary and coffee is amazing!!!! Some vodka I have never heard of and I usually go topshelf, dunno what it is but it's great. Coffee is imported from Italy and very bold.  Amazing! Food is 5 star as well. I got the panini and it was perfect. Huge! Girlfriend got the chorizo skillet and it is equally as good. Damn! Yum! Service was very good. You wouldn't even know it was packed cause the staff is on it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We rarely go out to breakfast but I love to do so and the menu caused my husband to remark that we'll have to come back because there are so many things he wants to try! Yay!  I had an omelet (yummy) which I easily shared with my two kids: ages 2 and 4, and still had some leftover. I appreciated that our server suggested sharing, as opposed to swindling us into kids meals instead (though well have to get the Mickey pancakes next time just because they looked fun and yummy). My husband had the salmon eggs Benedict and he said it was fantastic. The orange juice was generous and fresh squeezed and omg the hashbrowns?? Even if the rest of the food was horrible I'd be coming back for the hashbrowns. Best I've ever had, ever. My potato hating husband even devoured them.  The owner, or person I assumed was the owner, was very present. He was helpful working with his staff by clearing plates and also making the rounds to check in with guests. Super nice guy!  Kid friendly, delicious, great vibe, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a place that you to when you are really hungry or seeking to share. The portions are huge including the menu. It is hard to choose what to eat since everything sounds so good.  I had the brioche french toast, the bread is made there and each piece is at least 1 1/2\" thick, my mother had a side of pancakes which in most restaurants this would have been a full sized order and it only cost $2.95. Can't beat it! Others in our party had omelets which were packed with various add-ins and comes with a side of pancakes. Even the coffee, which is Lavazza, is very good and your cup rarely has a chance to be empty since our waitress kept our cups full all the time. The service is great for such a busy place we had just the right amount of attention paid to our table. They have a great outdoor, dog friendly patio too. But if you go on a weekend be prepared to wait for a table, it is very busy and it's best to sit outside if you can since inside is very noisy."}
{"text":"We brought 2 guests to Eggstasy for breakfast.  The menu is extensive with lots of options.  Waitress Erin was great.  Me and one of the other guests got our food after about waiting not too terribly long. The other two guests waited approximately 20 minutes more for their food to show up. By the time they got their food, we were completely finished.  Our waitress, Erin apologized.  We asked to speak to the manager and waited another 15 minutes.  We finally went up to the manager who seemed very inexperienced and who was too busy to bother with us and explained our complaint.  We told her we were not paying for any of our breakfasts which she agreed to comp.   Too bad we will badmouth this restaurant every change we get, because their food of which only 2 of us were served, was very good. Do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The salmon, onion, chive omelette is a fluffy, delicious delight. The pancakes are also perfect- sweet yet light. I was charmed by the ambiance & decor as well. I adore breakfast/ brunch and this is most definitely at the top of my list for brunch hotspots in Phoenix/Scottsdale. The menu here is insanely diverse & there's truly something for everyone here!"}
{"text":"Staff super nice and attentive. The menu is huge and very unique. While they have typical breakfast selections they have way more fun different options. A must if in the area"}
{"text":"Went in at about 1030am on a Friday. Place was very clean and modern. Time we arrived was no wait and staff greeted and seated us immediately.  Food came out quickly but not too quickly. It was made fresh and was well plated. Out waitress was nice and explained everything we needed from the menu. We had a very nice brunch. The place has an outdoor patio that very inviting. Too cold for my wife but it was inviting. Food was very good. Barbacoa omelette and Banana Macadamia Nut pancakes."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing! Portions were huge, and there was a large selection to choose from! Service was quick and our waitress was lovely!! There was virtually no wait. We had a group of three and there were tables already available, and the place was packed!!"}
{"text":"We've been here numerous times now. Their bench seats aren't the most comfortable (but not awful either) and outside tables a bit odd, but everything else is fantastic. I've yet to try something I didn't love. We tried their Bloody Mary's on our most recent visit, and I still salivate when I think back to the chocolate bacon. (The drink was yummy too!!) So glad to see they're often on a wait; were lucky to have this gem on our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We were salivating.  Our first time here was on Halloween.  Food was just  awesome after finding this place by mistake.  Full plate of food...hot...cooked right...we each had the two egg breakfast plus sausage.  The only bad was we had to wait a few minutes for the bread but that didn't amount to anything. So last Saturday when we were up again from Tucson we drove 10-miles from our hotel to Eggstasy even though we had a zillion places to go in between.  We couldn't wait. We ordered the same plates this time.  Once again...no toast.  But they served me the wrong eggs.  A few minutes later they re-served me...but we still had no toast.  We kept our plates covered with napkins while we waited.  Then the toast showed and away we went.  Our toast was not warm.  My hash browns were barely warm and way under cooked.  Sausage was OK.  Eggs were barely warm.  It was obvious they took back the original plate, cooked new eggs while the plate set, then they brought it back out with the proper eggs.  We didn't see our waiter until we were almost done eating...not good.  He asked how it tasted and we lied and said \"OK\".  But another 2-minutes went by and we realized we should not have lied.  Everything was cold.  So we told him about it and I said I was done despite having half of my cold food still on the plate.  He apologized and said \"he hates under cooked slimy hash browns too\"...but nothing came of anything.  No offer to replace...no manager...no discount.  So we paid...I left him 10%, not sure why I tipped him other than we're not troublemakers.  Then I wrote on my receipt things like \"cold food\", \"near-raw hash browns\", \"rip off for $30\".  Then I set it on the counter by the line where the manger was and walked away.  They looked at the ticket but did nothing.  I guess they have so much business they don't care.  Good for them.  Dispute going to American Express for this $30.  11/25 12:19 Ticket Y42 Server is Shea S  $33.60 total."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! My favorite lunch place. They were able to substitute toast/muffin with pumpkin cheesecake pancake (boy was it amazing! even 2 days later!). They give generous portions and price is right.   Waiter was very professional and was on top of everything. I like how they have an older gentleman/lady who screens all the food before they get taken to the customers.   Good atmosphere. attracts the right crowd (no little kids running and crying)."}
{"text":"Always open to trying a new breakfast place and this has a great location on Shea and 70th Street.  Went on a Friday afternoon and was seated right away even though they were pretty busy. The decor is pretty contemporary with some of the larger tables with bench seats. Seems like they try to make it like a open casual home feeling.   Shared the Denver Omelette,  asked them to substitute asparagus for bell peppers and they had no problem. Also substituted the buttermilk pancakes for the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. Also shared the fruit Waffles and ham kaseri crepes.  The omelette was good but if this makes sense tasted more like a bunch of scrambled eggs than an omelette. The pancakes were good but did not wow me.when the pancakes came out it looked like a glob of melted marshmallows on top of the pancakes. The hash browns were good and crispy the way they should be. The Waffles were done very well as was the huge portion of crepes.   The interesting thing was the cucumber water, kind of different but okay would prefer just plain water.   Overall the place is nice food is average to good and was nice to try a new place."}
{"text":"The food and service is always pretty good here and the food is amazing! Great options both tasty and healthy. This place gets pretty crowded for brunch so make sure to put your name in and be prepared to wait a few. They have a patio area as well for those who love this AZ sun. My boyfriend and I come here every time we are in the area. I think my favorite part is you can sub sides without a big surcharge or fuss.  I recommend the white chocolate raspberry pancakes, the churro waffle and nitro cold brew!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is outstanding!! Let's start with this staff: incredibly friendly and personable and despite how busy it was they were always on top of everything. The menu: wide range of selection and accommodating options for every diet. I was thrilled to see their selection of healthy options. I ordered an almond milk cappuccino with mocha and it was the best thing I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Lets talk about HORRIBLE!  First time here, recommended by a few clients.  Server: Leona or something like that. The WORST!  In my 20 something years, I have never had such a bad experience. One thing about any type of work, leave your bad attitude at the door. If you don't like your job, find something else to do, don't ruin my day just because yours isn't going well.  -came in, host was nice -sat down -L came and poured us water, walked away -once again, never been here. Would of been nice to explain a bit of the menu -L two tables away, starts yelling to us asking if we wanted anything to drink. Really? You couldn't wait until you actually approached our table?  Ordered two bloody Mary's  -for all the fuss about the bloody Mary's, they actually had no taste, very disappointing  -L come by again asking if we are ready to order, before I could even say anything, she turns her head and walks away -about 2/3 minutes later, she comes back and asks what we want -my friend had a few questions, of course, and L seemed irritated to answer -I asked about the eggs Benedict. Got two options, later to find out they have about 6 different ones to choose from. And yes, she looked annoyed about that as well -about 30 minutes into it, our food has yet to come -I look around and notice 3 tables, who came after us, are already half way through there meals -I look up trying to find our waitress and see her by the kitchen, she starts walking to her section and notices that we still don't have our food -runs to the computer and puts our order in -comes to the table and blames the kitchen for not getting the \"prosciutto\" right. - don't ever LIE to your quests, if you were honest, I would of understood, shit happens. But don't tell me 3 orders went in, but ours simply didn't go through the system. Are you fucking kidding me?  -on top of that, don't blame the kitchen, take fault for your mistakes -I got up, stopped the order, called for a manager -took off our drinks, obviously.  -asked if we wanted the food to go on the house. After the worst service ever, no thanks. Offered coupons or whatever for next time, no thanks. I didn't complain to get free stuff. Your servers need to be taught better.   I'm not one to complain, people have their off days. But this one, I can't even put in to words, of how I felt. So un welcomed.   It's unfortunate, your food has been talked up by many. We didn't get to taste it, and I refuse to ever go back.   0 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here yesterday for the first time for breakfast. Here we are again today two days in a row. It's that good!   Yesterday: I had the ham and asparagus crepes. Divine. My daughter had the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes and a side of hash browns. The food was cooked and designed to perfection.  The only thing I will say is those crepes need a light hollandaise sauce. The pancakes were perfect. We also each had the fresh squeezed strawberry OJ. AMAZING.  Today: we went with something a little different. We tried the strawberry mimosas. Great!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast meeting here and it was just OK.  I had the Greek Omelette and it was huge and came with a huge serving of hash browns and pancakes or toast.  Way too much food and who takes breakfast leftovers away from a business meeting?!! I would suggest cutting down on the portions and the price (I think it was $13).  The atmosphere reminded me of a camp lunch room with the long tables.  Not a big fan of the cucumber water but they brought me lemon water instead.  Waitress was very nice and prompt."}
{"text":"Excellent!  My new favorite breakfast place.  Crepes are delicious- also tried gypsy skillet and chocolate bacon. Well priced. Great expression bar. Well done."}
{"text":"Such A cute place! I came with a friend for brunch and we completely loved it... I had the skirt stake and it was cooked to perfection... Yummy drinks  we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If your slogan is going to be \"Breakfast. Brunch. Mimosas.\" I would offer a Mimosa menu. Both times I've dined here I have asked what mimosas they offer and the response has been \"normal ones\" or \"idk we can do grapefruit or cranberry?\" I like this place. The food, atmosphere and service is good. But it could be a lot better if they offered some better cocktails."}
