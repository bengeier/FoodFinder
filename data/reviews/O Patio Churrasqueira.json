{"text":"I love coming here. The reason why I'm giving a 4/5 is because I wish they had a larger variety of traditional Portuguese plates .  You really get the bang for the buck here, food is delicious and at a reasonable price.  I had the Portuguese chicken - typical, but oh boy was it delicious! The side salad was not well dressed though, I felt like not much effort was put into it, but that chicken though!   I also tried their Portuguese home made pudding and that just blew my mind.    I've been here a few times and will be coming back for more. It gets quite crowded on the weekends so if you decide to come you should call to reserve a table.  Another great thing is that they have their own parking - so you can just park, eat and relax."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on the weekend for lunch because we felt like some good Portuguese food. Waited 30min before we could order half liter of wine, 2 quarter chicken plates with rice & potatoes which came out cold and a calamari to start. When the calamari came out we were shocked at how it looked, after trying it we confirmed it was store bought frozen calamari. Disgusting! We told the waitress we didn't like it and wanted to return it, she seemed ok with that. Once we got the bill, we noticed the $8 calamari was still on it. We then tried to make it clear to our waitress we returned it because we didn't like it, she was confused so we asked for a manager. A tall balding man came out and asked why we didn't like the calamari, we said it wasn't calamari we expected to get from a Portuguese restaurant plus it was too breaded, he then proceeded to argue with us and tell us that he already bought the food, who's gonna pay for it etc.., then said if you didn't like something at McDonald's would they give you back your money or exchange it? We were like YES! At this point we were very uncomfortable, he finally agreed to take the calamari off the bill huffed and puffed then walked away. Long story short, the wait time is brutal, the owner has no people skills, he's rude and would rather lose 2 customers than swallow an $8 plate of store bought frozen calamari. We will never go back here again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bacalao a bras. You have to call in the morning on Thursday to ensure it'll be available for pick up after lunch but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Casual atmosphere,  reasonable prices, delicious chicken and the homemade hot sauce is too good !!! The Bala Bala or homemade round fries are soo good. I've also tried the beef skewer which is good too. My collegues also like to try the grilled squid and battered cod. It's close to my work and provides a chill no fuss atmosphere, my manager knows all the staff by name now. The hot sauce I was told is a secret family recipe and only 4 people know it !!! I recommend O Patio"}
{"text":"The service is great here.  I came in for takeout. Without ordering ahead it was ready in minutes. The food taste great and their homemade hot sauce even better.  The portion sizes are huge. More than worth your money."}
{"text":"Says its open til 11pm and i called at 10:30 for a pick up order and the women over the phone told me theyre closed."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  The server told us to seat ourselves - and then didn't bother to bring us a menu or ask us for drink orders for over 5 minutes.  We eventually gave her our order.  She returned less than 3 minutes later with these small plates with our food crowded on to it.  The chicken was barely warm, there wasn't any piri piri sauce provided.  The potatoes were cold.  The server didn't come back to our table until we had to flag her back so my dinner companion could get some water."}
{"text":"We were invited for a birthday get-together on a Saturday evening for a total party of just under 20 people. The hosting couple are regulars. We got fantastic service and the food was great. It wasn't warm enough for the patio so no can say about that. The only non-issue was the stack of potato boxes obstructing the entertainment."}
{"text":"Best chicken in toronto.....love the patio and the golf out back...salad always fresh"}
{"text":"I'm changing my review"}
{"text":"The first time I had Portuguese chicken, it was over 10 years ago at a restaurant that closed within a year of opening. The food was lacking and I never felt the desire to have Portuguese chicken since.   For my coworkers birthday a couple weeks ago,she wanted to have dinner at O Patio. She claimed it's the Best Portuguese restaurant in the city\"   I ordered quarter chicken dinner with white meat and the rest of the party ordered salmon and steak dishes. The food took a long time to arrive, we waited about 40mins. There was a couple that arrived 20mins after we ordered and received their food within 10mins of ordering. They ordered bbq chicken so it could be that our salmon and steak order took longer to make.   The portions were very generous and everyone enjoyed their meals. The chicken was very tender and moist, potatoes are nicely seasoned and not over cooked. My meal was around $10 before tax and tip.   Overall the food here is delicious i definitely recommend it. The chicken dishes will come out quick but if you order other dishes, it takes a while to come out. The restaurant also has a hot table for lunch time and for express takeout."}
{"text":"Location was weird but boy is it worth it. Free parking and lots of it!  You walk down the stairs and into a nice looking restaurant. Nice enough to hold a small celebration in. The front is the \"cafeteria\" style ordering with a large range of dishes and not just the chicken, potato and rice. Although the chicken and potatoes are damn delicious.   The potatoes are soft, but so much flavor it's almost like mashed potato with gravy when i bite into it. The chicken was moist, crispy skin, not too salty but great flavor.   Service was great, called in a pick up and everything was easy. They didn't start putting things together until I got there, but everything was quick and easy. Threw in a small order of olives and they are delicious!!!   Will be back to try their other dishes. All in all a great win!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here but I am a big fan of Portuguese cousine, I love the mix of spices and meat choises that this cousine has to offer.   We got all the traditional places like the chicken with tomato sauce, white seasoned rice, potatoes, salad, and barbecue style beef. Everything was great! I really enjoyed the food and the great taste of authenticity. Portuguese cousine is usualy not spicy but rich in flavour which is quite tasteful.  The service here was friendly and they know how to time all the food you order, this is always a great quality to a good restaurant. To me this show they understand the service industry.   I recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"This place was actually really easy to find, thanks to the big sign they put beside Keele st. The girl behind the counter served me quickly though, so that was a bonus. I got the 1/2 chicken dinner. I liked that they had a large assortment of sides (I got to pick 2), but I'm pretty sure she nuked my side veggies in the microwave which resulted in them being a little mushy. The chicken was good, a tad dry, if it was a little more tender on the inside and crispy/charred on the outside it would've been perfect. The potatoes were actually really really good, nicely seasoned and soft, a bit oily but it didn't take away from its taste. Make sure to ask for hot sauce when you go, it makes the chicken tastes awesome. Oh and there's no tax, which is a bonus. Definitely will come back if I get another craving for bbq chicken"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Best Portuguese food I've tried."}
{"text":"This is a very busy  restaurant that you can't tell from outside. We went on a sunday afternoon around 2pm and thought it would be semi empty. When we walked in, the restaurant was full and we had to wait a while for the servers to clean up a table for us. Surprisingly by the time we left the restaurant around 3:30, the restaurant was still full... Not many restaurants that I can think of is constantly busy especially at the time between lunch and dinner.    They served bread as soon as we sat down, which was nice. It was the 2nd time we came here and the first time we ordered half chicken with veggies and potato chips, I remember the veggies were a little bit cold as they were already sitting in the counter. I tried to order something from the menu and not in the counter this time.   My husband ordered the quarter dark chicken with potato chips. I order the stir fry chicken with mushroom sauce and fries. I thought mine was decent, However my husband's dish was a bit cold. I guess the chef finished his first but took longer to prepare mine.   We waited our dish for at least half an hour, it was a bit long. I think if you order the daily special that already in the counter, or bbq chicken would be faster.   I don't understand why this place is so busy. I guess there aren't many Portuguese restaurant that you can sit down and eat comfortably in Toronto as many of them are take out only.  Not sure if we would come back, but if we do, I think coming earlier to get the daily special maybe a good idea."}
