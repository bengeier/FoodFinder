{"text":"We had a late lunch at this place Monday. I will say the food was phenomenal. But the service not so much. Our waitress was very short and seemed to be taking her bad day out on us. She actually snatched the menu out of my boyfriends hand as he was still ordering! The food came out fast, the manager did come around and ask how things were, and the smell was brought us there. The smokiness of the ribs was on point. Just stinks that the service was awful. We talked about going back again. The other waitresses seemed nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Omg so good!!! We had the chicken tacos to start and for dinner the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"We met a friend for a late lunch.  We sat on the front patio, which is nice, but noisy from the street.  

Service issues: It took 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us and take our drink order.  In the 30 second greeting from our waitress we were convinced that she really hates her job.  When our friend arrived and asked what was on tap (which is NOT written in the menu), the waitress named 2 beers and couldn't remember any more.  Then she pretty much ignored us for a while (45 minutes) and finally came back asking if we were expecting another person and said that is why she ignored us.  She couldn't keep our drinks filled throughout the whole time.  So, we finally got to order and her tablet wasn't working and she didn't have anything to write the order down on.  Then when the food came, she missed putting in the order for wings (the man who brought out the food apologized and said they were on him).

Food: Friend got the bbq flat bread and she said it was phenomenal.  My boyfriend got the smoked wings mild and a side of sweet potato fries.  The wings were fall off the bone and good, but he said the mild sauce was way spicier than he likes.  The sweet potato fries were average sweet potato fries.  I had the chicken/bacon/ranch wrap with fries.  The wrap was ok, but needed cheese, it had no cheese, but it didn't say it came with cheese on the menu.  Fries were ok, but could have been cooked just a minute more so they were a little crispier.

Prob won't be back.  This is the second time eating here and we were less than impressed with the food and think the menu doesn't have enough options.  At least the last time we ate there we sat at the bar so we didn't have the service issues."}
{"text":"Went there for Daughter's Birthday. My daughter and wife ordered the Ribs, Son in Law had the Pull Pork sandwich and I had the Cajun Grouper. Daughter got the sweet potato fries and baked bean side, Wife the mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts, Son in Law Mashed potatoes and I got french fries and Apple Coleslaw . The mashed potatoes must have been several days old and reheated. They were the consistency of a thick paste, think mortar and a grey color. We advised they take it off the menu for the night as it wasn't good at ALL. The waiter asked if we would like something else, but the only time we saw him other than when he brought our meals was when he brought the bill. So too late for that. The Ribs tasted of being refrigerated and reheated. Son in Law liked his Pulled Pork Sandwich. I found my fish dry and salty. The Apple Coleslaw has Granny Smith Apple shredded in it and it is not a winner, the Apple didn't add anything to the flavor and actually took away from the taste. It too can come off the menu. Since we only saw our waiter during the ordering, delivery of food and the end of our dinner we didn't get a refill on our adult beverages meaning the restaurant is loosing money on this waiter. Daughter claimed the last time she went she had the same waiter and on her way to the restrooms which are by the Kitchen she saw him in the Kitchen spending his time dancing and their service that night was terrible as well. I rate the food Poor, Service Poor and ambiance so - so."}
{"text":"Good:  ok BBQ, except our party received several items that appeared to be microwaved from a previous batch.  

Sauce is good, but because there are so many individual tastes out there, this stuff comes off sweet  

Side dishes are better than the entrees

Bad: service is absolutely the pits.  Might as well bring a pillow and blanket and get cozy while you wait.  Maybe this is why i got microwaved brisket?

Atmosphere is about as exciting as watching paint dry, which ironically was happening while we were there  

Attitudes and staff conduct were like watching McDonalds employees prep for dinner rush.  Not sure if the owner was one of the cast of characters, but by the time we left, i felt like i needed a shower, and it wasnt from the smoking BBQ. 

Id lay a bet that these people watch a lot of Food Network and at least prepare the food as such.  However, there is no passion in this restaurant; maybe Restaurant Impossible can make a show here?

Folks, bottom line, youre not missing anything by passing O & E up.  The old Tony Romas in mayfield was leaps and bounds better, and that was a chain!

Prices are high for what you get; low value.  Also, i read some other reviews and a couple sound like advertising rather than review.  C'est la vie - take your chances as you wish.  Cheers mates!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I met his family here for lunch yesterday. After reading the reviews, I was excited to try the great BBQ.

We arrived after his family so they were already seated. The restaurant is fairly large, the bar area had a few customers, but the dining area only had one other party. Yet we were sat at a table in the corner near the servers station...odd but we laughed it off and figured oh well they're not busy so the servers are rarely coming over there.

The service started out pretty decent. The server, very nice and friendly took our drink orders...water and beer. (The water was disgusting, it tasted like it had been salted down). But three of our draft beers and two kid's sodas came quickly, however one beer (bottled) took them at least 10 minutes to bring to the table. Again, brushed it off. The server took our orders, everything on the menu sounded amazing. Three of us ordered the pulled pork sandwich with sides (sweet potato fries, apple slaw and mac and cheese). Another ordered the pulled chicken salad and the kids ordered sliders -no buns, no cheese, just the patty with fries.

We waited a very long time for our food. At first it wasn't big a deal because we were just enjoying catching up...but then when we realized that we were almost half way through our second extra large draft beer it started to become a bit of an issue.  It took about 35 minutes from time we ordered our food until it was delivered. But...we couldn't start eating yet because it took another 10 -15 minutes for them to bring the two kids meals (the 2 plain slider patties). Who brings out 4 adult meals and leaves the kids waiting that much longer? All they kept saying was \"sorry\" and \"it'll be out soon\".  By this time our plates had gotten cold, but alas we can eat.

The pulled pork was really good, it had a fantastic smokey flavor. Although I felt the BBQ sauce fell short of anything to talk about. They gave such a small amount, had to get extra on the side, but still didn't have any distinct flavors, could've been out of bottle from the grocery store. The sides were really good as well, only down side is the sweet potato fries were a bit overcooked while the regular fries (with kid's meal) was a bit undercooked. I really like the mac and cheese the best.

Everyone did really like their food. And if just reviewing the food, I would give it 4 stars.  However with the poor service I had to take a star back. I really think they could have made it up in some way, such as comping the kids meals...but they didn't bother to do anything.

If in the area again, I would probably give it another chance but I really hope they can improve on their service."}
{"text":"Sadly, this was our second visit.  This time in their new location, so I figured, the service would be faster... WORSE,... An hour from when we placed the meal to food delivery.  Not acceptable.  We enjoyed drawing on the paper covering the table and actually had to flip it over to another side to draw and play hangman with two kids.  The food not so good this time.  Last time the cornbread was the bomb, this time, not.  The slaw is really good still.  Barbequed pork came with a pile of barbeque sauce on top.  Hey mix it in, and it cooks in there and tastes better.  My bread was soaked and mushy.... Not getting any better.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I live right in chesterland and have been to the old restaurant three times and the new place once. We generally get really good service. I don't understand some of the impatient reviewers. Two hours for dinner seems perfectly reasonable to me.  We usually go with a group of 4 or 5 and really enjoy talking and taking our time. If you just want to \"eat\" go somewhere else, personally I enjoy the relaxed environment."}
{"text":"This place brought us back to our days of living in Houston, TX. The ribs are perfectly smoked and have excellent flavor. The BBQ sauce is zippy and smoky. All of their side dishes are made in house and very fresh and flavorful. Seriously recommend the cheesy succotash and baked beans - they were both highlights! 

DO NOT pass up one of their bourbon cocktails. Creative and tasty, these are a ridiculous bargain and priced at only around $7. (and would go for $15+ downtown)

Love the patio but wished they didn't allow smoking there."}
{"text":"Amazing barbecue restaurant near cleveland! Love their beef brisket and delicious sides."}
{"text":"First time at Oak and Embers and I wasn't impressed. From the beginning, they were off to a bad start. We stood at the hostess stand for 10 minutes before being greeted. We sit down to a half empty restaurant at 6:30 on a Saturday night. The restaurant slowly starts to fill up around us and every other table is being greeted by a waitress and getting drinks. After 20 minutes, I go to the hostess stand and ask for a waitress. 10 minutes later, I go ask the bartender for a waitress. We've now been in the restaurant for 40 minutes, sitting for 30 and still haven't placed a drink order. Finally, the hostess comes over and takes our drink order. 5 minutes later, our waitress comes over and to get our drink order again bc \"it was confusing\".....3 kids lemonades, 2 waters and a bourbon. Really confusing. We immediately place our meal order since we've now memorized the menu. It takes 40 minutes for the food to come out. Our drinks have been empty for 20 minutes and no refills offered. The food was decent. At the table we had the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs as entrees. Sides were fries, green beans, baked beans, apple slaw and succotash. The BBQ was ok.....all 3 were dry but had good flavor. The apple slaw, baked beans and succotash we great. The kitchen is operating out of a mobile kitchen trailer behind the building. I don't know if this temporary but I hope so. A relatively new restaurant that still needs to get the kinks out bc the front of the house completely failed tonight. I might come back for a 2nd chance but they sure have work to do. You can have great food but if the front of the house can't handle the customers, you won't be in business very long."}
{"text":"Very good.  Great beer selection with 12 taps of hand - crafted beer. Service was good. We sat at the bar and had the smoked wings and the burnt ends. They were both delicious.  The smoked wrongs are waaaay better than any fried wings I have had. The burnt ends were tender and the Bourbon BBQ sauce was awesome."}
{"text":"Our second visit.  Ordered the Cajun grouper which was a thin slice and mushy.  The fries were not crisp.  The Apple slaw was very good and the BBC slider were very tasty albeit greasy.  With the limited menu it may be hard to find a favorite but we may try again and hope four quality improvement to make things better."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Went on a Thursday night around 6pm and it had a decent amount of people but wasn't too crowded. Sat outside on the patio which was very nice and relaxing. 

Order: 
Appetizer: Burnt ends with plantains 
Burnt ends were in a delicious bbq sauce and were absolutely delish!  The plantains were yummy. Needed a bit more salt but together everything was great. SAUCEY!

Main Meal: The openfaced chorizo bbq meatloaf sandwich with cheddar. Fries on the side and fresh squeezed lemonade. The meatloaf was the perfect balance of both meats and was extremely moist. Very good. I highly recommend.  Lemonade was one of the best I've had.
Brother had shrimp and grits which was really good. Shrimp had amazing flavor while the grits lacked a little but when combined with shrimp it all balanced out to create a flavor fair in your mouth.

Bill was under $40 dollars which was great.

Conclusion:Great service, great prices, great meal. Hopefully will be able to get back here to try other yums."}
{"text":"The fresh squeezed lemonaid is a must have. I had the chorizo meatloaf and the flavor was just incredible. Husband had the brisket and loved it. We have been smoking meats for over 20 yrs and this was the first bbq place in ohio that has outdone our home cooked smoking. Highly recommend if you like down home smoked bbq."}
{"text":"My first and last visit for dinner.  Service was marginal, but from my view of the restaurant it wasn't on our server. Everyone seemed to be waiting, which I think is how they want it, so you drink more. Most of the patrons were there for the bourbon, the bar and power drinking

In fairness my wife's dinner was great. The brisket was tender and delicious, the mac and cheese was as expected and the sweet potato fries were good.  Mine meal on the other hand was a nightmare. 

I order buttermilk fried chicken with cheesy succotash as listed on the menu.  I was expecting a fried chicken, (a breast, leg /thigh, wing or some other combination with bones and skin) and succotash (usually Lima beans, diced peppers and corn) in a cheese sauce. What I got was two pounded out chicken thigh strips with burnt breading and a cup of summer squash in a cheese sauce. I detest summer squash, and moved the squash off the plate as soon as it arrived.  The waitress who was standing there said nothing.  The chicken strips were dry, the breading was dry tasteless and burnt.  It would have been nice to have a dipping sauce for the strips, but to have a dipping sauce would require them to actually describing the item correctly on the menu as chicken strips not buttermilk fired chicken (which implies bones and skin and a flavorful breading). 

When the waitress came back to pick up the plates, mine was full of burnt breading and an untouched bowl of cheesy crap.  No comments or questions. 

While I saw a few families there, the place is geared for drinkers. I suppose if I had a few belts that may have made my dinner enjoyable. There are places that are closer with more descriptive menus with an atmosphere more geared for dinning rather than drinking."}
{"text":"Stop in for dinner if you have three hours of your life to waste. 
My girlfriend and I stopped here on a Saturday night at around 8pm. The place was pretty crowded which give me the idea I was in for a good meal. We got seated at a booth and was greeted by a server in a timely manner. We ordered our drinks........ 15 minutes later they arrived. 
My girlfriend ordered a glass of wine......big mistake. For the next 45 minutes we waited for our meals while fighting off fruit flies. Tons of fruit flies. While waiting for our food, we noticed NO ONE in the bar was eating. Everyone was waiting. Why is a Chicken Salad and Tacos taking almost an hour to get out? 
Our food finally arrived, COLD.  I sent it back (first time in my life) the manager came to our table and claimed that the chicken on the salad was \"supposed to be severed cold\" THFOH. 
Like someone mentioned I an early review, everyone seemed to be waiting. Just sitting around. Don't go here unless you have nothing else planned for your day. 
In addition: this place is pretty new. They need to fire the bar manager. There are grammatical errors all over the drink menu. Miller Light!? Look at the bottle, it's clearly says \"Lite\". Angry Orchard is a cider. It doesn't belong is the Malt category. It is not malt based what so ever."}
{"text":"Probably the best home cooked food ever. Very slow service, but taking in account they had a fire and are cooking under tarps and in a trailer, I'll cut them slack. Will be back when they are fully restored and then re-evaluate."}
{"text":"Great little local restaurant for BBQ! Service, food and atmosphere are all GREAT!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this new place. 
Even if you didn't know what they're all about you can tell by the smell as soon as you walk through the door - smoked meat is the specialty!
The food is good and there are a few items I'd like to try; so definitely planning on going back.
We didn't like the decor much; it's way too dark in there. I don't know whether painting the walls dark colors was such a good idea. There's not much of natural light coming through to compensate.
In general though, a good place, especially for the meat lovers."}
