{"text":"Wasn't very happy at all, the guy didn't seem whatever about his job and the freezes we ordered were already melted and runny and didn't taste great at all. Will not come back and Will make sure my friends don't either"}
{"text":"Our first time here: They are out of Napkins, Drink Lids, and of all things - ROOT BEER. The tables are filthy, and though the staff has been pleasant, it does not make up for the pathetic management! This place needs serious help."}
{"text":"After waiting in line for a few minutes while the person working was getting other people their order(Don;t shortstaff the help) I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger combo. It was good the burger was excellent. The fries were good and the Root Beer was great."}
{"text":"This is a combo building with a long johns silver I've ate their food before but being from Kentucky I'd never had nor heard of this place so I thought I'd give it a try. The staff isn't the nicest and if you ever want any kind of sauce from this place you have to ask because they don't just give it to you. The A&W was surprisingly much better than the long johns silver portion and their fries are really good as well. If you do go here get the root beer or root beer float but make sure you get the chilled mug with it"}
{"text":"The items I am truly in love with here are the fried cheese curds and the root beer floats. If I could have them all day, everyday, I would!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of soda.  But I do have a soft spot for ROOTBEER!!! A&W rootbeer is one of my favorites.  I Only come here for rootbeer and rootbeer floats.  The four star rating is based on the fast, friendly service and the always great rootbeer float.  Perfect ratio of icecream and rootbeer.  I dont care for the food here, hate that it shares a kitchen with long john silvers.  I bought fried before at this location and the fries had that fish fry taste.  bleh.  But aside that come by and enjoy a rootbeer float worth it!,"}
{"text":"Well it is fast food, I thought it was a bit over priced.. The root beer is damn good to be honest! I think it will be a while before I am back..."}
{"text":"First of all, I rarely give a review to a fast food restaurant.  If I end up reviewing a FF joint, it's due to great service or a poor review. That said, the reason for my review is a good one.  It's all about service.  Been here about 4 times in the last year.  Every time I've been in here, usually drive thru, I've always had the best service.  A couple of nights ago arrived her 2 minutes before closing. My fault, thought that this place closed at 11 PM, but it closed at 10 PM.  The Mgr took my order, like they should, but with no complaints.  The Mgr is always polite and the service is always quick.  If you're in the area and want something quick & heathly, this is a good spot. BTW, healthy only if you order off the Fresh Grille Menu. Otherwise, like any other fast food when it comes to nutrition.   What I've Tried: -Super Sampler:  Average at best.  Greasy and about 1,800 calories.  -Big Cod Fish and Chips:  Thick piece of battered cod.  This was pretty good. -Chicken and Fish Combo:  Just like the Super Sampler, will do if you're starving and willing to consume 830 in one shot.  -Salmon Entree:  My normal order.  Can't beat 255 calories with about 25 grams of protein."}
{"text":"I feel 4 stars is generous for A&W but I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I came here for lunch today after being shot down by Lola's.  There was no place to park at Lola's.  So I ended up at Decatur and Charleston at A&W because it was something different.  I ordered a combo A5.  That is a bacon cheese burger with fries and a drink.  Of course I got a root beer.  Why would I get anything else to drink at an A&W?  It is what they are famous for.  So you can't go wrong with that.  I only wish I had ordered the frosty mug for it.  The fries were very good.  Not your typical fast food fries.  These were thick cut and almost restaurant style.  They go well with malt vinegar which is available at this location as it is combined with Long John Silvers.  On to the burger.  It was not the best burger I have ever had.  It was not especially hot.  But it came out fast and the bacon on it was crispy to perfection.  Service is not exceptional here.  Nor is it bad.  Just limited I guess you could say.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door.  I placed my order.  I received my food.  I ate.  I left.  That was the end of it."}
{"text":"This is an A&W/LJS-so everything taste fishy & fried-jk  Really its a pretty good fast food burger & hotdog but the fried stuff is just too greasy & heavy for me.  I jumped on the $.90 papa burgers on Fathers Day & this is one of the best bargains you will ever find at a fast food joint.  I still hang on to the memories of yesteryear when A&W was just like Sonic with the roller waitresses and drive-up ordering unfortunately the food is no where near the same as it used to be.  Just too damn FAST!"}
{"text":"Can I say how many times I've been to this A&W/Long John Silvers? I'm not sure, because it's too many times to count. This happens to a be a favorite hit-up spot of my boyfriend's. He really loves this place and I'm not entirely sure why. Now that we've moved from his side of town to mine, we've been going to one a little closer, but we were over on the North side of town last night and of course, he wanted to eat here.  Okay, it's not terrible, because it's fast food and all fast food is kind of terrible, right? I'd rather eat at McDonald's... or Burger King, or definitely Inn N Out or Sonic. That's a lot of places I'd rather eat at.   Of course this is a combo restaurant. I believe A&W teamed up with LJS because their business had been failing (surprise!). I LOVE A&W Root Beer and Root Beer Floats, which is probably the only reason I'd ever come here before meeting my boyfriend, I had never had the food. The food is so mediocre, it's sad. The burgers are tiny, and sometimes they remind me of lunch-time at my elementary school. The fries are absolutely nothing special. As for the LJS side, I can say I only like Hush Puppies. Other than that the thought of their too-much-breaded fish and its greasiness make me run for the hills.   I want to say it is okay because it is an American \"classic\", but I feel as though A&Ws will soon be gone from our landscape. Oh, as a side note, they do serve deep-fried cheese curds. Probably one of the only fast food joints that do."}
{"text":"A&W and Long John Silver combined you say?! This is one of my top fast food joints.   You have the A&W side with burgers and of course my favorite Coney chili cheese dogs. You also can get your classic root beer floats and shakes and their freezes. The freezes will give you brain freeze so I dare you to take a sip without caution! Of course this is the only place by me that does my favorite Wisconsin cheese curds so that is enough reason to stop by.   Now for Long John Silver side of the menu. Love me some fried cod and chicken or some shrimp. Hush puppies should be one of your sides. Also something about their coleslaw I like I just can't put my finger on what makes me like it more then other places I have had it haha.  The employees and manager are friendly and the place is kept clean. I always ring that bell before leaving.  I know they probably hate it but I like them to know they did a good job haha.  I give A&W/Long John Silvers 4 stars for the great fast food and for the awesome service."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm soooo good, I was sucking my spoon silly!   ***2011 Entertainment guide, buy one get one coupons***  Yummy! My sister and I had a craving for a refreshing root beer float, also had a two for one coupon.  The service is awesome for a fast food type of chain!  We got our Yummy RB floats and were so happy just moaning and enjoying every sip and spoonful.  The combination of the almost buttery tasting golden soft serve along with the A&W root beer is just amazing, the perfect blend!  We will be back for sure!   I want to experience this sensation again and again and again!!!  It made me feel so darn good! The taste is out of this world!  Mmmmmmmm yummy baby :)  I like it a lot!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Well I was driving looking for somewhere clean to grab a small bite & wash my hands since I was in the area that I was currently working in my outside sales job. I made a u-turn & found myself staring at the restaurant next to it \"Lumberjacks Restaurant\" but quickly changed my mind due to the fact that there wasn't a single car in front of that place, how ever I've always been a fan of Long John Silvers. But this place was a fast food \"Shangri La\"! The decor was done in a 1950's style with huge booths & a Juke box too! But the best part was the management! They are incredibly nice & helpful, and the music that was playing on the regular was all classic 70's-80's-90's R&B/Funk! Not to mention that they have burgers-to-fish planks! I give this place nothing but a huge thumbs up! I would totally comfy here anytime that I'm in the area!!"}
