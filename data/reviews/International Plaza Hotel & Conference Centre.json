{"text":"Not a bad place.  Staff were friendly, Starbucks in the lobby is nice.  Had to pay $14/night for parking and the room was fairly dated."}
{"text":"We booked a King Corner room on the 11th floor, a month before Valentines Day. Our room included free parking, breakfast for 2 and WiFi. Even though, I wasn't very pleased with the view we had from our room, the location was convenient. Our room was very spacious and had a nice wallk-in closet, but the washroom was small. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We went to \"Grand Chinese Cuisine\" for dinner, and surprisingly the food was good. We went to \"Harry's Bar\" for breakfast, which was included in our package. I didn't really like the breakfast choices there, but at least we didn't starve to death. Overall, I enjoyed my stay there."}
{"text":"On hotels.com, we booked a 2 bedroom king suite for 1 night. When we got to the hotel, we were helped by Candice and were told the room wasn't ready as they only have 3 such rooms. Since we were in a hurry, we asked if we could be checked in, and leave our bags with the bellman to then be sent up to our room when the room is ready. Candice agreed, got all my information promised to have the 2bd suite, and we were on our way out to tour.  Upon return at 2:15am, we discovered we weren't checked in at all. Shariq, a representative unwillingly looked at our reservation and seemed to have no idea of our booking!  Overcoming that hurdle we walk into a 1BD suite with none of our luggage there. Tired and disappointed again, we walk back to the lobby to speak to a manager. Claiming to be a manager, Shariq again unwillingly looked at our reservation. He kept on saying, we are in the right room, until I showed him what I paid for and was promised on Hotels.com. Incompetent to comprehend anything that was going on, he said, we don't have any 2 bd at this hotel, so I don't know how can you purchase this. LOL. He suggested I speak to a manager in the morning. Toward the end while he was still looking for an answer, I had stepped to the lobby restroom. When I came back, my Fiancée mentioned that he just gave her our bags to carry without a bellman or a trolley, even after she expressed she needed help.   Totally disgusted and disappointed, we went back to the room and called it a night.  Next day morning, as we were checking out, I saw Candice who helped us check in and wanted to ask her, what happened? As I approach, she looks up, smirks, and says. \"Hi, yeha, My manager here will DEAL with you for all your issues\" Note, all I said then was Hi followed by that statement she said. I looked up in surprise and just couldn't deal with the greatness of service! While leaving, the manager she wanted me to speak to looks at me and does the hand move, of you there, come here. An African American male. I felt like he was calling his little kid or a hooker off the road.  By far, the WORST EXPERIENCE in the history of my staying at a hotel! And I travel a lot.. and have stayed at hotels in 3rd world countries. Nothing comes close to this link! NOTHING  The rooms inside are filthy and the wall paper is coming off. It really felt like a 1-2 star motel. I have uploaded photos on Google reviews."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most unappealing hotels I've been in. The lobby looks great the rooms are gross. Not just dated but bad. We got a great deal off priceline.com so I feel comfortable saying I didn't over pay. BUT, the decor is worn, the carpets are lifting. The couch was horribly stained. The air conditioning didn't work. I checked for bed bugs Thank God there were none. The planes over head weren't too bad, but I would not willingly stay here again. Definitely not a 3 1/2 star hotel at all!  Update- went down to front desk to complain to Jessie, nice guy, really understanding. He found a new room on the executive floors for us to stay in. He insisted that I check it out first to make sure it was ok. These rooms are much better, cleaner and nicer. No stains on the couch. He refunded my upgrade charge and switch the rooms for me. So customer service was excellent when I had a problem."}
{"text":"Clean and fair sized rooms with comfortable beds, nice bedding, and good bathrooms. They have some nice adjoining options if you need it.  Ammenities are very nice. Great pool and a fun spot for the kids.  The hotel bar, Harry's, has a great atmosphere and is a cozy spot for a night cap.  The sofas are in need of a good cleaning. Drinks are expensive but that can be said for most hotel bars. There is an arrivals and departures board for the airport in the lobby and the shuttle to the airport is easy to use."}
{"text":"Prior to making a reservation at this hotel, I contacted them to inquire about any restrictions with using the deal posted on WagJag and provided them with a specific date as I had travel plans before the expiry date. I asked if it would be problematic to book one night although my flight would not arrive until 2:30AM the next morning. The female reservationist assured me that it would NOT be a problem. I told her I would call back to reserve after purchasing the WagJag voucher.  I proceeded to make the online purchase based on my detailed discussion with the hotel staff. I called the hotel back shortly and made the reservation and received a booking number. I was looking forward to taking advantage of the late check-out and indoor water park for my two young children.  My return flight was delayed an hour (unexpected of course) and we arrived at front desk of the hotel at approximately 3:45AM. A male front desk staff advised me that their hotel was fully booked and that they could not accommodate us. I questioned the reason for cancelling my reservation without notice. I did not get an email or voice mail message to notify me that my booking was cancelled. He provided a ludicrous response about the WagJag deal having blackout dates/restrictions. They, however, did pay for our cab ride home; hence, the one rating. They encouraged me to still use the voucher although the deal would be expired. Regardless of their somewhat kind gesture, I was and am extremely disappointed and will NOT use this voucher. This business practice is unprofessional and unacceptable. Based on my terrible experience, I contacted WagJag to request for a refund or credit and of course, they refused. I will not now or ever do business with the hotel or WagJag and will definitely warn others."}
{"text":"This is one of THE WORST hotels ever.  I arrived at 3:30 & even though check-in is at 2 pm, they said \"Your room is not ready.\" I said that I had a confirmed reservation and they said \"Sorry we're doing the best we can.\"  I waited OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF!!!  During the wait there was loud hooting & hollering coming from the tv area bec. the soccer finals from Brazil were being watched by about 50 people who were screaming & yelling.    When I finally got a room at 5;30 pm, the air conditioning was not working.  It took two different guys ab. a half hour to fix it.  Then at about midnite when I was freezing I realized there was NO ON & OFF SWITCH!!  Then around 3 AM the airplanes started roaring outside, practically outside my window!!   When I requested a late check-out they said absolutely not. Check-out is 12 NOON.  So I was in the hotel less than 24 hours.  WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!!  Buyer Beware. It sounds fancy and it's across the street from the Radisson, but it is AWFUL !!!!!"}
{"text":"Hotel Stay: The concierge were very friendly and the hotel is completely renovated downstairs, however the guest rooms are very out of date. I think the hotel is intentionally themed with old fashioned decore. The room did have a strange odor as mentioned by other guests. I thought the bed was comfortable and the bathroom is updated. They informed me they are in the process of renovating the entire hotel.   Events: Hosted a large event here. It was incredibly difficult to get a hold of our event contact throughout. Rather than immediately fixing issues (doors locking, missing gluten free meals, room temperatures too cold) someone would go find someone else to do it.   There are tons of restaurants local to this hotel. Roughly 30 minutes to downtown without traffic."}
{"text":"This could possibly be the worst hotel I've ever done business with. I hosted a conference here on October 7. Arrived the day before to set up, and discovered that the entire front of the hotel is under major renovation. This was never mentioned to our event planner in advance. It's probably a good thing they are doing renovations, since the entire hotel is old, stagnant, and very ugly. Their website, photos, videos, and commercials are not an accurate reflection of the condition of the actual hotel.  On the day of our event, finding someone to help us, or getting anything done, was like pulling teeth. It seemed like there was no one actually dedicated to our event at all. We had prearranged special menus for certain guests who had dietary restrictions... These meals showed up half an hour after everyone else's food had been served.  After an event, we usually ship items back to our warehouse, and any extra products get shipped to our representatives. I packed everything up, and attached all of the pre-paid waybills. One of the managers told me that he would take care of making arrangements to ensure that these packages got picked up (this is completely customary, and something that every hotel does after hosting a large event.) Today is nine days later, and I've just been told that the boxes were never picked up, and have been lost. I don't even know how this could possibly happen!  All of my guests who stayed at the hotel complained about their room's condition and cleanliness. In addition, do not expect a peaceful night's rest with airplanes landing at the airport 24 hours a day. One client texted me after she checked in and said, \"This place is ghetto.\" (She wasn't wrong.)  Overall, the customer service at this hotel is a zero out of five. I will never do business with them again. Ever."}
{"text":"Missed our connecting flight, so Air Canada brought us here for the night. Overall, the hotel looks nice. Checking in was easy enough and the staff was efficient.  After getting in our room, we noticed that it heavily reeked of smoke and we didn't request a smoking room. Since the smell was pretty strong, we decided to ask the desk if the hotel had non-smoking rooms. The desk agent said that \"the entire hotel is non-smoking.\" And instead of moving us to a different room, her solution was to \"send someone up with some air freshener.\" Really? We all know you can't mask cigarette smoke. We were already weary from a long day, so we didn't push the issue. I wish we would have though. If we had paid for the room with our own money instead of Air Canada picking up the tab, I definitely would have pushed the issue of relocating us. Overall, this was a piss poor way of handling a very legitimate customer service issue. I would probably avoid staying here since they don't really care about their guests. And the food at Harry's Bar was extremely overpriced, which makes since so they can always get at least $15 for dinner from stranded guest dinner vouchers."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in a \"suite\" right now that hasn't seen anything new except the advent of digital tv since the Reagan era. The wallpaper is peeling, the ceiling is water stained as is the carpet and furniture. The toilet tank is leaking. What isn't? There is no real handicap friendly features, including the staff. Each one also has the same answer to every question, \"I don't live out here, I drive here for work.\" The ONLY bright spot so far has been the Starbucks in the lobby. They are the go to people for caffeine and assistance. Everything here is also pay per use, even local calls. I'm past the point of dealing with Expedia since I'm here due to their stellar ability to underwhelm. I guess it was the cherry on top. No more. Expedia and this supposed 3 to 4 star hotel, they are both jokes played on me."}
{"text":"Came here for the Spa, decent place. It's very spacious, and very good for holding conference. While I was here they had a event going on. The place is clean, although there is a $14 parking fee, which I just assume if you're not in downtown, there shouldn't a parking fee? But prob because it's a hotel so be aware that when you arrive you'll have to pay for the $14 before entering the hotel.   I love their outdoor patio they had there. Starbucks is also in the hotel. Although they are lacking food options outside of the hotel though. Otherwise, not a bad place to hold any conferences."}
{"text":"Very nice Hotel with lot of facilities. I would say best pick from airport nearby hotels. They have deals on Hotwire too. I was just disappointed by the night shift staff at the lobby, but I guess we all have our good and bad days..."}
{"text":"I don't get what everyone is complaining about , for 80 bucks u get a Starbucks in the lobby , a shuttle that is free every half hour and runs on time , pool , hot tub , gym and ok I get it the rooms are stuck in the late 80's but hey it's 80 bucks !!!!"}
{"text":"Noisy, loud, old, outdated.   Very sad hotel needing a major overhaul.  Staff is friendly enough though......  Without a doubt, the absolute worst breakfast bar I have ever had.  Cold nasty eggs.  Bacon overcooked, oatmeal is concrete so I couldn't scoop.  Fruit is set out and not ripe.    Seriously how do you screw breakfast up and charge 20 CAD?"}
{"text":"Nicht zu empfehlen. Wurde hier von der Airline einquartiert weil ich den Anschluss nicht erreicht hatte. Bin aber nicht über Nacht geblieben. Es reicht nicht die Lobby schick zu gestalten und dem alten Haus einen neuen Namen zu geben. Die Flure und Türen von aussen verrieten schon einiges uralter Teppich verschrammte Türen. Im Zimmer roch es fies und muffig, der Teppich war eingerissen, die Fliesen im Bad waren ziemlich zerbröselt und die Einrichtung sehr in die Jahre gekommen. Ich wollte ein anderes Zimmer. Das war ebenso schlecht und ich habe noch am selben Abend ausgeheckt. Man muss sagen, das das Personal echt bemüht war und wohl um den Zustand weiss. Leider hilft das nicht weiter. Dreckig war es nicht aber total abgewohnt. Über die Bar und das Restaurant kann ich nichts sagen weil ich nicht dort gewesen bin"}
{"text":"Solid 2.5 star hotel! Good service but the room itself is dated and bed isn't that great. Get ready to hear planes take off!"}
{"text":"Service balances out the age and condition of the building itself.  To be honest, the condition of the room I stayed in was really not the best.  The carpeting in the room has lots of folding/bunching.  Some of the walls are crumbling in places (especially along the window).  The bathroom was clean, but it was clearly old with rusty metal fixtures.  The room was extremely warm, and the heating/fan was loud and really dry.  I was able to turn down the thermostat, so I was happy about that.  A strange powdery/flora smell was emanating from somewhere and it was rather unpleasant, but I could live with it I suppose. The carpets in the hallways were conspicuously taped together at the seams with duct tape.   I get it, it's old, and I was staying here on Air Canada's dime since they cancelled my flight and I was on international flights.    Looking past that - the beds were comfortable and the linens were clean.  That's basically the most important aspect of this.  The front desk staff were helpful and efficient. The service in the Orchid Cafe bar/restaurant was good.  There's a Starbucks on site, and there is a free shuttle to and from the airport.  Apparently there's an indoor pool too.  I didn't see it, but I could smell it.  Overall, this hotel is on the lower end of acceptable, but the service makes up for some of the negatives."}
{"text":"Rooms are not like images, bad smell everywhere, parking is extra, hotel is outdated, rooms are very far from the elevator. Customer service was ok minus. Don't recommend and won't come back."}
{"text":"I stayed here overnight back in December  Got the free shuttle from the airport to the hotel, which was very convenient  and punctual   Upon arrival the hotel looked pretty nice, especially the lobby  Checked into my room, and it wasn't bad at all  Sure, the hallways were dated, and the rooms weren't amazing..but I wasn't expecting the Ritz  Had a couple of drinks in Harry's Bar, which was pretty cool..literally..but the drinks were good  Next morning had the buffet breakfast, not bad..pretty much your standard breakfast. Good coffee and pastries   Starbucks on site was a bonus  Anyway, it was clean..close to the airport, and I slept well  It served a purpose, just don't expect a 4 star hotel or a Ritz Carlton"}
{"text":"I stayed here on Sept 12/2015 and I can honestly say this was one of the worst hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. Outdated furniture and constant stench of cigarette smoke embedded in the carpeting and the walls (and I was in a non smoking room?) Furthermore I had a bill slipped under my door for a bar bill at Harry's bar (and I didn't even go to the bar) After calling the front desk and getting nowhere I was told that I had to come down to the front desk to resolve this issue, even though this was something that could be resolved over the phone) If you have to attend a conference at this hotel, stay anywhere but here, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Stayed here for one night in June. Don't be fooled by the nice appearance of the lobby, because the room my family stayed in was horribly outdated - stepping into our room made me think I'd stepped into a cheap motel. And to make matters worse, our shower didn't have hot water, and it wasn't fixed until the next morning."}
{"text":"My first encounter was less than ideal with the hotel, but it isn't it's fault. One  or two lousy customer service agents shouldn't ruin it for the whole hotel, and the reservation manager Shannon made up for their incompetency.  Using a hotel credit, and splitting from my group tonight, I just checked into the International. And in a word, it is awesome.   They have every toiletry you could ever need; the bed is super clean; on it was an adorable teddy bear, personalized card welcoming me to the hotel, and a jar of red licorice; there's a nice bath robe and slippers (clean, in a plastic sealed bag) in the closet; coffee and a TV with cable!   I'm a little bummed I won't be able to try out the restaurants, gift shop, bar, pool with waterslides or the fully equipped gym with updated equipment. Maybe next time I'm in town....If possible, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stayed here the night before writing an exam at the Congress Centre. It did the job... Location-wise, it's across the street from the centre. If you're deciding between the International Plaza Hotel and the Radisson, they're pretty much the same distance from the Congress Centre.   The staff in the lobby was helpful. The Starbucks kind of sucks.. they seemed pretty miserable including the guy who looked like a manager. I had an old muffin that tasted kind of like dust.  One thing that really disappointed was the pillows. The whole purpose of me staying here was to get a good night's rest and to avoid any stress before my exam. I woke up at 3am with a neck cramp. Good thing for the crappy Starbucks in the morning!  The halls were a bit rundown with what looked like tire marks on the walls and doors... probably from luggage. The room itself was clean. I'll probably be back next year for the same exam. My experience was solid enough to return and you really can't argue with the distance.  $14 to pay for parking. I thought it was a rip off but what can you do when you live in a shoe.  Also you hear planes overhead. I never thought I would find the sound of loud planes to be soothing but I guess I do. Maybe I should move to sauga"}
{"text":"the only good thing about this hotel is the convenience to the airport and the long term parking. Rooms are very dated and the shower head is so low that we had to duck to shower.  Only near chain restaurants.  No hotel bar or restaurant."}
{"text":"been coming here for years, very very happy with not only the service, but the quality of everything this hotel has to offer. the rooms are immaculate, with excellent and prompt cleaning services. the people at the desk are super friendly and extremely easy going, even when it may be a \"higher\" then normal volume time (i.e. anime north/xmas time) the actual space of this hotel is amazing, rooms galore, with conference rooms practically everywhere, including a huge hall/theater tucked in the back.  ample parking, and a huge amount of restaurants within walking distance  just a side note: if you arrange your flight and get a nights stay at the hotel (usually before the vacation) they will include parking your car for the duration of the trip.  amazing: best bang for your buck in this area oh and the pool is great too!"}
