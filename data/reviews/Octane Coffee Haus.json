{"text":"Very small cafe with amazing service. This place has fantastic coffee (I had the Salted Caramel Frappuccino) and you get a punch card to earn a free one after a certain number of purchases.  I tried the Italian and the Cuban sandwiches. The Italian was good, but the Cuban was great! Will definitely get it again. The owner was very nice in substituting pepperjack cheese for cheddar on my toddler's grilled cheese sandwich. We will be coming back to this cafe!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this coffee shop.  Been here many times and always delicious!! The Caprese Sandwich is amazing!!! And her Cucumber Lemonade is the most refreshing drink ever!!! Very, very clean coffee shop. Super friendly owner! Try it - you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!  Swung in to grab a quick coffee and breakfast and were super impressed. From the outside you kinda wonder what the quality will be, but don't be fooled, the coffee is good and the food is fantastic!  We got one of the homemade cinnamon rolls and I must say one of the best ones I've ever had. Light, fluffy, decadent and delicious! The breakfast sandwiches were super good as well, the eggs were fresh prepared and the croissants were light and flaky! So satisfying and good!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Atmosphere was more of a to-go type feeling, not really conducive for a lunch date."}
{"text":"I refuse to go to Starbucks and I saw this place while driving and decided to stop. This is one of the best coffee shops I've been to  and it's locally owned.  The owner took her time explains the options and it was obvious that she has passion  which came through in her product.  I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Great coffee, tried the Sugar Cookie Latte and the Red Velvet latte- both were amazing!   We also tried the turkey sandwich, Cuban sandwich and the chicken noodle soup- all were AMAZING!!  Becky is so sweet and made us feel like we were at home, she was very personable and just someone you can chit chat with while enjoying your coffee and sandwich!   Their coffees are a proprietary blend and you can definitely tell they took their time selecting just the right coffee beans! Wish this place was closer to my house but oh well, we will definitely be back soon!  I highly recommend you try this place it!"}
{"text":"The best Red Velvet Latte and the Italian Panini is the best I have ever had! And the staff are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"We were looking for a local restaurant to hit for lunch, so we stopped by Octane.  The food was amazing and so was the coffee.  The owner is awesome, and it honestly felt like we were sitting down to lunch at a friend's house.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very limited selection of sandwiches and the only choice is panini bread.   Have never been a fan of panini, can we not have a choice of other breads like a regular bun?  But the sandwich was good and the service was very good.  But until they come up with a bigger menu, I think I'll shop elsewhere."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! The owner was super sweet and very welcoming. Her own brand of coffee was delicious and would rival any big name coffee company. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich was VERY good. The bacon, tomato and cream cheese was equally good.   Please consider that its a small kitchen, so the cook only serves \"Top ranking\" items.  While they only serve plain bagels, its still great food."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian Panini, and breakfast croissant.. I have high hopes for the rest of the menu I've yet to try. Speedy service, and friendly workers. Look forward to more breakfast at Octane Cafe.    I don't think there is much else to say besides, it's definitely a place to get good food."}
{"text":"Came out of town from California and had to re-seal a roof early in the morning and couldn't get started without a quick filling breakfast and tea first. Was going to go to Starbucks as a quick go to, but decided to check out Yelp and try something new in the area. Was pleasantly surprised to find this cute little place with EXACTLY what we needed! I had a bacon egg and cheese croissant sandwich and my mom had a sausage and cheese croissant sandwich. The girl behind the counter recommend them and made them with love and care =) I had a nice large Iced tea as well to beat the Arizona heat while up on the roof. I started off the morning grumpy and hungry and now I'm excited to start the day! I love local businesses and was glad we came across this place on our visit!"}
{"text":"I recently went back to Octane and was super impressed with Becky! She's not only revamped her baked goods but also her coffee line. She's also open on Saturdays now as well! Yay! Becky has the magic beans and she's fun and friendly. This is definitely becoming my go to, love buying local!"}
{"text":"Welcoming and clean is what I would describe this neighborhood coffee shop. Small inside seating area with about 5/6 tables. They have their own special blend that's very smooth and light. Been to many coffee shops that serves BURNT coffee but this place is perfect! They also serve bagels and sandwiches to. The Bagel, bacon, cream cheese and tomato (BBCT) is awesome."}
{"text":"The best cold brew!   Friendly staff, very comfortable place to sit down for a meal or a coffee."}
{"text":"Everything is supper yummy I love everything here lol I love there coffees  and the paninis are YUM.. :)"}
{"text":"great little neighborhood cace ilike the cuban sandwich having lived in south florida for 34 years so i know cuban food. it is clean and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"A cute small place! Don't let that fool you. The coffee was excellent. My breakfast sandwich was delicious. The service was excellent and so friendly!"}
{"text":"Guess we tried it on a bad day (Monday). First big turn-off: the toilet in the unisex bathroom was disgusting, old dried urine all over the porcelain, obviously not cleaned that day. Then discovered that the woman parked a few inches away at the closest table to the bathroom is the owner! This is a very tiny place, and she barely looked away from her computer the whole time we were there, except to take phone calls and discuss business matters within earshot of her guests, none of whom she acknowledged or welcomed, so I guess she wanted to remain anonymous. Apparently (hopefully), she hadn't seen the filth in the only bathroom. I consider that poor management.  Food was also a huge disappointment...tried the Monte Cristo sandwich, and it was flattened to the point of being unrecognizable, like the thinnest panino imaginable. (Panini on the menu I think.) The young woman caring for customers, and I presume preparing the food, was very pleasant, but obviously not trained in what a Monte Cristo is supposed to be. Flavor was ok, but more like eating a rubbery pancake than a sandwich. Coffee was ok, but certainly nothing special. I try to be positive, so should mention prices are reasonable for a cafe, but this nicely decorated place is much more like a fast food operation, and negligently managed, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Octane Coffee Haus is a tiny coffee shop sandwiched between some auto repair shops with window paint similar to that of a car dealership. I almost drove past it because I legitimately thought it was another car place.  This place is a pretty generic coffee shop with average food options. The nitro brew is smooth and delicious, but I'm not enough of a nitro connoisseur to really comment on the quality. Their breakfast sandwiches are seemingly pre-assembled croissant sandwiches toasted in aluminum foil. They're delicious, but nothing special. The reason I am giving it four stars is because of barista!  I came in super rushed, late for work like usual. I really wanted some coffee and a snack, and the barista made sure I got a product I was satisfied with, and that I got that product quickly. I felt bad being in a rush because it puts pressure on the staff, but the barista didn't seem bothered by it and was super accommodating. Mad props to the young woman single-handily manning the coffee house. I appreciate you!"}
{"text":"Octane is a small shop along the south side of  Southern at Ellsworth, in the auto shop row. It is small and cute, with auto related decor. Very clean, with just the right volume of chill music playing.   After seeing great reviews, and Octane's availability on my food delivery app, I decided to give it a go. I ordered a chai latte and a Monte Cristo sandwich. Fast and hot. I really enjoyed my almond milk chai. Not too sweet, but just right. Didn't scald my mouth off, but it was hot and tasty. The sandwich was also great. Be careful not to inhale the powdered sugar and choke to death. Maybe that was a note to self. (Ha!). Light Dijon flavor, good, melty cheese, real ham slices (not lunchmeat). I appreciated the simplicity and quality.   I was lucky to have met the owner, Becky, and she was delightful. We chatted and I had a great breakfast. The owners are very customer driven, and really take your reviews and comments to heart. On a side note, if you ever have a problem with your order, she will do everything to fix it and make you happy. While I was there, she read a bad review on a delivery app, which doesn't give any customer info,  and she was so upset that she couldn't fix it. Do give them the opportunity,  they are really nice folks.   Eat local! Stop in for a drink, or order delivery or to go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Suuuuper disorganized. The staff was fighting with one another, they kept mixing up/losing orders, etc. We probably repeated our order 4-5 times.   On a positive note, the staff was friendly to customers and the drinks were delicious. The food was okay. It all felt kind of overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"I always support small Mom-Pop type businesses & Octane Cafe is just that. A cozy shop with excellent coffee, tea & sandwiches. The service is as good as it gets. Becky remembers your name, your favorite beverage or tasty treat and that alone makes a customer feel important and anxious to return. In today's coffee house experience, they write your name & a cup and move you along, Becky and Octane Cafe makes you feel like your at home among friends & family and that along with great product is why I keep going back."}
{"text":"Great little out of the way Cafe. I had the Italian sandwich which was amazing. Delicious coffee too."}
{"text":"Had the cold brewed coffee that is made with beans specifically for Octane Cafe. It was really good! Paired it with a peanut butter and chocolate chip muffin made by The Muffin Girl and OMG what a muffin! Delicious  The owner, Becky is so nice. You also get a punch card and after your 10th coffee purchase you get one free. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Becky was so sweet this transported me to a local coffee shop that I'm used to it's my go to thanks octane coffee"}
{"text":"This is a sweet little café tucked away and we almost missed it! Becky is an absolute doll and very friendly. We very much enjoyed our ice tea and sandwiches/ soup. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for lunch, and I thought I'd phone in an order for pickup.  The lady that answered the phone was nice, and I detected a slight bit of surprise when I told her I wanted to place an order for pickup.  I'm not sure why, but I just got that feeling.  Anyhow, I ordered an Italian Melt and she said it would be ready in just a few minutes.  Place was small, but cozy.  Cashier was friendly (I am assuming this was the lady that took my phone order), and she handed me my order in a plain, brown paper lunch sack.  I brought it home, and found the Italian Melt very warm and quite tasty.  Overall, a really good experience.  I would return if I happen to be in the area again."}
{"text":"Great food and coffee. I had the Red Velvet Latte and it was delish. The breakfast sandwich was great. My husband had the Cuban sandwich and loved it. He was indecisive on his coffe choice and she made him something he loved. She even made him a sample of another recommendation (The Toddy) and he loved it as well.  Great service and great food. Will definitely be back. There is also an automotive shop next door and we will be checking it out as well."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast sandwiches, strong coffee and delicious cinnamon rolls! I have them delivered via UberEats so have yet to be in the shop but, so far the foods been delicious and delivered hot!"}
{"text":"I love the coconut flavor in her Latte's.  The trple meat sandwich is the best!  You can get your oil changed next door at Affordable Automotive.  Eat while you have your oil changed!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a coffee shop close to home and somewhere I can study. This place is perfect, plus the owner is so personable and nice. The muffins were amazing!! Next time I want to try the food and coffee which I heard from the customers there that it was really good. Definitely coming back to this cute place."}
{"text":"Really cute coffee shop. The family who runs it is really sweet. The coffee is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot, you'll find it tucked between the automotive spots in the complex. The owner Becky is a sweetheart and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The coffee was excellent, gave me the kick in the pants I needed and the BLT was on point. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Coffee was good and the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich was very good. I like the place."}
{"text":"Yelp suggested it so we stopped here this morning. We were quickly greeted and shown the menu. We both chose BLT sandwiches and they were delicious. The bacon was nice and crispy. My coffee was perfect with lots of options for lattes and other specialty coffees.  Prices are fair. I wish they would show some of the things they offer- some of us like visuals. A lady at a neighboring table ordered a cinnamon roll that I would have tried. Next time!"}
