{"text":"First time visitor. Quaint setting and great service. I ordered the chicken, which was fine. Not the best I've had but good. My wife ordered a dish that was promoted as pasta with puréed broccoli and cauliflower, prepared with pine nuts and raisins. All I can say is, the chef doesn't taste the food during preparation- It tasted like puréed broccoli and cauliflower with absolutely no seasoning.  And who thought of adding uncooked pine nuts and raisins!  If the cardiac unit at a hospital tried its hand at fine dining for elderly heart patients, then this would be what they would come up with. We'll definitely go back and give them another chance- this can't possibly be the norm."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers on tap.  I had a great Rogue Mogul Madness, which I haven't found anywhere else lately.  The Short Rib appetizer was delicious, as well as a great wedge salad. The restaurant is set among the wine bottles that you can buy at retail too. Going to have to bring a date to this place."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find! We have lived in Hudson for about a year and just found out about North End. Great service, yummy cheese board, delicious food! The wine was great and staff knowledgeable about all of the selections. We will be back very very soon!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Went here for my birthday with some family members and we all had a great experience! This place may be small but don't let that keep you away! We enjoyed the wine selection and everyone really liked their food. I was very impressed with the service and the staff. Since they heard it was my birthday they brought out a sample size dessert and a dessert wine for everyone at the table! Best dining experience I've had in a long time! We plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I was in Ohio visiting my daughter. I was alone last Saturday night and found the the North End Market. The place is comfortabe inside and was buzzing at 8:30. I ordered a bottle of Zinfandel, met some really nice people, and had a really good time. The staff was also very friendly. Next time I'll try the food."}
{"text":"Upscale casual with wonderful staff.  

Very good value for price.  A little loud when crowded, but overall a great social atmosphere for finer food and drink.

Yummy desserts with different twist weekly.  

Scallops were wonderful. Don't miss this dish."}
{"text":"Staff (male apparent owner) Scot is rude.
Our party was over charged 2 bottles of wine. We purchased one and there was 2 on our bill. 
The wait staff was very friendly. When the manger/owner came over to unprofessionally deal with the situation, he stated you drank 2 bottles of wine so you need to pay for 2. we only had one empty bottle and strangely enough, no one could find the other bottle. We will NOT BE going here again;"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! You can go there for dinner or you can go there just to drink. The food is just ok I'm my opinion and the portions are small, but the wine selection is fantastic! You can purchase bottles at retail prices and you pay a $10 corking fee. They have live music on the weekends. The atmosphere is very relaxed. They also have a beer bar. It does get crowded on Fridays and Saturdays, a reservation is a must."}
{"text":"Great wine and Craft Beer selection. Very good food and and great atmosphere. Hudson's best kept secret."}
{"text":"First time in and it was great. 
The first bar side you enter the establishment in looks a little weathered, but when you enter the dinning and wine storage area it is modern and really nice.  

The staff was friendly. Great selection of wine. The food was delicious! They offered us a champagne flute of a celebratory drink for our first visit! Be sure to tell them it's your first time!"}
{"text":"Such a simple easy place to get good food, wine and beer.  Note that this is not your burger, outback, kid sort of place.  I dont recall ever seeing children here.  
Wine you can buy and uncork there, it is a wine and beer store first.   If you like micro brew beer and great wine, this is a great place just to have a drink with friends."}
{"text":"Delightful dining experience...from hostess to chef!  Although, it was my first time there it was like fitting into your favorite pair of old jeans you forgot you still had (and better yet they fit)!!  The folks who worked there were knowledgeable, accommodating and genuinely warm!  Fabulous wine and beer selection to appeal to all palates.  Save room for dessert...key lime tart yum!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Hudson - so versatile. You can get a great happy hour deal at the bar or have an upper scale dinner in the dining room. The chefs are great and come up with some amazing flavor combinations. You can also shop for wine or beer while you're there - excellent selection. 

My favorite thing to order is the Kobe beef burger with pierogis or the chef's choice pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food and a huge selection of beer and wine. We go here all the time for wino Wednesdays where they have food and wine specials. Whoops, maybe I shouldn't have told you that because we like the fact that it's not overly crowded on Wednesdays. In fact, the place is not crowded all that often and I worry about how well they are doing. So please, go there any night but Wednesday! Prices are a bit high, but still worth it"}
{"text":"We revisited North End for our 2 year anniversary after remembering a good experience a couple years past. We were not disappointed. The food and wine was excellent and our waiter, Logan, was efficient, enthusiastic and excited to be helping us celebrate. It was an overall wonderful experience. We will be back, no doubt!"}
{"text":"I have grown up in Hudson and North End Market has always been a great place to stop at for wine and appetizers, even a meal! However this past monday I was able to participate in their first \"Wine & Canvas\" night and it was amazing! I am so happy they have decided to add this to the venue. They had about 40 of us set up in the dining room and we had wine and a food menu through out the entire event. The owner and waiters were very attentive and so kind to ALL 40 of us, while I am sure we were all a bit overwhelming with the painting and wine for the first time!  I hope they keep this event up and I highly suggest people to take advantage of this."}
{"text":"Scott the owner is warm and friendly, like the servers there. Fun to sit amongst the wine. Food was better than the ambience suggested. Time to spend a hundred grand on a remodel. Will come back to buy wine- cases for 10% off."}
{"text":"Solid 4-stars for a consistently solid wine bar, that's close to home and lacks snobbery.  

It's a place where you don't have to worry about the glass being smashed out of the window of the BMWer and is better than most of the neo-urban yuppie haunts in Douchemont up in Cleveland. 

It's not a very hard business model.  Just offer good friendly service, decent wine selection and upscale dishes.

For any newbie, this place will be confusing. Wine and craft beer store by day, bistro and wine bar four nights a week.  Oh, and throughout the dinner service you'll continuously see dudes making a beer run.  My wife and I thought about it...and for this end of town, what better place to go?  There entry bar is easy in-n-out, there's plenty of parking, and the brews are high quality...so it made complete sense to see a flow of continuous carryout beverages.

Our server was really friendly, and thorough.  We ordered scallops and the tempura tuna.  We were both very pleased with our orders.  Loved the red mashed potatoes that came as a side to the tempura tuna.  The scallops were a dish I would definitely consider making a return visit to enjoy again.

They had amazing dessert offerings, but we were too full from the entrees.

One thing I found a little odd was a note on their menu (\"retail price is $10 less than bottle menu price\") that stated they charge a $10 markup for bottles of wine consumed in the restaurant.  So you could be sitting there, glance over at the wine racks, and see the same bottle you're enjoying, at a different price than what they charge the table.  Almost like a corkage fee for any bottle they open in the restaurant.

It seemed as if the most popular menu item was their $15 4-wine flight with 2oz servings each.  Looked as if every single table in the dining room had flights being ordered."}
{"text":"Great wine and beer place but the real secret is how good their food is. They make dishes that really match well with their wine list which is really good. You will drive by this place and miss it if you have never been here. Unassuming from the outside but great on the inside."}
{"text":"First time here in 3 years just the same happy hour stinks of u want to buy beer great place to buy in bottles if u drink wine corked fee why  there prices is for Houdson people everyone has money soo be where learned my lesson u can go other places and have same for the price"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here to check the place out as she's new in Hudson and didn't feel comfortable hitting the bars by her lonesome. We walked in without a reservation and the manager seated us immediately with a warning that they'd need the table in 90 minutes. No problem. 

It was Friday night and there was a running store's wine tasting event among the dining tables, so it was crowded and loud. As other reviewers have mentioned, the place could use some noise-dampening wall hangings, curtains, rugs.... something. It was a bit bizarre to be in what felt like a fancy establishment, tables set with black napkins and wine glasses... and surrounded by folks in their running clothes. There were also children there. Children. In a wine store. 

I knocked off a star for the ambiance, and another because my mother is a strict vegetarian and there were only two menu items available to her aside from \"salad without the (insert meat here)\". That said, we ordered the artichoke dip, which was delightfully pleasing, very light on the cheese, no greasy cream sauce, and it was artfully (and deliciously) presented in half a roasted red pepper. Cute, functional, and it felt healthy. 

Plan to spend some $$ here on beverages. The draft beer selection was respectable and well labeled; the chalkboard presenting the selection noted the alcohol content, IBUs (bitterness/hops) and place of origin. 

There's a small stone bar with about 6 stools when you walk into the building, and behind it the draft beer taps and a 32\" or thereabouts TV playing sports. Again with the ambience, it's a weird place to have a miniature sports bar, but I guess that's what they figured would get people in the door. Beer and sports for the dudes while the ladies wine shop next door? Whatever. 

The wine is, not surprisingly - what brings probably 99% of patrons to this place. It is priced as such at $10+/glass, and if you know wine you know what kinds of prices they charge per bottle. If you don't know wine, you just don't want to know.

All in all this is probably a good place to buy snooty wine if you're into that, and probably a decent place for date night if you go on a weekday or call ahead to make a reservation *when nobody else is going to be there*... and have no dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"ok, mixed thoughts here- may need to go back!

On our way home from New Year's Eve dinner in Twinsburgh, my boyfriend suggested we go see a band and he had North End in mind.  The night was still early, but we were pleasantly surprised to see it empty inside.  From the outside it looks quaint, and also like two separate establishments. As we walked along the sidewalk, it looked cozy inside & I was looking forward to our visit; however, as we approached the entrance, I was slightly confused.  When you enter, the space throws off a cold feeling, mainly due to the colors, finishes & lighting.  I thought it was confusing- two women greeted us from this area. One was behind the bar & the other was from behind a podium.  We weren't sure what to do!  We knew we didn't want food and the band wasn't going to play for 30 minutes or so.

We opted to be seated in the main dining/wine area.  I thought it was slightly odd that they didn't have any \"fixed\" seating- everything was tables & chairs. I am sure this is because they want the flexibility, but it didn't feel very sophisticated. OK, I am a designer and these things do matter...  

Our waitress was very attentive and service was great.  I arrived with my boyfriend & left with a fiancé!  Yes, I got a wonderful proposal there!  We received complimentary toasts to ring in the new year and enjoyed a wonderful night of laughter and great pictures!

So, no matter what, this place will have a special place in my heart!  I will go back to have a meal in 2013!"}
{"text":"Love the food, the service is great and the beer/wine selection is awesome.  Best braised short ribs I've ever had.  Must start with a Pub Pretzel.  Great for a date or as a group."}
{"text":"Attended a wine event. Prior to enjoying my first glass, I witnessed one of the employees (who shall remain nameless, male )  approach another patron, and state something to the \"that's not F'ing cool\" then walked away scratching the back of his head with his middle finger. My 2 sisters that attended, witnessed the same. We immediately informed one of the owners of the incident, and left. Had we not paid for our tickets in cash, I would asked for our money back."}
{"text":"You want to meet where after work?  Never heard of it.  Be careful.  3 of the 6 times I have been there, my phone notifies me to find the nearest u-turn.  
Inside, bar one side, wine the other.  They always have very good beer on tap.  They also sell beer and wine to go.  It is one of those places that does not sell bud light or bud light platinum (also known as ruffies).  Sorry, I cannot comment on their wine selection.  Merlot, Cabernet, Syrah, it's all French to me.  
The food is very good.  Really surprisingly great.  Butternut squash ravioli, Jarlsberg cheese dip in parmesan bowl... blah blah blah...  Time out.  Please excuse my interruption of the current stream of conciseness.  I want to cover the best pretzel I have ever had.  Soft, salty, warm.  I actually debate if it is a pretzel or the second coming (or first for my Jewish friends).  So good, it's like a hug from your mom.  I might be exaggerating a bit... but not much."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a new sour wheat beer, and selection on tap was not huge but eclectic. Bottles and cans made up for it, and they can be purchased to go. 

Had Pirogies and their signature dip in a red bell pepper. Great !!"}
{"text":"While this is an excellent wine bar, we went for the food. They have a great selection of wines. I had a split of prosecco that was delightful. Very crisp but only a hint of sweet. It's a dessert wine but I love prosecco so I had it with dinner. I'm a rebel. What can I say. 
The restaurant is cozy and dimly lit. Most of the walls are lined with crates that are filled with wine that is available for purchase. There are high top tables or regular tables. There is no \"bad seat\" in the house. Our waitress was very kind and quickly answered our questions about the menu. The menu was diverse in its selection. I couldn't resist risotto and went for it. It was a seafood risotto that included shrimp and scallops. When it arrived at the table it literally had a Parmesan cheese shell around it-almost fanned around it. The risotto itself was very creamy with peas, small shaved carrots, and scallops. There were 5 Tiger Shrimp on top. They were large in size. Surrounding the risotto was an herbed dipping oil. I ordered garlic bread. It was a nice crunch to break up the creaminess of the risotto. It was all delicious from first bite to last bite. I absolutely ate every bite. I also ate a couple of bites of my husband's Mediterranean Cod. It had capers, olives, roasted red peppers, and tomatoes. It was served over wild rice. It was a big portion of fish. The fish was cooked perfectly. We enjoyed both dishes and walked away full. We will definitely go back to try other dishes. We were checking out everyone's plates as they came out of the kitchen and everything looked fantastic."}
{"text":"Food and service are very good. Add that to the wine selection that is excellent and reasonably priced makes for a wonderful dinner. Totally recommend this for casual night out or a dinner with friends"}
{"text":"Great food. Very interesting wine and beer selection. Fun and casual night out."}
{"text":"Such a fun concept! Visited last night with girlfriends for wineO Wednesday! Loved the bottle Of wine I picked out - so reasonably priced and delicious! Had a salad and shared an appetizer love to the Caesar salad with grilled chicken the house dip was just OK. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Well.....five of us showed up on a Tuesday (which is Burger and Beer Night, unbeknownst to us!) and were seated in the dining area(Burgers & Beer special not available in dining room) and ordered appetizers and a few bottles of wine. The service was a bit slow as explained by the owners and our darling waitress who worked herself silly serving the entire place with one other server! It really was no problem however, as they couldn't have been more gracious and attentive! The wines were delicious(& they will cork them for you to take home if you don't finish!) and the apps were fabulous.......really, really good. We did end up moving into the bar and a few of us ordered the burger special: Kobe beef, w/cheese and bacon, served with tots or pierogi, and a beer! We passed on the beer, as we had our wine to contend with, but the food was outstanding, and we were very impressed with the service....especially given the circumstances!
We will be back.....no doubt....as this will be a \"regular\" stop from now on! So happy to have found this place!!"}
{"text":"What an enjoyable evening out with my Boo! . As soon as we walked in we were greeted by Cathy, the hostess with the MOSTess, she also had a dual role, as our Server too! Can I get an \"I\" !!! For Impeccable, hell yeah! Ambiance was wonderful, it had a open floor plan and a warm cozy feel.  on a side note, I'd recommend Edison Bulb lighting .. But whatever! I love an industrial feel. We ordered a flight of wine to start. We loved the Red Blend, Trouble. And we actually liked the uncorked chard. Not bad!
Then we had ordered two apps, crab avocado salsa?... Yumbo! Very light and fresh served up with lightly salted triangle baked pita chips... I believe that is what they were. And we had this lobster/prosciutto app, came x4, served on a light drizzled orange tasting honey marmalade ? It was ridiculous! Delish!!! We then ordered an amazing Kale salad and shared it!  Not one single food item was even so much as under a rating of TEN!!! Everything was a foodGASM!  Lastly.. We ordered as our main dish, SCALLOPS.. The dish was $26.00 for three jumbo scallops. Pricey, not enough to share, however, we were ok with it since we had gorged and shared everything prior to. The flavors were splendid together! The dish had a very southwestern taste, with the lime and black beans and fresh finely chopped onions... mmmmmmmm mmmm GOOD! Cathy was incredible! Since it was our first time there, she gave us a complimentary brownie paired with a delicious fizzy berry bursting Moscato that was incredible to the taste buds YET AGAIN! We went ahead and glutinously indulged, and ordered the Carmel PB pretzel ice cream! Holy Cannoli Bat Man!!! I guess that was made from a spot in Tremont! SOOOOO.. Props to North End, Proprietor, staff and Chefs!!! WE WILL BE BACK!!! Oh BTW ... Just in: they will be open for lunch next Thursday!!! See ya soon!"}
