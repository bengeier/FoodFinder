{"text":"I've picked up take-out a few times from Jade.   To start with, my rating is based solely on the food.  I've always found the quality and portion size to be better than average.  I would have given 3.5 stars but my ipad won't allow it. I would put Jade on par with Kam Han (food wise).  I'm not sure why it takes such a beating in the ratings department on Yelp.  I've always found it to be pretty good..... At least as good as the other Chinese restaurants in Calgary with higher ratings.  With that said, the remainder of the business could use some work. The billing / discount system is odd....  I imagine Revenue Canada is missing out on a few bucks.     Customer service techniques could use a touch up as well......  I likely wouldn't dine in either; it is time for a bit of a renovation for sure.......  Bottom line however, when the craving hits for some good old western Chinese food, Jade will get you through it.....(just pick it up, ignore everything else and get out)."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews about this place I was a bit worried about ordering some food from here. Looking at the menu I first noticed that it has changed from the multiple ones posted on-line. The discount with cash payment as changed all over the place. Right now it is 13% off when you pick up and pay cash. We ordered the lemon chicken, ginger beef, bbq pork shanghai noodles and the diced veggies with cashews. The prices were on the higher side compared to other Chinese restaurants in Calgary but the portions also seemed much bigger. I enjoyed the food we ordered it was fairly delicious. I will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Honestly it's not great Chinese food. Very little meat, way too much onions- nothing special about thus place"}
{"text":"The worst food ever! We ordered here for the first time, and had to throw it out. It came to $90 dollars plus tip , but would have been thrilled if it was great. We do not normally comment on food sites, we just don't go back if bad. However, this was so gross, we have to warn people. Any positive reviews must be from owners or friends, etc. and are not being to be honest.  The ginger beef was good, everything else was disgusting . There is a reason for so many negative reviews, paying customers. We look forward to a good take out and to get this, very disappointing!! It takes some pretty bad food for us to speak up."}
{"text":"Good food and decent sized portions. It is a little on the pricier side, but it is the best option in the area."}
