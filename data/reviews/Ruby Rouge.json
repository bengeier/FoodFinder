{"text":"Not too bad, good place to eat some authentic Chinese food. Service is not always the best, but you have to do with it."}
{"text":"J'adore! Depuis que je suis petite je vais y manger et le les dimsums me rende folle particulièrement les boule de crabes, les dumpling au crevette et le pudding au coco!!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here to try the dim sum.  Coming from the area I grew up in the states, I've never had really good Chinese food.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious and delicate the dumplings were.  The prices were good too."}
{"text":"Worst dim sum we've ever had. As vacationers, we've been eating out for every meal and needed a break from French/Canadian cuisine. We decided to have dim sum for brunch and realized there were very few options. (Probably should've been our first clue...). The restaurant is located in a run down Asian plaza. The chairs were a little sticky, table cloth had a few spots, dishes ... (we cleaned them again ourselves). We arrived before they had the food carts ready so we just ordered from a checklist menu. The food came out pretty fast, but it wasn't hot. I almost wondered if we were served leftovers. The rice rolls were gummy. We ordered fried turnip cake but were told they had not turmed on the fryer yet so it would be a 20 min wait. Also, they don't clean their shrimp. Appetite  gone. We couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant. Terrible food. Luckily, it was pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Not realizing dim sum was only brunch/lunch, we came here for dinner. D'oh! Nevertheless, the food we ordered (fried rice, pineapple chicken, dumplings, soup -- yes, I know very \"safe\" food!) was all very good. But I just had to comment on how \"ho-hum/why-are-you-bothering-us-by-eating-in-our-restaurant\" vibe we got from the wait staff because another reviewer raved about the service. I'm sure we clearly did not \"belong\" there ordering our very safe  food. But just wanted to throw it out there that service might be very variable based on who you are and what you order. Don't get me wrong -- we will be back -- but only because we love dim sum -- and not because the service here is better than any other dim sum place in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was not too impressed by the quality of the dim sum. I arrived at around 1 pm, pretty much everything that was served was barely even warm and soggy. I've tried several Yum Cha places around Montreal, this one's ranked lowest. Having lived in China, take my word for it."}
{"text":"If you go to the restaurant on Monday to Friday before 11 o'clock?some special dim sum dishes will be offered and the price performance ratio is highest compared to other similar restaurants. But most of the dim sum dishes and chinese cuisines will be provided after 11am. The food is very tasty and you can hace a good meal with friends here with the low price."}
{"text":"The food is ok but nothing special. The waiters are rude and didn't really care about the service. We asked about one of the menu on the table, he said it would take more than 1 hour. Seriously? 1 hour to cook Chinese Food. Deep fried tofu $4.25 for Dim Sum was really expensive, it's chewy and tasteless. Really not impressed."}
{"text":"Wanted to go to kam fung but unfortunately it was closed so we went here.  The reason I gave a 2 was the service.  When we arrived it was empty, there were only 2 tables eating. Nobody was there to greet us until 'luckily' the waiter showed up and we were seated. He was quite rude when I asked if they still served dim sum (it was 3pm).  I saw 2 patrons came, weren't greeted at all, looked at the menu and left. I believe some of the cooks/staff who were having their lunch saw them coming, yet nobody said anything nor called for the waiter. Another 3 patrons came, same thing happened to all of us, confused of the huge deserted place without anybody seemed to care just waiting patiently to be greeted.  Food was mixed. The fried turnip was dry. The shrimp of the har gaw (which was the shrimp dumpling) was good but the wrapper was too thick and chewy. However the pork steamed bun, pork dumpling (siu may), and the pork and mushroom dumpling were good.  Tea was complimentary.  All and all $23 with tips for 3 people were quite affordable, 6 portions in total."}
{"text":"Food was decent, kind of slow, and the service was the normal Chinese restaurant type of experience, but the place was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Packed with Chinese patrons and a haunt with local students, Ruby Rouge is fantastic.  The wait staff is very efficient and the carts keep coming without long waits, although I'd really like more dim-sum carts and less of the fried/heavy stuff.  Try their dou-hua (or do-fu-fa, they'll understand), I think it is to die for. They got me so hooked on it I get cravings every week now.  I think it is slightly more expensive than Kam-Fung in the neighborhood, but I recommend trying it. I found Ruby to be less hectic and better organized."}
{"text":"la nourriture est bonne, mais il essayent de vous arnaquer des qu ils peuvent"}
{"text":"Compared to Maison Kam Fung, I was happier dining at Ruby Rouge for the traditional dim sum brunching.  You walk into a small shopping mall, and as soon as you come off of the staircase you will appear in the center of the banquet hall.  This can be rather intimidating if you arrive during a busy hour and there are people waiting everywhere.  If you arrive between 10:00-11:00am, then you should have no problem getting nice seating.  By 11:30am, they were officially slammed with customers and there was a wait.  They do have many tables for two and four, so sharing a table should not be a necessity if you arrive in time.  The set-up here is slightly different than any banquet hall dim sum dining experience I have had so far.  Mostly because of the layout and how you acquire the food.  Hot tea is complimentary.  Speaking in French is best, because some staff does not speak any English.  You will need a \"runner\" for your table if there are specific items you are looking for or you want the best items fast. The runner for my table was me, of course.  There is a bar with noodles and desserts, you will need to bring your bill ticket and request those items to have them fresh and carry them back to your table.  The meats are also carved at that same counter on the spot at your request with your ticket.  The pork here was sensational and came with a side of minced scallion sauce.  The soy sauce noodles were also good.  The crullers are here, but the congee is on cart.    Don't get me wrong, there are still carts going around all over the place, but the Montreal culture is much different, so you will not have cart \"pushers\" like you would in other cities.  You will need to ask for the items or ask to see what is on the cart, otherwise they will not bother you.  I am used to NYC, where staff will just put random food on your table and say, \"Eat!  You will like it!\"   Nothing like that happens in Montreal, and the pace is much easier.  Vegetables are sometimes needed to break up all of the gluten and meat eaten, asking for ong choi or gai lan is recommended.  It took us a while to receive our totaled bill and paying at the front counter is a must. They do accept credit cards, but you will want to tip in cash.    Best of luck to you in your food gathering!"}
{"text":"Food is good but very oily! The price is very competitive! I been here a few times for dim sum! At night I don't believe they have much business because the last time I went for diner we were the only table in the whole restaurant! It is very rare for a restaurant in Chinatown to be so empty at at diner time!"}
{"text":"Une catastrophe, un manque de respect pour cette belle culture. Plats froid, service pitoyable, vraiment fade !"}
{"text":"Run of the mill dim sum joint.  We went during off hours so we didn't have to wait and the food came out pretty quickly and it was fresh.  Like most reviews nothing special in the food, but it hits the spot if you're jonesing for dim sum."}
{"text":"Ok, not the best dim sum out there, but for that price, I'd go back anytime.  Let's face it, the ambience is bad and there is no decor at all. Just a very open space with lots of tables. The congee and the lotus leaf chicken are really tasty. On the other hand, their BBQ pork buns and steamed ribs are very mediocre. The service was not very fast but definitely friendly, and they open fairly early comparing to other dim sum restaurants.  If I'm not mistaken, any dim sum dish costs 2$ before 11AM, the Asian in me is screaming with joy *_*"}
{"text":"went to Sunday brunch with my friends.  effective reception service, a looot of tables, relatively cheap dishes, frequent wagon service, choice of tea, choice of dessert.  in one corner of the restaurant, they serve dumplings/noodles/rice/dessert/etc... in buffet style as well. there, you can take your time to check and choose what you really want. otherwise its always recommended to come with your Chinese speaking friends, so you can share a lot of dishes and eat like \"professionals\"."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Montreal for dim sum! They serve it all day and it is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food. We had a variety of old traditional Cantonese dishes and they were great.   $160CAN included tax and tip for lobster, Chinese broccoli, pork with salted fish, greens with pork, tofu, flat noodles with beef and black beans sauce, oxtail clay pot and the house soup and rice. Perfect for 7 of us. Good down home cooking!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that my wife is Chinese, so I'm very familiar with what to expect at most typical Chinese restaurants. That said, this place was special and not in a good way. The chopsticks, plates and especially the cutlery they gave us were beyond dirty. Really gross. The food cameout slowly, very slowly and was less than fresh. I could go into detail but there's no point. The extra star here is for the above average cleanliness of the bathrooms. Other than that this pace is on the permanent no go list."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS - i don't visit montreal very often, but this is a very serviceable spot for dim sum. not toronto or vancouver good, but if you need a har gow or sticky rice fix, it's a decent spot. - being a place that takes up the entire 2nd floor of a small chinese shopping building, i was very surprised at how jammed the place was. it was a packed house, and we had to wait a few moments for a table for two."}
{"text":"I just came back from Ruby Rouge. I went with family members. They ordered the usual stuff one can eat at any Chinese restaurant / takeout which didn't interest me. I specifically ordered the Peking duck. It came with flat pancakes / wraps and I made a couple of them with the duck. I'm giving it 4 stars just for the Peking duck. The taste was heaven.  The won tong soup wasn't watered down like the usual, in other words it was good. I sampled everything everyone ordered and most of it was good, better than the average stuff but the star of the evening was the duck. Service was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with friends for dim sum and dinner.  This place is the best restaurant for Chinese food in Montreal by far.  It also seems to be the largest in the downtown core.  Their dim sum is always packed on the weekend and finding a seat may require waiting a bit.  Also they hold a lot of weddings here on the weekend, so finding dinner tables isn't that easy either.  The good thing though is they are open late, and you can always come by after a night of drinking to order fresh dim sum or lobster!  The staff have always been friendly and kind to me.  Some of the best service in Chinatown by far.  They are attentive and always come by quick to fill up our tea pots.  Also they usually give me a 15% discount when I pay cash.  Not sure if that's a perk just for regular customers or if everyone is able to use it.  The food is great, some of the best you can get around Montreal.  In the summer they usually have a lobster special, which is 2 lobsters for $20.  A great deal if you pair it with some rice, you and a friend are set!  I will keep coming back here as long as they service and food are great!  Chinatown's best by far!"}
{"text":"We ordered pork dumplings and they had shrimp with no indication on the menu that there was seafood in the dish. Apparently most dishes have shrimp in them even if the menu does not mention it. Very dangerous if you are allergic. How hard is it to put a symbol beside all the dishes that have seafood in it?  When we were served the spare ribs, they were half fat and grey looking. Not appetizing at all. The waitress made us pay for it even though we did not eat it and they were far below acceptable standards. She even admitted that they were not quality controlled by the kitchen. All she did was give us excuses.   If you're not Asian, you will not receive great service. They will give you the bare minimum. They will not care about you. We were the only non-Asians in the room and the quality of our food looked way worse than the tables near us.   I will never return to this place. Not even for a free meal."}
{"text":"Walking in, the scent of dim sum just puts me at ease....reminiscent of NYC style dim sum joints that I grew up with.  Buffet section gave lots of options.  Standard dishes were on point.  Service was good and place was packed as expected for a Saturday morning, but still plenty of tables with virtually no wait.  Chicken feet was a little bland, but I've had worse.  Bottom line:  A taste of familiarity in a foreign place since we were visiting Montreal.  Hungover and dim sum hits the spot.  As far as dim sum places goes, Ruby had variety, speedy carts and good overall flavors (we ended up coming again the next morning).  FYI....chinese restaurant bathrooms are the same no matter what country you're in."}
{"text":"This place is great! An excellent selection of dim sum dishes. Fresh! Noisy because busy. Good value. One of the best dim sum experiences I've ever had.  The atmosphere is fairly standard but dim sum restos that I've been in aren't really big on that anyway. I found the staff helpful, you might have to flag them down to get their attention but once you have it they are quick to sort out your questions/requests. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since my last review. Since then I've been back a couple of times and have noticed some inconsistency in their food and service. Nonetheless, they are still standing, which is more than can be said for a few other places. The latest visits really reinforced that their best dishes are the most popular ones because they don't get a chance to sit around. The more I experience dim sum outside of Montreal, the more I realize that as a city, the quality is lacking. However, there are some dishes which consistently deliver as \"the best\": har gow, cheung fan (any variation), and their char siu bao. You may be forgotten by a server, but this place is bustling, so it's understandable.    All this being said, I haven't found a better spot yet. There's more investigating to do!"}
{"text":"Our (Fiancee and Myself) final dinner in Montreal and a perfect way to round off a week of fun filled immigration paperwork, meetings, security checkpoints, and sightseeing. My fiancee and I were feeling in the mood for some Chinese or maybe even dim sum, so I popped on here and found this place located in Chinatown. 20 minutes later we were circling the block trying to find a place to park, which, having it be a Friday night was next to impossible. Add-in the fact that she rolled her ankle the night before, I knew if we ever wanted to eat \"tonight\" I couldn't park at any of the lots down the road, we'd never make it in time. 45 minutes after arriving in the location, and our 6'th trip around, I saw someone begin to pull out and I snaked the spot, only a few hundred feet from the entrance. We made it in, and to the second floor. There must have been some kind of party going on because there were whole sections blocked off and people setting things like tables and speaker systems and the like. After standing at the top of the staircase for a few minutes wondering if the place was closed down for some kind of rented out party. A smartly dressed elderly gentleman grabbed some menus and gestured for us to follow him, alrighty then. We were sat in the back room next to the window overlooking the street we just came in from, nice spot, gave us a view to look at. Something I did notice was the large flat screen TV that was in front of us, wasn't showing a sporting event or anything, it was showing what was going on in the adjacent room. In case I wasn't interested enough in watching the people close to me eat, now I can watch the people far away from me eat as well.   The menu is quite substantial with many options, but what I immediately took notice to was the lack of \"carts\" pushing around Dim Sum. We must not have been there at the right time, so we decided just to go for the dim sum sampler platter to get a feel for what they served. Neither of us could decide on any one dish so we gave the \"Dinners for Two\" a shot with, I think, platter \"E\" Not a bad deal when you look at how much food they give you. 2 soups, 1 order of Dim Sum, 5 plates of various meats and fortune cookies. It seemed to be the best way to try a variety of what this place had to offer and satisfy our confusion on what to get at the same time. Since we didn't have any particular server we just told the first one who stopped at our table what we wanted and off they went.   Within a few minutes the Dim Sum platter was sitting in front of us, not bad considering they were a little busy, the cooks must have been on top of things in the back of the house. Everything on the plate was fantastic, my fiancee especially loved the pork siu mai. We weren't even halfway through when the soups came to the table. Hot & Sour and Wonton. I can say with hindsight looking back that the wonton soup was the most disappointing thing we ate. It had no flavor and smelled a little...Earthy.  We elected to just share the H&S. The food began rolling out at a nice pace. Starting with the Lobster shrimp, and ending with the Beef w/ Broccoli, the middle also had Pork, Chicken, and Duck. All the meat groups were present and all of them tasted fantastic. It took us about 2 hours to take everything in and we enjoyed everything we had. Finally the cheque came with the  2 fortune cookies.  Now I have a rule I made with myself, albeit a silly one, but it's still one that I follow. I will never choose my own cookie. I will either take by process of elimination of what is left on the plate, or allow whomever is with me to give me one. I dunno, just something I do..   This particular day as I said before, was filled with immigration paperwork that has taken almost 2 years to complete. Two long arduous painstaking years..  I am in the process of getting my Canadian Fiancee down to the states, and that Friday in Montreal marked the day that she was given the green light to come.  It was quite a joyous day for the both of us, which is why we were treating ourselves to a big dinner.  I tell you that part of the story so the conclusion makes a little more sense.  We cracked open our little sugary sweets in unison and read our fortunes. Normally we play the \"In bed\" game, where you put the words, \"In bed\" at the end of whatever it reads, try it sometime, it always makes them sound better. \"You Will be experimenting with new and exciting things....In bed..\" See??  However in this case, that was not needed. After a brief chuckle from the both of us, we read them to each other. Hers read \"You will soon be traveling abroad\" and Mine... \"Patience Will Triumph\". It's like, they knew we were coming. We definitely had to be there that night.  Give this place a try, everything was great. Would have been a 5 star experience, but the soup tasted like soil, and there was a very loud band warming up for whatever was going to happen later in the evening, made eating and talking to each other difficult"}
{"text":"Mon endroit favori à Montréal pour un brunch traditionnel au Dim Sum.  Nous sommes retournés en groupe pour le Nouvel an chinois hier (c'est le début de l'année du Dragon et j'en suis un!) et l'expérience fût très agréable. Nous avions réservé (ce qui est particulièrement recommandé au Nouvel an, mais aussi le dimanche en général) et bien que le restaurant était bondé, nous n'avons eu aucune attente et notre table était spacieuse (pour 8) et bien situé dans un coin tranquille mais qui permettait une circulation facile.  Entendons-nous bien, Montréal n'est certes pas la Mecque du Dim Sum et le choix et la qualité ne se compare pas à ce que j'ai pu expérimenté à Hong Kong, San Francisco ou Vancouver. Cependant, je décerne quatre étoiles à ce restaurant dans un contexte montréalais. Le repas de Dim Sum le dimanche matin est une tradition de longue date à Hong Kong et dans le sud de la Chine et on attribut à cette tradition le développement des \"brunch\" en Occident. Dans ce contexte, c'est bien agréable de se retrouver en groupe le dimanche matin dans ce type de grand restaurant où les chariots transportant les variétés de Dim Sum circulent entre les tables. Pour ceux qui ne sont pas familiers, vous faites votre choix graduellement selon les chariots qui passent près de votre table. Prenez votre temps, tout le plaisir est d'allonger l'expérience et de discuter avec votre groupe tout en savourant ces petites bouchées succulentes.  En plus des Dim Sum qui circulent, vous pouvez commander des plats de la cuisine à votre serveur et aller chercher certains mets à un comptoir (nouilles, etc).  Le service était fort attentionné pour ce genre d'institution et nous n'avons eu aucune pression pour libérer la table malgré l'achalandage et nous sommes restés à table plus de deux heures.  Les Dim Sum qui ont fait le plus l'unanimité ici sont les boules au porc BBQ (Cha siu bao) et les boules au sésame (Jin deui). Un favori des amateurs de Dim Sum, les \"pot sticker\" (Jiaozi), sont absents ici ainsi que le dessert favori de mon fils: le pouding à la mangue.  Il n'y a pas d'inquiétude si vous demandez plus de plats que vous pouvez en consommer, le serveur se fera un plaisir de vous apporter le nécessaire pour apporter le supplément avec vous.  En conclusion, ce restaurant amène une expérience suffisamment de qualité pour ne pas se passer de l'expérience du brunch au Dim Sum, mais ne pas s'attendre à ce que l'expérience se compare a celle qui vous auriez à Hong Kong!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum on this Sunday morning in Montreal turned out to be a real treat.  Open earlier than other places (9:00 AM), Ruby Rouge was already packed at 10:00 AM when we arrived.  With patience and persistence, we left full to the gills with delicious treats.    Carts are only part of the story here.  You can also order from the buffet and from the kitchen.  My favorite:  the sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves.  Truly wonderful!  My only regret is having only my one stomach to fill.  Oh, if only Gluttony weren't one of the Seven Deadly Sins!"}
{"text":"I went there for a family gathering. The restaurant holds a lot of events so be sure to call them before you go there  or else they will wear you  in the private rooms but It can still be loud."}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant de Dim Sum au centre ville. J'adore commander plein de petits plats à Prix abordable pour goûter à tout. Essayer les tentacules et  les dumplings aux crevettes frites, les nouilles de riz farcies au boeuf, les pinces de crabe farcies aux crevettes et les  classiques dumplings aux crevettes  et dumplings au porc vapeur! Il y a aussi un petit comptoir ou vous pouvez aller choisir des plats toujours en \"portion découverte\" il suffit d'amener votre feuille de facturation! Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Went for Dim Sum.  We just wanted to try it.  We weren't starving, so we just got three things.  The bean curd rolls were great but not incredible.  The pork dumplings were average.  The Chinese broccoli was incredible!!  I think the broccoli was the best we'd ever had.  Perfectly cooked, not too oily and a little salty.  The servers were well coordinated with each other and were very good about keeping track of which table was finished or who had just arrived.  Service was quick, efficient, and extremely polite.  TVs on the walls showed public service announcements or Asian soap operas, alternating every few minutes.  It was entertaining.  Go inside and up the stairs to find Ruby Rouge  Overall it was fun to try Chinese Dim Sum in a French area of a French/English speaking foreign country."}
{"text":"I don't know can people give this place bad review. It's good dim sum and very cheap. Very fast too and sometimes I didn't want to wait so I went to get my own stuff. Very efficient dim sum resto. Free coffee on Sunday morning too so that's a big plus for me. Those cart ladies are friendly even with their little English. To be honest I def prefer this one over kamfung because I don't have to wait  and the dim sum are just as good and cheaper."}
{"text":"Came from the convention center with a group of 8 on Sunday at noon (peak day, peak time, large group). Despite the throngs of people waiting, we were immediately seated and regaled with fabulous odors. I thought it was really cheap, also... $11 for basically all you can eat. Service was friendly, and fast. Recommend to first-timers and veterans."}
{"text":"Pretty basic dim sum to satisfy dim sum brunch needs. Came here quite a few times for dim sum. Food quality is decent, but I've definitely had better (coming from toronto) I would've liked if they had a greater variety and more of the dim sum classics. They have a bunch of Cantonese dishes that aren't dim sum but you can get a small plate.  The place is pretty big, but they don't have that many carts. A lot of the food is found at a buffet style area where you ask the person behind the counter to grab you an order. The system is fine, but it takes away from the whole cart experience. The general atmosphere is great though! Lots of energy, TVs playing the toronto Cantonese channel, and lots of the familiar dim sum noises.  You can't expect too much in terms of service, but they do the job efficiently. The prices are also pretty reasonable, I believe they have a discount if you get food before 11am."}
{"text":"When I was having trouble finding Montreal's most famous Dim Sum restaurant, a la Maison Kum Fung, I ended up stumbling to this banquet style restaurant, which came recommended to me by some Chinatown locals.   It's located on the 2nd floor of a Chinatown mall, where it was an absolute zoo when I arrived.  The stairs were filled with patrons all waiting for their number to be called and the crowd only got thicker with every stair step to the top.  There was almost little-to-no room to move and getting to the front to collect a number felt like an impossibility.  Not to mention I had 10 people with me and no reservation.  I some how made my way to the front, where I managed to play nice with the manager, who was busy handing out numbers to folks.  A crowd of close to 100 became a crowd of no more than 15 in a matter of minutes, due to the diligent seat assigning from the hostess.  Talk about a deceiving wait, I almost convinced the group to leave for another restaurant but was glad I stuck it out.  My group was given a nice private room overlooking the restaurant and not a moment too soon, since we were all starving.  Service was a little overwhelmed and was not able to clean our table or get food to us right away.  The staff was a little slow and getting attention to the room was marred by the fact they almost seemed too busy to tend to us.  Eventually the Dim Sum ladies wheeled their carts into room and managed to serve us heaping plates of Dim Sum goodies.  While most of them spoke some broken French / English, most of them had a tougher time speaking Cantonese than they did Mandarin.  Food portions here are ginormous.  I've never seen Dim Sum in bulk like this, not even in the South where everything was fatter and greasier.  The wu gok (fried taro dumplings) looked like they were the size of grenades and when stacked on top of eachother, looked like a hairy nest of eggs or unpeeled kiwi fruits.  Ha Cheung (shrimp crepe) and Ha Gao (shrimp dumplings) were both also massive, to the point where it took only a few dishes to make everyone full.  Zha Hai Kieu (fried crab claws) reminded me of jawbreakers and the Siu Mai was plenty thick with more meat than rice wrap.  Bigger isn't always better though, as most of the food was just adequate enough not to be mediocre.  I prefered most of the cart items than fetching items from the long table in the banquet hall area.  Most of those plates looked old and overly greasy.  Given the price and the portions, I think I could stomach another visit here in the future.  The final bill was a modest one, which came out to be $120CAD for roughly 10 people.  Surely the same Dim Sum rules still apply - come hungry, get a good spot, and arrive before noon.  A reservation here probably doesn't hurt either, something of which I'll consider next time I bring a big group."}
{"text":"We came for dim sum on a Sunday morning and after waiting for a while to be seated, cannot but notice that waitresses or other staff do not care if guests are here or not.  Finally we were seated by a \"funeral face\" waitress.  After a long wait, we kind of lost appetite and decided to get up and leave.   We must have disrupted the staff from their peaceful nap.   Will come back again?   No way!"}
{"text":"Before I begin, I should note my boyfriend is Cantonese, so it was a bit easier for me to order than it looks like it was for some of the other people who have reviewed.  Personally, I thought it was all delicious. My boyfriend on the other hand said it was pretty mediocre, so I would trust his opinion over mine, but he still enjoyed it.   The part that kind of ruined the experience was the cart service. Most of the things that we wanted to order never came around. As we were leaving we noticed a kind of buffet style, serve yourself station at the back end (? Still unsure) so the way they do things was a little confusing and we left not entirely satisfied, as we would have ate much more had we known it was available. Prices were also quite reasonable at around $3 a dish.  We would probably return if we were hungry and nearby, but wouldn't go out of our way to come back."}
{"text":"Terrible service and dirty restaurant. The vacuum right beside your table. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Delicious and very affordable food. Great Cantonese taste, and they have a very wide range of choices. That is very rare among Dim Sum restaurants."}
{"text":"Being the only other Dim sum houses in Montreal (Kam Fung being the other) I was disappointed in the food.  I'm from NYC and quickly realized how spoiled we are since we have 2 Chinatowns (NYC & QUEENS) So after moving here I asked around where we can have dim sum and was told Ruby Rouge.  Nice large dim sum house but the food was not up to par.  Being chinese and knowing good dim sum you can always tell by a good dim sum house by their \"Har Gow\" ( shrimp dumping)  Sort of like going to a italian restaurant and finding out they can't make a proper plate of spaghetti!   In A har Gow-The Shrimp dumpling rice skin should be soft, moist, silky and the inside should have full perfectly cooked shrimps inside!   ~Fail~ Not what we got at Ruby Rouge! Tough rubbery skin and tasteless over cooked shrimp!  I won't go into the other 3 dishes we ordered... I will say that the size of the dim sum was unusually LARGE so you will fill up but as one reviewer (Jando S.) said \"Bigger isn't always better though\"  The food was just adequate! He was absolutely dead on about his review (see below \" Jando S.\")  I even went back 2 more times on weekends and week days and it was the same.  In short if you can't get into La Maison Kam Fung then some dim sum is better than no dim sum!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for their Dim Sum and dinner. I have to admit, its ok. Then again, its hard to find a decent Dim Sum place in Montreal since we have a smaller Chinese community in comparison to Vancouver.  Its ok, the service is ok. Child friendly and decent food. Good price too! I wouldn't go here for dinner, you can definately find better quality elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here a few days after Christmas with family for Dim Sum and the place wasn't too packed. It was probably due to the temperature since it was under -25C for the entire week. We got the usual fare of Dim Sum items and this is the usual place that my family would go for Dim Sum in Chinatown. The food was good (no complaints) and a lot of items that you get prior to 11am are reduced in price.  Everything else that I wrote on my previous review last year applies."}
{"text":"Well the place has not changed much in 10 years . They are known for Dim Sum .We got there late 2:30 pm on Saturday. The place was empty . This is Chinese New Year weekend . That should have been a sign. They had a small menu which we ordered from but it is not the same as picking from the carts. They had only one cart and the food was cold. Overall disappointed but we will come next time around noon."}
{"text":"It´s OK...I came last weekend with a friend and we ordered one of those menus for two people. The food was decent, for the most part. The ribs were OK, the chicken with pineapple was not chicken but big balls of fried dough, the veggies were veggies (it´d be very difficult to screw a dish of steamed veggies), the fried rice with chicken had no chicken but scrambled fried eggs, the soup with dumplings was nice. The place was packed with Asian tourists (I just cannot understand coming all the way to Canada just to eat the same type of food they´d eat at home) and the main room was packed with a Chinese wedding. The bathrooms were very clean and the waitress was friendly....the place seems to be a hot with the Chinese, and I suspect that being Caucasian and a long-nosed does not help that much and we´ll always get the short end of the stick when it comes to food quality at Chinese restaurants. I´ll explore a bit more and try another place next time I fancy Chinese gnosh"}
{"text":"Oh man this place was terrible. The food tastes like mold, i could not eat most of it. I felt sick for the rest of the night . Stay away ! Yuck!"}
{"text":"I've already eaten at Ruby Rouge a few times but this will be my last time.  At the end of my lunch, I asked the waiter for the bill so he takes out his phone and starts calculating in front of me. I felt really weird/uncomfortable when he calculated in front of me because the cashier was in the front. He showed me his phone and told me the total was 22.xx dollars. I already knew how much the total was suppose to be and I was pretty sure he was wrong. I gave him 40 dollars and when he came back with the change he did not bring a receipt so I asked for it nicely. He comes back with the receipt, the total on it was 24.xx dollars. At that moment I knew something was wrong so I told him that it's incorrect. If my total was really 24.xx dollars then the change that was given to me was wrong. The waiter runs to the cashier and gives me a second receipt with the total 19.xx dollars that was correct. He blames it on someone else and at that point I was so embarrassed for him so I just paid and left quickly.   By the way the food is not that great and the restaurant is pretty dirty.  Not really sure what went wrong with the multiple incorrect receipts but please check your receipts!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Kam Fung and this place serves pretty good dim sum. The service is a little bit off.   The day i come on lunch time, the place is not packed but the food is good. I personnally will go back. The location is a little hard To find since you have To go through the main door of a shopping mall, go up a stair and you Will find the restaurant.   Overall, this place is a good place To go instead of the popular Kam Fung place."}
{"text":"Decent Chinatown dim sum place upstairs in the heart of Chinatown. My review however is based on my multiple experiences on takeout. So I realize by the time I get my half hour drive away from downtown it's not exactly the freshest dimsum. I still enjoy it. I have ordered some of their soya sauce chicken, shrimp har gow and sticky rice. Price of each is reasonable and they have been more than courteous to help me quickly with a takeout order. The quality of the dim sum is decent. Is it the best dim sum in the world? No. Is it the worst? No. I would concur that it falls somewhat in the middle. Peering into the restaurant it looked like it could use some TLC. Decor seemed a bit dated but dim sum trolley carts were being wheeled around. Overall three stars is a generous review."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10am on a Wednesday morning to enjoy some dim sum before we headed back to NJ. Read reviews on Yelp indicating that if we dined before 11AM then most items would be $2.  Sounded like a great idea until we actually sat down. Never have I ever experienced such terrible service AND dim sum.   What went wrong:  SERVICE - the hostess placed us at a table and not one person came by to bring us tea or water. Where is our server?  I saw one lady and asked if I could get some ice water and tea for my hubby.  She stated that we're not her table and then she walked off.  I flagged her down TWICE and she told us again that we're not her table.  The second time it looked like she was going to bring us something to drink, but never came back.   What is the point of having servers and dedicated sections if it's just ONE server with ONE specific section and not willing to provide service to other tables?  I saw a ton of servers/bussers/helpers, but they were all on the other side of the restaurant tending to other tables or just doing random things.  Finally a lady who pushes the carts came up to us and took our drink orders. We asked one guy for some chili sauce and he totally ignored my hubby's request and continued to set up tables and tend to other guests.  I couldn't believe that that actually happened.  Towards the end of our meal, a younger server helper came by and started providing us with some decent service.  FOOD - there are 3 carts that they occasionally push around.  They served har gow (shrimp dumplings), shu mai (pork and shrimp dumplings), veggie dumplings, beef meatballs, spare ribs, chicken feet, beef rice noodle rolls, BBQ pork rice noodle rolls, shrimp rice noodle rolls, congee, and steamed rice w/ dried shrimp and lap cheong sausage.  This was the only items they had in the carts.  Everything was $2 or $2.50.  I had to get up several times if I wanted to try their steamed rice dish or order congee.    Eventually they started to come out with different items (shrimp & chive dumplings, egg rolls).  By this time I was so upset and aggravated that I was ready to get the hell out of this restaurant.  I did not want to spend anymore time or money at this restaurant. The food was mediocre.  The 1 star is dedicated to the only 2 decent tasting items which was the BBQ pork rice noodle roll and congee.    I will NEVER EVER return back to this place.  I hate to say it, but if you're not Chinese,  the service you MIGHT receive will be minimal and most likely nonexistent. They truly cater to their own people and don't care about anyone else.  I would have rather paid 3x more for good dim sum and better service than to have wasted my morning coming here and ruining my last day in Montreal.  I've never felt more ignored in my life.  I've dined at many dim sum restaurants in many different cities/states and never have I ever experienced anything remotely like this.  I can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend or after their special $2 dim sum items.    I guess it's true what they say....you definitely get what you pay for which wasn't much."}
{"text":"Je suis venue ici pour célébrer le Nouvel An chinois. C'est maintenant une tradition chez nous et nous allons manger des dims sums avec famille et amis. En cette année de la chèvre, il n'était pas question d'y faire exception!   Nous avions réservé une table pour 12 personnes au téléphone (eh oui, nous étions vraiment une grosse gang!) et quelle ne fût pas ma surprise en arrivant au resto: nous avions une grosse table réservée dans une salle privée! Wow! En plus, c'était plein à craquer de monde! Un gros merci au proprio!   Les bouchées sont délicieuses, le service est assez efficace. Un serveur revenait fréquemment nous verser du thé. Côté ambiance, le restaurant est assez grand, c'est bruyant et à la bonne franquette. On s'est régalés et tous mes invités étaient enchantés par leur expérience. Je compte bien répéter l'expérience l'année prochaine!"}
{"text":"Roast Duck - flavorless and soggy skin, I left most of it, as a duck slut methinks not in every way.  Now to find a foot spa."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional dim sum restaurant. Look no further, Ruby Rouge hits the spot! While it is situated in an older mall, once you go up the stairs you will notice that this restaurant is full of regular Chinese OGs (Respectable older Chinese people) that are regular guests. They are usually found reading newspaper and sipping Chinese tea! The point mentioned above outlines the authenticity of this spot.  Now to the food. Growing up Vancouver, I would say I had better dim sum for sure. However it's average and meets my expectation for the most part. The Shrimp Dumpling Har Gou is descent, and their beef rice rolls are tasty! As stated in other reviews, the prices are extremely competitive and dim sum are priced at 2.30 - 4.25 per dish.  If you are looking for an average dim sum spot to fulfil your Chinese taste buds - at a bit of a run down location - here's the spot!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family. We always come here because it is one of the few dim sum restaurants in Montreal. They still have carts where you can choose your dishes. You can also go to the hot tables and pick up a dish if you don't want to wait for the dim sum carts.  We always have the classic dishes like pork shiu mai, shrimp hai gow, chicken feet, steamed ribs. etc. The quality is consistently good.  Ruby Rouge is a very large nicely decorated restaurant. But if you come on the weekend, prepare to wait a while for a table. On the weekdays, it is not crowded.  Would we come back? Yes, it is one of the few dim sum restaurants in Montreal and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Huuuuge location but this is probably the place to have dim sum if you are in Montreal.  It was sooo awesome, the wait staff speaks Chinese, English and FRENCH.  very cool!    Anyways, the dimsum is the usual, point and they will serve to you.  Also there are stations where you order, bring your tab to be stamped and then bring your plate back.  All are share-able.   Everything here was pretty fresh and tasty.   It is also a huge space, as well.  This is like the largest dimsum restaurant in Montreal!  Once in a while, it's good to have a little tasting of everything so the dim sum concept works well for that."}
{"text":"Si vous voulez manger des Dim Sum, évitez ce restaurant qui n'est rien d'autre qu'une usine. Si le service est rapide, le cadre est froid, la nourriture quelconque. Passez v"}
{"text":"The bus tour brought us here for Cantonese family dinner.  Food was decent.  Fish with soy bean was tender.  There was a banquet and it was noisy.  Bathroom is pretty spacious and clean.  Will try their dim sum on our next trip."}
{"text":"Français après:  I don't know where'S my Review but I've been going there a lot lately and it's pretty much my favorite thing of the Hour. Why? Staff is friendly even though they sometime (and that's quite polite) lack skill in French but hey I don't even care 'cause the food is that good. I go there with a REALLY empty stomach each time to make sure I can abuse in quantity. 2 super ultra hungry person is like 55$ with tip and 1 drink each. There's two menu. White people not to say Non-Asian get what I call (you'll guess it by now) The White People menu. ASK FOR THE DIM SUM ONE! They'll kindly get a menu for you. I'll tell you 2 things for this review: The type of guy I am in terms of eating and the stuff I believe that everybody that kind of «get me» should also try.   Ok I like everything at least once and I'm not disgusted by anything. If I hate it it's still an experience that brang a result: Knowing I don't like it. I personally have a fun game with friends as willing as me: Find something on the menu that you know the other might not like and ask that friend to do the same thing. The result are usually disappointing in a good way: You end up liking it!  1: Crab Roll. This is a big-filled-with-crab-crispy ball with nice tempura-ish  (see picture) 2: The Pork dims sums: Whatever the religion, cross your fingers and dig in: Simply put a huge bite of amazing flavoors.  3: BBQ Pork Steam Bums: Nough's said. 4:Shrimp Rolls: Since when there'S too much shrimps? 5: Sticky Rice Balls: They are filled wit meat: What meat? dunno, I just know I like it. 6: Sweet Tofu: Hot Tofu with ginger sweet sauce. Just great!  The staff, when you are smiling and friendly with them and show empathy for their lack of french-speaking is very pushing harder to help you have a nice relaxed meal.   Je pense que mon avis a été effacer ou j'ai une revue sur un autre avis du resto mais peu importe. Ces derniers temps je suis complètement méga-giga accroc au Dim Sums. En gros, c'Est juste un excellent coin ou manger comme un cochon pour pas plus que 55$ pour 2 personnes (avec tip inclus).  Ils ont l'habitude d'amener ce que j'appelle amicalement le Menu des Blancs. Mais je demande toujours le menu dim sums. Dans le fond pour cet avis je dirais simplement quel genre de foodies je suis et puis les mets que j'aime prendre chaque fois que je vais là  1: La boule de crabe croustillante. C'est juste tellement plein de chair de crabe, cE'st génial. 2: les Dim sum au porc; une explosion de saveur en bouche 3: Les pains à vapeur au porc BBQ. 4: Les rouleaux  de crevette: Juste encore des crevettes mais c'est juste trop bon 5: Les boules de riz collante: un peu comme les onigiri japonais. Cest juste délicieux enveloppé de feuille qui sent le thé. 6: Du tofu sucré. C'est du Tofu chaud (assez liquide) avec du sucre de gingembre: Superbe  Le personnel n'est pas vraiment qualifié en français mais en démontrant de la patience, de l'amitié et de la tolérance, on obtient un très bon service relax."}
{"text":"I was here a couple of years ago and the dim sum was good."}
{"text":"Ho ho ho... sad memories of Hong Kong being brought back. This place is far from Hong Kong and a bit dirty. For the experience, yeah... it surely reveals a bit of southern chinese magic... but like usual... nothing is as fresh and as refined. Choices aren't infinite but the menu is long enough to argue about what to have.  If you deal with the cart ladies beware! They often speak no french, no english and no mandarin haha. But you don't need anything else than your hands anyway."}
{"text":"Love to come here for dim sum! They also have awesome char siu and duck available at a cheap price for take out. Service is okay, don't expect anything too fabulous. This is a great please to come eat with family or friends to share plates. I come here at least once a month and I never leave without a full belly! Recommend :)"}
{"text":"My elderly aunts and uncles love this place because it's close to the nursing home. The dim sum was terrible and the dinner was only slightly better. The shumai were dry. The taro dumplings were dry and tasteless with hardly any meat filling. I found a piece of hair in one of the dishes at dinner. The red bean dessert soup at the end was extremely sweet; I couldn't eat it even after I watered it down with some hot water.  There are so many better options in Chinatown. Don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Decent place for dim sum. The cart experience needs to be refurbished. The place is big and not many carts pass by. You often need to get up and pick yourself your dishes. Waitresses are stressed, they really need some help.  There's a buffet place but with many people out there it is kind of messy.  Price is good. I've ordered a lot of food for 3 people and we paid $40, tips included.  As there's just one other dim sum place in Montreal, I would say it's ok to go to Ruby Rouge. It's subpar compared to Toronto."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant du quartier Chinois. La nourriture est excellente! On vous apporte vos plats sur des chariots et on choisi ce que l'on veut manger. Le prix est facturé en fonction de nos choix. On fait des découvertes. Service en Anglais et en Chinois. Pratiquez vous avec des baguettes avant d'aller manger. J'ai adoré mon expérience! En bout de ligne les prix sont abordables si on compare avec les restaurants Chinois Canadiens."}
{"text":"Je dois avouer ne pas être allé pour le dim sum un dimanche matin, mais simplement pour souper un vendredi soir. On a choisit un des menu de style \"souper pour 2\" et ça été pas mal bon. À part la soupe. J'avais choisi le \"hot n' sour\" et elle n'était ni chaude ni sûrette. Ça ressemblait plutôt à un liquide gélatineux san goût. Un peu dégeux. Même chose pour la soupe au dumpling. Mais le reste était vraiment, vraiment bon. J'ai un p'tit coup de coeur pour le général tao et le boeuf à je-ne-m'en-souviens-plus. Excellents! Et encore mieux le lendemain comme restant. Donc, à ma prochaine visite, j'évite la soupe et j'y retourne pour le brunch à la dim sum!"}
{"text":"Comparing this to NY dim sum, it really isn't very enjoyable. The food wasn't as fresh as it should be, and the flavors aren't anything special. Definitely pass on it."}
{"text":"For a sunday dim sum brunch, the service is friendly and fast.  It is important to get here early to get a good spot, the bigger dinning room, gets the the first service,  Deep fried tofu was a bit too dry for my delicate taste buds and it tasted overcooked & carbonated.   My favorite dish is the Guyland, it always takes the longest to order, usually a 10 to 15 minute wait for the Guyland. It still worth it, to take break from all the MSg."}
{"text":"once again a disappointing dim sum experience in Montreal. When the f--k are they gonna get it right here??? Except for the pork dumpling everything else was not even close to china or HK dimsum. I will not waste might time writting more than that. Its everywhere the same here. I am waiting for the day someone from Guangzhou will open up and give these old timers here a run for thier money."}
{"text":"One way you can tell if a Chinese restaurant is good is if there are Chinese people eating there. Restaurant Ruby Rouge caters almost exclusively to Chinese-Canadians; I'm always one of the few non-Chinese people there when I go. I can't judge whether the food is authentic, but it's very good.  I love this place, and I come here every time I'm in Montreal. The atmosphere is great -- formal Chinese dining room -- the wait staff are friendly, the service is good, and the food is excellent.  If you're in a group and feel adventurous, don't bother looking at the menu -- just tell your waiter what things you like, and let them bring you whatever they want. I've discovered many amazing dishes there this way.  They're a little pricey, but worth it, because you get good quality Chinese food. And don't do takeout -- the dining room is a fun part of the experience."}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the fact that it is right next to the Holiday Inn.  I would be the first to say that hotel restaurants or restaurants connected to the hotel are often mediocre and high priced.  This restaurant is neither.  They serve both Cantonese and Szechuan cuisines but the main draw is the dimsum.    Dimsum is served from the traditional metal carts.  Diners simply pick which item they want and the server then marks the price of the item on the provided check.  All the traditional favorites are available like pork siu mai, har gau, pot stickers, egg rolls, fried crab claws, char siu bao, etc., as well as, the more exotic items such as chicken feet.  Congee is also an option with all the necessary fixings.  For dessert, they really did an excellent job with egg tarts and sesame seed balls.  The other dessert items are still great options.  There are also some dimsum items (mostly dessert) that are served from a dedicated  table.  As with the carts, diners simply pick which item they want.  Despite the variety of dimsum items available, it is clear that quality was not sacrificed.  The only areas that could be improved is service by wait staff (slow and not very responsive) and decor (dining room flooring and walls could be refurbished)."}
{"text":"Restaurant Ruby Rouge is found in Montreal's small Chinatown.  My aunt wanted to take us to a Chinese restaurant that serves Dim Sum.  This was not her first choice, but the place she wanted to take us was closed.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of the building.  It is a very large restaurant.  The place was packed that day we visited.  We were seated right away, but that is as good as the service got for us.  It was one of the worst service that I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  Very very unfriendly!!  Very very slow as well.  Took forever for the carts full of goodies to reach us.  Once they did reach us, the food we tried was just decent at best.  The Spare Ribs, Shrimp, Shao Mai, Calamari, Chicken or maybe it was Duck Feet, Eggplant, and everything else were all disappointing to average.  Maybe we just picked the wrong choices.  More than likely, the bad service from the beginning was leaving a sour taste in all of our mouths.  I would not return here based on our awful experience."}
