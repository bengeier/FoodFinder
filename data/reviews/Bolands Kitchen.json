{"text":"This place is incredible!

I ordered the scallops as an appetizer: they were perfectly cooked and the sauce was phenomenal. For the main course I had halibut and asparagus wrapped in phyllo pastry and it was fantastic! October is fish month and they have many fish specials to offer. For dessert I had the cheese board and a Canadian coffee and both were top notch.

Service was the best I've experienced in a long time. They were so friendly and the recommendations were right on the mark. The atmosphere is warm and cozy! I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and amazing service! I've been here more than a few times and have never been disappointed. Everything about Bollards Kitchen is spectacular."}
{"text":"We randomly stumbled into this neighbourhood gem for lunch, and were pleasantly surprised. Although I had heard of Chef Boland and his Kitchen for several years, it's a bit off the beaten path (at least for me), so I had not had the chance to venture there.

The ambience was warm and inviting, albeit the decor was not exactly sleek and modern (think more like \"cozy grandparents' home\"). But who cares? After all, we were here for the food.

After seeing \"Rolled Souffle of Blue Crab & Boursin\" listed on the menu, it was a no brainer - we both ordered this dish immediately. I didn't even know such a delectable combination was possible: souffle, crab AND cheese? More, please.

Chef Boland personally took our orders, and offered us a glass of Cab Sauv that was not listed on the menu after hearing our preferences. 

I would definitely return for dinner - especially now that I know it's worth the trek!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times before and enjoyed the food so thought it would be a nice local place to bring our visitors from NY State
Our reservation was for 8 o'clock and we were seated shortly after.  Two of us ordered the chicken, two the trout.  We were told they were out of trout and there was only one order of chicken left.   The trout was changed to salmon and we were told there was only one salmon left. This 
was at 8:15 on a Saturday night in a restaurant with a relatively small menu!
The food finally came at 9:20.   While it was good.., we won't be going back.   So so many choices of restaurants... we would like to be able to eat what we like."}
{"text":"Following this really disappointing experience, I sent an email to the owner in addition to posting this review. I never got a response back (rude), but sending them an email somehow added me to their mailing list, so I keep getting emails telling me about their special features. Given the fact that I never want to go to this restaurant again, that's pretty frustrating. 

Based on this experience, it really seems like Bolands is not interested in giving good customer service. Even if the food is good, I don't know that it's worth a visit. Toronto has loads of great restaurants - and most of them at least acknowledge disappointed guests."}
{"text":"The food was very nicely done and the cafe was very clean. Authentic Thai food and consistent over the 3 times I ate there.Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had a very nice lunch at Bolands today. The atmosphere is cozy with dark wood and cushioned bench seating.

My server was lovely. Very informative and friendly. She told my friend and I that all their seafood is fresh from the market this morning, and every morning. Nice.

My friend and I both ordered the open face sandwich and soup of the day. The soup was butternut squash - delicious. 
The sandwich was salmon and I substituted it for beef. I was concerned it would be too heavy, but the sandwich was small. It was a perfect lunch sized portion. All this for under $11 :)

We then had mint tea and mint and ginger tea. Both came with fresh ingredients in large steepers. Loved this presentation. 

The only reason this isn't five stars is because I didn't have a ton of food. I think I will return and update this review. I recommend Bolands!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! The atmosphere is warm, the food fantastic and the staff--everyone we came into contact with was welcoming and knowledgable.  The owner Chris Boland, is the perfect host. It's like you are dining in his home.  No wonder it is a neighborhood favorite. Four friends were looking for dinner on a Saturday night. We were thinking we should try something new. But then we all came to the conclusion: why try something else when we have the perfect spot in Boland's Kitchen. Great wine selection. Two of us had the to die for pork tenderloin. One had the venison and the other the trout. Delish all round. Perfectly cooked with a lovely selection of fresh al dente vegetables. We tried the lemon curd for dessert. That vanished quickly. I can hardly wait to go back. Thanks Chris you are a gem."}
{"text":"Lovely friendly atmosphere.

Everything from the appetizers to desert was fabulous. The mains we had were all devine, from roat beef to fish. super.

The finishing Latte was perhaps one of the best pours I have seen, layers so well formed in a coffee drink. Bravo.

All in all a very enjoyable evening out."}
{"text":"Honestly where do I start! Firstly, yes the place is small but beyond cozzy and beautiful! I loved the atmosphere! Also please do youself a favor and get the ribeye, it is not on the menu but ask the waitress/waitor they migh have the special, so worth it!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal I've eaten out in the last 12 months! All the flavours were perfectly balanced and delicious. The trout and the salmon were cooked just right so that they were flaky and soft. We asked for a wine pairing and they offered us tastes of two different wines. It turned out the one we liked most was the cheapest on the menu. Which means that they have a great wine list and also were not pushing us to buy the most expensive bottle. 

It was an overall delightful experience! I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional - but the interior is just okay. And the food, while good, is not great. I do not think it is worth almost $30 per entree."}
{"text":"Had a lunch with friend, and found this place cozy and food absolutely delicious.
The owner gave us some wine tasting and was very nice and accommodating.
Will be back!"}
