{"text":"I came across The Burger's Priest purely by accident one day when I was biking in the Beaches neighbourhood. It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto.   First off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.  The fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.  The space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.  Next time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.

{"text":"This is review #1 in my Summer of 2011 Search for the Best Burger. It's Saturday and at 12:01 PM, we are already lined up at the Priest. It's cozy, nuff said. The smell is great, just enough to start the salivation process. The fresh meat is nicely formed into balls up, as each serving awaits it's transformation. I chat with some other patrons, it must be my good looks, because others are asking me what this is and what that is. I reply quickly, I am a Burger Priest virgin. I order a double-double for my significant other and 'The Priest\" for myself. Somehow this seems wrong, given my strict catholic upbringing and years as an alter boy. Then my world is shattered. The mushroom fryer is broken. OH THE HUMANITY. So I opt for the double-double and an order of fries. I go for tomatoe, onion and mayo. Let the burger sing it's own song people. It's juicy, the meat flavour is there. Nice crisp on the patty and a minimal bun. It's good, but where are the angels, the path to the white light? Still waiting. Could you and I make these burgers at home? Of course. Is this the holy trinity of meat, bun and add ons, as others have stated? Not in my opnion, or at least not yet. Are they good, absolutely. Eating out is not just about convenience, we are after all, social creatures. It's partially the experience and the thought that an individual at the stove will take our taste buds and our spirit to another level. I will be back at \"The Priest\" someday and am looking forward to giving them 5 stars. God willing. Namaste."}
{"text":"The burger was ok. Not what I thought after reading and hearing about this place. Very small a couple of stools. The cashier needs to learn manners. Really for what you get its over priced. The only good thing was the chilly chesse fries. I would go back for them again."}
{"text":"...it really depends on what you define as a burger.  i was fortunate enough to have the \"double-double\".  as verbally recommended to me by one of the brothers/owners, it was this, or the \"priest\" which i was to have, as a first experience.  i had requested fried onions, ketchup, mayo, and lettuce as my toppings.  the cheese was part of the burger, but this burger alone, cost $10.16.  the friend who recommended this place to me (and was with me at the time), told me that i should try the fries as well.  alas, i didn't have too too much cash on hand, and was expecting a rather large burger (i wasn't all that hungry).  so, what defines a burger?   is it the patty?  is it the toppings?  the bun/hoagie?  or everything all together?  the meat (which i was told, is fresh ground every hour), was fabulous.  what some people would consider \"dripping of grease/fat\" i must correct them.  it is juice.  wonderful meat juice.  one look at the inside of my bite, and i didn't see any visual additives to the patty itself.  i felt that i could actually TASTE the meat!    the toppings.  well, what to say?  the cheese was not the greatest cheese, but did the job well.  one lettuce, ketchup, mayo, typical stuff.  the fried onions?  they were $1, and though it wasn't a lot it did fill the burger as a whole.  the bun.  ah...  the bun...  i feel as if this was the absolute downside of it all.  i'm sure they know how juicy the meat is.  i'm sure they know the size of the patty, as it leaves the capable hands of its maker.  but this just did not fit the bill.  it might be that it is an unpretentious burger (it should be, cause the meat is GREAT), but the bun was just a little lower than that.  i ate the burger there, and found the bun very sponge-y, quickly absorbing whatever liquid driveled out, and with the little pressure that i was holding it with, made the thickness of the bun to almost nothing!   i don't know how people can enjoy this, as a take out item.  anyhow, i will frequent the burger's priest again.  i won't be running there, as some other reviewers will, but i hope that the next time i do, they will have my \"bun issue\" fixed.  or perhaps they'll offer me a fork and knife so that i don't have to have my burger with a bun, but that would cost more than having a better bun..."}
{"text":"Never going back overpriced and gross food. It cost $18 for a burger fries and a small can of pop. It took a long time to get the food too."}
{"text":"OMG! one of the best burgers in the city. .. this will date me but the only thing that comes to mind when I eat a Burger's Priest  burger is..it tastes like what a McDonalds burger use to taste like when I was a kid, and  Mickey D's use to have real meat, and they actually use to COOK the burger from scratch in the store on a real flat grill... the best thing is they will let you have your burger any way you want, you can even ask for NO SALT.. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Burger's Priest.. and even better I love the wall of grease across the road from the original location on Queen east, you have to check it out it's the funniest thing ever..you know it's a good burger if it's left it's mark across the street along the sidewalk ...I would Highly recommend having a Burger at this place..you won't be disappointed .."}
{"text":"Ordered the High priestess combo which rang in at about $15. Now, as much I enjoyed the burger I can't justify eating here more than once or twice a month, way too expensive . I went simple to see if the burgers reflected the hype they were receiving.  With the lines sometimes going out the door the seating was sparse, and uncomfortable. Maybe a hint that they needed you to eat and move it along . I would recommend you try burger priest and check out the secret menus online."}
{"text":"Simply delicious !! Ordered the cheeseburger with the extra onion topping for $1.49 enjoyed every single bite...nomnomnom. I think you definitely develop a craving once you come here at least once. This was my second time and planning a third and forever after lol Fries were extra around $3.69 burger was around $5 something. Fries were enough for 2 people to share. Do try the cheese fries at least once! I didn't go for anything too big as this was just perfect for me and I believe it's one of their cheapest burgers (if your on a budget you can still enjoy). All of them well worth it as your getting a freshly made burger to order. I even like their large selection of diverse pop cans, and the casual urban hightop seating. Know some biblical questions to enter the secret menu. You'll get it right eventually lol"}
{"text":"-A very busy place, so crowded and self serving. -Burger is tasty,juicy,well-flavored and fresh. And a very decent size. -Fries are ordinary but not bad al all.  -Chili is rich with cheese, also ordinary but not bad. -It's pricy as a fast food burger restaurant with no atmosphere. -Definitely will bring friends to go and share the taste."}
{"text":"I don't have much else to add, since all the reviews seem to capture all the good and bad that I experienced. Service was friendly, my cheeseburger with smoke was VERY delicious, as with the fries.   The bun to meat ratio was awesome - the patty definitely wasn't overpowered by the bun. And the bun was hot and toasted!!!!   I hope that one day, they will consider more comfortable, roomier seating. Currently, the tables are very small (at least it felt that way as we had our down parkas with us) and crammed together."}
{"text":"Agreed with Daniel D you need to eat these right away. Once you put it them in a bag and walk around for a bit, that steam from the heat of the burgers will moisten the buns and the toppings and  then when you're all stoked to kill it and you take it out of the bag, you're gonna feel it and then take your first bite and be like \"this place sucks. Im going to Parts 'n' Labour next time\". First, youre an idiot for judging them on a takeout burger you ruined, second...Parts N Labour is just as good actually...but only if you eat both right away ya dingus!  Get a basic bacon cheeseburger if its your first time and you wont regret it. The most simple burgers are always the best. Then go to Parts N Labour and see if you can decide which is better because I cant."}
{"text":"I tried their classic burger. You probably can get the same quality burger at McDonald at half the price."}
{"text":"Decent juicy buger  but under seasoned. Not sure what the fuss ia all about.  I had better fresh made on premise buger at holy chuck if I'm downtown or real mccoys in Scarborough   I ate here five times and it's  the same bugers so it not an off day situation    I would give it is a three Star but it is small and cramped place     I worked in the food service industry for years and I don't expect a lot of service but just  smile and pretend that you don't hate your job.  Also  I give here a tip when I paid."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not a fan for burgers so it'll be hard for me to give a 4 or 5 stars to this place. I had a cheese burger and my bf had a 'priest' and we also had a cheese chillie fries. The patty was good i think, very juicy and tender, but too greasy for me. My bf said it was SOOO good, was the best burger he's ever had. We both didn't like the fries too much.  This definitely can be a good place for snacks and cravings."}
{"text":"Coming from NY and CA, I've had my fair share of burgers and was excited to try burgers in Toronto.  I ordered the cheeseburger and a side of fries - I think this is a good baseline to get if you want to compare burgers from different places.  Food:  The burger was good and patty was well seasoned.  Thick burger with great toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickle, tomato, mustard, mayo).  Compared to Shake Shack, I think Shake Shack's patty wins.  The patty here needed to be juicer.  Regardless, I still think it's a good burger and next time I'll try the double or get the \"Priest\" which is a cheeseburger that comes with portobello mushrooms on top.  The menu is simple and I've heard there is also a secret menu that you can order from (see other Yelp posts about this).  For fries, I rate it higher than Shake Shack or In-N-Out.  Fresh, crispy, and just enough salt.  Also helps that they don't get too soggy in the paper bag.  Ambiance: It can get crowded so come prepared to eat standing up or taking it togo.  I went at 8:00 pm on a Monday and waited in line for 15 minutes.  But, after receiving my food, the line was gone and some seats opened up, so the crowd definitely comes and goes in waves.    Overall:  Good burger and fries - definitely coming back. Knocking off 2 stars because it's CASH ONLY and there isn't nearly enough seating.  Total for a cheeseburger and fries was $10.25, so expect to spend anywhere between $12-$20 for a complete meal w/ drink."}
{"text":"4 combos - bacon double cheeseburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes. $62.00. We found the burgers to be very bland and greasy. Fries were average. Kids enjoyed the shakes. Overall, not so special and pricey.  We're not burger purists  and not very fussy when it comes to fast food but we could not finish this meal. There are better options in Vaughan if you're after a juicy burger."}
{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Cheeseburger & Double Cheeseburger, Milkshake  Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 3 / 5 Cooking speed: 3 / 5 Food Quality: 5 / 5 Food Quantity: 3.5 / 5 Price: 4 / 5  Cleanness: 5 / 5  Repeat: Yes  I tried Burger Priest on multiple occasions. The meat is so tender, juicy and tasty, even eating it 30 min later after a co-worker bringing it back to the office for me. My only compliant is the size is small! It leaves you wanting more!  I tried the milkshake another time, they actually make it from scratch. But it's not a repeat for me.  In order to compare the burgers on Queen West, I ordered 1 burger from Burger Priest and 1 burger from P&L burger and eat it at the same time. In conclusion, I think Burger Priest taste just a little bit better, but you will be more fulfilled eating at P&L, and the wait time is significantly shorter at P&L."}
{"text":"I love this place the chilli cheese fries and secret Menu is an awesome combo. Will always we back at this place. They can use a drink fontain."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype, wait or price. Super greasy burger and fries. The burger was dry and had no taste!  Tried the Queen St location too. In general the burgers are small and have no taste. McDonalds is way better.  If you're looking for a spicy tasty burger under $15, I suggest you try Wahlburgers and you can be served and order a beer!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Comparable to The Shake Shack or In-N-Out burger. Wish they would put in a credit/debit machine."}
{"text":"Reducing my rating to 3 stars because of how unbelievably slow they are. I completely understand waiting for fresh food to be made to order, however I wait at Fusaro's nearby, Banh Mi Boys, but none take as long as this place and it's arguably simpler food to prepare!  Also, cash only? I HATE that."}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have ever had. The meat is juicy and full of flavour. It is also not too salty. The other thing that makes the burger is the \"option\", deep fried portobello mushrooms stuffed with cheese and herbs. I've tried the blue steel burger, without the option, and whilst I love blue cheese, it's not as good. Search online for the \"secret menu\" but recommend starting the the \"The Priest\". Yes it's an expensive burger, and the queue somewhat painful but I've never been disappointed with my burger from the Upper Beaches store.  ... also, be careful because sometimes they run out of meat!"}
{"text":"Ordered two burgers and fried through UBer eats. What a mistake !! Very expensive for the quality. Paid $30. Their menu says that the fries are freshly cut but what we got did not look or taste like freshly made fries. And the burger that cost almost $10 each was way below average. Also didn't even put ketchup for the fries. Never again!"}
{"text":"I have never had a hamburger so perfect in my life, and I am not a spring chicken.  I will not lie and say you will not have to wait because they are unacceptably busy; however, everyone from the employees to the patrons waiting for their food are so genuinely nice.    Back to the burger:  The burger is not large, but it is so juicy, fresh, and filling.  I kept it simple and only added cheese, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, and mayonnaise.  Everything was so fresh I started to wonder if they made their own mayonnaise in-house.  The bun was nothing special, but the simplicity of it is what helped to make it work so well.  As I waited for my food, I observed trays and trays of hamburger in perfect little balls and rows.  The meat was exposed on trays, and there were no flies in sight which is uncommon for the amount of times the door was open.  The workers were like a machine cranking out the perfect burger with a side of friendliness and creative edge.  The best compliment to the burger was my paper bag of fresh cut fries.  I love French fries, and these once again, were the best I have ever eaten. Although they were crispy, they were chewy and thick but not too thick.  I long to return to my favorite city on the planet and eat the signature dish of the Americans:  the hamburger from The Burger Priest."}
{"text":"I have heard many good things about Burger's Priest. But I don't completely get it.  I had a cheeseburger and chilli cheese fries. My friend had Holy Smoke (secret menu) and chilli cheese fries. The price was $30.35. On the pricey side. The burgers are small compared to modern industry standards. Generous portion of fries, though. They have a secret menu...I haven't decided how I feel about that. If you don't look into it before you go, you are left with a very limited menu. In a past visit I had the Option which is two mushroom caps stuffed with cheese and deep fried. It is delicious and unique. For this burger alone I would return.  Not sure if I would recommend, otherwise."}
{"text":"I live on the west side of town and hate driving across town for food, but it is worth it. Best burger in town at this price range. Better fries would be nice though. Clearly they have problems with the potatoes they use because they are very inconsistent."}
{"text":"I'm rating BP a 4/5 not because of the cost of their burger. While I'm a huge fan, I wish their burgers were $2 less. Then I would eat there more than once a week.  Nothing compares to BP. Their burgers just melt in your mouth. They are cooked JUST right, which most burger joints in the city tend to screw up, by overcooking their burgers.  I always get the double cheeseburger and hey, I can get used to the grease. The taste overcomes any mess than comes with the burger."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at Chili Dog I just ordered.  Very small dog.  Chili missing ingredients.  Just a very small sandwich.  You need 2 of these sandwiches to have a good meal.  Very tiny flimsy little sandwich."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious burgers. Absolutely disgusting fries. The burger was great but it was bit on the small side considering the burger was about 10$. The fries ruined the meal.... No salt and burnt tips. Aside from the top ones bring nice and crispy, anything underneath was greasy and soggy. The fries absolutely ruined it for me and left a bad after taste. The place was really cluttered and seemed to have gotten really crowded by the time I was halfway through my burger. No room to sit comfortably... Great burger but that's about it..."}
{"text":"I have always liked the burgers here. However lately the Toronto locations were losing their touch. This new Mississauga location reminded me of how good the Burgers used to be. I got the high priest, vatican and holy smoked. Those friend and battered jalapenos are something else. I digress though because through all my burger hunting escapades there is only one king in my books and that's Fresh Burger in Richmond Hill. Best I have ever had and I put the priest a close 3rd."}
{"text":"I was so exited to see what the hype was all about so I came in with my mom. I am a big burger lover and so i was expecting something amazing. Unfortunately i was disappointed. I got a double California with added bacon and my mom got a Priest. The burgers are not bad at all.. but neither of us found them particularly great. They were just okay. The patties themselves lack flavour in my opinion. If anything, we loved the fries more. They were delicious! Maybe my expectations were too high but i would say even a double cheese and bacon from Harvey's has more flavour."}
{"text":"Small overpriced and under seasoned burger. Not worth all the hype. The fries were soggy and my burger was super greasy. I got the \"priest\" burger, the meat itself was lacking salt/pepper and the \"option\" was greasy. I prefer 5 guys which is right around the corner."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from Philly and my local friend brought me here. This location is very small. I had the Fiery Furnace burger - it was so delicious!  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Most hyped burger I have ever eaten.  Did not live up to expectation, meat was tasteless, bun was like the cheap no-name ones you could get at the supermarket.  No seating, and completely faceless staff.  Next time I want a great burger I'd rather go  straight to hell than see the priest!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about how great \"Burger's Priest\" is, few have said it's their top favourite in the city. I'd pass it in a car but never went in, until I finally moved into the area. Went to see a movie and had some time to kill and an empty stomach, so figured right across the street is this Burger place that I've heard nothing but good things about. So I go in, prices seem fair to what most other \"fancy\" burger joints charge. So I order up a cheeseburger, as a combo. My partner the same. Get charged a bit over 20 bucks for the order... so far all seems normal.  Seating is very limiting, luckily we got in just before a fairly decent rush came in, so we had our seats saved.  We get called to pick up our food... open the bag... fairly small bag of fries. Under it, a fairly small burger. Not to say that I need more to eat, because personally I was fine with the amount of food. It's just that the ratio of price to food is way off.  The taste is great, not knocking the flavour and quality because it's all there, but it hurts me to pay over 5 bucks for a burger that almost felt like it was just a bit bigger then a slider.  Fries were okay, not anything to write home about. So if I ever decide to go again, I'll probably just go for a double cheeseburger, at least that way I'm getting a bit more burger for my money.  But I'm kind of doubting I'll really go again."}
{"text":"We walked in on Canada Day for the first time. We were told there were only 18 burgers left, as they grind their own, never frozen burgers daily. Really simple menu: burger, cheeseburger, veg option is a panko crusted portabello cap. Had the cheeseburger and fries. The burger was amazing, the perfect proportion of burger and bread. I hate when the bun overwhelms the meat, but this was perfection. Yum. The fries were a huge let down though, soggy and greasy. For that, I must give it only four stars."}
{"text":"Was there on a Saturday a few weeks ago. Me and 3 others stopped by around 5 for a small snack before going to a show. With all the hype around their burgers and all the new locations popping up, I thought it was finally time to give this place a try.  I got a High Priest ($9.79) to share with the BF and my other 2 friends got a Bacon Double Cheeseburger ($9.78) to share. You can choose you own toppings for the Bacon Double Cheeseburger.  You can definitely taste the fresh beef, but I didn't get much other flavours besides that on the High Priest. Not sure what the secret sauce is suppose to taste like, couldn't really taste it. I see others on here calling it a expensive Big Mac. My burger was also very sloppily put together, I had to put it back together to get a nicer pic lol. The Bacon Double Cheeseburger was much better put together. My friends liked it, but I didn't get a taste so not sure how it tasted myself.  The burgers were ok, nothing really special about it. I was slightly disappointed since there was so much hype about it. The burgers were a bit small for the price. The place was small and cramped, especially when it got busy. There wasn't a lot of room to even stand while you wait for the burgers after ordering. The line up to order took up what little room there was between the tables on either sides of the store near the front. It took about 10 mins for our burgers to be made. We managed to get one of the the standing tables at the front, scarfed down our burgers in 5 mins and left. I might go again to try the Vatican City since so many people rave about it. But only if I was ever close to a Burger Priest, not worth an actual trip there."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best burger joint in Toronto. If you want a good juicy burger packed with flavor, THIS IS WHERE YOU GO!  This place does not really offer any room to eat as it has very little dining space. There is also a \"Secret menu\" that you can find on their website, which kind of boggles my mind because this menu holds all the best stuff...  I'm sure a lot of people miss out on a lot of options because it's not shown in the joint which kind of makes me feel sorry for them.  Either way, I'm giving this place 5 stars because I come here for the burger which is my favorite in all of Toronto. I'm not going to come here to sit and socialize - If I want to do that I will go to 'The Works'.  I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an amazing tasting burger. I either ask for a 'High Priest' or a 'Vatican City'. Their fries are great too!"}
{"text":"Nothing special at all. Expect spend $30 for two. Yeah cash only. No seating and this is what I call highway roberry."}
{"text":"Got delivery.  Had a little mistake with the order, but killer customer service and delicious food."}
{"text":"This place can be considered a bit expensive for what it is by some places but I am glad there are some more casual options opening up in the entertainment district.  This particular location has more room and seating than the other two I have been to (in particular the Queen/Spadina one) and so far during the off times I have gone it hasn't seemed as busy as the other locations as well.  Maybe it is a bad thing that I don't need to walk further to get a burger fix now!  I  I usually go for the straight cheeseburger but I had the fried chicken sandwich the other day for the first time (Peter's Denial).  It was good for a change but the fried chicken steamed bao at Banh Mi Boys is definitely better."}
{"text":"The Priest at The Burger's Priest is a very unique burger. A traditional cheeseburger from what seems like the local grill is topped off with a cheese stuffed fried portobello mushroom. They call this mushroom \"the option\" at The Burger's Priest. However, it is anything but optional as it makes the burger something extraordinary. Overall, this is not your average burger and is definitely a one-of-a-kind burger you won't find at most other places. For uniqueness and pulling off a mushroom in a way that appeals to the masses The Burger's Priest gets major points."}
{"text":"The biggest problem with The Priest is consistency. 85% of the time it'll be the best burger you've ever had, with fries that are really good. However, 15% of the time the burger just isn't right, the fries are under- or over-done, and it just makes you question whether or not you want to live another day.  Don't get me wrong, even on a bad day the burger is pretty good. It's just not transcendent.  But that 85% of the time? Well, that is enough to get 5-stars, because it far overshadows the occasional misfire."}
{"text":"I LOVE The Burger Priest! Pure awesomeness!  At $10 a burger you can reach heaven's gate. Yes, that's how good it is.  After the first bite you can taste the quality and freshness of the ground beef. It's so much meatier and juicier compared to other burger joints. You can actually see them grind the beef every hour which makes it a step above other gourmet burger places   The Priest - deep fried stuffed cheese portabello mushroom on top of a cheese burger is soo good and packed with so much flavour. Guranteed ITIS after eating one."}
{"text":"Blessed by the priest during stop #4 of the 2015 Burger Tour. The patty is fresh and delicious. The fries are stellar! But the lack of toppings hold it back from a perfect score. Until next time padre."}
{"text":"For you burger lovers out there, you've got to try the Burgers Priest. I had the Priest - a cheeseburger with \"The Option\". Order the fries to go with it, and bite into your burger - but hold your burger over the fries. Let the cheesy goodness ooze out of \"The Option\" and onto your fries.  Delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest of cashiers. We were first time customers and not sure how the process worked. Never told us to help ourselves to our drink at the end of the counter in the fridge. We asked how big the fries were as we would share them if big. She showed us the bag they came in, didn't seem like much empty. Boy, when we got them, we could have shared 1 bag for 3 people. Fries were tasty, crispy but far too many bits and not enough longer fries. Burger was OK. Fresh and cooked properly with a nice bun that is not too big and overwhelming. It didn't leave me with the feeling that I've got to come here again. Getting the same at several of our other burger places we have tried across the GTA."}
{"text":"Nice burger joint to hit after combing the streets of Toronto. It's a very small place, cash only and the line often bleeds onto the sidewalk. The items are a bit overpriced, but still delicious!   -Bean"}
{"text":"Believed the hype, and went across town. Waited in a long line. Ordered. Paid.  I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't an upscale White Castle burger on cheap bread. Don't get me wrong -- I liked the burger just fine, and it was obvious a lot of love went into it, but after hearing, forever, that this was the best burger I was ever going to have, I was disappointed with what my visit yielded. It's billed as the best burger in the city when in reality, it's not even the best burger in the neighbourhood.   Still, you should go. It's an experience."}
{"text":"One of the best burger's I've ever had in Toronto! Also ordered the fresh cut fries and a milkshake. Everything was amazing and the location was quite small, but cozy. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying \"the priest\" but sadly was let down. The burger, although handmade, was flavorless as well as the option (portobello mushroom filled with cheese and then deep fried). Don't even order the fries."}
{"text":"I went there for the grand opening with some family. Although there was a long line, the wait was minimal. The cheeseburger+bacon was even better than I expected and the fries were very tasty. Another good thing was the washroom was very clean.  UPDATE: I've been to the Queen St W location as well and I can say this one is much faster and it has more payment methods available.   I tried the Californian Classic and loved that just as much, especially the buttered toasted bun."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. Was really hyped to try a burger here for a while, but found it incredibly over priced and a really disappointing meal. Basically the same size as a regular McDonalds burger, dripping grease onto the table, soaking the bun, and missing toppings. Almost $30 for two small burgers and two portions of fries that were bigger than the sandwiches? Sad.  Oh, and cash only."}
{"text":"I once reviewed this place negatively after having a terrible greasy experience twice in a row.  I take it back.  I'm a frequent priester and they are hands down the best burger in city.  Their locations vary though. Bathurst and bloor is the best and Queensway is for sure a close second. Skip Adelaide."}
{"text":"Id come here on a regular basis....if it werent for the crazy prices. BUT it is definitely a place to come once in awhile as the burgers are amazing."}
{"text":"They make a really great burger and pretty good fries too! I like the California burger and fries with gravy, a great combo. Room sometimes too hot though.  My favorite burger joint in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"My favourite burger joint in Toronto. I usually get the Holy Smoke and fries. Never fails."}
{"text":"Finally made the trek to Burger's Priest on my first trip back home.  I was expecting a fast food joint-like place, that is with seating but it's a take out place.  A packed take out place. There are few bar stools along the side but there's a sign, which I didn't notice until I was almost done eating, that's it isn't meant to be an eating area. Whoops.   Anyway, I had the Priest burger and there are supposedly \"secret/off menu\" burgers on their Facebook page which of course, we didn't look up.  So we simply asked the cashier to surprise us with one of them (my friend and I shared this one).    The Priest burger was awesome - you have to love the fried portobello mushroom, so, so good!  The \"off menu\" burger the cashier ordered for us turned out to be their version of the Big Mac.  While better than the original McD's version it didn't have anything really different about it because the fact that they used much better ingredients.  I was hoping to be blown away by a burger I'd never dream of.  Oh well.   Line ups are clearly common here so be ready for that and eating a burger can get a bit messy."}
{"text":"Got the blue cheese burger, thought it'd be better with an extra patty - was wrong. Don't do it, it kills the flavour of any remnants of blue cheese. Bf got the Vatican, he loved it.   Now now, the only difference I feel between all three or however many there are Burger Priest's is that the fries are cut differently from the Beaches' Burger's Priest and all the others.   So, you're a huge fan of your fries and LOVE your fries long instead of stubby because they just taste better long - go to the Beaches. I don't really like going to the other Burger's Priests because of this. They shouldn't be FRIESIST! lol ;)   but ya, overall, burgers are good, huge hype over them. they're great. fries could improve at all locations but the Beaches."}
{"text":"I think I can make a better burger at home.  All the different options on the menu (and on the 'secret' menu) sounded like they were going to give me a heart attack, so I opted for the plain cheeseburger. Maybe I should have wiled out and gotten something more artery clogging (since all the good reviews on here seem to have opted for the Option or something from the 'secret' menu), but I was really in the mood for a plain old fashioned burger.  The patty itself was moist and juicy and cooked perfectly, but it was pretty small considering how much I paid for it. The texture and density of the patty was too light for my liking - it crumbled and fell apart as I ate it. And the cheese was too greasy and  made my burger too oily.  There's virtually no where to sit, so you've got to find a curb or some steps around the place to chow down. Fortunately for me, my manfriend decided to eat at Swiss Chalet across the street so I had a place to sit down and eat AND I bought my fries from there as well since I heard the fries at Burger's Priest are horrible.  I'd come again, but only if I was in the beaches area and if someone else suggested it first and absolutely didn't want to eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Like my mom would say... \"That was an experience\". Probably the best burger in Toronto. Their \"high priest\" burger is basically a copy of the Big Mac. But, it surpasses McD with quality, freshness and ultimate flavour! The wait was WELL WORTH IT!! In one single word: AWESOME."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you're in Toronto. It's a small location but I had heard great things about it and I knew I had to try it while I was here. It lived up to my expectations and I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Where does one start when your absolutely disappointed? First off I would like to warn anyone who likes their burgers cooked to not bother going to this place. My burger as with another customers burger (who was pregnant) had a raw burger ( in the centre) now maybe it was all the joking around the employees were doing and lack of hygiene that caused such a bad experience. I had such great expectations for this place I really really wanted to love this place I honestly did. We tried the milkshakes which were like$4.25? And VERY subpar for a milkshake...now the fries...if you like fry pieces then go here :) next the thing I wanted to love and I tried I even ate the parts that were cooked (fingers crossed) and this was very mediocre. If you want to spend a lot for undercooked,underdressed and not quality burgers. Like I said I wanted to love this place I truly did now all I want is for others to not have to go through what me and my husband did. Oh and FYI the cashier was so rude I should have walked out!"}
{"text":"this is my first written review. I've given some thought to it, and am conceding immediately, that taste is entirely subjective. so perhaps this is an exercise in futility ?  regardless, I just had to spread the gospel of this place.  seriously good burgers !"}
{"text":"I get angry when people talk about this place because then it makes me want to have it... just an amazing place and very unique to the city :)"}
{"text":"If it wasnt for the price and the cash only policy then they would get 5 stars no doubt. I have yet to find a burger in toronto that tastes as delicious as the ones at burgers priest the burgers are sooo juicy and flavourful. The high priest will forever have my heart."}
{"text":"My favourite burger joint in the city, plus they have a location up in the burbs (Vaughan / Woodbridge). Such good burgers and fries, and just the right size to fill you up, without feeling too guilty."}
{"text":"I gotta say...we are BLESSED with good burger joints in the GTA. ;)  After spending the day at The Bluffs, my boyfriend and I decided to check out the original location of The Burger's Priest on Monday evening. This location may be small and only accepts cash, but the service was quick and friendly.  It was my boyfriend's first time visiting The Priest and he decided to check out The Vatican City. Double cheeseburger between grilled cheese buns. Mmm... My boyfriend LOVED it. After his first bite, he was ready to order another one. It was just as greasy as the one I tried at their Mississauga location, but I also found the burger here was juicier.   I didn't think I would find a burger better than The Vatican City, but...Holy Smokes! Double cheeseburger with panko-crusted deep-fried jalapeno peppers? That's what I ordered off the secret menu. If I had to choose, I would give up the grilled cheese buns for the added crunchiness with a spicy kick to the already glorious burger. (Wait...I wonder if I can have the grilled cheese buns AND panko-crusted deep-fried jalapeno peppers...??!?)  No doubt, The Burger's Priest's burgers are guilty pleasures. Big, juicy, greasy goodness...but you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Like a few others, I have heard so many great things about the burgers at The Burger's Priest, but I never got a chance to try it until a couple nights ago (since there's a location in Mississauga now!).  My friend suggested that I go with something new, yet simple...so I chose The Vatican City -- a double cheeseburger between two grilled cheese buns. We shared the burger because we had something to eat earlier at the Yelp Elite event. The double cheeseburger itself is quite filling, never mind adding the two grilled cheese buns. But the grilled cheese buns were the BEST part about this burger. It was delicious! (The buns actually reminded me of Shake Shack, but Shake Shack's buns are SO much fluffier...) I could tell the meat was fresh, 'griddled' to order, and all the toppings were fresh, too. As soon as I took a bite into the burger, I was already planning my next visit. ;)  The only thing is...it was very greasy (cooked on a flat-top griddle), so it can get messy. But who doesn't love greasy goodness every now and then?!  To top it off, my friend and I ordered a chocolate shake and a vanilla shake. Both of us thought the shakes were too sweet (and definitely not comparable to Shake Shack's amazing milkshakes!).   It cost us over $20 for one burger and two shakes, which is a little pricey...but I think the burger itself is worth it, and the customer service was great, too. They also have a secret menu that you can check out on their website.   Unfortunately, my friend and I must accept the fact that we still do not have a Shake Shack in Toronto... Until it crosses the border, The Burger's Priest has become my go-to greasy burger joint in 'sauga!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Kinda greasy. Actually quite greasy.  However it is a little over-priced considering what you are getting. One thing that would probably bring me back there regularly would be more seating. Yeah I get it - don't want to bring the hassle of servers etc but add a few more tables please!"}
{"text":"So I had the opportunity to try Burger Priest last weekend. Let me start by saying expectations were very high, friends and neighbors raved about the burgers. My wife loved them (she was pushing for at least a 4.5 star rating for my review). I found the burgers a little greasy for my liking but very tasty. The fries were REAL fries and done to perfection. My argument is this, if you're paying that much for burgers...than I'm going to Burger Shoppe on Queen St down the road. Good burger joint though."}
{"text":"Heard mixed reviews from friends anout The Burger's Priest so I thought I better check it out for myself. Headed over to the east end and ordered a cheeesburger loaded, my bf ordered the priest and fries. The cheeseburger had a nice soft bun. eco friendly wrapper, the beef was fresh, moist but unfortunately had little flavour. A touch of seasoning would have gone a long way. MY BF'S Priest was delicious and in all honesty if you are going to The Burger's Priest just go straight for the Priest or the Option.  I am basing my review on the bites I had of the Priest, not the cheeseburger...."}
{"text":"Nothing constructive or new to add. Finally got around to trying this place last weekend.  Fries aren't anything to write home about but they aren't bad either. Best burger in this pricepoint in the entire city, handsdown.  Will note that I asked for medium rare and the fellow behind the register told me that's what they cook them to normally (a squeal of excitement erupted inside me from this).  Burger was a medium but was so juicy, moist, and delicious that I forgave it for the minor sin."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat Burger!  We had the hand-cut fries and vanilla milkshake, which tasted both very well! I had a California styled burger which I can highly recommend! My friend had \"the token\" which she didn't liked because of the gravy and it wasn't easy to eat. Furthermore the seating isn't very comfortable, so it's better to takeaway or use the home delivery."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Toronto.  I eat a lot of burgers, and I've eaten at all the places that the Burger's Priest has pictured on the wall, and this place compares admirably.  If you've ever eaten at an In-N-Out then you know how badly you can crave a burger--and The Burger's Priest fills my In-N-Out longing with gusto! I love the crispy outside of the burger and the juicy insides. I can't get enough of these burgers.   I hate the fact that they don't have a sit-down area though. It basically means I can't go in the winter unless I want to eat my burger on the streetcar on my way home (I don't want to). Oh, how I wish they would expand. I dream of it.   This is a burger that needs to be appreciated, enjoyed in a way deserving of the excellence of the burger--and I want to be able to sit down and do that. Impossible at The Burger's Priest since it's always packed. But I still have hope, and faith. ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious burger, delicious fries, definitely a must go if you love burgers. It gets really crowd but the service is fast.  Don't forget to check their secret menu: http://www.theburgerspriest.com/secret-menu/"}
{"text":"Extremely expensive place! The food tasted fine but that does not, in my opinion, justify the price when compared to the quantity of food that they give you. I most definitely do not intend to eat at the burger priest again. Once was more than enough for me."}
{"text":"Was told that it's the closest thing to an In'N'Out burger you're gonna get and though it's an expensive one, it's pretty damn close. Tasty! But there's only 4-5 counter seats so, know that."}
{"text":"Epic Burger, not many extras, just good old fashioned hamburgers. Almost like they are squishing a ball of ground beef on the flat grill, but it's oh so good. The fries are great and the location is full of excitement, all of it around this truly sublime burger experience."}
{"text":"With all the talk on how great Burgers Priest is, I finally got to take the family out to give it a try. We wanted to keep it simple and each ordered the single with cheese...as well as some fries. Upon getting our order, we all dug in.. My first impression was the burger was rather small for the price and really wasn't juicy. Although it tasted ok, I didn't get the wow factor that I did from another burger place west on 7. The fries were good, but seems like our bags were filled with the little pieces. I can't say I will rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I heard some really decent things about burger priest. Since I live in the area my boyfriend and I decided to head over one Friday night.  We arrived and the place was packed! So full we couldn't even enter. But the excitement pushed us to wait!   Once we were in I got a very awkward vibe from who I can only assume is the owner. Instead of making the sardined customers feel more at ease he watched over his staff intently being sure to correct them on their mistakes. Very awkward!  I would have to say the biggest disappointment was taking the food to go.  We decided to each get a cheese burger and share some chilli fries. This was clearly a mistake. The fries were disgusting and had turned into a pile of mush by the time we got home. The burgers were not properly packaged and had fallen apart in the bag. So gross and so disappointing.   If you are not going to supply sufficient seating then think of a better way to take the food to go!  Personally, this place only seems appealing during the summer or to people too drunk to care."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after walking by many times. I'm no burger connoisseur, but there's something about a greasy burger that hits the spot once in a blue moon. I was going to go for the classic cheese burger but after two people in front of me ordered the California Classic, I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. It was delicious. Juicy, greasy and messy...just what I was in the mood for. The fries, on the other hand, were doused in salt. It was as though someone had opened the lid to the salt shaker before the cook sprinkled it on, and the entire container fell out. My lips are still burning from all the salt.  My recommendation: Try the burger, in fact, try the California Classic. Skip the fries."}
{"text":"The burgers here are overall good, nothing fancy. The fries are the thin cut variety. Personally I prefer the thick \"chips\" as we Brits would say,as I think they are tastier and more home made so to speak. As for the patty, I also prefer patties that are seasoned rather than plain but that is a purely personal preference. The price point here is very reasonable as well. I must admit though I still haven't found the amazing burger in TO yet."}
{"text":"Heard lots of good things, and was really excited to give it a try. Went pretty late at night after a concert, so it was fairly empty and service was friendly and fast. Super disappointed in the burger though. Got the chicken burger with creamed corn and gravy (as a combo). Chicken was dry, barely any corn, gravy made the bread soggy. And it was super tiny. Basically the size of a Mcdonald's burger. For $14 I was expecting a little more? They do give you a decent amount of fries, though. From other reviews, maybe I need to try another location. But overall, underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Great burgers, the order came out fast, a bit over priced for the size you get but definitely I will consider coming back. They really should lower the price, I would probably come to this location more often if they do so, over all it's another great spot on the East side for a quick yummy bite on the go."}
{"text":"The high priest burger was quite good. The fries were meh. The seating was meh. Would I go again? Yes. For the burgers."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times already, but this last time I had the Vatican,  which is something like two grilled cheese sandwiches with patties and more cheese in between. It's heavenly. Already had California classic and fiery furnace,  both really great but not as impressive. This place only doesn't get 5 stars because soda is sold in cans and those were never cold enough,  fries are too salty. But it is definetely worth a visit. Or multiple visits."}
{"text":"This is my second time trying this place. If I was to write a review based on my first visit, it would be very different: after that visit, I avoided going back for almost a year.  This time, completely different story. My girlfriend and I decided to give it a try (her first, my second), and I'm glad we did.  From the \"secret\" menu (to be found online), I ordered the \"Red Sea\" and I believe she got the \"Vatican city\" one. This was definitely a much better experience.  The Red Sea burger is a cheeseburger with chili on top. It was very tasty. Cooked to perfection, very well complemented with that savoury chill. The fries we ordered were great: freshly cut, fried to perfection.  Far from being the best burger in town, it certainly is one step above places like \"The Works\" when it comes to flavour."}
{"text":"An unholy disappointment. I came here with high expectations based on recommendations from friends and reviews I'd read. My wife ordered the priest burger, I ordered the high priest and a side of chili cheese fries. Each burger cost about $10. Although my wife enjoyed hers I didn't think mine lived up to the hype. The patties were okay but nothing to write home about. It also didn't help that my burger was lukewarm. Chili cheese fries were also mediocre. Too much cheese and super soggy fries. My advice is that you find another burger temple to worship at."}
{"text":"What I imagine eating a baby tastes like. Unbelievably delicious. Fries were a total let down though... Shouldn't even be on the menu."}
{"text":"The Priest Burger was amazing! The fresh ground meat really makes a huge difference in taste and flavour. The deep fried cheese-stuffed mushroom was so decadent and really put this burger over the top. I'm thankful for the smaller sized burger as eating one oversized and this rich would definitely make me feel extremely guilty.  I'm surprised to read that so many people disliked the fries. I actually loved them and prefer this type of french fry to the super straight and crispy variety. Just add a splash of vinegar and have some ketchup for dipping - YUM!  This place definitely lives up to the hype and despite the lineup and the steep price I will definitely be returning for my burger and fries fix.  If you've never been here before don't expect to actually eat here. This place is extremely tiny and the 5 seats available are apparently not to be used to sit and eat, but to sit and wait for your food only. Also, they only accept cash. There's an ATM in the convenience store next door just in case."}
{"text":"I have to tell myself that I can only have one of their burgers on a special occasion, because it's just not healthy.  Damn delicious, but not healthy.  I stop here when I bike over to my favorite pet supply place and order a double-double. It's either breakfast & lunch or lunch & dinner, depending on the time of day.   Toppings? Pretty much standard, from what I recall (they don't list them on their website). Burger's Priest is about the *burger*. I usually ask for pickle, tomato, mustard on my double-double. And I buy a bottle of water (yah, I hate buying water, but the other drink choices are variants of carbonated or still sugar water).  It's a loose burger. It's a juicy burger. It's a burger that is barely held together by gravitational attraction or covalent bonds, it's not by the meat having been squeezed tightly together.  It's a messy burger. It's a burger that is going to have juices and fats dripping on your hands. Salted enough to taste the salt, but not leave you thirsty for the rest of the day. Yes, you'll need a napkin or two.  It's so delicious that I'm tempted to go there right now and have one.  What prevents it from being 5-star? The bun. It's very soft and thin, and falls apart while eating the burger. It might be satisfactory for a single burger, but I think something with greater density is needed for the double-double and other specialties. That said, I'm still going back. Many times.  I think I've got to order off the secret menu next time."}
{"text":"I don't get what the fuss is about.  Cheeseburger is SMALL... Not worth the over $5 price.    Meat is juicy; probably because it is not lean meat... Nothing else fancy.  Fries are horrible.  Get KFC fries next door."}
{"text":"The burgers are great here. I have been there 3 times, they are my favourite in the city, so this review gets 5 stars.  But, I went there last night, and had a bit of an issue with the way they are running the place. With 3 staff manning the place, I had to wait 20 minutes for my order (3 burgers, 1 fries).   That in itself is not the end of the world, but there was no communication from the staff about the situation. No heads up when you order that there will be an unusual wait, no status updates, and no explanation or apology when you finally get your food.   Your name just gets called and the food is wordlessly handed over. No \"thanks for your business\", \"have a nice day\", \"sorry for the wait\", \"enjoy\", or even, \"say 3 Hail Marys, you have been absolved\".  The other issue is that I am not sure the wait was even necessary -- there were *multiple* 5 minute periods during the wait in which there were no burgers on the grill -- nothing!  It is hard for me to see how it is that hard to coordinate and optimize your workflow when all you serve is burgers and fries. With 3 staff.  Don't let this dissuade you from going. This place is great and I really want them, no NEED them to succeed. A few minor tweaks to the way they run the place, and it would be beyond perfection.  So please, do go."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Burger ever.  Get the bacon double cheeseburger.  It literally and figuratively melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"Have tried a few of their burgers, but the High Priest comes out on top. I'd describe it as a Big Mac copy, but made with quality ingredients. Melts in the mouth and currently my favourite burger in the city. Fries are pretty good too.   Some of the burgers are just extremely greasy (buttered buns, etc) and the secret menu stuff is a bit over the top, but get 4 stars for High Priest alone. (Bacon Double-cheeseburger is great too)  Drawbacks are that there's a little bit of longer wait time for the food and the prices are right at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay for it. The milkshakes are also very small considering the price."}
{"text":"Its the only place in the city I actually go to for burgers ^^ double cheeseburger and they have a lot of options for pop"}
{"text":"Good burgers that melt in your mouth!  Fries are OK... Wouldn't get it again. Too expensive and tasteless. Not sure how fries can be tasteless but they manage to do it.  Store just opened. Long lines but that's a good sign. Will probably go again soon when the lines die down...   Also note that seating is extremely limited. No WiFi."}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is. I was still hungry after paying a lot of money for a burger combo. The burgers are small...I like a lot of meat...and this is not the place to get that for a decent price."}
{"text":"Nice little corner shop with friendly staff. I greatly enjoyed my meal experience here. I had the bulging burger and poutine. The poutine was fantastic and the burger was memorably enjoyable. I'd recommend this burger spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here to get the fried chicken burger and it had wayyy to much gravy on it for me.  However, the burger was so fresh, so hot and so yummy I didn't even care after I drank all night! Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Pros -Their burgers are very tasty, fresh and different.  -meat is seasoned well no frozen or unclean tastes, I'm very finicky about well prepared meats. -the Vatican is a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches Very good. -Their milkshakes are tasty and thick. -prices are ok  Cons Even though I have a few cons they still deserve a high rating. -Not a huge fan of their fries.  -wish they wouldn't skimp on vegetable condiments like their secret sauce, lettuce, pickles, tomato. -it's busy so sometimes dine in area needs cleaning. You are better off taking out. -not exactly healthy eating enjoy as a now and then dinner treat."}
{"text":"\"the burger's priest\". More like \"the burger's seat\" because I'd happily let any of the burgers here sit on my face.   pros: The grease. So much. So good. I usually get the Vatican off the (not so) secret menu: a big old patty sandwiched between two grilled cheeses. #blessed.   cons: Always busy and the square footage of the space is almost non-existent. Especially during lunch/dinner hours. Usually end up getting the burgers to go or, if there are seats, I can rely on walking out with footprint marks AL over my bag or coat or both."}
{"text":"Add grilled cheese buns to any burger for your version of the Vatican!   The burgers are tasty so I get why they're so busy...but I really wish they'd clean up a bit more in the place. The floor is filthy and tables clearly haven't been wiped between customers. Service is generally good - they do mess up orders every once in awhile but are quick to fix. The fries are not bad but I'm not there to eat fries, hehe."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not getting it. Too long lineups, shitty customer service (not bad people, just really inefficient, slow and confused). But the real crime was the overcooked and overgreasy burger on the oil soaked bun. Uggh. The hype is confusing."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Why do people like this place so much?  So the first time I went there I wasn't impressed at all.  I thought may be I missed something so I gave it a second chance recently and it still wasn't blowing me away at all.  Patties were thin, small, and no flavour.  Quality of meat wasn't that great either and not a good meat to bun ratio.  The thing looked like to it was thrown together by a blind guy (no offense to blind people) and the burger would fall apart so easily.  It was difficult to hold and eat.  Cost of the burgers are overly priced.  Oh yea, and they don't take credit card??!!  I hate it when places force you to use cash.  I understand if you're a small mom and pop joint, but when you have 3 places opened across the GTA and you don't take credit card, you're being a tight a$$.  I've been to other places of equal or lesser price which are better AND they take credit cards."}
{"text":"The burgers are in a league of their own but I hate the cash only policy as well as the limited seating options."}
{"text":"So this review is less about the food and more about the operation of the place.  When I got up to the front of the line to order I was told they don't take any type of digital payment.  Credit card or debit - and the cashier pointed to an ATM behind the line.  They must make good money off the transaction fees from the ATM because while I was in line I heard her telling the same thing to 4 other people, who all went went to take put cash.  As a business owner I understand not taking credit cards because visa and MasterCard are demanding high percentages of the total sales.  Debit cards however are a per transaction basis, .25-.40 each.  Even if they don't want to eat the transaction fee, they should have the machine available and simply charge the fee to the customer.    I won't go back to this place simply because of their business shortsightedness, the transaction fee I got dinged by the ATM was extremely annoying and the fact there were no cash only signs on the door or the window was icing on the cake.    To the owners:  become more informed before making decisions like cash only.  Unless...you know exactly what you are doing and the ATM is just a money making scheme.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is disgusting. And I am not just talking about the food. Everything. First off, disgustingly greasy. Took one bite, and a waterfall of butter and grease poured out of my burger. Couldnt do it. I ate the fries - decent but nothing special. Got up to get napkins. No where to be found. Had to ask for napkins?! They are too cheap to have napkins readily available? Its definetly not for environmental reasons as this place doesnt even have recycle bins. When I asked if there was a recycling bin for our cans, she instructed me to throw then in the garbage.   Anyhow, went back to my seat - actually I think it was a foot stool - to watch my friend struggle through his burger. He ate half and tossed it too. Why do people eat this crap? I wasnt expecting to eat healthy, or even clean for that matter - but this is next level raunchy. Everything from the food, seating and service was just dumb. Worst $25 spent in my life. Big Smoke Burger is way better. The look of the restaurants, the food, the service - way better. Even Macdonalds is nicer.  We went to try it because I know someone who was talking about it the other day. Now we realize - that person just likes to hear themself talk.   Shockingly disgusting. Dont fall for the hype. When its over, you will feel gross and wish you hadn't"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the cashier messed up what we ordered pretty badly, but by the time we realized it we had gone home.  The burger itself was very tasty, but not worth driving across town to eat in your car tasty.    If you do head all the way out there, or are lucky enough to live in the area, make sure to get the Vatican.  The bun is a grilled cheese sandwich, and it makes it happen!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger joint in the city!    Burgers are so fresh and cooked to perfection. Would recommend calling ahead to order for pick up."}
{"text":"Burgers Priest seems to be Toronto's version of Shake Shack, where \"the priest\" is their version of the delicious Shack Stack. Unfortunately, that is my favorite burger in the world all I could think of was BP just didn't measure up. Missing some flavour and butteryness in the meat, and the cheese was lacking.   Probably deserves a better rating, because it was good in its own right, but life isn't fair. Also, why even put seats in here, its tiny! I'd rather standing tables only, and not sit in the corner looking at the wall."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Cooked on a flat top by some very passionate people. Low gluten buns are available are good but still cause a reaction for this glutard. I wish the fries were better. Thinner, crispier and maybe serve fewer? The bag o'fries is way too much of an okay thing."}
{"text":"I've never ordered anything fancy- just always the hamburger, but its always made order fresh and moist. Its LITERALLY like a drug I can't enough of, and you pay for it with a full stomach and a light wallet at the end.   For the gentlemen who come here, or ladies with a larger appetite I suggest getting 2 patties bc one will not be enough.  But really, it's the gluten free bun, that keeps me coming back, (they call it the \"low gluten bun\" bc they can't 100% guarantee..bless their hearts). It's the only place in Toronto where the gluten free option actually taste like fluffy white wonder bread."}
{"text":"I got the preist.  The meet was juicy, cooked perfectly.  Above average burgers!"}
{"text":"I finally made my way to the Burger's Priest and was not disappointed! We came on a hot Monday evening, so it wasn't crazy busy, although there was a constant line the entire time we were there. The place is tiny, and there are only about 6 stools, so most people ordered the burgers to go. Be warned, they don't have AC so it gets extremely hot inside.  I decided to go with the High Priest on their \"secret\" menu, which is their take on the Big Mac. It tasted pretty damn close to a Big Mac, but so much better! The patties were juicy and the burger was packed full of flavour. My only complaint was that the bun didn't really hold up too well, but that's just being nit-picky. Amazing, amazing burger!  My boyfriend ordered the Priest, which was the \"option\" (fried mushroom stuffed with cheese) + cheeseburger. Again, another ridiculous burger! The combination of the deliciously juicy patty with the fried and stuffed mushroom just blew my mind. Another huge hit!   We also ordered a side of fries, which was a bit of a disappointment. They weren't very crispy and were just meh. Wouldn't recommend them. But since they make such amazing burgers, all is forgiven. Keep in mind the burgers are a little on the pricey side (I think they were each around $10), but totally worth the price and the trek."}
{"text":"Best burgers out there at the moment. It's just that simple."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended me this place because he is completely addicted. I have to say that the hamburgers are actually really taste. I love texture of the meat and its juiciness (Some people complain about this but I love it).  They only accept cash which in my opinion is completely stupid and it caught me off guard so I had to use their ATM which you have to pay a $2 fee or something (You won't go broke because of this but anyway) who doesn't take credit/debit cards?   The place is really small and uncomfortable when full (And it's full almost all the time) so you usually have to make a long line because they only have 1 cashier.  No outdoor seating.  I ordered the biggest burger they had (Double meat, all the veggies, etc) and it's actually pretty small for the price).  Overall, I did like the food but there are so many things that could be improved that I felt the need to drop a couple of stars.  Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Meh... After hearing such great things about this place I finally decided to give it a try. I had the \"holy smokes\" off the secret menu. A double cheese burger with Panko fried jalapeños. I was looking forward to some heat, but it was MIA. At one point I wondered if my burger had any jalapeños at all... It was a good, messy burger... Will this make me a convert? Not likely..."}
{"text":"Skip the fries.Dry and crispy!.Expensive for small hamburger(juicy-plain meat).Chairs doesnt have backrest!lots of stooltype chairs made it look messy.No booth.Small tables uncomfortable to stay n eat.McD has better seating!Chili burger ok.Menu over cash makes it easy to read.Loud inside to hear your name/# being called.Not sure if I'll return.Website is plain.No delivery offered!Why have it offered on website.Secret sauce..what's that about?Fast food with expensive prices like a sit down restaurant but no where to sit(uncomfortable).Drinks were just regular pop can didnt try the shakes."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers and fries $39! Ask for chilli cheese fries was given regular fries, and the wrong toppings on the burgers... Realizing this after I got home is very very annoying... Especially since paid over $43 with the tip, phoned and was told I hadn't been charged for them..."}
{"text":"Whoever dares give Burger's Priest only 4 stars is a fucking moron! It's a 5 star burger; it's a 5 star joint. The best of its kind! Like, are you kidding me!?!? Go fuck yourselves. Traitors!! Also, come to my show on August 14th - https://www.facebook.com/events/478514018991675/"}
{"text":"Too expensive. Too loud.  Always dirty. Over rated.  Cash only. No alcohol. So many ppl line up mean while there are so many other burger joints with fresh meat !"}
{"text":"This is THE very best burger i have ever had. I have been going here for about a year... i tell every one of my friends and family members about it.. it is just the best.   check out their secret menu if you haven't yet"}
{"text":"The best in town! Happy they have expanded to other areas of Toronto and to Edmonton! When I think delicious burgers, I think of burger priest.  Thanks for all the tasty burgers! Keep up the hard work!"}
{"text":"I ordered the double cheeseburger, chili cheese fries, and a cherry Dr Pepper.   The burger was absolutely delicious, not dry at all, and cooked perfectly. Simply put, this is the best burger I've had in a long time, after trying many burger places far and wide. The chili on the fries had just the right amount of heat, and I will consider ordering a chili burger next time. My wife is a fry expert and she concurred with me that the fries were excellent.   The prices are a tad high, but they emphasize quality so I don't mind paying the premium.   I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The bun has Wonderbread texture.  The cheese is processed.  I liked the patty but overall I'm not sure I could tell the difference between this and McDonald's."}
{"text":"Overpriced. After eating High Priest (2 beef patties) and a drink, I paid about $15. I was still hungry. Never Again."}
{"text":"Being a self proclaimed burger aficionado, I had high expectations when coming to Burger's Priest. I ordered the double cheeseburger and fries. The fries were great, but the burger was just lacklustre. Some of the great things about the burger are: the meat is ground fresh everyday, and the patty is extremely tender and just melts in your mouth. However, I found the meat to be bland and under seasoned. It could have done with a heavy sprinkling of salt. If I was asked if I would eat here again, I would say probably not. I would much rather go to Holy Chuck for their great and flavourful burgers!"}
{"text":"The burger was good but I felt like garbage the rest of the night after I ate it. Way too greasy despite how yummy it was while I ate it."}
{"text":"Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? HELL YES. I always order the Vatican and a black and white shake and I'm never disappointed. They play awesome music, the staff are super friendly, and you can't get food like this anywhere else in the city. One of my favourite indulgences."}
{"text":"The Burger's Priest is one of the best burgers I've ever had.  I only wish I got the double :(   The cheeseburger was a good size, but I felt like I might have needed another.  (I am a big eater!)   They serve their burger with a smaller bun, so you're not eating \"filler\" and can actually taste the meat.  Skip the chili fries, they're not worth the stomach space.  Definitely will be going back here again and trying something off the secret menu.  I don't know what's on it, but I hope one of the burgers has a fried egg!!!"}
{"text":"In short, this is overpriced, glorified McD's.  For over $10 I had the burger, fries and grape crush (points for carrying my childhood fave soda!).  While the patty itself is relatively tasty despite the copious amounts of grease that ooze out with each bite, it's so incredibly small, has the World's Plainest Bun, and only the most basic of toppings.  Their fries are tasty and plentiful.  Without the fries, I'd be starving.  Absolutely nothing remarkable about this burger and it amazes me how people consistently bow down to this place.    So, I went there again several months later, after reading the burger edition of The Grid.   But alas, I felt no different.  Also, because it's only a takeaway joint, by the time I get it to my BFF's (who lives less than a 10minute walk away), the grease from the patty has begun to sink into the bun.  And I don't like me a soggy bun.    There are definitely waaaaaay better burger joints in this town."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. Get the California Classic, it's great. A little cramped inside, though."}
{"text":"I wish there was a sixth star. theres plenty writtien about the food, and the secret menu items, so i thought i would talk about the after effects of my first time.   I finished the double cheese Vatican City, barely, and sat on the park bench, staring blankly into the abyss of the lake. for 15 mins, just trying to get over what just happened. I know now why they picked the name, as the cult of burgers has a new leader."}
{"text":"It seems like the Queen West location is still working out the bugs. Yesterday it took almost 20 minutes from when I paid my money until I got my single cheese burger and the place was not that crowded. I've been a big fan of the uptown location for a long time but this isn't nearly as efficient... yet."}
{"text":"Burgers were great though small in size. I'm sure they packed enough calories in there to last you a whole day.  They sell combos quite expensively and the fries were too tiny to grab and didn't taste good either."}
{"text":"Came here to see what the hype was about. The diners combined with music was a little too loud for us so I got our order to go.  For one bacon double cheeseburger and one double California combo the total was $27. If I pay that much I expect to get my money's worth.  To start the fries were soggy. They were made fresh right in front of me so I guess its just the style. I did not care for them.  My California double was falling apart and covered in grease. As I ate it fell apart even more. My friend complained of the same problem with her bacon double cheeseburger.  After finishing it I was still hungry. This may just be a fat person problem, but if I drop that much on a burger I want to be full.  The staff were friendly and quick. No complaints there.  Overall I've had better burgers in Toronto for less."}
{"text":"American-style burger, in the Shake Shack or Corner Bistro idiom (think backyard bbq, homemade patties, processed cheese, soft white bun).   Nothin' fancy, nothin' high falootin', a great ole' burger. Not too big, not too small.  I paid about 8 bucks for a bacon cheeseburger and a pop. No room inside so I ate it in the car and life was good."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian. Amazing. Hubby had the cheeseburger. It was alright. Had better before but still decent. Small place. Not much room to sit down. Expect take out. Did not have the fries. Cannot comment. Overall a good place to grab a quick lunch to go."}
{"text":"Its a good burger but way too small... average joe will need two for sure! even if you get the priest. I finished mine in three bites! Thank god for the fries or else i would have been hungry!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. Two combos rang in at $30. They were good but not quite $30 good. Every table was dirty and there was food and garbage strewn across the floor. The cashier who had been seated most of the time that we were there actually got up and walked to the cafe area not to clean but to pick up a spray bottle of cleaner off a table which was covered in goop. Didn't clean it. Took it back behind the counter and resumed her seated position, staring at her nails."}
{"text":"I'm hooked! Finally...a burger that taste like fresh beef! The buns are perfect! Incredibly delicious! I'm at the beginning stages of becoming a regular! Definitely my go to burger spot! ********** 10 Stars!"}
{"text":"Other veggie burgers should cower in the face of The Option, a stupidly unhealthy concoction of cheese and portobello that is breaded and deep fried. Yes, it is just as crazy delicious as it sounds. While I was aware of the \"secret\" online menu, which has a bacon-topped version called \"the religious hypocrite\", I just couldn't punish my body that much.  The early lunch rush wait wasn't too bad--maybe 15 minutes in total--but seating was practically non-existent, and the line was hanging out the door by the time we left.  The religious schtick is mildly creepy but ... did I mention the deep fried portobello on a bun?"}
{"text":"First off let me say I'm huge fan of burgers. Perhaps one of the great inventions of the modern world. For me burgs break off into two categories: gourmet and fast food. This burger belongs to the later.   Don't go here expecting to get some sort of gamy tasting super crispy hundred percent all beef burger that's not what this place is about.  This place is competing with McDonald's and Burger King and licks and five guys.   If you get a hamburger here you got to get the high priest that's the one everybody talks about it's the best burger they have.  It's a soft bun, soft patties, basically it's a better tasting Bigmac.  That being said amongst its peers I'd rather be at five guys. There's a lot of hype to an otherwise average product. And it's a lot more expensive pound for pound.  It was $16 for a double patty burger with a drink in fries which is insane."}
{"text":"Waited about 20 minutes in line on opening day and I decided to get 2 burgers since I haven't been to the Queen St. East location in a year. I ordered the high priest and the Vatican. I was pleasantly surprised as the burgers didn't turn out as greasy as I remembered them to be at the Queen St. East location, but they were still sooooo delicious. I inhaled them in just a few minutes.   Seating - Where did they get those miniature tables? Nevertheless, there is enough seating for about 17-20 people so you can enjoy your meaty goodness immediately.   So happy they are now just around the corner from where I live! Such a better alternative to McDonald's, Hero Burger (which is crap btw), A&W, and dare I say, Banh Mi Boys...  Burger's Priest - Welcome to the neighborhood, and god bless!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their Fresh Tasting French fries. The Mint Chocolate Shake was delicious too! The burgers are good. I had a veggie burger with a portobello mushroom wedged inside a mozzarella patty. Its unique and delicious, but I just wonder why is it that every time I order this, the mushroom inside the cheese is cold?  But the cheese is melted.  Would be best if they were all warm, in my opinion.  I've ordered this twice now, and both times the mushroom was cold ... Regardless, the burgers here are still delicious and original! And friendly service, with staff speaking to you through the confessional-box-type windows.  Happy to see Burgers Priest in Downtown Toronto, Vaughn and Port Credit too, and great that its open on Sundays now on Queensway!!!  Wish they were open past 10pm though... On another note, Be sure to read the writing on the walls of the restaurant!  Also, be sure to bring at least $15-20 per person as it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"went once never going back, NO ONE WAS WEARING HAIR NETS OR GLOVES, OR WASHED THERE HANDS  there wearing winter hats and baseball caps,  while cooking my food in front of me. toronto public health should pay they a visit.  there burgers are over rated and not worth 10 cents if u ask me. 6 bucks for a single burger and I'm still hungry.  8 and change for a double. very small sizes burgers. not worth the money or time or even anything in my opinion. i have had much better from my own house. ordered 2 singles and 1 double 1 thing of fries 26 bucks with tax yikes. they where cooked quite fast i will say though  . mind you there was not one there.but not worth all the hype that they are made out to be. not going back."}
{"text":"Its takeout dont expect to be able to sit in a quiet spot. This place is too popular for its size!! Regular line ups are the norm. The burger is the star and i ordered the california classic. The only negative thing i have to say about the bugers are you have to special order your favourite toppings if they arent on the menu. Such as onions and ketchup etc. No matter, because this place delivers on its promise of a great burger. Im already planning my next trip and ordering a priest with option. It sounds delicious!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burger place in Toronto! The priest burger is amazing. So much oozy cheese, delicious! The burgers look deceiving small but really fill you up. I tried the red sea which was pretty good but the chili does make the bottom bun soggy so definitely eat it in the restaurant if possible."}
{"text":"Burger was pretty good, but the bacon was too salty and the fries were too salty. They also mixed up our order.Overall, it was a nice little place to have a burger on Wednesday night!"}
{"text":"i have seen god, and it came in the form of a delicious cheeseburger from the burger priest, a newish burger shop in leslievile.   toronto is saturated with gourmet burger restaurants. i've tried many of them including craft burger, gourmet burger co., w burger bar and the burgershoppe and the burger priest stands out as it fits into its own category. their burgers are not fussy, they offer very standard toppings and can be considered gourmet in a sense that they use high quality beef which they grind in house a few times a day.  the menu is small. they offer single hamburgers/cheeseburgers (4 oz. patty) as well as a double double (two 4 oz patties and cheese), the option, a vegetarian artery-clogger made up of two portobello mushrooms filled with cheese then battered and deep fried, and the priest which is the option paired with a cheeseburger on one bun. they also serve fries which i didn't try but have heard are very good (something to do with the double-fry technique.  i decided on the double double ($7.99) with lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, mayo and pickles. the patties are loose formed balls which are then fried on a flattop grill. the consistency of the burger meat reminded me a lot of shake shack's burgers and i have read that many find them similar to in-n-out burger. i found it incredibly delicious, juicy to the point that the meat just falls apart between the bun. the bun is your standard grocery store bun which i feel compliments the burger well as it doesn't take away for the tasty meat. toppings are applied sparsely which lets the burger shine. simply a perfect burger."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $9 for a greasy ball of fat with maybe 1/4 of meat then this is the place to go. Fries (another $4) and pop not included. Just spent $45 on three burgers and 2 fries. So disappointed. The California burger bun is drenched in oil and looks like a mini burger not stretching the size of my palm. They have no plates, no condiments and serve everything in miniature brown paper bags...complete mess and had to wait in line just to get ONE more napkin. This place is \"X\" ed for me - not coming back."}
{"text":"In a word: small! My burger was fantastic: taste, toppings/freshness, but I wanted more. I ordered a single but felt like I needed a magnifying glass to see the beef patty. Perhaps I should have ordered a double? As far as singles go, much smaller than a single from South Street, Big Smoke, or Gangster Burger on Queen St., or the legendary Apache Burgers on Dundas St. One other point, if I'm paying 9 bucks for a burger I'd really like a choice of buns, something other than generic plain white bread."}
{"text":"On a weekend trip to Toronto, we stopped here. This place is now in my burger hall of fame. Literally one of the freshest, tastiest burgers I've ever eaten. Don't listen to those who say it's \"expensive\", they likely work for the competition. This was wonderful, from the friendliest staff to the MOST DELICIOUS FRIES ever. Small, but people move through quickly, so get a little \"New York\" with it, and pounce on that open seat! You cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Hallelujah!  Best burger in Toronto.  The genius is in the simplicity.   If you want saffron scented kobe beef with garlic aoli and frise on a spelt ciabatta...... don't go here.    If you want a real, back to basics, fresh ingredients, beautifully griddled, old school burger:  GO HERE!    The comparison to In-N-Out is fair, but Burger's Priest is a small run operation that has much fresher, better ingredients, seasoning, and service.  They grind their own beef and griddle it to perfection.  When I'm in Toronto I don't crave In-N-Out, but when I'm in California I crave The Burger's Priest!  The cheese burger is heaven.  The double double is a devilish delight.  I'm dying to try The Option, but I'm so in love with the beef I have to have it.    Be warned:  Most walk-in closets are bigger than the space they have for customers.  I have sat at one of the four stools every time I'm there, because I can't wait to put the burger in my mouth.  But maybe would be better option to take out, especially if you have more than two people.    Also be warned:  These guys are not afraid to make it greasy = delicious."}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't like slap burgers, but I found my burger to be the mushiest,  greasiest thing imaginable.  Honestly, it was as mushy as a big Mac. Not for me."}
{"text":"34 min wait time from order to burgers in hand. Watched two customers get refunded whilst waiting, as their orders had been 'forgotten' (imagine that wait time!)  No seating available so we walked home with our our burgers, only to find someone else's.  Major bummer when you pay close to $30 for a couple burgers. Other locations have been super reliable, and my partner loves their food. But this is my second time around and I think I will stick to something else from now one."}
{"text":"Love their cheeseburgers. You won't get seating though if you go during lunch or dinner. Have usehurrier.com deliver or just get takeout.   Order from the secret menu!"}
{"text":"Shared a Vatican with my gf and it was heavenly.  I don't understand how the people working there aren't 500 lbs each.  Somehow they run the AC so cold that the place stays cool despite the super hot grill and sweaty men running around in the back slinging meat.  Likes: Best burger in T.O. Dislike: Not too much seating. We hung around a bit to get a seat rather than eat outside when it was super hot out there."}
{"text":"A great burger. We opted for the Priest burger as it has the cheese stuffed portabello mushroom cap on top of the burger. Fries were decent and it was quick. Highly recommended over other burger places that have popped up nearby."}
{"text":"Absolute over hyped, WAY WAY WAY overpriced garbage. The burger was small the frish were greasy s*it with a taste of burnt grease AND 2 small combos ran ya $30. I was actually mad and felt ripped off. So if you want to be an idiot and follow other wankers....get on your trendy hipster outfit, whip out your iPhone and stand in line with the other total losers, perusing their \"secret menu\" on line, which is even more full of over hyped over priced slop...or better yet....dont go. Its a trendy hipster hangout and should collapse this winter when the traffic dies down."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger I've had in Toronto and that's all she wrote!  Definitely give this place a try if you are a burger connoisseur. I always get the high priest, those grilled cheese Sammie's on the top and bottom are everything! You won't be disappointed.   The only things I don't like is the hefty price and the menu. I wish their was more variety. Other than that its great.   Their home made cookies are also very tasty! Check them out if you crave sweets like I do after a greasy meal ;)"}
{"text":"delicious.   basically, it's an upscale McDonalds. no fancy gourmet toppings - you get processed cheese slices and white buns. but man oh man, the burgers are TASTY.  know what you want before you go in - it's a tiny place and there's no time to stand around trying to decide what you want. it's a take-out spot, nowhere to sit, no bathrooms. you've been warned.  i've paid much more money for burgers around the city, but these guys have the patty down to a science. it is juicy and tasty and falls apart in your mouth. and if you're really a burger fan, you know a burger doesn't need fancy-ass toppings if the meat is good quality.   please, other burger joints - you can keep your blue cheese, pineapple rings, crab meat, lobster rolls, and all that other shite. all those things do is take away from the essence of the burger (and really, they just work to cover up a less-than-decent patty). i'll take a basic burger from The Burger's Priest ANY DAY :)"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place based on all the hype it received. Decent burger but mucho expensive. Tastes like an inn n out burger."}
{"text":"Go early as they get busy.  Like super line up out the door busy.  Still, it is worth it.  The burgers are simple but they are delicious.  I would advise going with a double or more.  The single patty was a bit small (but reasonable for the price.)"}
{"text":"This remains the best burger I have ever had anywhere I've ever been. Go for items on their secret menu - delish."}
{"text":"I did not liked fries smell weird . The burger had weird taste i smell the beef  disgusting .  I found hair in my burger . Slow service ."}
{"text":"FOOD: Priest burger: this is a cheeseburger with the \"option\" (portabello mushrooms stuffed with cheese)   I LOVED IT! I loved the portabello mushroom, it was veryy cheesy. Each bite was filled with melted cheese. I will probably order this burger again .    Double cheeseburger: Although this is more meaty than the \"priest\" burger, I still prefer the priest burger since I really liked the portabello mushroom.   Overall: I think both burgers were good , it depends on each individual preference. I absolutely loved the \"priest\" burger that is loaded with cheese. However, my friend thought it was just too much cheese and it took away the meaty taste of the meat patty."}
{"text":"Terrible. Got 2 burgers with fries and milkshakes for $38. Definitely not worth the price.  Burger: decent but was way too small for the price. Also the buns on my burger consisted of two tops, and one was upside down. Where as my partner's were a normal bun.  Fries: the longest fry was about 1 inch, most weren't even half that. We got 2 sides of fries and both servings were like that.  Milkshakes: probably the only good thing we got, although for $5 they were very small, only 16oz.  I'm not sure if the fries and burger are always served so poorly, but if they weren't blasting music so loud that you can't even talk then maybe they'd have better quality control.  All in all for the price of our meal there are far better (and cheaper) options to go too in the \"gourmet\" burger category."}
{"text":"I saw this place a couple of months ago, and before walking in, I decided to yelp it. There weren't any reviews of this place then, and over the last two months I have seen the rapid rise in popularity of this tiny hole in the wall place.  After 3 visits, and having tried everything on their menu, I guess I am now well qualified to review these guys.   I tried the basic cheeseburger first, and fell in love with this place immediately. The beef is definitely fresh ground, and if you ask for a medium rare burger, you get exactly that. (which doesn't happen at most burger joints). The \"Double Double\" is the same as the cheeseburger, but with double meat and double cheese(duh!). For vegetarians, they do not have a regular veggie burger or soy burger. Instead, they have a very interesting creation of their own -  two portobello mushrooms with cheese between them, covered in bread crumbs and fried. It is drenched in oil, but who counts calories while visiting a burger place? Perhaps the best burger they have is \"the Priest\". For $9.99, it is slightly on the expensive side, but it is worth a try. It basically contains both the beef patty as well as the fried portobello thing .   They are pretty basic in their topping choices.They just have lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, ketchup, mustard and mayo. For a buck extra, you can get fried onions and bacon.  A larger list of toppings would have definitely earned them a 5 star rating from me.  The fries aren't special, but there isn't anything to complain about either. The buns and patties are also on the smaller side.  The place is really small and not more than 5 or 6 people can fit in. There is a pew outside, but I think the best option is to just walk down to the beach with your grub. The owner and the young guy taking orders are really friendly, and are always willing to talk about their burgers.  Overall, The Burger's Priest is definitely one of the best burger joints in Toronto, and I am going to be their fan for a long long time."}
{"text":"My brother-in-law raved, so I went to check it out.   Up the stairs and to the alter, I was halted by a menu that seemed simpler at first glance than it turned out to be. Nothing is in categories, all entries/types of food are given equal entry space, carved with chalk. I stood for a while in the middle of the room figuring it out. I was aiming for a burger that would give me the best \"burger's priest worthy experience\".  The guy at the cash was SUPER friendly. I was moved to the point of increasing my own friendliness to lessen the gap. It had been a long day :P  What else can I say besides it was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten ever? I have tasted similar styles, but no one has taken it to this level.   I not only recommend hitting up the closest burger's priest within the week, I also challenge you not to return shortly thereafter. :)"}
{"text":"My good friend Stadds recommended this burger joint. He told me they were the best and so clearly my expectation going in were pretty high  This is a new location so it's extremely clean, but you can tell that they keep it immaculate. Bright lighting an upbeat atmosphere. It was a little on the loud side though.   I ordered a classic cheeseburger with bacon and a chilli cheese fry as the side.   Amazing! And I mean AMAZING. The soft bun is great, the burger meat is fantastic because it's fresh ground beef, and it's spiced perfectly.   There are a lot of \"good\" burgers in Toronto, but this is by far the best. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I bought \"the option\" burger, which is panko-crusted portobello mushroom stuff for cheese on a bunch. The level of magnificence of this burger is beyond measure. Sooo good, that it would be a crime to eat it everyday. My toppings were ketchup, mayo, tomato and lettuce. You could get just about anything on this burger and it would still taste awesome."}
{"text":"I'll make this one quick. Amazing burgers. No questioning. I wish there was setting. Also, they are a bit pricey. But it is quality, so I say it's worth it. I've tried most of the burgers and all are great (some a bit too crazy to eat on a regular). With burger joints being a dime a dozen in this city, I welcome this one with open arms."}
{"text":"Ordered the Four horsemen burger today.  It was so big I had to use forks and knife to eat it. Service is a bit slow during lunch hours. Over all same as the other locations."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD - I have found the best burger in Toronto and it's at this place. The Toronto Star was right, and I'm glad I tried this place. The burgers are smaller than the normal supersized bun but it's so good. I can't even explain it - you have to try it for yourself, and take a friend. Note there isn't much seating, so you may have to stand outside the shop and eat, but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Ive heard so many good things about this place. I figured out that there was 1 near my work place so I went to give it a try. The freshness and quality is amazing, but the 2 things that I wasnt happy about were, the price and size of burger. I got the priest and it costed 12 dollars! If it was bigger then I wouldnt mind the price. Overall not worth the price for what you get."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! My favourite burgers in the city! Take out only! Usually 30 mins wait! I can eat two if I am hungry! Veggie option available. $"}
{"text":"Over 5 visits  It's sad that I have to give this great little burger place 4/5 because they have VERY limited seating (6 to be exact). I do hope they expand soon!!! and continue the great success.  Searching for the best burger in town is not the eaiest task. So many pop up and so many different taste buds.  One thing when you're searching for the best burger, make sure you are doing a fair review. Comparing a flat top & flame grilled burger is truely unfiar. Both bring different flavours.  Burger's Priest cooks they freshly ground burgers on a flat top. Cooked to perfection with chared outter shell incasing the light pink juicy center. Fresh bread and ingredients is how this is a TNJ (top notch joint)  The Priest Burger is where it's at, Their cheeseburger with the stuffed deep fried portabello mushroom. My mouth tingles thinking about their burgers. haha  One day I will muster up the courage to order \"The Vatican\" their secret menu of the double cheeseburger incased with two grilled cheese.  This is a must try for all you meat eating burger lovers!! =P  see you all on the flip side"}
{"text":"I was never a 'burger person'.  My entire life, I have yet to sink my teeth into a Big Mac, and have no plans to anytime soon. Enter pregnancy, and suddenly I had a craving for burgers like my life depended on it!  I tried a few places, and the craving was never satisfied...until I went to The Priest...ooooh, that's why we love burgers!  My son is now 10mths, and I still get weekly cravings and am a fan on your FB page, how crazy is that!? I've had the Option as I'm a sucker for anything with goats cheese, but overall, I stay simple with the good 'ol Cheeseburger and the fries rock! No surprise, the line ups get insane, and you guys seem to be out growing your space already...perhaps you'll open another further into the main Queen/Beach drag...I'll continue to follow.  :)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am not a burger person.. However, I am in love with burgers priest. I don't live close to it but after I first discovered it I went three times that week! The burgers have a salty, juicy and flavorable taste and the buns are soft yet crispy. They have the best chocolate milkshakes and amazing fries too! However, the portion sizes are quite small (except for the fries - good to share for 3) I get full quite quickly but I can finish a burger and some fries and still be hungry. The milkshakes are expensive and are on the smaller size. I do enjoy them a lot but the prices are just so high. Also, don't go in expecting to get a seat because the majority of the time I end up eating it in my car or outside. But overall, amazing food - just high prices."}
{"text":"As a not-so-big fan of burgers, this place give me an alternative view on Burgers from a different angle. I like the fact that the staffs are putting a lot of efforts to keep the kitchen clean. The high priest from the menu tastes awesome. One thing i have to put a compliment here is their fries. The fries are well prepared into small pieces. And they are sort of deep fried, which make them really crispy and crunchy."}
{"text":"Four horseman of the Apocaplyse or go home.   Expensive burgers. Some may say theyre small. But unless you eat the four horseman of the Apcalypse ($20.00 but hella worth it.)or a vatican city then it aint worth your time. Good day good people"}
{"text":"Had Burger Priest last week.   Was my first time at this location and first time at Burger Priest in general and have to say, will be back soon!   Decor inisde was cool and unique. Did not wait long for food.  Burger was amazing and the price is right. Only downside is if you order a combo, combo costs an extra $4.79.   Will be bringing my friends soon and recommending to others."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese sandwiches as the bun?! You can't beat that! Burger Priest has the best burgers in Toronto! This is my go to spot during my offseason. Everything about the Vatican burger just makes you want to keep coming back for another one. Fries are double fried, served crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Pretty much everything on the menu looks appetizing but I'm gonna stick to the Vatican burger! Burger was extremely juicy and held it's great tasting flavor from the first, to the very last bite."}
{"text":"I honestly wasn't that impressed by the burger; for the price I was expecting something bigger. The fact that they forgot to include bacon didn't help the situation either (I only realized halfway through).   The store isn't well designed, with many people standing up and waiting for their burgers (of course it is possible to sit down)."}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype. The burgers are OK, had the high priest, but it almost tasted like a McDonald's burger (only with fresh meat). My meat was a bit overcooked.  Fries are nothing special.  For the cost and length of wait, I think I'd skip it next time."}
{"text":"I had the Vatican burger with fries and gravy.  The Vatican was so good, that was a 5! It was an excellent greasy mess choice for a Friday lunch.   The fries were tasty but the gravy was not.  The gravy tasted like powdered gravy which I expect more of a burger joint.  Otherwise the burgers are cooked nicely here."}
{"text":"222 reviews. Does the Burger Priest need another? I finally got to try the burgers at the Priest today. I live in the neighbourhood and have never had a chance to try it out. I had the double cheeseburger. Pretty tasty for 9 dollars. Yes. 9 dollars!!!!. As tasty as it was the price point will scare me off from returning on a regular basis. Doesn't seem to really matter as this place is hopping with lineups out the door. Please note that the nine bucks didn't factor in drinks or fries hence why I only had the burger. Double cheese burger is average size too. Only have the standard 5-7 toppings available to coat your burger (e.g. Mustard, Ketchup, Pickles, Mayo, Tomatoes, Onions). Have to say with Harvey's across the street not sure I can afford the luxury of the Burger's Priest"}
{"text":"If your looking for a great tasting burger at an affordable price this is the place.  Tastes very similar to In n Out Burger out West.  This is not fancy but does provide enough seating.  Food is prepared and made fresh."}
{"text":"This was the best burger I've ever had. Amen.   Read more: http://staydine.com/1dl9hq5"}
{"text":"Burger's priest, you are as amazing as everyone says. I'll admit that I've only seen you from the outside, but one of your delicious burgers was delivered to me at home this evening and it was amazing. Truly amazing. I had a double cheeseburger. The patty was moist, soft and rich in all the right ways. It was perfectly pink in the middle. The cheese was just melted enough. Seriously. I've had some really fancy burgers but this is the best one I can recall.   Bonus points for putting it on a gluten-free bun. That was such an unexpected treat - it made my night and won my loyalty.  My only question, burger's priest, is why you chose to accompany this luscious burger with fries that are only acceptable. I mean, as vessels for ketchup, salt, and hot sauce go, they were fine. But you could do so much better than that.  Update: it's now two full days later and I am still thinking about how that burger felt in my mouth. Seriously. It's that amazing."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what everyone's raving about but the food speaks for itself, burger was dry and the topping selection in my fridge has more variety then this place! Overpriced, dirty seating area gives them 1 star in my books"}
{"text":"Although some people may consider the burgers filling, they make one of the best hamburgers in Toronto. Not mention the great fries"}
{"text":"Ordered the fiery something..chicken burger. It was literally a 2bite burger. The taste was very very average. My buddy ordered a double hamburger and was happy with the quantity. Wish they increase the size of the Chicken.. Overall ambience was nice."}
{"text":"Awesome burger but don't see what all the fuss is about, other than pressing flesh with about 29 other people at any given moment when they are open.  For Heavens sake... Please expand your location. For the claustrophobes stay away. Bring cash unless you want to ruin your dining experience by going to use the dirty ATM next door at a place I am confident is full of rats."}
{"text":"We stopped by around 7 PM on a week night and had to wait to get into the place. The place was very small, but the line moved quickly enough.  While in line, we had a chance to meet other Yelper who was also trying out this place for the first time.  We exchange notes of other notable burger joints to pass the time.    Overall, I love the burgers, but was disappointed with the fries.  Double Double was tasty and satisfying. This is a straightforward double burger without the gimmick  Burger was on the smaller size, but packed lots of flavor. Initially, I thought I was going to need to endure the line to order a second one, but was happy to report, the burger was very satisfying.  The fries was soggy when we ate ours. We did not finished the order of fries that we were sharing.  Will be returning to try out The Priest, but will be passing on the fries."}
{"text":"Over rated in my opinion.The Burger is small its the same size as a McDonald's cheeseburger. It had absolutely no seasoning and it didn't taste good at all. I wish i could get my money back."}
{"text":"I went here today expecting something amazing... and I was gravely disappointed. How does a burger place NOT HAVE BBQ SAUCE? Are you kidding me? Even the street meat vendors have flipping BBQ sauce. Not impressed people, not impressed. I can say however, the Option (vegetarian) which were 2 portobello mushrooms stuffed with cheese and breaded with panko crumbs was quite delicious, but it would have been better if I was able to put some sort of condiment on my \"burger\". I do not eat ketchup nor mustard, so my \"burger\" was left to be quite dry. I would have given this place and my veggie burger 5 stars-- which is quite a lot of give for a veggie option but:   No BBQ sauce = no 5 stars.   Not impressed."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this burger joint. I think it is the best burger place in town. The priest burger, cheese burger, and blue cheese burger are the best. They have only a selection of their menus on the wall ..make sure you visit their website too see the full manu. They have a wide variety of burgers that satisfy everyone's taste.  Just keep in mind that they only accept cash and they are closed on  Sundays."}
{"text":"I made my way to the Burger's Priest yesterday with a few friends to see if it was worth all the hype, or if it was overrated.  I think it was a good burger overall, but likely not worthy of the \"third best food in Toronto\" given by Zagat, which I still find confusing.  I did check out the secret menu online before going, so instead of trying a basic cheeseburger, I opted for the Vatican City.  This is the double cheeseburger with, instead of a bun, 2 grilled cheese sandwiches to hold the meat and condiments.  I thought it was a cool idea, and worth a try, and I am glad I did.  The burgers were made from quality meat, and as far as I could tell, were unflavoured.  The patties were nice and juicy, and had a good simple taste of their own.  The 2 grilled cheese \"buns\" also held together surprisingly well, because I thought they would be the weak link and lead to a serious mess.  It was a nice touch, because I could definitely taste the grilled cheese flavour, and it went well with the burger and basic toppings.  The double was big, but not monstrous, although I think a single would be too small for me.  The burger reminded me of a Shake Shack style, but bigger and maybe a littler better.  I made mine a combo, so for my ~$17.00 I got an order of fries and a can of Pepsi as well.  The fries were fairly decent, not as bad as I had read in a few reviews, although I understand they can be hit or miss.  Everything gets soggy in the bag if it stays in there for more than a minute anyway, and since there is no real seating on the premises, that's how 99% of orders will be eaten.  Next time I would probably skip the fries and just grab a burger that I could get out of the bag to eat right away.  I guess I have to admit that I enjoyed my meal, but it is a little on the pricey side for a burger, a small bag of soggy fries, and a canned drink.  Add to that the fact that you'll likely be eating it sitting on a curb, and I'm still puzzled at the Zagat rating, but I would recommend a trip there for anyone who enjoys a good burger, at least for comparison purposes.  Burger's Priest is, in my opinion, still overhyped, but that doesn't mean that they don't put together a good burger with some interesting \"secret\" options for kicks.  With that said, figure out what you're getting into before you arrive, because the menu in store doesn't tell you a lot, and you don't want to be judged by the hipster in line behind you for asking questions at the cash."}
{"text":"Cali buger, priest burger, regular hamburger and fries ... good burgers but not sure what all the broohaha is all about. The fries were good but they gave us so many of the little pieces that it felt like we got all the leftovers :-(.  All in all, it is a good burger place but not worth the line up or the cost."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. My girlfriend and I dropped in for burgers because I had heard it was one of the best burger joints in Toronto. It wasn't, not even close. Very over-rated, not close to Five Guys or many other chains. Expensive and so salty my girlfriend felt sick and threw her burger out. Fries were ok."}
{"text":"One of the most overrated places I've ever been to.  I was impressed at first, inside was clean and appealing, with a small yet detailed menu and various pictures and slogans on the walls.  I was shocked when two burgers, two fries and two sodas came to $30. After all, this place is 100% traditional fast food. I hoped the food would justify the price - sadly not.  My California burger was tiny, greasy and I honestly would have gotten much more pleasure from eating a Big Mac. Whoever said below that the Burger's Priest's secret sauce was identical to Big Mac sauce was spot on. Nothing special whatsoever. In fact, the excessive cheese on the tiny, oily meat patty was a bit nauseating.   The fries were completely bland. Neither the skinny salted American style fries nor the fat chunky British style ones - just a stodgy, in-the-middle unremarkable, forgettable mess.   Boyfriend specified for his double cheeseburger to come without tomatoes and pickles, and of course it came with both.  Even the pop was a disappointment! You'd think paying $15 for a combo you'd get a large fountain drink but no, just regular cans.  I'm curious why they charge so much? Is the meat organic? (Not that I know of) are the toppings or sauces super special? (No) do the staff cook the burgers any differently to minimum wage employees in McDonalds? (Having worked in McDs myself, it didn't look like the BP staff did anything differently)  Will not be back. Harvey's is a whole other universe of quality, tastiness and value. Go to Harvey's.   Ps - oh yeah, still cash only."}
{"text":"The worst burger ever. We ordered a high priest and single California, both combos. The burgers were very oily, in a bad shape and absolutely tasteless. Worse than that were the fries. I would say it was more like mashed potatoes than fries. I don't recommend them at all."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had!! Great mix of fresh meats. Super juicy !!"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch with some coworkers. We arrived around 1:00pm on a Friday and it was busy but it didn't really take long to get through the line, place our order, and get our food.  Like any fast food place you line up at the cash and take your order to a table, there are no servers here but you're getting a much better quality product than at McD's or Burger King so don't be thrown by the price tag.  It's worth it!  I ordered The Priest (I had to compare it to the Animal Feed I had at Holy Chuck) with a side of fresh cut fries. The Priest is their cheeseburger + The Option (the option is almost the same burger as The Animal Feed). I opted for no Cheese on the cheeseburger part of my Priest. That did cause a little confusion for the girl taking my order as the pattie for The Option is stuffed with cheese, I just didn't want the extra on my beef.  The Option a delicious blend of garlicky cheese sandwiched (sangwich as they say at Burger's Priest) between two portobello mushrooms, panko breaded and fried to crispy perfection. I have to say I enjoyed this version of the veggie burger more than the Holy Chuck version, and not just because I added meat to it!  The cheese filing was so flavorful and when it oozed out it retained it's cheesy colour. Whereas at Holy Chuck it was just cheese and mushroom, there didn't seem to be any added seasoning and when the cheese oozes out it's a nasty grey colour that doesn't look very appetizing.   The fries were amazing!  They were very much like my preferred chip wagon fries, not as thick cut though. The were perfectly seasoned with salt and had a fantastic crispy texture. I shared mine on the advice of a coworker - he said the portion was too big for him to eat on his own...I honestly could have eaten the whole portion with my burger with no problem...yes, I am a glutton (when it comes to delicious food) but the portion isn't really that big.   I got very excited when I saw \"BEER\" on the menu board!  And then a little disappointed to read directly under it \"Coming Soon\". What better to wash down those fries than a nice cold beer!?    The restaurant itself is small and it's lacking outdoor seating but because you're not being served at a table, it's less likely you're going to get campers hogging the tables. Also, if you're not sitting at one of the bar height tables, the chairs don't have backs to them, so let's call them stools. You're not going to lounge around on a stool.    I also noticed that the owner was out on the floor cleaning tables and pushing in stools. It was good to see him actively running the restaurant and not afraid to do the \"dirty work\" to make sure his clients had somewhere clean to eat their delicious burgers.   I will definitely be back and will be bringing the family!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I can say this is the #1 burger in the GTA but it is certainly top 3. Absolutely amazing, fries were nothing special but that's not what it's about. If you can eat it I'd recommend 'The Vatican City' from the 'Secret Menu' which is a double cheeseburger that has grilled cheeses for buns. You may have to wait a bit, it seems to always be busy, somewhat pricey but I'd say worth it. Very limited seating, pretty much just a small bar where you likely won't get a spot. Cash only (They have an ATM)."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few burger joints in the GTA and Burger's Priest is easily one of my top two faves. The thing that I enjoy the most about it is the burgers are delicious and honest - straight-up goodness and nothing fancy. I've grown tired of this so-called gourmet burger trend because so many places in Toronto don't live up to the label. Give me an \"old school\" burger any day of the week.  I usually order the single cheeseburger combo, with everything on the burger. I will admit, for $6 you can find a bigger burger, but I'm willing to pay that much because it's that good. What separates Burger's Priest from most places is the beef they use - it's fresh, and it's cooked right in front of you and about a dozen others, depending on the time of day, because this shoebox is always crammed.  That's not a big deal to me. Good burgers are worth waiting for. If you want some standing room in line go to a fast food chain.  On that note, it's all takeout at Burger's Priest. No dining in because there's no space and no facilities. That's another bonus - I get a bit of exercise while I eat on my walk home.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Delicious juicy hamburgers, and the milkshake was out of this world!"}
{"text":"I visited when it first opened.  My test for a good burger is -- show me what you got with just a patty and a bun.  It was ok but no Biggy for me.  It's fine but I don't get the hype.  It's like a craze where all of a sudden people discover the novelty of B movies and start to rate them...oh the best of B movies - gotta go see. C'mon.. They are B movies!  Rating the best of Chevi's vs bmw's ( across the spectrum of all foods) is just a flash in the pan. I expect it will still hold for a couple of years, but then onto something else?  This is just a fad folks.  Sorry."}
{"text":"There's not much I can say that 130 other reviewers haven't other than the fact that it is worth braving the line (or at least forcing a mid-afternoon \"snack\") for.  These are flat top style burgers which means that the meat is fried on a griddle instead of grilled over a flame and the result is an extra juicy burger that is amazingly tender (since the cooks are very careful to only loosely form the patties so as not to overwork the meat).   I stuck to the basic cheeseburger to test the place out but next time I go I'm definitely adding \"the option\" (aka a deep fried portabello stuffed with cheese).  These burgers are so simple yet so good and all in all I'd probably rank this as my favourite burger in the city (runners up would be the ones at the Stock Yards and Big Smoke)."}
{"text":"This place had amazing burgers!! We tried the Vatican City and it was BOMB DOT COM! It was ooey gooey perfection. The cheese was melted perfectly and the meat was fresh and tender.   The service was great too, everyone there was really nice.   However, it is a really small space. We literally had to stand over people to wait for them to leave so we could take their seats. There were barely enough tables/seats for all of the people waiting for burgers. If only this space was bigger, I would give it 5 stars..."}
{"text":"Was really craving a burger, so I called my friend and she met me at The Burger's Priest in Woodbridge.  It's a larger location then the one on Yonge and they take credit/debit which is a bonus.  I ordered Holy Smokes off the secret menu, because I had had it before and it was delicious!   It's 2 patties and cheese and panko crusted jalapenos.  I like that the drinks are regular prices, which helps compensate for the well priced, but higher end burgers.  This particular burger is rather greasy, so I wouldn't advise ordering it to go.  It will likely be mushy by the time you get home.  Eat it while it's fresh!   Fast service, pleasant place, and good food.  Not sure what else you need?!"}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers in this city there obviously tons of choices, burger priest has some locations and we checked in to the queens way location yesterday. Thinking they're prices are on the high end we were surprised to see they were relatively the same as Five Guys or A & W. We started small and ordered the cheeseburgers and fries. The atmosphere inside is crafty not typical burger fare, they have nice tables and benches for seating. The menu is great and supposedly they have have a secret one to. I've heard good things and after trying it will definitely go back to try something different another time."}
{"text":"best fries and burger !!! They need a new bun or at least an optional bun, the only complaint was the bread. The rest was by far the best burger in the city. Fresh beef is all you need to know, and the fries have some special flavoring on them and crunchy like they should be."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the option vegetarian burger and it was delicious. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the cheese in the Pablo crusted portobello mushrooms was so yummy! It was expensive , $10 for the burger and the can pop , so I probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"My husband liked his order, I loved their fries however the bun was too greasy for me. Dripping butter it was. The quality meat is fine but too thin to enjoy the flavour. Don't expect a juicy burger."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all...burger very greasy and fries tasted good, but 95% of them where literally one inch long."}
{"text":"Good. Not great.   Probably worth going for some of the more adventurous items off the secret menu because all the hype will make the simple cheeseburger seem disappointing. And they really need a bigger location 'cause I definitely don't want to come back here only to take my grub to the park in order to eat a lukewarm burger and soggy fries.  Tip: the burgers aren't that big -- go for the double."}
{"text":"The burgers were pretty good, however was taken back at how small they were, especially for the price you pay. I think next time I will try Holy Chuck's."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. The burgers are great. I would especially recommend the California burger -- the bun in particular is really good. Skip the fries; they aren't worth it and are mediocre at best. Still worth the trip for the burger though."}
{"text":"It's fine. I had a cheeseburger and fries.  The fries were a generous portion and very tasty - cut a bit on the thicker side, and I think these are fresh. The burger was also very good, with an excellent balance of meat-to-bun, though the selection of toppings is pretty bare-bones.   This is definitely one of the better burger places in the city, but I found the environment distracting. I was there around 5:30 PM and the music was obnoxiously loud - almost too loud to chat with my guest.  The place was noticeably busy,  and the service wasn't noteworthy or particularly attentive - it was strictly an order desk. Five Guys has the same setup, but the staff are always a lot more attentive and friendly, and the environment is much more welcoming. We finished our meal and left.  I liked the burger a lot, and the price was excellent value, but not enough to go back to this location."}
{"text":"Om nom nom nom  Won't you please join me for a delicious burger? then together we can...  Om nom nom nom   Seriously, just try it.  Om nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I think their secret to locking in all the flavour is the cramped, steam room-like space. I must try the Priest Burger next time because the cheese burger wasn't satisfying enough for me."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is that it is the back-to-basics burger.  It's not trying to be anything other than just a real burger.  Fresh ground beef, simple toppings, plain bun.    I had the cheeseburger and it was nothing special, but that's what made it a spectacular burger.  I really  thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  The fries are delicious too.  My husband had the burger with the cheese-stuffed mushroom on top of it, and he can't stop talking about it.  After hearing much ado about this place, we finally tried it on Friday.  We drove all the way across the city to try it.   Tonight (Sunday), we found ourselves in the Beaches again, and decided to swing by for seconds.  Much to our chagrin, it wasn't open.  I presume they aren't open at all on Sundays, because it was 7pm when we drove by - so I doubt it was a \"too late\" thing.  My only other beef with the place is that there is no seating.  Well actually, there are some stools and a counter, but the signs clearly indicate that this is waiting room only and you can't eat in.  The place was very busy, but I do think we could have sat there and ate without being in anyone's way.  So that was a bit of a pain.  So we ate in the car and the smell is still in there 2 days later!  * Note: Currently Cash-Only!"}
{"text":"Fatty, greasy and as good as it gets.  Can't say anything that hasn't already been said about this place.  I'd eat it everyday if my wife would let me.  Double double is as close to perfection in burger form, essentially it's burger porn."}
{"text":"I just ate at The Burger's Priest a few days ago.  It recently opened up on the Queensway.  THERE WAS A LINE UP OUT THE DOOR!  I was a little discouraged at from the line, because I hate lines.  I waited anyway.  It went pretty quick.  This turned out to be one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had.  AWESOME!!!  Great burgers, great fries.  The menu isn't that big, but there is apparently a secret menu.  I had the California Burger, with fried jalepenos.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Well first of all... TASTEYYY! Really liked eating here the food was great!   First impression: quirky, slightly crammed.  Staff: very friendly and good looking  Food: amazing! Very tastey! And original! I liked that you could see that it was freshly made.  Should be clearer that you have to pick up your own drink.  More tables required!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed their veggie burger which is made with cheese and mushroom not soy which was nice to see. Service was fast and friendly. The burger was great but quite rich so it's not something I would be having on a regular basis. People will line up way down the street for this place so I imagine their other burgers must be pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Best burger you will ever have!!!!!!!!!! Get the vatican burger its the best!!!!!!! You wont regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger in the city! This location is just as good as queen east and queen west. The burger just melts in your mouth! Had the vatican and high priest. Cooking it on a flattop and completely fresh makes all the difference in the world. Wait is well worth it. There is no burger place in toronto even romotely close to burger preist!"}
{"text":"best burger in missisauga hands down! this place is consistent with the other locations on queen east ,west and on adelaide. you get what you pay for and this place clearly delivers! the burger is essentially liquid butter ! so unbelievably good. actually have a fair number of spots at this location and serice is amazing."}
{"text":"Goddamn it this is the best fast food greasy burger in North America. Rivalled only by In and Out Burger. This burger is friggin' pricey, but it's so so so so so worth it. Each bite just melts in your mouth. Try anything and you'll love it. I am patiently awaiting the day they get ONION RINGS on their menu. Their fries are also to die for."}
{"text":"I'm not religious. I don't worship any specific god or belief system. I do however believe that the Burgers Priest was sent by some almighty power to make is all delicious burgers. Get the \"Vatican City Burger\"......it's not on the menu but will make you change how you look at life! ITS A SERIOUS BURGER"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! Try the California cheeseburger with grilled onions! Yummy!  And the best fries! Didn't really enjoy the chocolate shake, was a bit too lumpy & not enough chocolate flavour....bu the rest of the meal was WOW!"}
{"text":"Line up is crazy, place is small but it's worth the wait. Call ahead and then pick up works best."}
{"text":"I normally do not write reviews but after receiving our meal I feel like I have to.  The order came 35 minutes late.  The food was a soggy mess.  The papers bags were so wet you couldn't even hold it without supporting the bottom.  70 bucks for 4 burgers and fries isn't worth it.  I ordered dessert which was not put in the order. The driver from just eats waited for 30 minutes for them to cook the order.   If you can't prioritize delivery orders you shouldn't offer it."}
{"text":"Burger was not bad but staff was flat out rude and busy chatting up a storm.  Definitely not customer service oriented"}
{"text":"Nothing special (in taste) from the other boutique burger places. The names of the burgers are funny though..."}
{"text":"A few foodie coworkers of mine read the glowing reviews and grabbed me to join them for lunch at The Burger's Priest, even though it was quite far from our workplace. We must have arrived at an extremely busy time since this place was just packed with people during the lunch rush. We almost wanted to turn away on the spot, but having travelled such a long distance, we were on a determined mission to taste the food no matter how long the wait!  Was it worth the wait? By the time we finally got to place an order, we were so hungry that we would have wolfed down anything that was put on our plates. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. There was nothing wrong with the burger, which tasted perfectly fine, but it wasn't as delicious as it had been described to me. I did like that the portions were reasonably small, so we were able to finish our meal without feeling too full.  I don't regret coming to The Burger's Priest for the first time, but I won't be coming back for a return visit."}
{"text":"Went to try the burgers at the Burger's Priest out of curiosity given all the hype.  We had the Option, the Double Cheeseburger and chili cheese fries.  The double cheeseburger, chilli cheese fries and a canned drink came as a combo.  This combo plus the Option (deep fried mushroom and cheese burger) and a regular cheeseburger came up to just over $31 - in my opinion expensive for a meal of just burgers, fries and a canned drink.  The burgers were small as well and it's not that we are big eaters.  I'm a 5 ft 2 just over 100lb Asian female, my bf a buff gym addict.  'I was a little worried that the double cheeseburger wasn't enough for my bf.  Luckily, the grease and the chilli cheese fries helped to fill up the empty space.  Taste wise, to be frankly honest, it does remind me of a McDonalds Quarter Pounder because of the beefy flavour and cheese.  Unlike McDonalds, the meat is definitely fresh and when you bite in, the melted cheese melds perfectly with the juice of the patty.  I think they minimize with seasoning of the meat (maybe just salt) to not take away from the freshness of the beef.  Cheese fries were disappointing - heavy and kind of tasteless.  As for the veggie burger, nothing special again but then again, a deep fried mushroom and cheese burger does not appeal to me much.  The Option is very similar to the veggie burger at the Shake Shack in NYC and it didn't wow me - I would have much preferred a non deep fried portobello burger with cheese.  Perhaps I need to have ordered the extravagant burgers (grilled cheese burger) to be wowed.  However, then again, I'm not the type to appreciate eating the deep fried butter balls at CNE.   I'm a big burger fan and to me, it's about the patty.    All in all, for the price that I'm paying, I've had better elsewhere.  Burgers at the Shake Shack are of the same if not better quality but half the price.  I wish that there's an equivalent here in Toronto in quality and cost but it appears Toronto still has some catching up to do."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, been to this location and the east end one and this is the better of the two. Space to eat. I ordered the high priest and it was very good. Would order again. If you look at there site their is also a secret menu u can order from check it out for sure."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the others in terms of look however the burgers are just as good. Friendly service. I got the fiery furnace and it was very well made and tasted very good. Will try again in the near future."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and tried the single patty magnum burger with chilli cheese fries. You can tell the patty was high quality and was very juicy. The chilli cheese were good as well but didn't stand out. I would say this is a pricey burger place but after tasting the burger i could see why. Would efinitly go back again."}
{"text":"To me, mc donalds's cheapest hamburger  is more tasty!! Plus the shop is smaller than a toilet"}
{"text":"I'm at the very end of my patience with this place. I pre order s burger for pick up, arrive on tin only to discover that my order hadn't even been started. I watched what seemed to be a manager come in from having a cigarette and didn't take the minute to wash his hands. I've been a customer here since opening day and I'm no longer interested in giving them another chance - one too many. I hope another burger place opens in the hood soon other than this place."}
{"text":"20 minute line up is totally worth it! Highly recommend Magnum, Religious Hypocrite,  and chili fries! So good!"}
{"text":"HOLY...  Best. Burger. Ever...that I've ever had:P and I've tried many burgers.  Probably would have tasted better if I had sat in but it's so small and tight there, that 1)I wouldn't be comfortable and 2) I'd sound like I was making love to the burger with my moans of ecstasy.  Decor: I'm wasting time writing in this section but it's a tight space with only about 4 stools to sit on and eat on a ledge table.  DONE.  Food: YES! *pump fist* So good!  The patty itself is not your typical patty as it is a bit crumbly and falls apart but that is fine and dandy with me because the texture is just right.  I got the PRIEST which is The \"Option\" with a Cheeseburger.  The Option is essentially a vegetarian burger you can order where the beef patty is substituted for a Panko breaded portabello mushroom stuffed with cheese.  If that sound unhealthy, then you are thinking right.  If you are health conscious, maybe you shouldn't be eating this:P I'll admit that it was a bit much for me but I savored every bite. The fries were thinly cut which I like so it complimented well.  Overall: Well worth the drive no matter where you're coming from.  Keep in mind that they always sell out 1 hour before closing time usually so call ahead if you want to go late.    This place is the bomb and I want them to cater a bbq for me one day..hahah"}
{"text":"The burgers here are definitely quite a few notches above McDonalds, but I do not consider the burgers here exceptional quality, for the price that you pay per burger the quality you get is ok. It is not super cheap hence I would not expect to get a McD quality burger served to me here.   The burgers are pretty greasy, my bun was soaked in grease. I am not a dieting kind of girl and have no aversion to calories, but seeing soo much grease is kind of unappetizing, additionally, I get a coating of fat in my mouth after eating one of these burgers, you can really feel it in your gut afterwards.   Overall, probably pass on this place in the future."}
{"text":"Great burgers, terrible service. We ordered 3 burgers and fries and all three burgers were incorrect. However the burgers were excellent, I would skip on the fries, they are good but really small in size."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype and we were lucky enough to get a seat on a busy Saturday night.  Staff is friendly and efficient.  First time there and no negative points to report."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries I've ever had! They've got a large unique menu, and you can customize your burger how you like. The fries are absolutely delicious and they serve you a very generous portion. They're much more expensive than a typical fast food place, and you're going to have at least a 20 min wait, but it's worth it when you want a great meal!!"}
{"text":"Soooo good. I had the cheeseburger with sauteed onions. The fries were amazing too. Can't wait to go back :)  Only downside is that it's very small and there's nowhere to eat outside so you're stuck bringing it home - in which case your meal will cool down. The Spadina location should be better for business though.  Still yummy."}
{"text":"Definitely NOT your average veggie burger.  Called \"The Option\" two portobello caps stuffed with a ridiculous amount of cheese, breaded, deep fried and placed on a bun.  It was good, but way too heavy and WAY too cheesy. Each bite created an uncomfortable hot cheese avalanche, which sounds better than it was in reality.   Tasty, yes, but no whole wheat buns. Fries were meh, toppings sparse. Another expensive burger place, A burger and fries combo came to almost $14. We didn't get a beverage from the cooler.. should one have come in the combo? None of the staff mentioned otherwise even though they were watching us pack up our stuff to go (its a tiny location.)  I know in the past I have given bonus points for clever concepts and or copy (hey, I'm an art director) but whereas I thought the iconography/burger thing was funny at first, the novelty definitely wore off.  Can't tell if they are running with the joke, or taking themselves that seriously.   Overall the food was alright. I definitely would not travel across town for it thats for sure. These exorbitant priced burger shops are getting to me. If you want to charge that much make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"As far as burgers go.. The Burger's Priest know's how to grill some serious ground beef patties.  I did not try anything special.. just a normal cheese burger with fries and it was pretty damn good. That said, in my personal opinion it's hard to mess up meat and bread.  The first time you go there you're not going to know what to get (hence my choice of standard cheese burger). Take your time though, the staff seemed pretty nice but don't expect to sit anywhere!  Ye son.. also.. do not go if you do not like meat."}
{"text":"Burger priest was a pleasant surprise. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is pretty good.    I got a California burger, and wasn't very impressed with the presentation. It looked like two squashed greasy pancakes wrapped in wax paper, but the meat was very flavorful and the cheese and onions were very good too. The fries had something of a fryer taste to them, like you could taste the oil they'd been cooked in, but they weren't bad.   It had modern decor and is mid to high range price wise. Flavorful food."}
{"text":"Anyone that thinks these are the best burgers around really needs to get out more.   I feel like I paid $10 for a Big Mac.  Small, overcooked and dried out patty, cooked to a greasy and oily mess on a flat top.    Asked to have my burger cut in half so could share with someone in my party and was refused, as 'it's against their policy, and it changes the signature look of their burger'.   Really? It's an underseasoned, overcooked, flavourless burger.   There are far better places to eat in Port Credit."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype..? They're good burgers, decent for the price and quality but taste worse, they're nothing special! I had the high priest, which essentially was a glorified big Mac. The buns were child, and the cheese not melted, and the toppings seemed skimpy. Overall, wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"--- SUMMARY ---   Pluses: a 10 - 15 minute walk from the volleyball nets at the beach, smaller portions meant that we could actually finish the food, food comes out fairly quickly  Minuses: cash only, take out only - no room to eat / hangout inside  --- FULL DETAILS ---  Came here to check out the third best restaurant in Toronto for 2012 (as per Zagat). When we were there, there was a line of people waiting for their food, not to order though. Slightly disappointed that it wasn't a sit-down joint (which I guess adds to its charm?).   Ordered a Cheeseburger and the Priest burger (which is a cheeseburger + portebello mushroom stuffed with cheese and fried). Priest was really good - thanks to that mushroom + cheese and fried. The cheeseburger was just average (the patty they used is apparently ground fresh every day and you can taste the difference - but otherwise it's nothing special)"}
{"text":"'Twas a Sunday night and everywhere was closed. I stumbled onto this place and what a pleasant experience it was!  The patty was juicy, burger was perfectly sized and the people were friendly. Seating is very limited so take-out is the best option.  Fries were disappointing. Then again, this isn't The Fries Priest."}
{"text":"Super expensive, fries are nasty, burger was over done  !! Will Never Go Back !!"}
{"text":"Had the low priest. Burger and fries were very salty. The burger tasted like a Big Mac probably due to the special sauce/chopped onions combo. The patty was hot but everything else was cold (including the cheese) yielding an overall cold burger. Bun was average... on the dry side. Overall I like the concept and the story behind the place... good effort but wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I try to go when the line isn't super long but it is worth the wait. Just delicious every time. Very consistent. I do wish they were cheaper but you get what you pay for! Yum."}
{"text":"Burger was good,  real meat, place was very modern and nice. A little pricey .  nothing to special ..cheese fries not the best"}
{"text":"The Burger's Priest is way overrated.  I had the High Priest Combo (which is their copy of the Big Mac) and it came to $17 for a burger, average fries, and a can of 7Up.  The meal was bland, and the only thing with any taste were the pickles in the middle of the sandwich.  The meat had no seasoning of note and I threw out most of the heavily oil-soaked fries.  The only positive thing I can say about this place is that the ingredients seemed fresh and it was fairly busy.  With so many burger options available, I won't be returning to Burger's Priest any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is heaven for someone who is  having cravings for some greasy and fatty food (Saturday morning food?)  These burgers are pure perfection: meaty and juicy patty, lightly toasted bun and fresh veggies.. add some killer sauce on top... and you got it:) Love both the regular and the secret menu. Another good thing is that you can customize everything to your liking and ad/remove any ingredients with no hassle. My personal favorite is the Priest burger with deep fried jalapenos (MUST TRY) and mushrooms. Wait time depends ion the time of the day but usually 10-20 minutes (a bit longer than typical burger joints) Let the feast begin!"}
{"text":"I have three words for those who are still contemplating to try the place: chilli cheese fries! Yes they were truly remarkable!"}
{"text":"This place has it's ups and it's downs. I can't really comment on the meat like many other reviews because I always get the veggie burger. It is truly amazing, a huge portobello oozing garlicky cheese covered in panko to give it an amazing crunch. Really who could argue with that?? I've never had any bun disintegration issues either, maybe the mushroom doesn't emit as much liquid as the regular burger.  However, I have to agree, it's overpriced. Last time I went with my boyfriend it was $30 for two \"meals\" that didn't include drinks. It's a but greedy for the size of the burger you get. The fries do blow, they are bland, overcooked and lack seasoning. Both times I got them they were cold. But realistically people don't go for the fries, there is a reason it's called The burger's priest right? People are correct there is no room, you get cozy with people pretty quick but they do turn out food pretty fast. Unlike others the disposition of the person flipping burgers doesn't really concern me as long as I get my food in a timely manner.  In the end I will return because the veggie burger is epic, next time I'll just skip the fries!"}
{"text":"I was around Etobicoke for a meeting and the Burger Priest location here was calling me. I got off the meeting around 11:30am and thought I can beat the lunch crowd by getting there a bit before 12pm. Well, there was already about 4 ppl in line and the sitting area was packed with people eating or waiting. Waiting in line gave me some time to decide what to get. Finally, I've decided to get the \"Bacon Double cheeseburger\", no fries ... burger was enough and not trying to feel more guilty. The wait was not bad, probably a little over 5 minutes. The first bite of the burger was just as the first time I tried it, the patty was juicy with the bacon fat mixed in with the cheese. Yummy!! I've ate that burger pretty quick was it was still warm. Very satisfying burger."}
{"text":"It's not the best burger, to be honest. It had me feeling a little nauseous afterwards as well-  really greasy too.   Not to mention how rude these ppl are- and if I ask for no lettuce on my burger, usually you just leave it out, right? Not these guys. You get what you get!   #overit #gotoWendys"}
{"text":"Okay, first of all: it's fast food. It's not the awesome Burger restaurant I expected, the place is reeeally tiny. Like 5 people fit in there, that's it. You can't really sit there. So if I would rate it as a restaurant it would get 2 stars, but as it's definitly just fast food i'll give 4, because it's good fast food. I had the Tower of bable and that thing was 1. Huge and 2. Cheeseheaven. It was really fatty, but worlds better than other fast food restaurants. And kind of expensive, my Burger was something round 18 bucks after tax. And they only take cash. But the customer service safed the 4 stars - the ATM in the store wasn't working (not their fault), the one in the next store wasn't working (not their fault), but as we really wanted those Burgers now I went round the corner and got the money finally. The guy behind the counter was so sorry that we got drinks for free. So good for a fast food experience,  but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Just awesome! Excellent burgers with a big portion of fries! Long wait times during lunch to be expected. I've had a few different burger's there and they were all amazing!"}
{"text":"Well well I had expectations. 155 reviews to this date BP seems to be a pretty popular joint here on Yelp, well in fact in the city.  I had expectations going. Unfortunately they were not met tonight. :(  Some of these things I've read about this place IMO are blown out of proportion like a legendary fish story! .. comments like  'grease in the air , I have to shower when I get home, go eat in a park to have a communion with a burger. Lol. Haha some excellent creative writing people and props to that.. you know who you are;).   Those comments induced grade \"A\" burger fantasies as we approached on the 501 Queen st E streetcar into no where land. damn you guys :p  I ordered 'the priest ' the house specialty. It's a cheeseburger topped with \"the option\" a deep fried cheese stuffed portabello mushroom. The option is the size of a patty itself.   About 10 minutes later, the order was ready.   I opened my wax paper to do a quick inspection and took my first bite.   They used fresh ground meat and it cooked on a griddle retaining all of its rich fat and juices. They did cook it right. It was very juicy.  The bun is kind of lacking though, it's smashed and soggy.   The option - i'd opt out. is a tad too much cheese. the priest is already a cheese burger to begin with. .    toppings are pretty standard. Tomato,pickle,mayo,ketchup  Its a excellent grease pit/diner burger.   But it's not what i consider an ultimate burger though.. Ultimate would convince me to eat it over a steak.   update: I started feeling abdominal cramps about an hour an half after eating this and soon found myself running to the bathroom. I cannot digest this grease so yahh I didnt gain any weight from this experience. Woot! Woot? Wtf  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Burgers are good but just not worth the price.  Ordered the holy smokes with frees and a can of pepsi. Can't remember the exact price but it was nearly $20!! Burger was indeed very good and the portion of fries was pretty hefty so that was a plus, they were also pretty good.  The only thing I'm having trouble with is how they justify the price for what is essentially a takeaway burger place. I've had burgers in restaurants that were cheaper!  I'd give it 4 stars if based just on the food but have to give it 3 because of the price. Probably wouldn't get it again because of that."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the built up hype, but I found that their option was rather lacking and the presentation of the burger was merely decent. Don't get me wrong it was a good burger, but I felt that their burger was a bit on the average side without any identifiable flavour.  I would recommend that they either add some sort of spice mix to their option burger, otherwise it will remain in my books as a one time meal.  For those who love cheeseburgers this is your place to go for the classic burger, otherwise keep searching around.  I love the portion size of the burger, they have a great grasp of how to deliver a proper old school burger!"}
{"text":"It is my most favorite burger place in the city. Burgers are awesome. Try California double and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I got the cheese burger with bacon and fried onions. Easily one of the best fast food burgers I have had in my life. The burger was extremely juicy and flavorful. Since I live in The Beach I see myself coming here a lot! The fries were fresh cut and awesome. Next time I come I will try the veggie option called, \"The Option\" 2 portabello mushroom caps stuffed with cheese then deep fried! The guys that work there are fast & friendly."}
{"text":"Very small cheeseburgers. I ended up eating 2. I'm satisfied but not deadly full. So be careful on the $$ evaluation.   Nothing special about the cheeseburger. My friend had the Vatican and didn't find anything out of normal. It's a good burger but I had higher expectations after reading all other reviews"}
{"text":"Never even heard of this place decided to take a shot called in advance ordered two Burgers went to pick them up With my debit card and found out they do not take debit they only take cash and they have an ATM machine by the washroom which was an extra two dollars. Hell no!!! So now I have to take a trip Four blocks away to my bank take money out come back and then their cashier says to me I should've known because all their other locations only  allow cash. Now I'm annoyed with her attitude and the way that she spoke to me and I said to her I have never been to any of your other locations i have never heard of you before and if I didn't have my friend involved in this burger pickup , I wouldn't have come back at all ,at least be a little nicer when you tell people that you only take cash!!!!!  All in all the burger was just ok, nothing to write home about!! If it was great I would have said it was great and totally worth the aggravation but it totally wasn't."}
{"text":"I wanna hate this place because the owner always seems like a jerk, but the product is really good. Value is decent, especially compared to similar places in New York. Jarge Style is great, and the California Classic too. Plain cheeseburger was excellent and you should always start with that. I didn't like the one with the option and the burger but it was fine."}
{"text":"A great burger joint to get your food and eat by the beach. It definitely is top 5 for burgers in the city. Great selection of burgers. The only thing I don't like is that the burgers are pretty small other than that they're great."}
{"text":"Very good burger. I got the californian with secret sauce (10$ double - you need to get the double!) and chili cheese fries (amazing). A bit difficule to eat but worth the challenge. The place is a bit small and could be cozier. Nice music."}
{"text":"This location is very very small. The lineups are out the door sometimes and there are 4 or 5 seats against the wall but it says it's a waiting area. I still eat there when it's empty.   I've only ordered the single cheeseburger, double, and the Vatican City. The burgers are amazing. The vegetables are fresh, the buns are soft (how I like them but it's not everyone's favourite style) and the patties? Best part about the burger. It's absolutely flavourful and juicy.   I am fortunate (or not in a way) to live close to this location, and I keep coming back. The only drawback is the fact it's a bit pricy.  Quick tips to maximize your experience: - Google \"Burger's Priest secret menu\" before you come. It's actually on their website now. - I suggest the Vatican City if you're hungry. The buns are replaced by grilled cheese sandwiches, and it sounds disgusting, but it's delicious. - Don't expect a healthy burger. I've seen reviews complain about the grease and oil. What do you expect from a burger joint? - Bring cash. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"I expected this place to disappoint.  I assumed it was just another mediocre burger joint with a gimmick. I was wrong. Burger was amazing, juicy patties that melt in your mouth... Buns buttered and tossed on the grill which is how I do it at home. I had the bacon double cheeseburger with lettuce pickle and mayo. Perfect.  It is loud and busy and quite chaotic."}
{"text":"I had the Priest with every topping, and plan to come here next time I visit Toronto. While I was already struggling to control my drool while watching the cook flatten the beef patty on the grill; biting into the perfect concoction of tender, juicy beef topped with onions, pickles, cheese, and a DEEP FRIED PORTABELLA could not have made me any happier at that moment. Minus one star for the surprisingly small size of the burger, but taste wise, it's a five."}
{"text":"Finally got to Burger's Priest last night before a movie. It was about 7:40pm with a que of about 10 people deep waiting for their food. I snagged an open table while my boyfriend ordered for us. I got the California burger - came with buttered buns, cheese, special sauce, grilled onions with lettuce and tomato. The special sauce is the thing that sold me - but it was non existent. The buns were fresh and the burger was meaty, no stand out seasoning or anything like that.   My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Double Cheeseburger - Jarge style - burger patties are grilled in mustard al a In N Out on the west coast. He loved every minute of that burger and didn't even give me a bite; though he said it was a little too much cheese.  We also got an order of fries to split - amazing. I think I enjoyed the fries more than the burger (sorry!!!)   Over all, I think this is a great local burger joint for Toronto that is doing some simple, and indulgent things. Its reminds me a little of In N Out - but more expensive. I'll be back again and will order a little differently I think. It was suggested to me by a frequent patron afterwards to get the Smoke option - panko crusted and fried jalapenos added to a burger. A little extra flavour was ultimately what I was missing."}
{"text":"Meh - for the price and no seats and the over hype...I'm underwhelmed. Ok the patty is great, but the double was more meat than I could ever eat. And the chilli cheese fries was one of the worst I've ever had - how can you screw up fries and cheese and chilli! $17 for a combo is a little bit RIDICULOUS for a burger.   Makes me miss Shake Shack sooooo much - this is definitely its Toronto the replacement."}
{"text":"Pricey and the burger patty is small compared to other burger joints - but BP makes damn good burgers.   I usually get their classic burger with a classic shake on the side."}
{"text":"Number 1 burger in Mississauga! Not a lot of parking but worth it."}
{"text":"My gosh... Absolutely delicious! Great old fashioned burgers. I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I got the Priest burger with the option. The meat was out of this world tasty/fresh but the burger was a bit small for the $10. Next time I'd just get the cheeseburger.  The spot has that pretentious Toronto feel to it in both the staff and customers."}
{"text":"By far the best burger I've ever had that's not cooked on my backyard bbq!!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town !!!! Order the California Classic double patty :) Their beef is ground fresh daily so it's juicy and deliiiiciousss. Their fries are addictive too! They don't taste salty and are very crispy. Make sure you check out their secret menu online prior to visiting, but be wary; some burger combos come out to $25+ after tax. The only downsides are small tables and seating area and 20+ minute waits."}
{"text":"I know a gimmick when I see one. And I'm even more certain when I taste the food. Let's start with what this place excels at: marketing. Dope theme, nice decor, cool website, and an outlandish menu (including a not-so-secret menu...stop me if you've heard of this before).  Admittedly I have not had a beef burger from here, so take my review with a grain of salt (which don't come on their fries by default but perhaps that's an American thing). I actually liked the fries with vinegar and a little salt. The mushroom burger is reminiscent of Shake Shack's and just as mediocre. There are just better and more creative ways to do vegetarian or mushroom burgers and deep frying two moderately-sized mushrooms with a glob of cheese in the middle. Anywho it was cool to say I went, but I wouldn't come back.  My friend loved his root beer float, FWIW. Meh."}
{"text":"I must say, this place has the BEST burger patty I have ever tried! I love the seasonings they use, and it was cooked to perfection, nice and juicy!  I ordered the bacon double cheese burger. It was filling, and came topped with fresh lettuce, tomato and a crunchy pickle. The bun it was served on was nice and soft. I also ordered fries, which I shared with another person. They were fresh and actually very crispy.   I haven't enjoyed a good burger like this in a very long time. I was very pleased with my experience. This place is also very reasonably priced for the amount of food that you get and the quality of the food,  The place is kind of small, limited tables and always so busy, so expect to wait for a seat if you go.  I will definitely be returning for more delicious burgers when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, don't kid yourself about that but the price is ridiculous.  Over $20 for a burger fries and a drink is way to steep in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this week but I should've gone sooner!!  They have great burgers that are full of flavor and very juicy. Not exactly the biggest burgers out there - but I like that.  They give a lot of fries which were pretty good. They were a little burnt but I still liked them. Small shoestring size.  The line-up was just out the door when I went on a Friday evening but it moved very quickly.  The staff are very friendly too.  Don't forget to get a cookie when you go! Buttery chocolately goodness. Free street parking by the theatre or you can park in the Harveys lot and walk across the street to get a better burger, like I did."}
{"text":"Went back after the grossest burger of all time (The Option) and had a bacon cheese burger. Almost made up for it. Glorious."}
{"text":"Meh, it was fine. I got the preist, a friend got the vatican city and another friend got the regular cheese burger. They don't really put much flavour into anything. The Option just tastes like cheese the mushroom and batter are just smothered and the burger isn't very flavourful. All you could taste in all the burgers was meat and cheese, which isn't as good as it sounds since everything seemed to lack seasoning or just salt.   I got all the toppings on my burger and I could barley taste any of them. The amount of toppings was really lacking on all our burgers. With such basic burgers I think if they put on a decent amount of the toppings the burger would have tasted much better.  So it tasted fine but it honestly was not worth the price of $11.30 for The priest. Especially since I was still hungry afterward and I don't really eat a lot. Also not having anywhere to sit and eat afterward is really uncomfortable, there isn't even anywhere outside that is close to sit down. We ended up eating on the bus."}
{"text":"I had the Tower of Babel, all I can taste is meat and cheese,,,,loved it! Grilled cheese top and bottom to hold in the 2 beef patties, deep fried portobello mushroom with more cheese, the usual lettuce..tomatoes....and a lot of yummy :)"}
{"text":"I always get their double bacon cheese burger.  First time, it was good.. that was during their opening week...subsequent times, it got worst. They talk a lot about their beef, but nothing else... and rightly so, because the most recent purchase resulted in a bacon that was stringy. I cook a lot of bacon and I can tell when a lower quality bacon has been used. This is a race to the bottom for them as they migrate to lower quality ingredients while keeping the same price. What can I say that haven't been said before. With all the hype, I was expecting a little better.  Did I mention the burger was a ball of grease? Holy heart-attack."}
{"text":"Just like everyone here, I decided to try this place because everyone has been saying that it's the best burger in town. I really shouldn't have that high of expectation really. Because when the burger came, I was so disgusted by all the oil dripping from the deep fried buns. Seriously? This is why it's the best burger in town? By putting more oil? I ordered the basic priest burger with vanilla shake and chili fries. It came to more than $20. I didn't know that oil is so expensive that they have to jack up the price that much. Just go to McDonald across the street and get their combos. Less oil and cheaper with bigger burgers and sodas."}
{"text":"I've seen better burgers at McDonald's.  This thing was pathetic.  A bun that makes Wonder bread look healthy.  The meat was greasy, overcooked, tiny, and way too common.  The rest was process cheese, tomatoes, etc.  Completely empty.    I've heard people compare it to a drive-through in California.  That is completely irrelevant.  If you want quick, the drive-through at McDonald's is just as quick.  Or you can forget eating, as that's even quicker."}
{"text":"First visit to Toronto, and always on the lookout for the best burger/roadfood in any town. Given the high Yelp rating and numerous other glowing articles, tBP (on Queen) appeared to be the best choice. Of course, we tried to go on Sunday - and it was closed for \"Church\". You people in Toronto are strange about your Sunday restaurant hours. Don't you still get hungry on Sunday night?  At any rate, we stayed longer in town just to ensure we could make it to tBP, and we were so glad we did. Easily a top 5 favorite cheeseburger, and we've eaten a lot of high-rated burgers in a lot of places. It is an absolute must-visit in town if you like burgers.   We had the standard burger (which is a double) with cheese. The burger was greasy, and the simple toppings were fresh and complementary (but didn't stand apart like many fancy gourmet places) - they were simply in service of the burger. The beef is amazing. The only thing I could possibly say *might* have improved the burger would have been a pinch of pepper, but even then, that might have intruded on the perfection of the meat, cheese, grease, bun, topping combination. A really quality, big, greasy burger.  The fries are good, but just okay. Maybe they would be better with the chili cheese option, but my waistline can't handle that and a double cheeseburger, too. No eating in the restaurant, and cash only. Weather permitting, take your treasure to the park kitty-corner across the street, and chow down, lie back, and wonder how life got this good."}
{"text":"Why the hype.  Double cheesburger was worse than a Big Mac for twice the price.  Very confused???????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"just loved this place! we were a bit skeptical walking in, its tiny, not a sit down and the staff (also owners) tho nice are a bit aggressive (burger pushers!) with selling their burgers (makes sense cos we found out they had been open just 2 weeks at that point).  the burgers are just delicious, juicy, fresh and so much flavor. they're messy and packed in foil which makes the eating experience that much yummy. and their fries are insanely good, perfect, also packed in foil, long and shoestringy (its how i like my fries!). for a small joint, the burgers are on the pricey side, but they're so good its totally worth it. around $10-15 per meal. they don't take debit so make sure u have cash. downside: its all the way out in the beaches, i've only been once but dream of heading back...wish it wasn't so far!   must try: cheeseburger with fried onions and absolutely must try the fries! :)"}
{"text":"If you're willing to remortgage your home to feed your rampant burger habbit, then there's no better place to go to score your meat sweat high than Burger's Priest.   Just remember, they only take cash, so start giving handy's outside and you can afford the combo. (But for $20 for a burger and fries, I should be getting the handy?!).  Good; yes. Overrated; also yes."}
{"text":"Over-hyped! The beef itself is good but patties are thin. I could easily have 3 or 4 no prob. 2 wasn't enough. The bread is pathetic. Toppings mediocre. Price unreasonable"}
{"text":"Restaurant: The Burger's Priest Cuisine: Burgers Location: The Beaches Address: 1636 Queen St E Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 2 Service: 2 Ambiance: 1 Overall: 1.5  Extra information:  *Eat in or Take Out *Specialize in Burgers *Closed on Sundays  The much praised Burger's Priest is located just a 5 minute drive from Toronto Downtown. This was my first time going east from Toronto Downtown and it was kind of exciting (maybe a little). The drive wasn't very long and we shortly arrived at the Burger's Priest. If you drive there, they have street parking at the front and it's $2 for an hour.  Apparently they always close on Sundays because they go to church (note the burgers PRIEST) because the owners are very religious people.  I read couple reviews before going in and many people mentioned how small the store is but obviously I didn't have a good idea until going in.The store is VERY VERY tiny. I wouldn't even say that you can Dine-in in here, all they had were 4 stools against the wall. Usually people do Take out from the Burger's Priest but I decided to Dine-in because I like to be a rebel (but really, it was too cold to do take out and eat it in the park nearby like some reviewers suggested I should).  They specialize in Burgers and Fries, varying from double burger, cheeseburger, the priest burger, fries and chili fries. You can add fried onions or bacon to your burger for a $1 if you wish.  Ordered: Priest Burger - 2.5/5   *Regular Cheese Burger with the 'Priest' (deep fried 2 portobello mushroom with cheese in between) for $9.99 plus tax *the price does not include drinks or fries *Bread is soft but it's just too small to hold all the ingredients/toppings that's inside *Meat patty is cooked to Medium and is juicy throughout *You get the option of toppings and I just added everything to the Burger (ketchup, pickle, mustard and mayo) because I am just too lazy to pick and choose *First 2-3 bite of the Burger was really good.  *The soft bun, juicy patty and the crispness of the priest went really well together *After couple bites, regardless of all the fresh ingredients inside the burger, everything became really mushy and there was no texture *Taste and Texture was same before you start chewing and after you chew  *Outside of the 'priest' is crispy but the cheese between 2 mushroom patties were cold (so I am assuming these are pre-made and reheated once you order your burger) *Too much going on in the Burger and it's just a giant mess at the end  Ordered: Chili Cheese Fries 1/5  *French fries drench with chili and topped with cheddar cheese $5.79 *Read reviews about how their fries are not very good so decided to try their chili fries. *They were just ok and not the best chili fries I've tried *The fries were too mushy to be made into chili cheese fries *This just turned into a big mush of potato later  Anyways, thank god I got there early right after they opened because it gets super busy here. Maybe it was my fault for wanting to Dine-in but half way through my burger, there were so many people standing around me it was so uncomfortable. It's just hard to eat when people are elbowing your back as you are trying to hold the burger together. Plus they don't have anything to do while waiting for their order so they just stare at you while you get ketchup all over your face.  Summary:  People working behind the counter wasn't the nicest and the Priest burger was just too much for me in terms of price and taste plus I had hard time even finishing it cause of the texture. It's an interesting idea to have the deep fried portobello mushroom patty in between but I found it to be nothing special and felt like it was over-rated. If I wanted a burger, I would much prefer to visit Big Smoke Burger down the street or even McDonalds."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!!! Very clean, Staff is always very friendly and love the interior!! Highly recommend this burger place"}
{"text":"I am sure you think you know the best burger place in Toronto but if you haven't been here before you have no idea what you're missing. The place is tiny, u can't sit, u just order and get out. The burgers are absolutely amazing. The patties are all fresh, u see them in front of u so no secrets no frozen meat and when they come out just a heavenly experience. Stop reading this and go have yourself an amazing burger."}
{"text":"Good burger for the quickness of how they prepare it. I enjoy my burgers medium rare and i believe all burger priest locations now have to cook them to well done do to their growing number of chains they have now in the gta.  It use to rival Shake shack back then when it was cooked medium rare and you had the option of asking for it done like that.  Still a good well done burger."}
{"text":"It was that good. I've read about this place for a while, and was really excited to try. Perfectly cooked juicy loose-packed beef. Yummy melty cheesy goodness. Perfect bun. LOVE."}
{"text":"Just ordered take-out for two, fresh meat meets hot grill (of the flat-top variety) food came quick, fries were typical diner style - crisp and fresh and yes the burger was very close to if not better than L.A.'s In-N-Out Burger. TBP's version is actually a lot fresher.  great new burger joint will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out last night -- it was packed! There was a huge line up outside just to get into the place, but I wanted to wait it out because if people are willing to wait 20-30 minutes in line for a burger -- it must be one hell of a burger right?  I got the cheeseburger and regular fries. I wanted to try the chili cheese fries, but I was worried I wouldn't have enough room to finish them after I ate the burger.  It took another 20 or so minutes to wait for our order after it was taken -- almost 1 hour of waiting altogether. Thank goodness it wasn't cold outside.  Finally -- we got our burgers in our hands and a chance to taste the fries. Overall it was nothing out of the ordinary. The bag it came in was accumulating grease stains by the minute. The burger itself was fine, it tasted fresh and it was good. But it had ben squished because the fries were sitting on top of it. The fries were not that great -- I've had better. I came home and poured the fries out on a plate and they were all stuck together.   I may go back, because the burger was decent, but it is definitely not worth an hour of my time."}
{"text":"This is my go to burger place in Etobicoke. The food is the exact same as the other locations around the city. This is a newly constructed restaurant which is bigger than their other locations with more seating. Although the one thing I don't like about their seating is that the tables are so small!  My favorite burger is the Priest. I checked out their secret menu online and have never ordered from it although I often hear people ordering the Vatican. Not sure how I feel about two grilled cheese sandwiches as the burger bun although my young sun loves the grilled cheese which it pretty much buns dipped in melted butter pressed with processed cheese inside. One order taker called that the Vatican without anything inside.  The service is always good and quick. Try coming early to avoid crazy long lineups.  Oh and try the chocolate chip cookie. It's really good."}
{"text":"I really do love BP but this location cannot manage to get an order right. I'm not sure where the disconnect is but the last last few times I've been to this location I've received incorrect orders despite correcting the cashier NUMEROUS times! I really don't know how \"the works and extra pickles\" can be misunderstood to mean only pickles, no pickles, or nothing - yet here we are. For the price of the burgers I'd think they'd be a little more concerned with getting things right."}
{"text":"Have heard lots of great reviews and finally made it. First impression, delicious smell and tiny tables. The seating area was packed with a line up. We quickly grabbed a table that was being cleared by customers leaving. You make order, they give you a number and you wait to be called. My son ordered the cheeseburger which he loved. My husband ordered the Priest burger with vegan combo which he enjoyed. I had the vegetarian which was a stuffed mushroom with cheese that burst out. Overall we enjoyed all burgers. What disappointed us were the fries. We ordered 3 fries but only finished one pack. Not a fan at all, appeared to be made with old oil. May consider ordering burgers not fries again."}
{"text":"Had a Double cheese burger, it was way too greasy. felt  like having a heart attack afterwards. definitely not worth the money"}
{"text":"Oh, The Burger's Priest! It took me too long to get here. It was a perfect day at Woodbine Beach and just a short walk away is BP in Leslieville. The place is tiny and an ordering only zone. Luckily, Woodbine park is around the corner for a summer day. Service was friendly and patient to newcomers. I was incredibly excited when I saw balls of freshly ground beef, waiting to be pounded out on the grill.   The burger was astounding. The meat retained all of it's juices and tasted the way a homemade burger should. You could make out the meat's true texture perfectly with no indication of any fillers. The bun held together nicely and was a great addition to the classic cheeseburger feel.   The fries were piping hot and wonderful. I wish they had a better system for taking ketchup to go instead of just squirting as much as desired straight into the bag. However they still tasted great with their golden, crispy crust.   The beach and burgers may not be the perfect combo if you're at all concerned about your bikini. But as far as I can tell, I am not about put any limits on when I'll indulge in The Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait ! Ordered a double cheese burger all was prepared and seasoned well. The fries are not the greatest but hey I didnt come for the fries. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. The vegetarian option, ironically called 'option' was uninspired and forgettable. The fries were cold and the graveyard was complete congealed. There a pretty long wait time also."}
{"text":"This place was really busy! I went on a Friday night though. I got the Priest and i absolutely loved \"The Option.\" It def'n makes the burger! I took away a star because the patties weren't charcoal grilled and tasted very similar to 5 guy burgers. Also, it was def'n processed cheese. But, overall, pretty good!"}
{"text":"Amazing veggie burger. Portobello wrapped in cheese and bread crumbs and deep fried. Occasionally it is not cooked as well as it should. Still cold in the middle. I would guess they are initiallyfrozen. They have messed up my order twice and once really messed up the order of the person in front of me. Pretty pricey. I haven't tried the meat burgers yet because the Veggie Option are so good"}
{"text":"In my opinion, better than Shake Shack in New York, and better than In and Out in California. Priest makes the best burgers I have had in my entire life. I keep it simple, bacon cheeseburger. I don't go all out and get the grilled cheese buns triple stacked burgers. The fries are always on point. You can get an option such as a deep fried jalapeno that is sliced and then put inside the burger. So goddamn worth it. I want to try the chili cheese fries which look unreal. The lineup and wait can get quite long, but good things come to those who wait."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger ive ever had the pleasure of eating (unless I recall my first encounter with mcdonalds back in '97). Expensive but boy is it worth every penny. Been there 2-3 times and its been packed! Definitely a take out place!"}
{"text":"Hnads down! One of the top three burgers in tdot. I tried to finish the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse and failed. I had to sit back and bask in my greasy burger bliss. The preachy pattie is so great and should be cooked with smoke. Awesome shakes too. The fries and rings are good as well. Don't sleep on this ( like a day at sunday church ) get your self down here and try one of torontos greatest burgers!"}
{"text":"Secret menu is the only way to go- visit their website before making a visit as it's not posted on location!  I've ordered the cheeseburger a couple times at other locations and it was good but not over the top. Most recent visit- burger was damn good!  I ordered the Vactican City- double cheese burger smack dab in the middle of two grilled cheese buns.  Sceptic are you...I was...just try it! Split my burger with a friend so not fully committal- guilty! If you're getting the burger I'd suggest skipping the fries not crazy about them. Not crispy enough for my liking.  Customer service was great! While the customer was finishing their debit transaction the employee started taking my order. Quick and efficient! Lines are expected but move fast.  All in all a stack of napkins is required."}
{"text":"So good.  I had the high priest burger last night.  High priest = better quality big mac.  The meat is so juicy and the bottom bun soaks it all up.    They only take cash.    Do it."}
{"text":"We started planning our trip to Toronto months ago, and it was supposed to be centered around the Sting/Peter Gabriel concert..... nah, we came for BURGERS!!!!! There just happened to be a concert while we were here!!! Seriously, these are the best damned... err, darned burgers I have ever had. I swear the best food comes from unpretentious small hole in the wall places. This time I chose not to go to the secret menu and had their version of  \"tow all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun.\" OMG... err, golly gee, it was SOOOO AMAZING!!! I would tell you what my wife got, but I was way too busy stuffing meat into my mouth to even notice. The portion for fries is generous, so we split an order. I am writing this now because in about 2 hours I will once again be reveling in a sea of crusty cow goodness... oh yeah, me likey da burger."}
{"text":"Best burgers I've ever eaten. Period.   My only squabble is to do with the size and ambience inside. The burgers are best eaten right after preparation. Unfortunately, there is only 4 stools inside the place, and no elbow room. The parking lot next door is usually quite empty, so you can eat out there.   Will be perfect when they move to a bigger place and start serving beer."}
{"text":"It seems that as BP continues to expand with more locations, the service, food quality and price seems to deteriorate.   4 friends and I decided to stop by last night while in Port Credit. It was between BP and Papa Guissepes, we made a mistake.   The burger was mediocre at most. I ordered the $10 Priest which is a cheeseburger with an Option: deep fried porotebello mushroom stuffed with cheese within a panko crust. Meh. They deep fried it way too early, even before the beef hit the griddle. This meant a hot burger and cold deep fried mushroom. Gross.   The $7 chili cheese fries were a problem. The fries were the bad batch end of the fryer type with burnt crisps, fries the size of half my pinky finger and watered down chili that tasted like it was frozen. I kid you not when I say fast food chains like Wendys and Tim Hortons have better chili than BP.   Overall, with a burger fries and drink, $20 was not well spent. I will not return to BP ever again."}
{"text":"Came to Burher's Priest on a Monday evening, to see if the OG location served better burgers than the other's. Verdict: they all taste the same, and quality has decreased in recent years with a new flat top griddle which allows for faster cooked burgers (cutting corners).  It was busy and the girl working the cash seemed very distressed at the non-stop phone calls, Uber eats orders, and in-store customers, and when I got to the cash she gave me a long eye-roll (Like wtf do you want) sort of look. Cool. It's Family Day, you're busy. I understand, but I don't respect that level of service.  I watched the young gentleman behind the counter talk VERY rudely to an Uber Eats Driver who spoke little english and was picking up an order. So rudely, that he began screaming at poor man yelling \"VOCALIZE YOUR ORDER NUMBER TO ME\"!!!! It was quite disturbing.  Anyhow, after 25 minutes, I received my Priest and Heavvy. They were tasty, and similar to other BP locations.   I likely would not return to this location just based on the service and attitude of the staff who work here."}
{"text":"Came in for a burger on a Friday evening. Called ahead of time for a double hamburger with the works. The burger was ready upon arrival, and it had all the appropriate fixins. The meat was cooked well, and overall, it was very tasty.  I will return for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I honestly consider this the best burger joint in Toronto. The burgers are made with fresh ingredients and their meat is mouth watering. They are growing steadily with new options it seems every time I go in. They offer some funky options and some things you never thought you wanted to eat until you sae the menu. The only downside I would say is that its a little pricey. Theres no combo option to save you some money; you would have to pay for fries and a drink seperately which obviously adds up to a lot especially if you get those cravings. Expect to pay $14-18. Im not saying its not worth the money to have a game changing burger experience, but be smart with your portions."}
{"text":"Really great burgers with creative (but not silly) toppings. Anything with the chilli & cheese on it is really tasty. If you order the mint chocolate shake: it is 99% mint (at least mine was - still good though!)."}
{"text":"Long line.  Really long, which speaks to the popularity of the place.  My bf grabbed two burgers (the one with two patties and cheese in the middle) as well as chilli fries and we headed out to a nearby park to eat them.  Amazing.  The burgers live up to their reputation.  I'd place this spot as the number 1 burger joint in the city.  My previous favourite was Five Guys Burgers but that now is a distant second.   Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if had the choice. I ordered through uber eats. I ordered chilli fries and a cheese burger. After waiting almost an 1hr for my food to arrive, I took a few bites out of my fries only to realize there was hair in my food. Immediately spit out everything that was in my mouth and threw out the rest of my food. I can usually be a little understanding if I find hair in my food - mistakes happen, but the hair was short and resembled nose hair and makes me question sanitation procedures at this restaurant. Uber was kind enough to to resolve my issue. I am never going to this location again."}
{"text":"Decent burgers, pretty greasy tho. Decent price, prefer going to The Works for the $$$"}
{"text":"Definitely the best burgers in Canada. The High Priest is a classier version of the Big Mac and the Vatican is just heaven. (No pun intended)"}
{"text":"EDIT  ** My most recent burger here was suspiciously chewy with weird bits of connective tissue or beef by-product blended into the patty, something entirely new with a nasty texture sticking to the crowns of the molars.   Was kinda grossed out. Considering the prices have only gone heavenward since the Priest was sold, I can't see how they justify such a drop in the quality of the beef, or think I couldn't tell. So now I tell. The toppings are still meagre and lack emphasis, particularly the lifeless fake cheese slices. I would actually take these home and add aged cheddar and slivers of sour kosher pickles to wake this thing the hell up - sadly funny because the Priest brand pretends to be so dope.  Please don't start to suck badly, BP or use nasty filler meat, it would be a sin. I will give you a chance to redeem yourself...  ** END EDIT  I've gotten used to the mushy style of burger here, it's OK but you are probably getting your full quota of grease and salt for the day.  For this reason I do not recommend bacon with the cheeseburger, just too much salt! The double cheeseburger is decent value. I want to try the Californian next.  I did try the Vatican or whatever it s called with the burger sandwiched in two buttery grilled cheese buns, very fun and tasty to eat. They do take some creative chances here.  Note TBP cooks only to order and stocks only fresh beef. This can mean 15-30 minute waits in a crowded area and they sometimes run out a bit early if quIte busy. (Happened once to me, no beef only portobello veggie sandwich.) The quality and demand still prevails.  Only once I had a bit of gross chlorine taste on the tomatoes or lettuce or something. That seems a bit careless.  This place is tiny, barely any room to stand order and leave rather than eat. Basically ZERO civic space or benches at this location, and unfortunately the burgers are best enjoyed right away not at home. So you might have to improvise there and eat on the sidewalk like the local rubbies. It's kind of funny!  Fast, acceptable food in an incredibly awkward little location and space, worth a try. It was good enough to get me past a few questionable experiences."}
{"text":"The large line-up outside implied that this place would be amazing; it wasn't. It looked and tasted like an ordinary cheeseburger to me. The burger in itself was good because calling even an ordinary cheeseburger bad would be terribly un-American; however, it certainly was not $10-good. My friends took me here swearing it's the best burger joint in Toronto, but I really don't see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Yummy veggie burger (The Option) but it's on the small end and waits tend to be a while since the lines are long."}
{"text":"This is probably sacrilege, but I'm calling out Burger's Priest for being overrated. This is not the be all and end all burger. At least not for me.   I had a High Priest (no cheese) at this location the other day.   Problems with this burger:  1. Too greasy. I know the difference between juicy meat and grease that's dripping off the cooked sides of the burger patties because the line cook was either too sloppy or lazy to drain the patty for a tenth of a second by tilting the spatula before transferring that grease-laden greaseball to my bun. This was not meat juices from the centre of a juicy patty dripping onto my wax paper. This was undrained grease from the grill. I do not necessarily want grill grease as my secret condiment. What's the stupid name for that secret ingredient on the secret menu? \"The Priest's Embrace\"? Because it makes you feel all dirty and covered in filth?   2. Not enough seasoning. I'm not asking for anything more than salt and pepper. There's hardly a speck of either to be found in this burger. I can taste unseasoned meat and I can taste grill grease. That's about it.   3. The bun is wholly inadequate given that they're slathering grill grease onto this burger like it's mustard. I ate this burger in the restaurant as soon as I got it. The bun was instantly soggy and only held up to all of the grill grease maybe halfway through my burger consumption. If I had even walked to my car and tried eating it there, the extra minute or two would have rendered this bun nothing more than wet pieces of greasy bread. Would this bun be adequate if they did a proper job of draining their patties of grill grease? Perhaps.   4. The worst pickles of any fast food burger I've ever tried. Seriously. They should be going into a confessional booth to atone for these atrocities. These pickles are too thin, too flabby, and they have a weird bitter taste rather than a bright, sour bite. If Five Guys' pickles are a 10, these flabby discs are a 2.   5. Not enough toppings. If you're not going to season the patties with anything other than grill grease, at least give me an adequate amount of well seasoned toppings. I barely had the lightest schmear of the wannabe Big Mac sauce on my burger. I could barely taste it. It certainly wasn't competing with the taste of grill grease. Perhaps they were concerned (and rightly so) that if they had added more than the slightest amount of sauce, this bun would have been a goner.   6. Not really a comment about the burger, but another issue is that if I come to a Burger's Priest, I can never order a side with my burger because the fries are not good and that's the only side they offer.  Unless I'm dragged to a BP by a buddy, I probably won't be making my way back. There are just too many better burgers out there to waste my stomach space on these problematic burgers."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about the Burger's Priest I was really excited to try it, and that's putting it lightly. Let's put my excitement into perspective. I'm from Mississauga and the drive into Toronto can sometimes be lengthy. I brought my childhood bible with me for the ride in. I read scriptures to myself, and friends, I held the book out to other drivers caught in traffic, and showed them Jesus. Unfortunately I can be a little agressive and the book was torn to shreds by the time I got home. Sorry Jesus, you're still that my friend.  Now onto something more relevant....  The food was excellent. Juicy, flavorful. I like it. I ordered two burgers because I was just that excited. They were really good, but I still like holy chuck better. Still very good though, definitely try it.   The service was adequate, as well as the interior of the location. Nothing fancy here.   Try it if you're   A) hungry B) a fan of good burgers C) into nonsense religious gimmicks   Cheerio!"}
{"text":"Fave burgers in the city. I'm not a burger person but these ones are so good. I will also recommend their chilli fries !   The only thing I don't like it's the space is small and their chairs and tables are for like toddlers  lol"}
{"text":"The meat is really good. Loosely packed, coarsely ground, juicy, and beefy. The seasoning on this patty is very subtle, but the beefy juiciness really carries through.   The fries, as others have mentioned, are not great. Probably not even good. They're under seasoned, anemic, and they get cold and hard pretty quickly. I ate about three or four fries. Next time I'll just get a large burger and no fries. Don't waste the stomach space on these duds when you could be filling it up with juicy meat on a perfectly soft hamburger bun."}
{"text":"Great place, long line though. But it was totally worth the wait. Got the high priest, double cheesburger and fries. Fries are either blanched or double fried, very crunchy and the burger was very good, well seasoned, secret sauce was delicious! Would definately recommend if you have 30 mins to wait for a burger."}
{"text":"A delicious, freshly-ground chuck burger with multiple options to entertain and challenge the tastebuds. The simple cheeseburger is delicious, but the more complex flavours of the Californian and size of the Vatican City may be more exciting for many who decide to dine here. The fries are well-seasoned are plentiful in a serving.   What this location - and indeed, all Burger Priest locations - lack is ambiance. This location is plagued by music played too loud, and a lack of tables and chairs for the clientele. While this is an enviable position to be in for any restaurant, and the line-up-and-wait-for-your-number-to-be-called is endearing the first couple of times, it's not the kind of atmosphere that is easily accepted by the whole family, and certainly not by someone you're taking out for a date.   Great food, though."}
{"text":"Ordered from Burger Priest / Just Eat. Last time it took so long for the driver to pick up the food was soggy and disgusting so I threw it out. This time I made sure I called the restaurant to make sure they didn't get it ready to early. They said \"the order is ready and the courrier will be picking it up in 7 mins\". So I said that's a long time for it to sit there, can you please make sure you make it fresh closer to the pick up time? The answer: I don't think so. Seriously. Worst customer service ever. I'm paying $24 for a burger and fries, I expect it to be fresh. You clearly don't care about your paying customers. Will never order from there again. Bring on McDonald and Uber Eats!"}
{"text":"I'll admit it. From time to time, I pray at the alter of The Priest.  Their burgers are a lot like the In n Out burgers on the West Coast. They have a bunch of fancy pants options but I usually stick to the cheeseburger and fries and find that's more than enough food."}
{"text":"My fam love the BP bacon double cheese burger. My mom loves the Pope so much. We always wished BP on Yonge had more tables until we discovered this Vaughan joint! Staff is super smiley and nice, most of all, you wouldn't feel uncomfortable when coming here with entire family due to the spacious sitting area. Yup my double cheese burger was awesome, and we liked fries somewhat different from what I'm used to in other BP joints (not dark brown! Not greasy! Sign of clean frying oil?! Small batch frying?!) We prolly won't go to other BP locations any more."}
{"text":"Their burgers are definitely top notch burgers - hands down. Super delicious and mouth watering. Only thing is, my burger had a lot of oil :( but still good :)"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre for me..  If you're expecting something as good as new york's shake shack, I am sure you will be disappointed.  Not really worth for waiting half an hour for a burger in the uncomfortable small space.  Just made Fries were good."}
{"text":"I made a point to go to Burger's Priest within a few days of eating at Holy Chuck to reaffirm my faith and repent my cheating ways (and gluttony...)  It's confirmed, Burger's Priest IS better than Holy Chuck.  The burger patty is better, the toppings are better, and they're just cooler cuz they were here first.  I'll admit, there are a few things I wish about Burger's Priest: I wish they took credit cards, and I wish there was somewhere to sit. Their fries could also be crunchier...but the important thing is, THE BURGER TASTES BETTER! And is slightly cheaper, by a dollar or two. And that's enough to make it worth the trek out there....  I can't wait until they open the new location at Yonge/Lawrence."}
{"text":"So the line up to get the burgers is quite long, but moves fast. It definitely was worth the wait. But I think I would have to workout 10 times harder this week because of what we ate from here yesterday.  My friend ordered the \"Tower of Babel\" and I had a Cheeseburger with Fries. That burger my friend ordered was a heart attack on a bun.... No wait, I mean, heart attack between two grilled cheese sandwiches and a bunch of other fatty and artery clogging goodness. YES. It was good, but really fattening! So if you are on a diet, I'm sorry, just buy a side salad across the street from Harvey's if they have any.  The cheeseburger that I ordered was just perfect for my liking and my appetite and the fries were good, not amazing. But good enough for me to like eat it everyday if I wasn't on a diet or like if I was skinny and just never gains a single pound. The meat was delicious and tender and the whole thing just like literally melts in your mouth....(i'm not sure about the rest of you but that's how my burger was like when I ate it/. lol)  I totally forgot to mention that my fatass friend also bought two cookies as well and they were amazing!  I cannot wait to go back, maybe in a few more months? This place is REALLY good... but not if you're on a diet."}
{"text":"One of the more overrated burger joints I've been to.  I came here a few months back with friends before going to a movie. Not only was I offput by the cramped seating conditions, but the cashier seemed to be disenchanted and not caring about much of anything, delivering menu suggestions in a bored monotone.  I had the double burger combo, which incredibly came out to just over $16. I don't care who you are or how good you think your burgers are. If you're charging gourmet/restaurant prices for what is ostensibly a Big Mac without the branding, you're going to have do a lot better in terms of pricing.  As far as the burger goes, it was alright. Nothing mind-blowing, compared to what some of my friends and former co-workers had hyped the place up to be. It does taste like a Big Mac, but again, the prices just don't warrant it, even if the quality is good.  I found the fries to be very greasy and ended up giving half away to the rest of my group. I don't think I'd come back here again. The quirky menu and decent burger isn't enough to offset the high price and mediocre seating/staff conditions."}
{"text":"Small, cozy, pungent, it is one those burger joint you'd expect.  Seats are very limited (maybe 12?) so either go there on off peak hours or take away.  Check out their tacit secret menu, which is explicitly posted online.  I ordered myself a Tower of Babel and that is one of the best thing I have had in Toronto.  The fried portobello mushroom ball has too much cheese in it IMO.  They customize orders as well, so order a 10x10 if you crave for a heart attack.  I will eat that any day I am around the jawn.  Yea I said jawn, I am from Philly.   The End."}
{"text":"Cold bun , cold cheese. Shitty greasy fries.  A Big Mac meal is better.   The option had cold cheese not melting. The bun was ice cold.  It was shit.  Thank for the $30 bill.   Nothing special. U could've made 10 burgs on BBQ for same price."}
{"text":"Yum, yum and more yum! I can't say enough good things about their burgers and combinations. The option is a MUST on everything I get even if it's not included. That mushroom stuffed with godly cheese is heaven! Never get a burger without it.. Literally.  Great atmosphere, small but the people are what make it so enjoyable and the food is bomb!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of The Priest Burgers as I have gone to the Queen location many of times since our place is within 5 minutes of them both. However I don't know what it is but I don't find the burgers as good or as fresh as the Queen Street location. Not to mention both times I have ate from this location I got sick, my hubby got sick and my mother. The bun tasted like gasoline or some odd motor flavor. Even though this was a few months back, we haven't been back to that location since. It's unfortunate but I think we will stick to our original location along Queen St. West."}
{"text":"And on the 7th day, God rested. But before he did he created Burger's Priest and saw that it was good. Very good."}
{"text":"Not impressed; did I just have an overpriced Big Mac? I also thought we were getting away from cash... (This place is cash only!!) in short $27 bucks for two Big Macs, fries and a can of Pepsi.. Well you tell Me."}
{"text":"If you are looking for juicy tasty fresh burger - this is the place."}
{"text":"Sorry, I wasn't wowed by the burger at all. I had the High Priest, and I felt that the burger itself lacked flavour, there wasn't enough sauce. It was too dry.   Seating was uncomfortable and crowded. Too pricy for what you get. Definitely disappointing, I'd definitely check out other burger places before returning here."}
{"text":"Initially, Burgers Priest didn't wow me, but I've been converted. Yes, it's expensive, but I like that they make their ground beef on-site and clearly use quality ingredients.   My go-to is (still) the High Priest but I ask for it well done so it's not too messy. The Fiery Furnace is pretty close to the SmokeShack burger at Shake Shack. That alone is worth a visit in my eyes.  If you want one of the best burgers in the city at a reasonable price, Burgers Priest is the place to go. I love that they have chili cheese fries and banana milkshakes, both of which are few and far between in Toronto."}
{"text":"Awesomeness at every bite!  This place is definitely heavenly when it comes to a unique burger that delivers in an evil that is more welcome than sunshine these days!!!!  I have been here several times and always,always,always it is going to be busy but equally worth the wait!  I am here to just reassure you that you must give it a try and you must get the The Priest!  Look at my picture of these beautiful creations from above ;)"}
{"text":"Having started our Saturday rather late, we decided to grab a bite to eat here on the way to get groceries, and though it was past lunch time (2pm) it was so crowded that there was barely standing room in which to order and wait. We lucked out on a table, but there is very limited seating, so you might consider grabbing it to go and finding a spot of sunshine nearby.  I'd heard rave reviews about this place before, but, being vegetarian I hadn't made a point of going. I have been missing out, as it is actually the best veggie burger in the city! Roasted and breaded, cheese-stuffed, non-greasy Portobello mushrooms with an airy toasted bun and whichever toppings you choose. No skimping on ingredients, not too much sauce, and no overwhelming mushroom taste! A good balance of flavours, which is really what a good burger should be about, veggie or otherwise. Also, portion size is perfect; it is not so giant that you regret eating it afterwards.   Those I was with had a Double Cheeseburger and The Priest. The Double Cheese was \"amazing, as ever, but the bun was too dry\", and The Priest was \"divine\". Prices range from $5.49 to $15.99, so this is a gourmet burger. I also noticed a grilled cheese ice cream sandwich on the menu, which I will need to try, being a fan of both grilled cheese and ice cream sandwiches. Any place with the guts to experiment with these institutions requires my attention.  I love that they give you each burger in a neat little paper bag, it stops things from dripping all over the place! So, points for actual burger deliciousness, delivery, and how nice the cooks were. Not a perfect score for limited seating, longish wait time, and not accepting cards!   Bring cash, and be sure to sneak a peek at the secret menu online before going!"}
{"text":"After watching Burger Wars Toronto, we knew we had to try Burgers Priest and P&L Burger (which are on the same street )while visiting Toronto. We never made it to Dangerous Dans. The plan...one go to BP, one to P&L and meet back at the car for a food fest. We got the Tower of Babel and the Religious Hypocrite from the \"secret menu\" and fries. I thought a grilled cheese made out of hamburger buns would be dry, but it was nice and moist aka greasy! :-D The Tower of Babel was huge and delicious. The fries were really good too. The Religious Hypocrite is a cheese stuffed mushroom \"partty\" topped with bacon. This was also pretty good. I prefer the mushrooms at Shake Shack in New York.   It's a small place with very few seats on a street that is a little scary at night. While eating in the car, we were serenaded by the guy above the YMCA calling the cops across the street \"f'ing pigs\" over and over!!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place till about 2 months ago. I was clueless. My friend brought me here, telling me these burger are awesome. I was a little doubtful as he doesn't have the taste in food....  Well boy was I wrong! These are awesome!!!  I order 3 of the blue steel (blue cheese, no bacon) and they were killer. Only sad part (and the reason I ordered 3) is the burgers are small. Not to worry still packed full of juicy meatiness!!!!  My husband ordered The Vatican City (Double cheeseburger sandwiched between two grilled cheese buns) and yes it is just as good as it sounds; I snagged a bite.  The fries aren't bad, but note if you are in the Lakeshore area the priest is across the street from Smokey poutine ( Make an awesome combo yourself, I did).  Yes these burgers are pricey but they are worth it, 100%  I just wish they were bigger.. oh well.. I can keep hoping."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow (there was about 3 customers ahead of me only and they only ordered a burger each). When I finally got my burger it wasn't even warm let alone hot, the buns were cold. I had ate at burger priest before at their downtown location and remember that the cheese would ooze out of the veggie patty, but at this location it did not. The cheese had already cooled down and was getting cold. I probably would not return to this location."}
{"text":"Get the priest burger and make sure you have the portobello mushroom inside and get ready to melt away in burger heaven. You can taste the freshness of the patty. Too bad it's a bit on the pricey side..."}
{"text":"Really teetering here between a 4 and a 5 star review, but overall had to go with 4 for a few very small reasons.   Positives - AMAZING FOOD. Well, burgers at least. The combination of texture, tastes, spices, and their \"special sauce\" was just amazing - by far the best burger I've had in Toronto. The fries I got were average, but the burger definitely carried the meal. If you do end up stopping here, I highly recommend the High Priest - well worth their price.  Negatives - Not too many of these, but it was hard to dine in the restaurant with such small tables and seating arrangements, but that probably wasn't their intention. Also something I didn't like was the impatient cook staff - if you don't go get your food the instant they call your name (I was late by like 30 secs) they impatiently yell much louder. Not to mention the mediocre fries.   Overall, though, the amazing quality and fast service time of the burger is too much to pass up. Come here if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Absolute BEST burger all around.  I would definitely call myself a regular at Burger's Priest. I've had items on the secret menu as well as the regular menu and I've never left feeling disappointed.   I've been to several locations as well but I've always enjoyed the upper beaches the most. Perhaps because it was the first one I've ever been too and I've never looked back.  The good: - Moist Juicy BEEF!  - Good quality - Different types of buns - Thick creamy milkshakes - simple but flavourful - service is quick and efficient - price is reasonable   The bad (minor issues):  - Lack of seating (at this particular location, but they've learned to expand at others) - you want to keep eating - The fries (I won't lie, I would still choose mcdonald's fries over this) - Can get very smoky and you can come out smelling like food  If you go here, try the classics first and work your way up to the more \"complex\" burgers, and don't forget to try the secret menu out! :)"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's because I didn't eat till 7pm, or the food was just really good.  But I'm in love with Burger's Priest, and I can see what the hype is all about!!  As I said, I haven't eaten the whole day, so I got their $15 combo meal, I think it was called 'The Right Choice' or something like that. Don't panic over the $15 price tag, it's only because I was famished. The combo came with a double cheeseburger, chili cheesefries, a cookie and a can of pop.  The burger was thee freshest burger I have ever had in my life. To the toppings, bun and most importantly the beef!! Juicy and melt in your mouth!   The chili cheese fries though could have been better if there was a bit more tomato sauce, either that, or the fries just soaked them all up. But it ran a little dry.  The cookie was .... Well a cookie. Nothing to rave about it.  It's a loud environment, with limited seating. The staff though are super friendly. They call out your orders with both a given number and your first name.  I will for sure be coming back! Love their burgers!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment, a rip off compared to other local burger joints. I added all the free toppings (which are like lettuce tom onions and pickles) and I could still mostly taste the patty only and I really do enjoy my vegetables. The patties itself are alright but for their price they should be much bigger. I paid 5 $ extra for the combo, they gave me a can of pop and a bag of fries that tasted like fried cardboard. I couldn't even finish them because they made me feel sick halfway through.  I'm most likely never going back again."}
{"text":"The burgers at Burger Priest are very tasty! My only complaint is that the burgers are too small for me (lol). I ordered the Holy Smokes burger from their Secret Menu. It's a double cheeseburger topped with panko-crusted deep-fried jalapenos. It was really good but the way it was made was very sloppy. My guess is because this is a new location that just opened up at Mississauga's Lakeshore area and the staff are fairly new so give them time to perfect their craft. I also ordered Chili Cheese Fries on the side and they were good too.   Overall, the burgers are delicious but I wish they were bigger and the way they are made could be neater."}
{"text":"I've been here many times with my boyfriend when we're around the area running errands, we usually order from BP (in restaurant or delivery) about once or twice a month as a treat on a really busy week/end. While I admit it is pricey for fast food, but it is the best burgers we've had in Toronto! They are so juicy and full of flavour, if you thought Five-Guys or P&L in TO was amazing, this is the top of the top. There's always a lineup on the weekends and that should say something about their food.  Yesterday, we ordered delivery through skipthedishes, which we have many times, however this time our food came cold and fries were soggy. I followed up with skipthedishes this morning and the restaurant manager Des quickly got on the phone with me within minutes of notifying skip, Des offered to make this right for us and investigate the situation with the courier. I didn't expect such a kind gesture from BP as I am sure they have many customers who come through and losing out on twp wouldn't change that.  Des can guarantee that my boyfriend and I will be returning to a restaurant that values their customers and their quality of food. Thank you again Des!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't get the hype.  Good patty, but cheap white bun and processed cheese. $10 burger and you can't afford a nice bakery bun and REAL cheese?!?!?  I can name a dozen better burgers off the top of my head. Parts & labour still #1.  I got the $16 combo with chili cheese fries - the best part of the meal was the cookie. My rating is for the burger only...nice place and service but hey, I came for the burger."}
{"text":"Burger was okay, not amazing by any means.  Annoying that they only take cash and the cashier's taking your order aren't the friendliest, they act as if you should know exactly how to order a burger there.  Wouldn't call them rude though, just not a \"fun bunch\"...  Probably won't go back for $18 for a burger, fries and a canned soda..."}
{"text":"The burger is alright. They just take basic burgers and add more toppings to it. The bun was a little stale and the beef patty was not seasoned as well. It is definitely overhyped by social media. Not really worth going back."}
{"text":"What more is there to say about this place, best burger ever, get the secret menu, etc... Cash only, but a lot of the places on Queen West worth going to are like that anyway.   Got the Vatican (burger on two grilled cheese sandwiches) and the beef was incredibly moist and tender, like the premium angus burger at Harvey's but better. People used to dollar menus complain about the price, but when you consider the quality of the beef (much better than any chain) and the added labour of doing a grilled cheese bun, the prices stack up pretty well against the big chains, and you're supporting a Toronto business."}
{"text":"Well, this was quite a nice little gem to find. Five Guys, you suck! This place knows how to fry burger without getting it swimming in 20 gallons of grease. The wife and I loved our burgers and fries. I see this place as \"Chipotlesque\" burger joint. All fresh, toppings and all. I'm not a big fan of fried burgers usually but, this was awesome for a takeout burger joint."}
{"text":"This place makes great burgers! The buns could use some help but all in all for the burger alone it is worth it. Ask them about their 'off-menu' items...not only is the place paying homage to In-N-Out (which I have yet to go to) they also have a bunch of 'off menu' items a la In-N-Out. Living in North York it is a long ways away for me to go there but I see this being a Toronto institution for a long time to come. Note: The venue is SMALL. They have a small counter with a couple of stools but most people do not eat in the establishment - there simply isn't room to hold more than 3 or 4 people eating at once."}
{"text":"So this joint has been on my list of places to try for awhile now, and the wait was definitely worth it!! The Burger's Priest really knows what they're doing when it comes to burgers, and there is a reason why it's always packed..  Their patty was a perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned piece of heaven. The beef was so juicy and flavourful, it comes through in every bite! At other burger joints, I've often found that the actual flavour of the beef gets lost among the toppings, condiments and even the bun. But here, it really stands out among everything else. I just went with a single patty cheeseburger, but there was nothing simple about the TASTE!! This is how a burger should be....  My only complaints (really just me being nit-picky) are: 1. They are cash only (really? in 2015?) 2. Their dining area is small and crowded (which is only a problem because they put out amazing food and are insanely popular) 3. I was a little disappointed in their fries. They seemed a little dry and overcooked for me. Possibly just this batch...   Regardless, none of those things would warrant less stars or praise just because their burger is simply phenomenal! This place is definitely going to the top of my list of places to return to - probably many times! I think I'll go with a double burger next time ;-)"}
{"text":"We were overwhelmed by the lack of space in here and almost turned around.  Some friendly customers who were waiting for their food advised us we should definitely stay.  They promised it was worth it.  The super nice guys behind the counter were very helpful in explaining the menu.  Specifically: the OPTION.  Portabello + Cheese + Deepfried = SOLD.  The Priest is a juicy burger plus the option.  Whoa.  I couldn't possibly handle that.  I was not impressed with the drink options.  Very boooooooooorrrrring.    There were zero seats available when we arrived.  I should mention they only have a total of 3 and a half seats (or something like that).  We were told seats would free up by the time our food was ready, and sure enough they did!  Tip: I gave up my seat super early (probably still chewing the last bits of my burger) and got a big compliment for it!  Diners seem to be very appreciative of seating, especially in the middle of winter.  I have had cravings for the Option ever since and have only been back once.  It's a little out of the way, but well worth the trip.   My most recent visit was on a hot day and it was twenty times hotter in the Priest.  Ugh.  We didn't even consider sitting inside and instead wandered across the street to a cute little park.  There's a picnic table there!"}
{"text":"Holy arteries!  This place is 4.5 stars while you're eating, but an hour later you're thinking 3.5 stars because all the juicy goodness is now clogging your arteries.  My wife got the Classic Cheeseburger while I indulged in the Priest (Cheeseburger PLUS panko-crusted portobello mushroom) and we shared fries with gravy.  First time to the priest in Etobicoke and food-wise it is consistent with the other locations, while it does not feel as intimate.  The fries were crispy excellence and complemented the burgers very well.  After taking a bite out of my wife's cheeseburger, I thought that I should have ordered it for myself (and save $3+HST in the process).  The Priest is a great burger but I have to say that the cheese and mushroom kind of cover up the great tasting beef patty.  Plus I think that my heart would be more grateful as well.  But all in all, the Burger's Priest is a once-in-a-while  indulgence.  Now I gotta get me some green tea to start my cleanse..."}
{"text":"I love trying new burger places and this was definitely one I'd recommend! Everyone is really friendly and helpful and their menu isn't overwhelming. I'd highly suggest anyone to try The Priest - the fried portobello mushroom cap stuffed with cheese is such a good twist to a burger topping!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!   Best burgers in Toronto - Get the Cheeseburger with the Option! Add fried jalepenos!  This is a hole in the wall joint so be prepared as there isn't really any seating."}
{"text":"I was in the area for Busker fest and saw this place on the way. As I had this already marked to visit, I thought this would be a good day to eat here.  The place was packed like crazy and they were taking orders and pushing burgers out quick. The location is of a decent size but on a busy day there would not be much seating. I tired their \"option\" burger, this is the veggie burger on the menu a panko-crusted, cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom. To be honest I was not a big fan of they veggie patty as when you eat it there is only cheese popping out of the burger as it is stuffed inside and you don't taste anything else. Burger Legend in Streetsville has a better portobello mushroom burger. The fries on the other hand very quite nice and they were hand cut too."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, without a doubt, Burgers Priest is one of the best burgers I've ever had. I've been a regular customer for the last 4 years and have tried a few different locations. The Queen east location is the closest to me and to their credit, the food has always been great. However, the service has been steadily declining. The last few times I've visited I've waited 25 minutes with no heads up or any mention of it at all. My last visit was a 35 minute wait and when I said 35 minutes was a long time to wait for one burger and fries I was given a shrug and felt blown off. From now on I will be enjoying my Burger's Priest only if I'm down town. As for a beaches Burger joint, I would recommend \"No Bull\" or \"Buldging Burger\" before the Queen east Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"The veggie option, called \"The Option\" is a creative and welcome change from a veggie burger even if it is a  \"heart attack on a bun\".  Two portabello caps stuffed w/ cheese, rolled in panko and fried.  I asked the guy what he recommended as toppings, and he said, with confidence, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Seemed about right.  It was tasty, but messy.  The cheese squirted out the back, and the flimsy, paper wrapper didn't help things much.  The fries were in the same flimsy paper, so if you're taking out, get somewhere quick to eat it.  The \"artisan\" buns (as someone else described them) are about the size of packaged hamburger buns (those that come in a package of 8) and about as bland.  The texture was good though.  Some will like the small size, cause hey, who wants to fill up on bread?  I overheard that they've been swamped since they opened 2 months ago, so maybe that's why they haven't even been able to put a menu up on their web site."}
{"text":"This burger was pretty delicious.  Be warned-- it's pretty heavy. They use quite a bit of butter to toast up the buns. Also, I think in their haste, they flipped our buns upside down.. But no matter, the food was good.  We got the California classic burger with a single patty that had cheese, lettuce, grilled onions, and tomato. It tasted great and the patty was well seasoned. However, the burger was pretty greasy and filling-- you've been warned. Solid flavors and not over complicated with a bunch of toppings or add-ins. We ask for the mayo it comes with on the side. Pretty tasty and went well with the burger.  We weren't that hungry so that's all we tried but I hope to be back for more! We went on a Saturday afternoon around 1:00 PM and thankfully there was no line.. Guess we got lucky?? Overall solid and good food. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Love! My experience was as good as with the location in the beaches! Amazing and out watering! Bacon cheeseburger with the option mmmm"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to grab a burger!  I've tried the regular cheeseburger, the High priest, and the Tower of Babel and each time my belly has thanked me.  Not a big fan of the fries or chili fries though and will not make the mistake of ordering them again. (Would much prefer to swing by mcdonalds and grab some fries to compliment my burger.)  The place is really small and some advice from experience would to be go before or after the lunch or dinner rush to avoid the line up in and out of the door.   The area is a little sketchy (especially at night) but the burger is well worth it.   Will try the new location one of these days.  Bring Cash!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place having the \"best burgers\" in the city, and being a curious burger lover, I had to check it out.   Heads up, its cash only, and to use the ATM, there's a $2 charge. Having made it all the way through the front door of Toronto's \"BEST BURGER PLACE EVAR\" I did it, but it wasnt exactly worth it.   I got the bacon cheeseburger. The bacon was crisp to the point of crumbliness. Like McDonald's bacon, maybe worse, as a comparison. The patty was on the thin and small side, but perfect otherwise. For $8.24, the whole thing was teeny tiny. It wasnt worth it.   Especially since I was still hungry afterwards.   (Kudos for the treatment of the meat and grinding it in-house, it really comes through, however that alone isn't enough to sell me.)"}
{"text":"One of my go-to burger joints in Toronto. You can clearly see its increasing popularity through its restaurant expansion strategy.  We were food hopping so this would be our second and final restaurant in our little hop. We ordered the double California Classic with a side of Chili Cheese Fries.  The bill came out to $18 which was reasonable. We did not have to wait more than 7 minutes for our order to be ready.  First thing i noticed was the parchment paper the burger was in was soaking up tons of excess oil. This was the only turn off from a burger standpoint. Overall, a very well prepared burger. The beef patty was succulent and not overcooked, the bread was toasted just right and the other ingredients melded together very nicely.  The chili cheese fries were great as well. The only recommendation which may be a bit unorthodox is to put the cheese under the chili so all of the cheese melts between the hot fries and chili."}
{"text":"So with all the hype of the Burger's Priest, my bf and I decided to try it out as we were in the neighbourhood. Expectations were high and we both were salivating just thinking about burgers. I had heard the place was busy and that long lines were a given, but I did not expect the place to have been THAT small.   Food. I ordered a cheeseburger and my bf ordered a double cheeseburger and The Option which is a gooey, cheesy, fried-mushroomy burger. I ordered a side of fries and my bf ordered chilli fries. The total came out to be $38!! We may have made the mistake of bringing the burgers back home which allowed them to cool a bit, but going against the grain, I really don't understand what the big deal is about this place. My cheeseburger was essentially meat with cheese and toppings of one tomato, ketchup and 2 slices of onions. I actually didn't find my burger to be that big even...I was hungry after I finished mine. My $3.49 fries were just fries and by the time I ate them, they were cold and soggy. All in all, the WOW factor was not there. I expected my burger to be something larger, wider and filled with \"gourmet\" toppings like Brie cheese and olive tapenade. The cheese that was in my burger was the signature yellow processed one that isn't even real?  I think that this place is quite overrated. These burgers are really nothing special, but they are expensive. I mean, these burgers aren't even christened or made by priests!!! I think in order to work here, you have to be a young, male, teenager who looks more like a skateboarder (signature side cap) than anything holy.   Since I have now tried the hype of this place, I can rest easy and go on living my life normally. As a side note, both my bf and I mentioned that we much prefer a Craft burger. That is my idea of what a burger is supposed to be.   Ambiance. Small. Line extends out to the street. There is literally seating for 6 people: 3 bar stools and a ledge on one wall, and 3 on the other wall. Angst, head bashing music is blared loudly from an IPOD speaker so make sure to order loud and make sure you are close or in the restaurant when they shout your name to pick up the order. Be careful of two large garbage bins in the restaurant as the lids are not attached to the bins. If you are not careful, you can knock the lids on the ground and you have to pick it up with your bare hands (like my bf did...)  FYI. Cash only."}
{"text":"Tried the high priest burger. The 'secret' sauce kinda reminded me of big mac sauce. dont get me wrong its tasty, but not $10 worth in my opinon."}
{"text":"I love this burger joint. My go-to is always the Vatican. Two beef patties between two grilled cheese - seriously cannot go wrong with that. I also get a strawberry milkshake with my meal as well, it just your typical milkshake - nothing special. Overall, I really enjoy their burgers and the staffs always super nice!"}
{"text":"Finally! Got to try Burger's Priest. It has been on my food list for a while but I never got around to travelling to their other locations. I'm glad they just opened this joint around the corner from me... or am I?  Since they opened, I got to try: - High Priest, it's supposed their take on a Big Mac, but it's been forever since I've had McD so I wouldn't know. The burger was good tho, the beef was flavourful. - California Style, 2 patties with grilled onions. A simpler version but still good. I'd prefer this over their bigger burgers. The burgers were filling but they were extra greasy and messy. - Peter's Denial, fried chicken with corn and gravy. I'm a sucker for fried chicken. This was one of the more affordable options and it was pretty good! Messy but lots of flavour. - fries, it's pretty simple and cooked well. They can get soggy. - coffee milkshake. I'd go there just for this :)  The space is big with lots of seating plus the aisle is wide to accommodate the people ordering and waiting. Service is quick, depending on when you go... although I haven't been during the lunch rush.  Overall, Burger's Priest is a good option if you're craving some greasy food. I'm glad and also afraid that it's so close to me - I'll be fat and broke in no time. I can't give them the full marks cuz the price can get ridiculous for a burger/combo.   4 stars"}
{"text":"This review is more about their service than their food.  My daughter and I decided to stop there for late dinner after hearing all the hype about their burgers.  Unfortunately, our experience was ruined by total lack of tables due to a large party taking up most of them.  They were already done eating and just chatting with each other there, so we waited patiently with five or six other customers for 10-15 minutes.  They obviously knew we were waiting but refused to leave, and the restaurant staff did nothing about it.  My daughter have had it enough, so we took our food back to our hotel instead.  The purpose of eating at an establishment is to fully enjoy their food, but that didn't happen at this visit.  A small establishment like this usually has a rule about the size of party and the length of stay they allow their customers to have.  After all this, my daughter is contemplating about giving them another try at a different location, but I'm not sure if I want to."}
{"text":"Three stars because it is very average. Small burger and no fries included. Granted I got the buffalo chicken sandwich but it was still small and just not great. I was hoping for more, I would recommend paying a bit more somewhere else and getting your money's worth in flavor and size."}
{"text":"Mixed emotions here burger fans... mixed emotions.  LOVE - that this location is within walking distance of my home  HATE - that this location is within walking distance of my home  Overjoyed - that the quality of the food is exactly the same as the other locations  Frustrated - that they forgot about my milkshake (Riggs and Murtaugh) and my burger got soggy while waiting  Understanding - that the staff are new and getting used to the grind here (ba ha ha - a meat joke)  Sad - that it's right next door to one of the few remaining Licks restaurants around and will surely put them out of business in no time  Dismayed - That for a shake and a specialty burger I paid $24!!! WTF?  Giddy - About how good the Judgement Day Burger was (2 'Options' on a priest burger)  For these reasons I give this location a 3.5 with easy room for improvement - however post Burger Binge Week I may need to hold off on returning here until my cholesterol returns to normal!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I had the Four Horseman of Apocalypse the last time here... man up and try it and ignore the price. This time I had the Vatican. Double patty with an added Option. The patty seems like ground beef with a dash of salt. Basic. As a burger lover keeping it simple is key. Have the Option on a burger if you get the chance. The deep fried portobello mushroom is key. Price reasonably and the service was with a smile. Fries are also pretty kick ass. I am Definitely a return customer. Check out the secret menu on line."}
{"text":"The burger was outstanding!!!! I had the Highest Priest burger with fries. I honestly thought about the burger, especially the cheese and sauce, several days later. The fries were ok, nothing really special. The chocolate chip cookies were good.   The atmosphere is interesting on the weekends/late nights. This location is surrounded by nightclubs and bars. So if you go late, you can get some free entertainment or be a part of the show!!! They have bouncers/security just in case things get too out of hand.   I would definitely recommend grabbing a burger here before or after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"This place has a mystical aura around it but it was okay. I had the priest burger which was good but too greasy with the cheese slice plus cheese inside the fried mushroom cap. Chili fries were really greasy and nothing special. For what you get its expensive... priest burger, chili fries and bottle of water cost $22."}
{"text":"Having heard about this place a few times and built up some high expectations I was in the end let down by the hype.  A day at the beach playing volley ball built up a big appetite, so a few of us decided to go here straight after, must have been around 7pm on a Saturday evening.  I had walked past the place before when it was closed and was sceptical so actually stepping into the place was not exactly a life altering experience. Luckily there was not much of a queue so we were served pretty quick.   By the way the place is small and gets hot and stuffy and eating inside is not allowed since there is just no room then avoid this place if you see a massive line up.  You choose the burger you want from one main chalk board, I think there were 6-7 options increasing in price so I went for a double cheese burger with fries.  At the cash register you have a smaller board with the toppings - again limited but they had what I wanted.   So a double cheeseburger with fries and a bottle of water came close to $15 so already by this time my belly was shouting out for food as the sounds and smells of burgers sizzling on the hot grill wafted out.  Because they were not super busy we were all served within 10 minutes and within seconds of them handing over the burger my heart sank into my belly, (that would have shut it up more than this burger).  It was a dwarf of a burger! For the money I had paid I expected something that would need two hands to hold and eat.   The only good thing about the burger was that it did taste great but there was just not enough of it to fill me up. Having to go to KFC straight after to just get some more food is a shame on this place. However it gets one star just for the taste of the burger which again was really good.  If you want a real good burger for value and home made then UFO burger in Niagara area is the best I have experienced so far."}
{"text":"First time here, food takes time to cook but it is worth it. A little  bit  on the pricey side. But the taste is worth every cent. Would definitely  come back again."}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus have mercy...this was an amazing eating experience.  Best burger I've had in Canada.  Fries were awesome too.  Since it was my first time I got the California and it was great - lovely grilled onion and fresh tomato.  I could have done without the buttered bun as the actual meat is very juicy and greasy (in a good way) so it just wasn't necessary.  Wish I was in town longer, would have loved to try The Priest and a milkshake!  Bring cash, and if you see an open footstool, er, table, snag it fast."}
{"text":"Over the years, my Canadian colleagues have been raving about this place. Either I had an unusually bad experience, or they should leave burger judgement to us yanks. I had this delivered to my hotel room, and it was downright awful. The burger was overcooked and dry, and the fries were cold and limp. Gross. McDonalds would seriously have been better, not to mention real burger places like Five Guys and In 'N Out. I will not be giving this another try."}
{"text":"I just finished eating The Priest and hurried to yelp about it... With 4% battery life left and I can't move to charge my phone ... This will be quick...  Beef patty not overcooked, moist and tastey...topped with two mushroom caps stuffed with cheese....AMAZING-ZING-ZING!!!   Even the bun was good and all it was white bread!!   OK... Now I'm going to eat my chilli fries and drink my icecream float!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype ... its worth it!!!  Ordered the Priest with Options - a burger with a batter coated deep fried portobello mushroom cap with cheese and fried onions.  Oh wow ...   Rushing out of the house to make it 10 minutes before opening time, the insane amount of calories packed in each burger, the $10ish dollars for said burger ... all worth it!!!!  Now for the fries - they were soft, oily, and burnt.  My husband overheard the staff saying this particular batch had been burnt and unfortunately we were given the batch anyway ... uhm ... yay.    Well, I'd rather save my calorie allowance for the burger anyway - it was epic.    The place itself is quite small so seating is limited to just a few stools and a little communal counter.    Staff was cute and pleasant.    Can't wait to come back.  I'd suggest coming early since within 10 minutes of opening, the place was already bustling.  If you love burgers, I don't think you'll be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I have not tried Holy Chuck yet, but they recently had a Groupon available so I will be going shortly. Therefore, I cannot compare the the two at this time.  I have been here twice now and both times I got The Vatican City. I mean I love grilled cheese and I love burgers so thank you so much for putting the best of both worlds into one delicious creation. I found the burger to be very flavourful and juicy. Definitely not something you can treat yourself to on the regular, but when you do it's totally worth it.   I am just glad I knew about the secret menu going in so make sure you check it out prior to going. The concept behind the secret menu is good and it gets people talking, but people could also be missing out when they go. I would recommend advertising it as part of their regular menu because I don't think I would be as impressed with anything from the regular menu."}
{"text":"I'm here to give an honest, unbiased review of The Burgers Priest. Let's be honest..this place has developed a mini cult in the past few years. Today was my first time trying it as I finally caved in after years.  And I wasn't impressed.  Here's why:  I went in going in with zero expectations. First of all my waitress was very snappy acting as if I should already know the holy lord Burgers Priest menu like the back of my hand. Anyways, I ended up settling for the priest (patty with the option(deep fried \"mushroom\" with cheese) and a regular cheese burger with fries.  The Burgers are heavily under seasoned..there was no mushroom in the option..just gloopy bland cheese..with some type of coating.. I literally couldn't taste a thing on the burger..not even the tomato or onion ..the burger is juicy but it's so unappetizingly fatty and bland!!! I liked the softness of the burger and how it kinda disintegrates as you eat it..but it was lacking a lot of texture and flavour. The ingredients were very very fresh.  On the other hand the fries are what saved the day..they are double fried..like how you get your fries in Quebecois poutine..crispy on the outside, sweet and creamy in the middle. Loved them. They are literally what saved the meal for me as I would've been pretty disappointed otherwise.  The burgers are forgettable and bland. There's just too much hipster hype surrounding it.  And that's my 2 cents."}
{"text":"The burger was amazing, I had the high priest with fries the burger was perfectly made and very tasty. Will be hitting this burger a few more times before the year is up.  There fries were perfect like the old Swiss Chalet fries but better.  It's good to have a great burger place like BP in this city, to many wannabes."}
{"text":"By far the best burger I've ever had in my life.  I've tried EVERY single burger place in town and some of the best around all Canada and the USA.  This place has the more juiciest and best tasting burgers anywhere.   Look up the off the menu items, it'll run you close to $15 depending on the off menu item, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"My favourite burger place in Toronto*  my dad loved it so much, my bf is a fan of the one with the cheesy Portobello mushroom* i tried the grill cheese ine before and it gives you a heart attack but so good* however i do prefer the classic Cheese burger* juicy tender and so fresh* if you also like a casual walk in burger place with good burger* this does just the job*"}
{"text":"Although it had only been open for a week by the time I stopped in, The Burger's Priest has already got its mojo in full gear.  The Priest is all about purity, with a focus on serving awesome burgers and fries without the confusion of a thousand exotic toppings.  The owner selects the beef every morning personally, then grinds it in fresh batches all day long.  Simple concept, but I swear I have eaten burgers all over the world, and I have never had one explode in my mouth with juicy tasty fresh perfection like this.  The fries are also exemplary, exactly the way I like them, not greasy, not too thick, not too thin.  Congratulations!  I am a slave to your meat."}
{"text":"This is my go to place to get a great tasting burger. My favourite is the option but I get the occasional regular cheeseburger with fries.   The times I've visited it's been busy and cramped, seats are usually taken as there's limited spots, although I don't mind because I always do take out.  The only down side is that they take cash only and I never carry cash on me anymore."}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Toronto ! Service is always friendly & as fast as it can be when making from scratch food. Remember check out the secret menu before going in !"}
{"text":"Loved both the burger and fries! Great burger place in Port Credit and the staff was friendly.  I especially love their cheese stuffed and deep fried mushroom they have. Works perfectly with the burger or by itself."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and helpful when I was trying to decide what burger to pick. The burger was amazing! I got the priest and my cousin got the high priest on a gluten free bun. We both loved it."}
{"text":"First time here, don't really know what the hype is all about.  Had a High Priest and my other half had a Bacon Double Cheeseburger.  Sizes were small for the price, but the meat was good quality.  I'm not in a rush to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst burger ever. just a burger cost me 9.99+ tax and it was gross!! Meat wasn't even cooked! Wouldn't recommend to anyone ever"}
{"text":"They don't even deserve 1 star...Worst burger ever ! The burger was so gross! Meat wasn't even cooked yuck :( I paid 9.99 for just a burger !! Way to over priced! Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Embarrassingly small burger barely bigger than a Big Mac.  Not much better either.  Meat patties seemed smaller than Fresh Burger or Burger Factory, Five Guys, or Hero Burger.  Any of those I mentioned are far better burger joints at this price unless you just want the ridiculous gimmicks of them stacking stupid ingredients together.  Save yourself the wait times too and make your own McGangBangs."}
{"text":"A classic go to joint. I can count on this place when I'm hungry and not sure where to eat. I usually order the fiery furnace. A little tangy since the spicy peppers are pickled and bread can get soggy over time but ... it shouldn't take you long to eat anyway. The milkshakes bring me back to my childhood."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint in Toronto. If you had In-n-Out burgers from the west coast, this one comes close to one.  All the burgers and patties are freshly made. The High Priest is like a Big Mac and taste great. The double cheeseburger is delicious. My favourite is the Vatican City where they use grilled cheese sandwiches as the buns. Its super yummy and I definitely recommend it if you come here. Its unique and has a lot of cheesy goodness.  It is pretty expensive to eat here since a double cheeseburger alone cost $9.60 and the Vatican City alone is around $13. The fries are just average. Sometimes, it takes a long time for your order to be prepared. This is a popular place so finding a spot to sit in the restaurant is difficult as they can accommodate at least 20 people.  Also, make sure to check their website for their secret menu!   I am definitely a fan though and when I'm craving a burger, this is the place that I will go to."}
{"text":"Burger's Priest is definitely my go to burger joint in Toronto. This location is conveniently near the financial district so it can get really busy during weekday lunch hours.   I tried the chili cheese fries, double bacon cheeseburger and Vatican City. All are staples of the franchise and made fresh when you order. There is definitely a lot of open space in the middle at this location and you need to walk up stairs to get to the main area. The kitchen is at the back as well as the counter to order. Make sure to check out their hidden menu online.  And for some odd reason, they do offer free WiFi but the most recent times I have visited this place, the WiFi does not work or is very, very slow.   Definitely my go to place for burgers."}
{"text":"I've only gotten delivery orders from here and my order has only been right once or twice. About 20% of the time. My last order they gave me a completely different burger that was obviously special ordered with weird toppings, and an extra fries. The extra fries got wasted. When I called to tell them, the girl could really care less, didn't even say sorry or thank you for letting them know, and didn't offer any recompense, but said \"what do you want to do about it\" in an exasperated manner. Like it was my fault they can't get a simple hamburger order right. Their burgers are good but I'm starting to think the attitude and ineptitude make it not worth it."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype over this over rated,over priced burger spot? Nothing special at all. Have been wanting to try it for a few years,I should have kept that streak going. It's not awful,just nothing special. After spending $30.00 on 2 burgers and fries,we both left hungry. The burgers were so tiny,and I got a double patty. The fries were garbage, we spent $5.00 on tiny over cooked fry bits. And they were cold, good job fry cooks! I guess it's so popular because it's \"trending\"."}
{"text":"After a recent week of generous reviews I was hoping to find something less than stellar to review, I don't know why after reading all the review for The Burger's Priest that I though I would find that here. Wrong-o Kris!  Working a Yelp office day with Evelyn W we worked up quite the appetite in our time together and decided that nothing short of the biggest, juiciest, greasiest (most secret-est) burgers in Toronto would do.   This take away joint is tiny with only about 4 seats but don't let the lack of seating and tiny menu fool you. In fact, just ask for the secret menu. I did and they admitted to it BUT when I asked what was on it I got a \"if you don't know I can't tell you\" sorta  answer (but more polite). I opted for the \"what's most popular\", I was then referred to the High Priest and the Vatican. I'll leave the descriptions for you to find out but let it be known that the High Priest resembles the Big Mac - only it's what the BM SHOULD taste like at all times.  I let it sit in the wrapper while we found a place to eat and by the time I got to it (5 minutes later) the burger was cocooned in a cornucopia of its own greasy juices, making the edges of the buns almost translucent. Some might say...ewwww grosss. I say F%^k YA....bring on the coronary!!  So good, I'm salivating as I write this and shaking my head while I remember it.   Honorable mention go to the fries we shared, fresh cut and deep fried to perfection!  My only issue was the price point for 2 burgers, 2 cans of pop and a shared fries I ended up dropping $28+. Little much guys, I mean it's fast food - great fast food, but fast food non the less.  CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"I went to burger priest once before and it was quite a good experience, but this time, it was so poor, that I decided to make it my first official rating.   what I had: I usually have a burger with bacon and sauteed onions at all burger places to have a comparable burger base, so I am comparing apples to apples. If I am hungry enough, I try to get two burgers so that I have a better, more representative, sample or burgers and ensure that  any errors in first one get eliminated in the second one. I had two cheese burgers, with bacon and sauteed onions, one fry  analysis: So overall, the product I got to eat was a really poor tasting meal, for a less than spectacular price.   would I recommend this? bottom line: don't go here, unless its to say you have been there. go to golden star instead if you want to go eat a burger thats out of the city core.  1. service: off the bat, the service was terrible. I clearly communicated my order : two cheeseburgers with one fry, bacon and sauteed onions on both. what I was ordered instead was four plain cheeseburgers, one fry. thank fully I caught this before it was put through.   2. price: 20$, which is on the high side for my liking. it is a cheese burger after all.  3. taste: the burger was terribly dry (both of them), there were were little condiments or toppings inside, its almost felt like they wanted to save on everything, and kept the pickles for themselves to eat later ? I also asked for bacon and sauteed onions, and onions were tasteless, bacon was soggy but there was a decent amount of it.  the fries: quite soggy, like they served you fries that were lying around for sometime, heated in a microwave then served, and honestly, for 4$, its quite the rip - off  4. portion size- was decent, that the only thing that was good. but to pay $20 for a decent sized portion of a dry burger and soggy fries not worth it.  5. another thing that I can't quite categorize is the atmosphere of these arrogant teenagers who serve you and get the order wrong and then stand there chatting about their night out with the cooks, while the burgers are burning on the grill...WTF..  so bottom line, save your money folks!!! I think the hey-day of this place is over!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a burger, The Burger's Priest hits the spot. I went for the basic cheeseburger which didn't have the typical gourmet toppings propelling the simple meat on a bun to some kind of gastronomical specialty so there's nothing too remarkable to say about it. A smallish bun with a very tasty patty and possibly some cheese in there too, but not enough of it to comment on. Right across the parking lot staring right at you is California's where a sandwich is no doubt a full meal, even without fries. But nothing compares to a well prepared burger and this is what TBP is for. (Plus the fries, yeah FRIES!)"}
{"text":"The new Burger's Priest location complete's the last of the four corners of Spadina and Queen with some kind of burger joint. From the hype, you would think this is the best place to get your fast food, and you'd be right! No-nonsense burger made with flavourful beef, a melt-in-your-mouth fluffy white bun, token slice of cheese to not overpower the creation, and crunchy-good fries. What more could you ask? They have floats and shakes too with the option for making it a 'malted' for 99 cents more. And the cooler has some interesting soft drinks in it. The lineup on Friday at suppertime was not discouraging and we were able to score a standup table by the window. Welcome to Queen West Burger Priest!"}
{"text":"Yeah, we like tihs place.  Simple burgers & milk shakes.  Fries are ok.  However, I'm not sure what's so special that it has the lineups that it does now.  I prefer this over Five Guys off North Queen for sure, as I find Five Guys to be far too salty and I feel like preservatives in the meat make me feel like garbage after."}
{"text":"This location has been the slowest location I've been too. You need better management in the kitchen to keep people awake."}
{"text":"Great burger, great fires and great shakes... do you really need me to say more?    Bonus: secret menu items: http://www.theburgerspriest.com/secret-menu/"}
{"text":"back of house customer service is superb. front of house is hit or miss but overall decent. burgers hit the spot"}
{"text":"Got the Priest and Cheeseburger.  This is the 2nd time I am here. First time I got the option (veggie burger). Love the burgers here as they are always cooked right.  Burgers aren't as big as other places and price is a little on the high side.  This place is super tiny were they have 4 bar stools.  It is def a take away joint.  This place is Cash only so don't forget."}
{"text":"Ah yes, my 3rd... or is it my 4th Burger's Priest location, countless burgers eaten, even more burger blackouts later - it's still amazing and delicious.  You don't need to know much about this location as the menu, look and operation are the same as what you would expect from being to other locations. This one in particular is located just north of Hwy 7 along Weston road.   What was different about this visit? I did it, I danced. I danced with the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. Despite what you might think, it wasn't a world ending experience, but a religious experience? Sure well you be the judge:  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse 2 cheese topped flat top pressed burger patties 2 Option (cheese stuffed deep fried portabello mushroom caps) ALL the fixings Oh... and the buns... they aint no ordinary buns - they're two grilled cheese sandwiches.  Stacked up, it looks like a formidable foe, but once the melty cheese of the Options started flowing, it coats the crumbly greasy juicy burger patties and aids in the sliding of it down your throat hole. But if you were worried about these grease making you buns go soggy, you'd be wrong. The grilled cheese sanmmies hold it all together like steel trap.  I have nothing else to say - I slept well after, you will too  Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"- everyone knows they have amazing burgers. you read that all the time. and they do. no question. delicious. - my beef (pun intended) is cost. had the high priest a couple of days ago, with fries and a water..... and it cost me $16 and change. - i get that high end burger joints are getting pricier and pricier to account for quality of food costs... but come on. The burger alone was almost 10 pre-tax.  - not trying to hate on burger's priest, but this is more of a warning to hungry yelpers out there that this place aint cheap."}
{"text":"After hearing about how this place was one of the best burger places, I decided to come and try their bacon double cheeseburger. Making it a combo (including a small bag of fries and small milkshake) came to a total of $21??!! After eating, I didn't feel that it was good enough for that price. The burger tasted like a more greasy burger you get at a family barbecue, the fries were mediocre but the milkshake was pretty good. Overall, not worth the $21. I felt sick after eating."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after claims of them making the best burgers, and I was really disappointed. The burger was flat and dry and it honestly reminds me of Wendys burgers. The fries were great though."}
{"text":"It's good.  We go to this one or the Queensway sometimes, but it's not worth the lineups.  It's just a regular burger, less fake than the cheap ones from McDonalds.  The fries are so-so, but their shakes are good.  If there were other places to eat in the area that were quick and tasty, I'd do that instead if there were a line-up.  Then again, I'm hugely intolerant of lineups for food."}
{"text":"I went Burger's Priest for the fist time last night, and got the double with fries. Based on many recommendations, grabbed some beer from the LCBO, then walked down a block on Coxwell to sit in the park.   The burger is so damn good. Well seasoned, and stays together very nicely. Unfortunately, the fries are preventing a five star rating. They were bland, and the oil flavour was too strong.   Will definitely be going back, but will skip the fries next time."}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious- especially the Priest. Take a bite, the patty melts in your mouth and then the cheesy goodness from the veggie patty (portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese and then deep fried) just adds to the experience. A little on the pricier side but definitely worth it. Would come back to try their secret menu."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out the Burger's Priest after hearing so much about it! I ordered a regular cheeseburger + fries + coke, and my boyfriend got the double cheeseburger + fries + coke - the total came to about $25 altogether. Portion sizes are a little bit smaller than normal, but maaaan these burgers taste good. If you're feeling really hungry, then I don't think a regular cheeseburger is going to fill you up - double it! It didn't take that long for our food to arrive, and when ti did, it was hot and ready to go! Super flavourful and left me feeling safisfied and not bloated or greasy.  I know there is also a secret menu on their website, although apparently those are quite expensive.  Service wise - when we went up to the cash, the girl asked us \"what do you want\" and proceeded to look really bored when we gave her the order. My boyfriend and I were a little taken aback at first, but maybe she was just having a bad day? We weren't taking that long to order either... It was noon on a Tuesday and wasn't busy so idk. So I'll dock a star off for now, but I'm sure service will be better next time!  The tables are quite low and the seats are just stools, so keep that in mind if you're wearing a chunky jacket. (I say this because I wore one and I had nowhere to put it - maybe leave it in your car, haha)"}
{"text":"Amazing quality burger, went at 7:30 PM on a weekday and was not packed at all. The food was amazing, but I'd recommend not sitting inside the store as the AC was not working at all, but other than that it's the best burger I've eaten. Definitely, worth the money, would go again for sure. Definitely lived up to the hype"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place many times before but didn't think much of it. Finally Friday night found my friends and I struggling to decide on a dinner spot that would be quick, filling but not heavy, and not some fast food franchise. We were headed for the area so someone said Burger Priest! And we went with it.  Getting into the place you feel like you stopped into a late night drunkard-friendly pizza/poutine joint. The decoration is hipster but simple, and there's very little seating - maybe for 20 if you squish? Most of the place is an open floor intended for people waiting for their order or lining up to put in their order. The menu is simple - about 30 items covers it all from burger to fries to dessert. Everybody kind of crowds near the cashier but not close enough to order, to see the menu so it's all a bit confusing and rowdy. If you're looking to take a seat make sure you go for the tables first before ordering.  I went with the Priest burger, which is a cheeseburger with the Option burger on top. The Option is actually the veggie option - a cheese and battered portobello mushroom cap! The basic add-ins available are generic: ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onions...do note the onions are raw and if you want them cooked (i.e. sautéed) that'll be an additional $1.49. You're handed a number and your receipt after you pay, and you just have to wait for them to call your number and scream your name from the kitchen/order prep. Then you drop your number back in the box and your order will appear from behind the pickup counter.  The entire burger was about the size of a softball, and as soon as I took my first bite one thing was confirmed - the Priest was a great choice. The cheesy portobello mushroom cap was juicy, the cheeseburger sitting under it was tasty and good texture, and everything went together very well. It wasn't messy because the cheese was stringy not runny, and the portobello had its own deep fried breading encasing. The portion size was good - no trouble finishing it off, not left craving for more (excessively).  The one downside of the place is the setup and staff. The one poor cashier took orders and attended to everything else that customers might need - a cup of water, a fork, more napkins - everything that's normally self-serve at say McDonald's is tucked away behind the counter. Rather inconvenient, but a bit understandable as soon as I saw the large crowd of rosy-faced giddy individuals come in all rowdy at 8pm...I can only imagine the fiasco later on into the night. For sure I'll be back, for takeout at least if anything."}
{"text":"I'm torn here. I mean the burger is fatty and cheesy and kind to my tastebuds, no doubt. But I just don't think this place is worth it. Their specialty list of fancily designed burgers leaves little room for what you actually want. Everything is a touch too oily, was sliding all over my hands. They only offered small ketchup packets, a nuisance. And the fries here are mediocre at best. I'd much prefer Five Guys if I'm doing a burger night."}
{"text":"Heard they had a great burger and they do!  Had to wait like 25 minutes which seemed like forever standing around, but it was definitely worth it - just perfect bun-patty-topping interaction.  Had while visiting Toronto for the weekend but this would be a weekly spot if I lived there.  One of the better burgers I've ever had.  Go with the two patty burger.  The fries were good, but not remarkable.  If it weren't jam-packed with people and I could have had some room at a table instead of standing around outside, I might have enjoyed the fries more with some vinegar or ketchup.  Also had a vanilla shake & it was good if a little small.   Would really have liked a place to sit and eat, but won't ding them on the review for being crazy popular.  Good value for the price."}
{"text":"Trekked to this location cause people keep raving about the burgers. Got the priest - deep fried portabello mushroom stuffed with cheese on top of a patty with standard toppings you choose. Added smoke - fried jalapenos to it plus an order of fries. Food came out pretty damn fast   the portabello  was delicious but the patty was meh... truthfully I've had a better patty at Moe's out in Scarborough. the Fries were probably the worst fries i have ever, ever had. Like really bad!   There is no seating so we sat across the street on some concrete steps.  Overall -  I would come back just for The Option (just fried portabello) but found the burgers highly overrated."}
{"text":"This was the most amazing burger I've ever had, I wish I had bought two so I could just rub one all over myself. Got the double cheese burger and mustard fried it (secret menus thing) it came with onions fried in their secret sauce. It was like... If you cooked a Big Mac in crack. Sweet jeebus, I'm going to dream about this burger forever"}
{"text":"A burger is an incredibly simple meal. A slice of meat, part of a tomato, a piece of lettuce and a smattering of ketchup and/or mustard in between two slices of bread. But that is the beauty of a burger, it is so simple, but so customizable. The Burgers Priest has a very nice menu with a nice variety of burgers. My two issues with them are a waitress who was rude with my kids and the prices are a bit overblown for the food. For the same money, we could go someplace else and not pay an exorbitant price."}
{"text":"Ordered through a popular mobile delivery platform and they sent the driver away without actually giving him my order because they were too busy. Figure out what you're doing! #wastehistime2016"}
{"text":"food is the new religion   FYI: The new one at Yonge and Lawrence has milkshakes.   I only met Burger's Priest yesterday.  I'm late the party so I'll avoid all religious puns. Toronto bloggers have covered them all. I'm also Christian so I'm not going to comment on the iconography.  But do you know about BP?  Did you get caught up in the hype?  Have you read all the reviews?  There are so many, and they all say the same thing, over, and over, and over again.  Save and except the 5% that run against the grain.  The biggest complaint from that group seems to be that it fell short of expectation.  I wonder if they know that meeting expectation is relative and dependent on who is doing the expecting.  Some of the minority also took issue with cost.  If you consider that a McDonald's meal, which by the way shurnk in size (that or it was colossal to the eyes of a 10 year old me), is about $9.  I don't think spending $50 for four burgers and two fries is really crazy.  Am I wrong?  Tell me I'm wrong.  Before my dinner date with The Scotsman, Cracker, and Kungfu Panda I researched the not so secret menu.  It took me a while to decide, and I changed my mind about 19 times.  They all sound ridiculously dirttyyyy.  (You can find that menu if you look; I'm not about to lay down here.)  Kungfu Panda is a vegetarian so he went with the Option.  The Scotsman had the cheeseburger with Jargz (onions fried with mustard, akin to In-N-Out's animal style).  He loved it. And Cracker had the Pope. I loved it.  It made me wish I had gotten the High Priest + Option + Jargz.  I just got the High Priest.  The \"haters\" call it \"just a Big Mac\".  Firstly, what's wrong with a Big Mac.  Secondly, and more importantly, when's the last time you had a Big Mac that filled you up and left you feeling good?   ...  I thought so.   The three of shared the fries, which were just that, fries.  But I never met a fry I didn't like.   BP starts from a really good foundation.  Meat-eaters get quality beef while plant-eaters get a panko-breaded portobello mushroom cap stuffed with cheese and garlic.  All-eaters get fresh toppings and can build their burger as crazy as they want.    It's no In-N-Out, but for now, American burgers joints trump Canadian ones.  But here in Toronto, through all the hype, and with all the waiting, Burger's Priest was dirrrtyyyy.  The true test of any burger is how it made you feel.  When all is said and eaten, did you feel good?  Or did you feel gross?  I felt good, like I knew I would, so good, so good, I love meat."}
{"text":"I really wished that I could have enjoyed my burger's priest burger more amidst all the hype for it, but sadly I couldn't, though it is really the place's fault besides their very limited seating! I came in here a week ago when there was heavy rain, so after ordering my red sea burger (chilli cheeseburger) I couldn't find a seat to eat and had to walk ALLLL the way back to Eaton's (in the rain) before I could sit down and enjoy my burger. Now many of you will probably have foreseen the upcoming issue.  The chilli in the burger made the whole thing all soggy and thus making it far less enjoyable. I don't blame burger's priest though, I should have thought further ahead. The burger though was still quite tasty regardless, and the chilli was incredibly flavourful. HOWEVER, I did expect the burger to be a bit bigger for $7. I also wish they would have alt methods of payment besides cash (not even debit?!) since they are on the pricey side, and quite frankly not a lot of people like to carry cash around these days (as demonstrated by other reviewers who made similar comments about paying cash). I will certainly return though either for the vatican on ice, or something from their secret menu! Hopefully I can finally understand what the hype is about on my second visit."}
{"text":"Ah yes I do love some Burger's Priest! This is my local burger joint and I frequent it quite often, and when I can't visit, I order it through UberEats.   Short version: Great good, poor value, a bit expensive, nice decor, and a bit overhyped.  Long version:  This place can get quite busy around noon for lunch hour. I usually order a single cheeseburger and it's so good! The patty is thick and juicy (a little bit on the greasy side but I'll deal with it.) You get a variety of options for toppings (I get all of them.) Fries are like $5 so I'd say skip out because the amount that you get doesn't make it worth it. Milkshakes are good too but again, a bit on the pricier side.  There is also a ~secret menu~ that you can order from which you can view on their website. However be warned - my boyfriend ordered from there once and his burger ended up being like $20! The prices aren't listed for a reason on the website so don't be surprised if your order comes out costing more than you expected.  It's not great value for money but it tastes so good!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I had heard that this place was amazing but have never been. The food was good. Service was good. Excellent menu, pretty busy, people around us enjoying and finishing their meal. I agree the burger was a little smaller than I was expecting but was good value."}
{"text":"It was greasy, heavy, and very tasty. I am giving it three stars because for two combos we spent $37. That is steep for what we got. Otherwise, I found the burger a little under seasoned and I didn't have many condiments on mine - and they didn't ask to put some on. The cookies are bleh (average). The milkshake has artificial banana - I was hoping for the price, they would put/use real bananas. mmm.... banana chocolate milk shakes....(not so desirable in this case). Go earlier to avoid the rush. It is worth a try. I will most likely head to Woody's on Lakeshore if I am craving a burger. This place is decent.  Oh, it was very very loud."}
{"text":"I waited weeks for this place to first open...back in the day. I was here the first weekend and been coming on occasion to this and other locations. Love it!!!!! Amazing burgers. Fresh and delicious and not too greasy. I see the negative reviews and they seem to be simply by pissy little people and their \"cash only\" inconveniences. Screw them!!! Burgers Priest is awesome and I've never had anything other than a great burger!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Toronto and one of the best burgers I've ever had anywhere!  The fries are nothing special but who cares.  Didn't really care for the mushroom stuffed with cheese but who cares.  That burger was awesome.  I finished it and only wanted more.    Next time I'll order off the 'secret' menu and try The Vatican!"}
{"text":"A glorified overpriced McDonald's type burger. So overrated, not impressed with anything on the menu. And who has a secret menu that isn't a secret at all."}
{"text":"I am not sure that this place expected the crowds they are getting but the space they've set up shop cannot hold the amount of people who are coming and going. Its chaos!  I wanted to try just a burger and fries and I added the \"smoke\" to it. (Panko crusted jalapenos) Everything was absolutely brilliant. The burgers were cooked to perfection and the jalapenos added the perfect amount of heat. I cannot wait to try the milkshakes next time I'm in... and perhaps the chili fries.  Other than the line ups being big and the wait time for the food, even bigger, this place is here to stay.   Be sure to check out the secret menu online so you can order additional items (they are no where to be found in the joint).   I'm officially converted."}
{"text":"Get drunk. Go to The Burger's Priest. Get the double cheeseburger. Die a little bit inside while attempting not to weep tears of burgery, delicious joy."}
{"text":"I'm not a religious person but hallelujah praise jeebus! a burger place in my hood that I love! I've heard (or rather \"read\" some of the reviews of this place on this little website here) about how artery-clogging the veggie burger is. I had to check it out for myself and because I've got a deathwish. It's a tiny little place but air-conditioned! I would've opted to eat it in a park so I could die in nature with my veggie burger but gawddammit! it was too hot! There are a few stools and I was expecting there to be a line-up out the door but maybe eastenders like to live the healthy lifestyle. Me? I wanted to suck back some grease! yum!  The guy at the counter was super friendly and asked us (and those that followed) if they've ever eaten there before. He explained and showed us the fresh raw beef (no thanks! i don't like cow flesh but i sure do love the cheese they make!). He also showed us \"the option\" = veggie burger. It's as described in other reviews: two portabello burgers with cheese smothered in between and panko breading on the outside. it's then deep-fried. He also let us know that their fries aren't fried with any meat. They only take cash here so my husband and I ran over to the LCBO and got some beers & cash. Praise the burger heavens for the a/c in there for keeping our holy beverages cold. The burger was so good that I think I only chewed once and inhaled the rest. It's somewhere lodged in my esophagus right now. Beware cheese burns! They can squirt out and cause some facial damage (this has happened with a pizza pop to me. it creates an unsightly wound). The burger bun reminded me of mcdonald's. that's not a bad thing. i have good childhood memories of eating that shit. The fries too reminded me of mcdonald's fries except thinner and a tiny bit more soggier but it's the burgers you go for anway! Seriously, man, get down to the burger priest and praise the heaven's for a decent burger joint in the east!"}
{"text":"*** Cost Cutting Alert *** i understand the new minimum wage law.. But you don't have to take it out on your customers. Smaller buns and low quality now. Good buns Replaced with no frills crumbling white bun's you buy in a pack of 8 for $1.99 at your low cost groceries. Even napkins, forks and ketchup had moved behind the counter. I wouldn't have cared about any of that if your food quality and taste hadn't changed.   What is wrong with you??? You are trying to sell a Gourmet burger!!! I hate when companies think consumer is an idiot and will not notice. News flash!! We speak with our dollars. LAST time at Burger Priest!! Here begins your race to zero where you will become a nothing burger like 78% of business that are has beens thinking they can out smart consumer dollars. Bye!   Go to McDonald's at least they are not lying about what they are selling you. Which is a cheap Burger!"}
{"text":"Food doesn't disappoint, I'd recommend it to anyone looking to indulge on buger, chicken, fries or just a shake!  This is not a daily or weekly venture.. or your waistline will be non existant!  Yes, it's high-calorie, cholesterol-kicker type food but it's a great once in a blue moon, type of treat! We ordered the Vatican City, cheese fries & Blue cheese stuffed burger.. delicious!  The ground meat patties they use are perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, making their burger meal a tasty satisfying experience! I was a tad disappointed with their cheese fries, the fries were great but the cheese wasn't suited for cheesy fries, it should have a lil kick, a tang of some sort, and perhaps more consistency like Taco Bells cheese on fries, it just seemed like shredded cheese sprinkled over fies and melted. All in all, I truly enjoyed the experience & I'll definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the city! ...& I've had a LOT of burgers.  Only concern is the long lineups & small space but is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The burgers were just ok. What was the worst part was the service. They surely forgot our order because other parties nearby (who paid for their meal at the counter) got their food first. The surly order taker wasn't much help. She mumbled something about my order that I couldn't hear. I was about to ask for a refund after about half an hour of waiting, when my order got called. No apologies for the extraordinarily long wait, even after I asked for a refund.   My advice: you could get more value elsewhere. If you really want to try Burgers Priest, I would order using an app called Ritual. They seem to prioritize those customers over others."}
{"text":"I'm not the burger person I use to be however, I have been to a few good places over my years and this isn't one of them.  While it was acceptable, it wasn't special and at the price they charge special should be part of the deal.  It was small, on a cheap bun and not seasoned at all. I will stick to HERO burger for the antibiotic free, hormone free, grain fed and fully traceable beef. And no, I don't own a hero burger or have any friends that do.  Why it has 4 stars and 300 ratings says a lot. I Guess it is the Mac-generation coming up now and after being raised on MacDonald s, this would be good. Does anyone else remember The Empire Diner... now that was a good burger."}
{"text":"Thought the burger was good but not sure what all the hype is about. Needed to wait in line for a good 20 - 25 minutes for my burger and fry. Again it was good but I would not call it best in the city as some claim."}
{"text":"Geez, the California Classic was perfect.  The grilled buns were so crispy, the meat was juicy, and the toppings were just right.     The double is a more satisfying option but I suppose a single would be fine if you don't have a big appetite."}
{"text":"I've been a supporter of burgers priest since their first store on the east end so I almost feel bad giving them one star, but this location is absolutely horrible. I ordered their tolken chicken sandwich and I was absolutely horrified. I took two bites of my sandwich, less than 2/3, and the chicken was gone. This was the smallest portion I've seen for a long time. However, the usual beef patties aren't huge but taste makes up for it - not at this location. I received a piece of leather soaked in franks red hot sauce. I felt instant buyers remorse after eating at this location and had to throw away almost half my sandwich because there was no meat left...  Avoid this location and go somewhere else... I would prefer McDonald's chicken JR over this and t cost 4 times as much."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and chilli cheese fries! it always satisfies my burger craving. the burgers taste so fresh and don't leave you feeling bloated."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this burger place and this is probably my third or even fourth time stopping by to satisfy my burger craving, especially from burgers priest! I got the California classic but have also tried their popular priest burger. What I loved about the burger I ate was their grilled cheese buns, which was a bit on the greasy side but honestly tasted really good! Also got the chilli cheese fries and overall, it was very filling! The burgers are on the pricey side but I think it's worth it, and would recommend this burger place to anyone if you have not been yet!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, pretty pricey.  Secret menu on the web site is kind of annoying, but as long as you have your phone with you or know ahead of time what you'd like to order everything is great."}
{"text":"Today was their \"trial\" opening.  \"Training exercise\", they called it.  Officially, they open tomorrow for lunch.  There were several different menus to order from, but you had to stick with the one menu that was given to you.    We had the California Classic and the Pope.  Both double patties.  Damn that was good.    These are the best burgers I've had in the city.  The beef is moist and flavourful.  It's loosely packed and it stays so juicy.  We are huge fans of the Queen West location, the original location is just too far east for us.    We also had two orders of fries, a pop, and a root beer float.  Loved it!!!    Come check out the new location!  So much more seating!  Open late, giving Burrito Boyz a run for their money!"}
{"text":"I've always loved burgers but now I crave them thanks to The Burger's Priest.  Simple , tasty perfection.  Believe the hype and eat one.  EDIT- Still my favorite after 20+ visits.  Also my daughters favorite too!"}
{"text":"Love The Burger's Priest!  I have been to several burger joints in the GTA and this being my 2nd visit to a BP location and I always love their burgers the best!   I'm not one for a regular burger, so BP does good for me on their unusual styles of burger-ing.   This was our last CMYE Burger Brigade event of 2014 and it gave a delicious ending to the year of burger eating.  I ordered Noah's Ark - The Option veggie burger with chili and cheese between hamburger buns.  Now The Option in itself was the winner here (A custom blend of cheesy goodness sandwiched between Two Roasted portabello mushrooms, breaded and deep fried) Paired with the chili and the \"works\" toppings! Muah! finger licking good!  I have had similar style \"option\" burgers at other places but BP does it best! The portabello mushrooms are tender and juicy and the breading gives a nice crunch.. Then the cheese.... oooey gooooey cheesy goodness oozing from the middle!   I tried the fries and chili fries but I just couldn't get my mind off the burger.  I will definitely come back again and board Noah's Ark more than once!   5 stars for a truly heavenly hallelujah burger experience!"}
{"text":"Juicy burger patties and perfectly sized buns makes Burger's Priest a satisfying summer lunch.  We arrived just before opening at 11:30 and already a line of about 12-15 people had formed. We chose the Cheeseburger and Holy Smokes burger with fries.   Flavour was great and service was fast.   We heard from a friend that Burger's Priest only accepts cash, no debit or visa. So probably a good idea to have some bills on hand."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger. It's fairly small for the price, and similar tasting to shake shack. I usually stick to the cheeseburger with everything but sometimes I will also get the high priest, which is basically their version of the big mac, which is also very tasty. Nice place to come to once in a while, but my fav burgers will still be Johnnys in scarborough or the pimento burger at stockyards. Though you cant really compare because I feel like they are three different burger experiences haha.  Didn't really like the fries here... But as stated in another review, they definitely are not skimpy with their napkins, which is actually pretty awesome, I agree."}
{"text":"ok HAD to try it. I've been wanting to for a while but never got around to heading to that neighborhood until this week. And ok, the hype is real and well deserved. I had the priest which is a cheeseburger + option. The option is obviously a knock off of shake shack's shroom burger but burger's priest's is a little bit greasier and cheesier. The burger patty was what won me over though. THE FLAVOUR WAS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD. It was meaty, juicy and grilled to perfection.  I did find it annoying that they don't allow anyone to eat inside the restaurant (it's december and snowing out and it's like 10pm. Where the hell am I supposed to eat this? I ended up driving home and then eating it- by then, the buns were a teeny bit soggy)  I'm a bit of a burger freak and have tried a lot \"famous\" burgers in Canada and in the states. Umami burger in LA was my favourite until I ate Burger's Priest. It's that good. I'm a pretty snarky critic but this time, I'm going to have to disagree with the haters and say this probably is one of the top burgers in Toronto!   We also got the chilli cheese fries and I cannot recommend those- it was NOT very good.   Just get the burger."}
{"text":"Don't know why its taken me so long to try Burgers Priest... I love burgers and I also work pretty close to the ones downtown.   Really liked this place. The patty was delicious. Maybe one of the best patties that I've had. The bun was pretty good too. I ordered the High Priest... its kind of like a big mac with 2 huge delicious patties for $10. I  don't think I'll get that particular burger again since I can get a Big Mac for a lot cheaper. But I also tried my wife's burger (Magnum), which was amazing.   Don't really  like these fries (I'm picky about fries). The fries are huge though. One serving is more than enough for 2 people  Lotsa reviews mention the prices are high, But I felt they were pretty fair. There are a bunch of burgers for under $10. And the fries, drinks etc are reasonable.   Theres quite a bit of seating, but the restaurant did  fill up when I visited on a Sat night. Plenty of parking. Accepts credit card."}
{"text":"I can't say that I agree with Now Mag as this place having Toronto's BEST burger, but it's pretty good!    I visited around the dinner time hour in March and the place, which is tiny, already had 8 people cramped in. I figured, it must be good, and by the time I left, there were 10 more people waiting.   I ordered a hamburger with everything, fries and a drink. A friend of mine ordered something with a deep-fried mushroom on top (at least that's what she told me), that had cheese and onions and it was all good stuff.  The meat for the burger is super fresh -- much appreciated; the bun is soft the way I like it and the staff are awesome!  The menu lets you customize your burger anyway you like, but it can get pricey. If I lived in the area I would be here all the time, but it was really worth the drive from Mississauga.   It's simple burgers done well, with good ingredients that make it taste great."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the locations on Dufferin and on Yonge. The food is good and the service is friendly and efficient.   I can't say the same at this location. The place was 60 percent empty when we came in. It took 45 minutes after ordering to get our food. The burgers were underdone, the fries were over cooked.   I won't return to this location."}
{"text":"If I had choose one of the horsemen for my experience, it'd definitely be death.  That's kinda how I felt after eating the four horsemen off their secret menu. A quadruple burger and mushroom patty burger with grilled cheeses instead of buns, it was quite the mess to conquer. Forks and knives almost required.  I loved the concept and loved the sight of ordering the monstrosity, but the taste overall was just okay. I've definitely had better fast casual burgers, and I mainly felt gross after. (I split the burger with someone too).  A few pros: wait time was super fast. We got our burger within five minutes of ordering. The cashier was very helpful and patient while we were deciding. The mushroom party was actually quite tasty. I might even prefer it to Shake Shake's shroom burger. Lastly, a secret menu?? Thanks Yelp for that insight which made the ordering experience that much more fun. Check out their website for the options!"}
{"text":"OMG...the best burgers in Toronto that I have ever tasted.  Must goto! I cant say enough about this place...always a line up there."}
{"text":"So yummy. My new burger place! Nothing to look at but the taste was amazing. I got the priest burger.  Friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger in the city. The meat is fresh daily and very juicy and moist. It is amazing as a take out burger because it is a small location and well worth trying."}
{"text":"I had to try this spot before leaving the 6ix. Ordered in Burger's Priest using Foodora. The menu off the website was confusing - especially it didn't help that there were no pictures of the burgers. There was an array of burgers, sides and shakes - not your \"In & out\" burger but definitely original. I ordered the Vatican City- which is a cheeseburger with two grilled cheese sandwiches as buns hugging two beef patties. It was definitely original-But there could've been a different choice of cheese selection for the grilled cheese instead of a \" triple cheesed out\" burger. Homage  to American cheddar! Definitely not your Dilallo in Montreal that still  holds my title of better burger joint.  Delivery - highly don't recommend it if you're ordering numerous burgers as they weren't labeled! Fancy fast food."}
{"text":"First time buying food there and it was quite good. We ordered the high priest burger, and surprisingly it tasted like the high end version of the Mcdonald big mac.  The burger was too salty for our liking, and the patties were on the dry side. Overall, the burger was very satisfying."}
{"text":"I ordered in via just eat and i have to say these were very good Burgers! I  love their take on the \"Big Mac\" it's just so much better!! and so much fresher! I really I loved the burger. The only complaint i had was in regards to the fries, they were not the greatest and really takes the whole experience down a notch as they were also delivered cold, but even if they were not, they were still pretty bad. It seems like they put so much effort into the burger, and seem to totally disregard the need for good fries to compliment their excellent burger. if they served fries like they do at fresh burger or 5 guys, these guys would be close to the best in the city."}
{"text":"This location has got some quality control issues. Stern fries had so many burnt onions. Burgers came missing toppings and patty was dry. I've never had a dry priest budget before!  We won't be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"This new burger place has amazingly yummy burgers. There are plenty of options for what type of burger you want. The smokies (deep fried jalapeños) are super yummy. The inside is quite loud and busy so don't expect to hear so well. It would be nice if the back parking lot had a few benches. Prices are moderate for what you get."}
{"text":"It's a tiny place that I read good review online and decided to try it out.  Their concept is like take out place as there's just a few stools, and it's cash only. The staff was friendly and very helpful as it was my first time and I asked for suggestions. The food was done within 7 minutes and I loved it! I've ordered two different burgers and I couldn't say which one was better (just remember the name of one which was the Californian).  I was amazed, definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Burgers are not bad here. My friend ordered bacon double cheese burger and I had the burger that's like a big Mac. The sauce was delicious! We got the fries on the secret menu that had cheese onions and sauce. The fries were delicious! So the food was good. I just feel like they were pricey. We could have gone to In and Out and not paid so much. $38 for 2 combos is expensive so that's why they only get 3 stars."}
{"text":"We ordered the cheeseburger, the \"Option\", and the hamburger for the kids to share. The best burgers we've ever had - fresh, simple, cooked perfectly. FYI - a take out place only and cash only, but it has an ATM. I love the fact that it has a secret menu. The size of the burgers were just right for us, not huge and we liked that.  We didn't order any sides or drinks, which is why I said that it is under $10/person. And it would be great for groups because the food is amazing! You just have to wait for it - it's worth the wait;)"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and made to order. But all it is simply is a fatty burger thats been fried to keep the juice in.  I have had other burgers that are much better. Certainly did not live up to the hype and not worth going out of my way for."}
{"text":"after hearing so much about the burger's priest i had to try it.  It was super busy, but the line moved pretty fast.  I had a priest burger and chilli fries and a diet root beer.  I appreciate that they have a good selection of diet pop.  The priest burger, is a cheese burger with \"the option\" (mushroom with cheese breaded and deep fried) the option is also the vegetarian sandwich, and while it was yummy, it completely overpowered the flavour of the burger.  They were very skimpy on the condiments, 2 pickles, hardly any ketchup.   I don't recommend the chilli fries.   all in all, Meh, I've experienced better.   oh yeah, it was pretty expensive. three people was $45. Alot for a place with no bathroom, or tables and chairs."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! Ordered the High Priest to go and got back to work within 5 min to eat it. The burger had an odd smell but I figured it was just my senses. But I was not wrong! My burger was cold (after 5 min?), the bread was old and hard, my fries tasted like they were sitting there for hours: I'm completely turned off by this location and will never ever visit again. How can anyone possibly serve that to another human being."}
{"text":"Not bad burger... Average. Not worth the premium price for a burger. I had higher expectations for this chain as I have heard positive things about the food. The sitting area for this location specifically was awful - there were a few tiny tables and a few chairs. Luckily we were able to grab a table before it got \"packed\".  Back to the burger - they have a secret menu (which I was tempted to try, but didn't) and a regular menu in store. The bread and patties they use were good, but I honestly felt that a fast food place like Harvey's had a better quality patty.  Overall, I wouldn't really recommend this chain to a friend, as there are plenty of other burger restaurants to try out with which taste better. If I'm in the area and craving a burger, I will grab one, but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"You know, I'm on a diet and with the coax of my brother I decided to make this my once a month cheat. I was SO DISAPPOINTED!!! The burger was smaller than a whopper amd 3 times the price.  No taste. Skimpy. The fries. Burnt. No taste. Over fried.  Too much salt. The whole meal came up to 25$ for the both of us and I was still hungry. So hungry as a matter of fact that I had to go eat something else after!! Do yourself the favor and go buy a box of burgers and some bums and condiments and DO IT YOURSELF!!! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND CALORIES!!!!! I only WISH I can get my money back or BETTER YET, start the day over so I NEVER WENT IN!! Awful. Never again. Should be shut down."}
{"text":"For the millionth time in my life, I couldn't decide on what to eat for brunch. Decided on Burger Priest finally. It had a bright sign on the corner and it was located on the corner of the block. When I drove into the parking lot, at first glance it didn't look like there were many parking spots. But there actually is free parking if you go down into their underground parking lot. Walked into the place and I was greeted by the cashier with a smile and he was eager to take my order. He made sure that I chose the fillings I wanted in my burger and asked if I would like anything else. Though he had a moment  of forgetfulness with spelling my common name, he was able to turn the mistake into a smile on my mind. I asked him if they had forks and knives to which they said yes. I usually eat my burgers with utensils, but this time it was so good I actually dug in with my hands. The chef and cashier were mindful enough to put the utensils into the bag though I didn't specifically ask them for it. This was a nice touch. I ordered the blue cheeseburger and made it a double. The patty was juicy and not overcooked, not too little sauce and not too much, tomatoe and lettuce were fresh. Though there was a little pool of fat on the paper burger pouch thing, it was okay because it made it taste all that better. While I was eating I noticed a senior couple come in and order. The cashier took the time to read out their choices of toppings as they were having a little trouble seeing the board. The cashier had asked them to take a seat after they finished ordering. And to my surprise the cashier brought their burger to the table personally and also notified them the chef had cut their burger in half as they had asked. These little extra touches really enhances someone's experiences and I must say they made an impressive impression on me today. From the time I entered the establishment and leaving it, the chef and cashier both still had a smile on their face. It shows me that they truly do enjoy their day and enjoy serving customers. Bathrooms and floors were clean, and the ambiance was peaceful.Kudos to this location's management and team, you've done a great job."}
{"text":"Ahhh!!  We drove to Toronto from NYC and got in at about 2:30am. I was starving and didn't feel like pizza, so decided to hit up this joint.   It was Saturday night and the hoards of drunken people were out but this place was pretty clean and didn't have a lineup out the door, so I decided to get a burger, with two patties and a milkshake( a pretty bad meal before bed but hey, I was on vacation).   The burger was surprisingly really solid! It seemed like it was freshly cooked and was delicious. The milkshake was solid too! Overall, great place to grab a late night snack!"}
{"text":"Good burger overpriced and overrated. It's not the best burger in Toronto It's a good burger but it just cracks the top ten i think in toronto. The priest has a prime location and the name stands out. too much money  not enough meat. Dans and the Real Mccoy make way better burgers."}
{"text":"Heard about this place long time ago, never get a chance to try it. Read their menu online and decided to try the namesake burger, \"the Priest\"  It was quick, receive the burger and fries in less than 5 minutes. Queen st. location is small with a few small table, with one high table in the corner that you can stand there and eat.  Bite into the burger, the cheese in the \"option\" was a bit much, making the burger greasy, and a little salty. The burger meat doesn't seem to be anything special. The fries are skinless fries, and LOADED with salt. Making the whole meal sodium level through the roof. Not recommended for anyone has a high blood pressure problem.  Will try other items to see if this was a one time thing."}
{"text":"Hugely disappointing. There's a lot of hype around this restaurant, so I gave it a second chance but both times (different locations) were severely underwhelming. The burgers here are fancy-ish McDonald's burgers at twice the price. If you love McDonald's, you'll love this place but don't waste your money. Just stick with McDonald's, it's better value. The patties are thin and flavourless. They just cover it up with greasy toppings in the hope that you won't notice. The bun is not much better than store-bought buns either. I tried to like it because my roommate raves about it but I just can't figure out why. I am a burger lover and this place just makes me sad. For this price point, you should go to somewhere like Big Smoke Burger instead."}
{"text":"Went in hoping for a sinfully greasy burger, and it sure didn't disappoint there! Delicious beef patty, though if anything it's a little TOO greasy. I got the California single, and it was quite tasty, though I wish they had put more sauce on it. My date got the Vatican burger, which was smaller than I expected it to be, but it was DELICIOUS. Now I know it's really the burger to get! I got fries on the side and they were just okay. Next time I might get a milkshake instead of fries as their selection of sweet drinks and treats is pretty impressive.   It is a bit on the pricey side, costing $11.50 for the Vatican, but significantly better than your typical fast food burger!"}
{"text":"Hypothetically speaking, if you heard the theme to Law & Order playing through your neighbour's wall every hour for approximately eight hours you would probably become concerned, so you start to wonder if your neighbours even give a shit about you at all or if they're just going to let you become one with your couch like a horrific scene from the movie Se7en starring Brad Pitt and you praise Baby Jebus he isn't bearing witness to you in this state because you're desperately trying to recover from your hangover by using Foodora to order one of \"The Best Veggie Burgers in Toronto\" aka \"The Option\" from The Burger's Priest, which is two roasted portobellos stuffed with enough cheese to send a man to purgatory then deep fried, plus all 7 optional toppings and a side of fries topped with real melted cheese and you count your blessings that this restaurant doesn't ruin perfectly good fries with that radioactive orange goo or make their veggie burgers with some sort of pasty bean patty abomination because you're not a vegetarian but just because someone chooses that particular lifestyle doesn't mean they should have to eat shit food."}
{"text":"Just driving by,  it caught our eye.  Delicious,delicious.  I can not say enough about the food!!  The staff was also great.  Super friendly and fun.  It would be worth driving back from Buffalo!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest burger fanatic, but I gotta say that I'm definitely a fanatic of Burger's Priest. I ordered the \"Vatican City\" and it was delicious! The grilled cheese \"buns\" gave it that extra oomph! The patties were extremely delicious. I also ordered the chilli cheese fries and they were a let down. The star should've been delicious chilli.. But instead tasted under seasoned. Lots of cheese though, yay!"}
{"text":"My first time here, and lets say I expected way too much! Or at least more than what I got. I was carried away by the pics on the website.. The burguers look so delicious!  But when I got mine (Priest: cheeseburguer with \"the option\")  it was disappointingly small . My daughter order a double bacon cheeseburguer, and hers was even smaller than mine! And had literally one half strip of bacon!!! One!!! My friend he ordered the Noah's arc, and he got the worst part... I can't lie, they are flavourful,  and the fries are delicious, but c'mon! Is not worth the price for the size! We had a $55 lunch, for 3 ppl, and we had to go looking for the rest of our lunch. Someone told me it was the location, they said at other locations the portions are bigger and better, but I don't think I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"I've been to the new \"gourmet\" burger shops in Toronto (W Burger, Craft, Oh Boy Burger and Burger Shoppe) and this place is nothing like that. This place serves a good plain burger. The chuck is ground twice by the order which makes it so juicy and melts in your mouth.  I suggest asking for the \"Big Mic\" it's the owner's version of the \"Big Mac\" and not listed on the menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered the priest special..... What a mistake. Happened to sit outside with another customer. We both looked at each other after the first couple of bites and found the closest garbage can to dump the rest of our burgers in.   How can anyone rate this grease ball of a thing anything more than 1 star....."}
{"text":"Their burgers are so goOooOO0d. I tried their burger for the first time 3 days ago and I couldn't stop thinking about it for the next two days. Because I have no self control, I went to get another burger today - double this time. I've decided I'm not allowed to go back for a month. It is a bit greasy, but I don't feel gross during or after my meal at all (just happiness, really)  Haven't been able to find a burger place I actually like until now. It's a little far for me but I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burger joints in the City. The secret menu (online) is amazing too - had the \"Vatican City\" which is essentially two beef patties between two grilled cheese sandwiches. Uber delish!"}
{"text":"While in Mississauga visiting relatives, we decided to go on a burger quest having seen a number of places featured on a few TV shows. Since The Burger's Priest recently opened another location in Mississauga, it was a no brainer. WRONG! I have no idea what all the buzz is about. I had a double with special sauce...the counter girl said it was their version of a Big Mac, Problem is, a Big Mac is way better! The rather thin patties were absolutely tasteless. Run of the mill roll and an order of fries produced potato bits...not one \"fry\" longer than a half an inch. It was like what's left in the fry basket after they serve real fries.The noise level was unbearable to the point everyone in the place had to yell at each other. There were four of us and all felt the same way - rather tasteless food and a bit pricey for what you get (or what you don't get). Sorry Priest...time to convert and find a real burger joint worth eating at. I hope all the hipsters keep you in business because it's clearly not about the food!"}
{"text":"Really great people here. I walked in 5 minutes after closing after driving 30 minutes from Milton. They restarted their grill and fryer for me. Top notch.   Food was awesome as always."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I've had the Cheeseburger, the Option (mushroom-cheese patty, vegetarian option) and the chili cheese fries. I can't say I was a fan of the latter two, but the cheeseburger itself was a four-star experience, and the prices overall were (in my humble opinion) perfectly justifiable and reasonable ($5.79 for the cheeseburger, $8.49 for the double on Foodora). I'm not sure what to say about the cheeseburger - it was absolutely delicious! I suggest you buy a double, however, as it is a little small on its own :) I've ordered online before and I received a complimentary drink with my meal, which I thought was a considerate and friendly touch for a fast food joint that I wouldn't expect to be so keen on providing great service - needless to say, I'm a happy customer! My sister had the double cheeseburger, good old plain fries and chili cheese fries and she definitely seems willing to pledge her allegiance to the BP now too. We hope to be back many times! Next, I have my sights set on trying what looks to be some sort of ice cream sandwich in some of the photos here - go big or go home, right?"}
{"text":"Great place to eat but don't even think about getting a seat during lunch hour. Tables are really small but doable. Food is amazing"}
{"text":"The last time I was in Toronto (2012), TBP had one location on Queen St and I knew exactly 2 people who had tried their burgers. Both of them loved the food, but little did I know that TBP would really take off and even make it to Alberta! Fast forward to this year - I am back in T.Dot for a few days and come to find out that TBP expanded their business a 10-fold. It was a given that we finally had to try their burgers now.  We came here for dinner one evening and the place was packed. Luckily, we were able to snatch the last table though before ordering.  We decided on The Priest and High Priest as well as a side of fries. The High Priest tasted like an amazing version of a Big Mac, but I totally loved The Priest. So tasty! The meat had so much flavor + was so juicy and those cheese stuffed portobello mushroom caps just took the burger to another level. Awesomeness. The fries did not blow me away, but whatever - I came here for the burgers anyways.  $10.49 per burger is not cheap, but they are totally worth their money. Can't wait to come back here in a couple of years. ;)"}
{"text":"The burgers? Wow! Amazing... The only disappointment for us was that we couldn't eat there.  No dining room... While the food survived the trip back to the hotel, we weren't expecting to need to get it to go and I'm sure it would have tasted that much better on the spot.  Still giving 5 stars bc the burgers were that good."}
{"text":"Very Overrated! I can't believe how small the burgers were, you can eat them in 4-5 bites! The website makes them look huge. I rarely eat burgers but when I do I want a real burger that requires the use of two hands!  The fries were really good though and they give you a lot. Service was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Best Burger in Toronto Hands Down!!! Juicy and Meaty!"}
{"text":"Wow, I can't explain it. It was delish, if it's your first time and you love mushroom, cheese, and a nice simple burger. Get the priest burger, that should be their signature burger. Check out the picture I posted below!  @hangrymann approves."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty awful. The guy who took our order kept staring for some unknown reason. The food was mediocre. I tried their veggie burger which felt very greasy and heavy. My friend ordered the high priest. He said was pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"Redefining bad ass.  Other than noting that this was quite possibly the best burger I've ever had, what's a guy supposed to add that hasn't been said in the other 74 reviews?"}
{"text":"We are on the hunt for the BEST BURGER in Toronto! Stop #4: The Burger's Priest  Of all the restaurants that were suggested, The Burger's Priest garnered the most excitement. That excitement grows as the first thing you see is the excessively large, broadway-esque, and well lit \"the Burger's Priest\" sign. As you walk inside, the decor is nice and simplistic, but for some reason there are bible quotes on the walls, some in English, and some in what I think is Arabic. Why? I don't know, and I'm not going to question it further. The one annoying decor detail is their confusingly small tables and stools. I'm not a six year old. Please give me a real seat.  I stayed off the secret menu for my first go, and ordered The Priest, which is a cheeseburger with \"the Option\". Without question, the Option is special. Originally this was intended to be a vegetarian replacement for a regular beef patty. It's two roasted portobello mushrooms that are breaded and deep fried. But get this; in the middle of those two gentle mushrooms is a gooey... sloppy... and probably sinful amount of cheese, that immediately makes you get a little emotional. All that being said, and despite my infatuation for the Option, it overwhelms and violently outshines everything else. If there were other flavours that they were trying to showcase, mission unaccomplished, because all I got was a cheese comma with a gentle, meaty caress. Lastly, I should say that the bun is nothing special.  The fries, which I assume that they make in-house, are pretty damn nice.  Is this going to take the title as best burger in the T.O.? Not this time, but they made a respectable attempt, and I'm really happy that I went."}
{"text":"Do not order the chicken. It was tiny and covered in sauce.  You will leave hungry. My kids seemed to enjoy the burgers."}
{"text":"Welcome to the most concise reviewer in Toronto:  Tasty and unique burger taste  Ideal American cuisine.  Prices fairly higher avg meal burger + fries + drink = $14-16  Self serve setup. Plenty of parking spaces."}
{"text":"I miss this place sooooo much!!!  My husband used to live a couple blocks away and I obsessed over eating here!!!  I cannot remember the name of the burger we would get (we split it most of the time because it was massive!) but it had the grilled cheese buns from the secret menu.  My mouth waters every time thinking about it!!  That burger got me on a mission to try every other burger like that but nothing is half as good as here!  When we go back to visit, I told my husband that I am going here first!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger. Juicy, well topped, made to order, the way it should be. No gluten free buns, though."}
{"text":"Best burger place in Toronto.  Soooo juicy!"}
{"text":"I went here to grab lunch and got a cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate chip cookie. The only thing that sucked was that it was cash only. When I travel I typically don't carry cash on me and if I do, I usually have US currency. Anyway, dare I say that it tasted like an In n Out cheeseburger?!? Why yes, yes it did. It was damn tasty. The fries were a bit too greasy for me. The cookie was a nice treat."}
{"text":"I always get \"The Option\" (the veggie burger, made from breaded mushrooms I think, with melted cheese), & usually a vanilla milkshake w/ malt. Truly delicious. The staff are nice, the food is cheap & good, the pickles are excellent."}
{"text":"Four stars? People, wake up.  This is an expensive joke. Ordered the High Priest and could have sworn I received a Big Mac. Greasy, relatively small, and somewhere in the $10 range without fries or a drink.  The restaurant's interior reeks of cheap fast food and has limited seating. No outdoor seating either.  Credit or debit cards? Nope. Cash only.  At least the employees were friendly, so +1 star for that.  Live and learn."}
{"text":"Great fries and the burger is at least 4 star taste, but as others mention, it's just a bit too small. The beef tastes terrific, and I like the fact that it's almost fattier/juicier than most. The size of the burger is probably sensible for a somewhat normal portion, but I've come to expect a bigger size for a burger for better or worse. Still worth going for sure though. 3.5 Rating."}
{"text":"believe the hype. the burgers taste like beef and not fillers unlike other fast food burgers.   the quality and price point put them well above a regular fast food burger, but this is restaurant quality food for a few bucks over a meal at McD.  Get the Priest before going crazy ordering off the secret menu!"}
{"text":"WARNING: YOU MIGHT WAIT 1HOUR FOR 1BURGER! (At this location specifically)  On a rainy weekend day, i waited 1hr to get 1 single burger.   Normally they let you know estimated time at the cashier, this time they didn't. After 20mins wait, they filled all uber&delivery orders then they said \"Sorry you need to wait 15mins more\". Nope i waited 40mins more, 1hr in total.   Burger's Priest is always a go-to place since 2013 and their burgers are a painting of perfection but i think their service business model is dying with more delivery businesses booming.  Ultimately everybody will order delivery online since people have cold feet for the restaurant walk-ins."}
{"text":"I had some high expectations because a friend recommended this place when I said I was craving some In-N-Out burgers.  Although they are similar in that they both use very fresh beef, the burgers are pretty expensive.  We spent over $30 for just two burgers and fries.  I got the High Priest and my boyfriend got the California Classic.  The High Priest was basically a Big Mac but with better buns and patties. The patties were quite juicy but there wasn't much about them that stood out to me.  The restaurant is pretty small and can get quite loud during their busy times.  Overall, I feel like this place is a little over priced but their burgers are pretty good."}
{"text":"Had high expectations especially based on the price. Totally not worth it. Better off going to Five Guys down the street."}
{"text":"Best burger in the city. Eat the High Priest (their take on a Big Mac) and its saucy goodness. The meat is so fresh that it breaks apart in your mouth. You come here for a good burger and you definitely get it. Some people think the price is a little high for a burger but if you want to try other \"premium burgers\" you're likely paying the same or more for a lesser grade.   Don't skip out, this place is for real."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers that I've ever tried.   I got the Priest Burger and it was delicious. The melted cheese and beef patty combine into make a mouth watering combo.The cheesy battered portebello mushroom made the burger extra special. I enjoyed my burger the first time so much that I went to back again in less than a week.  I also had the fries. Which weren't bad, but I would stick to just a burger next time. If you do get fries I suggest getting the Chili fries."}
{"text":"Burger priest easily has the best hamburgers in town.  It's not cheap but well worth it.  I recommend skipping the French fries and having more burger instead.  The fries are mediocre, but they make a good shake as well.  I am a big fan of the high priest, it's kind of like a Big Mac but much much better!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, they used to be my favourites in Toronto but I find them too greasy now and sometimes too salty. The most popular ones are pretty expensive. Fries are not good. And milkshakes are just okay. Customer service is not bad but nothing special, and food gets ready usually pretty fast."}
{"text":"Burger was made of burger meat and tasted like burger meat.  Fries were a bit undercooked and tasted kinda waxy.  I'm not really getting what all the fuss is about here, but I think I will try it again someday to see if I can experience the same rapture that others seem to enjoy."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends tonight and we had a good time. We had just gotten drinks at a store nearby and they allowed us to take them into the restaurant. Only issue would be that the seating is pretty tight. There's only a small stool/accompanying tables and no where to put your jackets and belongings!   I ordered a \"secret-menu\" item which was located on their website if you answer a question (the answer is 370 days!) called \"Noah's Ark\". It's essentially a cheese-stuffed, breaded portobello mushroom burger with chili and cheese. Yum! It was pretty delicious. You could say it's one of the lighter options since it's base (w/o the chili) was a vegetarian burger.. but I mean, this one definitely had its fair share of cheese!  From the regular menu, one of my friends ordered \"The Priest\", which he commented was \"a lot like a Big Mac\". That can be good or bad depending on how much you like Big Macs, I suppose!   The other friend ordered the most cardiac-arresting, artery-clogging burger on the secret-menu. He got the iconic \"The Four Horsemen of The Apocalypse\"... which consisted of 2 layers of beef patties and 2 layers of cheese-stuffed portobello mushrooms. He nearly died. He couldn't finish it and felt a little sick near the end. It also costed a little over $28 so be warned that this burger is definitely not for the faint-hearted!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the priest burger as it was different from any other burger I've had. The price is high but you're getting quality meat and lots if cheese. I thought the portion was perfectly fine."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in to try this place after years of hearing so many rave reviews about it.  We had the California special, cheeseburger, chilli cheese fries and Pepsi float.  Portions were smaller than average burgers, especially with the pricier tags.  Burger was definitely juicy and flavourful, although not fit the health-conscious with all the grease.  Thought it was pretty neat to have finely shredded cheese on the fries.  It's a cute restaurant set-up with sufficient seating capacity.  Probably would not return, once is enough to satisfy our curiosity...can get better value elsewhere!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced this place to me. Always a line up, but worth it. Parking might be a problem, but there are few parking lot near by, it is queen st west and spadina ave, so you know how it is."}
{"text":"Wow ! Even cold it taste awesome... I had a cheese burger and fries and cause I couldn't eat it there, when I got back to the office it was cold ... But hey it was still very juicy! Next time I will sit there!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Once again another over hyped Toronto spot smh. Seriously overpriced for the amount you're paying (two combos is just a little over $30) which is stupid considering the burgers are super tiny. The fries I would rate 5/10, they look and taste like fries you could literally make yourself at home. Also they could improve on how quickly and often they clean tables, there were quite a few dirty tables. It's always good to try new places and things, now that I've had my visit I won't bother coming back"}
{"text":"It was inevitable.  We had to get the Tower of Babel.   A double cheesburger.  With an option.  With grilled cheese for buns.  Total?  $20.10.  WHAT? a TWENTY DOLLAR BURGER? Because they have a secret menu, that's not something you can complain about... so you just pay it.  But seriously... I was waiting for someone else to come in, ask for the same thing and them say, \"$15.50\", like I was a chump. #boourns  Regardless, It was delicious.  really BEEFY taste, So huge you couldn't actually eat the whole height in one bite.  Every single thing in that burger was done to perfection and it was simple- no fancy cheeses or sauces necessary.  However, I 100% agree with Sarah L's review: -The secret menu is novel but unnecessary.  All of their burgers are going to taste the same \"LIKE COW\".  That's a good thing, for me- but just a warning to others who dare order off the secret menu- it's not worth it except for the picture opportunity and saying that you did it. -The beef is overwhelming and the extra cheese just makes it extra greasy.  There is no real need to get more than a single burger other than the fact that it might not be enough for you to eat.  Echoing Sarah L.'s review- the meat to bun ratio on a double is not desirable- there really IS simply too much meat. -The fries are unimpressive and the drink options are almost non-existent. -The place, even though I realize is no frills, kind of looks like food poisoning waiting to happen.   Yeah, I will come back.  It's totally worth it for that unique taste.  But my recipe next time will be: 1) Single cheeseburger 2) Fries from the neighbouring KFC , and 3) A chocolate milkshake from Harvey's across the street   : )"}
{"text":"We visited this much spoken about place for lunch today.  Although bright and cheerful, the atmosphere was pretty much non-existent.  A few small tables and resin chairs. reminded me of a cafeteria or a food court.  The staff were happy and friendly and the food came back quite quickly. Unfortunately the buns they use for the burgers are those squishy, tasteless, white hamburger buns, and to make matters worse, they were not toasted.  So although the actual hamburger was very tasty, the bun was boring and un-toasted. So what's up with that?  I also felt that it was expensive."}
{"text":"When I picture a gourmet burger joint, I picture thick patties, lots of topping choices, artisan bread buns, flame grill.  The Burger's Priest has none of these.  If that's what you're looking for, don't go here.  The Burger's Priest blew right through several of my preconceptions quickly.  They use a flat grill instead of flame, their patties and buns are relatively small.  Their toppings are classic, and don't include four kinds of cheese or chipotle mayonnaise.  Fortunately, the burger itself was great, significantly better than what I'd had at burger places that had all the gourmet trappings.  It was all very simple, just good ingredients, very well executed.  And although the portions aren't massive, I'm entirely certain that's probably a more appropriate serving size that the portions that I'm used to.  Do yourself a favor, leave your expectations at home, and just go in and try a very simple, very good burger like the cheeseburger, and see what you think.  It's worth it.  I will note that the vegetarian \"option\" is mushroom-based (two portobello caps sandwiched around cheese and breaded, I believe), so if you're a vegetarian who doesn't like mushrooms, there's no burger option for you.  It's a very small restaurant, there's room for about six people to sit.  The space that's there is nice, though."}
{"text":"It is absolute and utter nonsense! The burger's priest website is mislealeading. And  I cannot even begin to explain the justeat website regarding the option burger. What a hideous experience. An utter waste of my time and money! I don't even want to rate them."}
{"text":"Their burgers are top notch, my favourite is the \"option\" burger but vaticanized. The prices are quite high but definitely worth the taste.  Highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"After hearing lots of good things from a trusted friend, I decided to give this place a shot. I went with a pretty basic double burger w/cheese & bacon and while I've certainly had worse burgers, I don't know that I'll be in a rush to come back. Here's why:  Cost: My burger came to a little over $11 and I could deal with that. Meanwhile, the $3.99 fries were not $3.99 fries. Basically just stubby chip-stand fries. For that money you'd want something like the seasoning at Gangster Burger or the duck fat fries at WVRST.  Noise: Maybe this means I'm an old man now, but the combination of a small space with a too-loud stereo and relatively noisy kitchen counter made it tricky to hear the softly spoken cashier and, occasionally, my dining partner. To their credit, they knew how big to go with hollering my number when my order was ready.  Not a Great First Impression: The system has a little kink that'd be easy to remember on subsequent visits, but was a little bothersome on the first - especially with the noise level making it tricky to catch the explanation that they have one basket for taking your number and a second, on the other end of the counter, for depositing it. I'm not sure why they don't just have both baskets behind the counter for the cashier to sort out.  The Burger: Hearty, for sure, but greasy to the point that you'll actually need most of the two dozen napkins they give you. Greasy to the point of having a bit of a food hangover afterwards. Maybe that's your jam, but it isn't mine. The meat was tasty and the bun pleasingly soft, though.  So yeah, not garbage by any stretch, but there's a handful of small annoyances that combine with the glut of choice for burgers in the immediate area - let alone Toronto - to leave me in no rush to return. Within less than five minutes walk of here you can hit BGM or Gangster Burger for a better premium cut, or hit up the almost-adjacent McDonalds or Hero Burger for something lower quality, yet still filling. Maybe they'll improve, I hope they do."}
{"text":"Place is toooo loud. Can't even hear your number being yelled out. Why is a place of sanctuary blaring music so loud?  I ordered the Priest burger with fries. It took so long to make and get my order but I hoped that it was worth the wait. The patty is freshly ground meat but is has no hold to it - no binding agent. The patty falls apart and doesn't hold it's shape. It kind of felt like I was eating a sloppy joe without the sauce. The fries tasted just okay but were cut too small. It made it seem like I was eating all the leftover small pieces of fries.  I've been here a couple of times and I don't know why I keep thinking it would be better, but I keep getting disappointed in the end. It's gimmicky but I find it too expensive for a burger that is half cooked. Other love this place but I don't find it to my liking."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in the east end of town and figured why not give them a try here.  I decided to go with a simple burger, the Priest, and give it another fair chance with my regular toppings when I rate burgers (mayo, ketchup, onions, and pickles). Got a drink and a side of fries and wow it's pricy.  This place has actual seats where you can eat and was glad because it was raining outside. They gave me a bag and there doesn't seem to be any trays so that's classy. :-) And the music is played too loud - it's not a club.  Took my first bite and remembered why I have been trying to like this burger but always end up disappointed. The patty breaks up and ends up like ground beef textured and the fat from the meat makes it so messy and soggy. The fries were a not to my liking with short stubby lengths which made it seem like left overs.  I keep praying for it to be better but it always falls short. It'll be hard to come back and probably will, because everyone else seems to like it."}
{"text":"Very good burger - it just tasted fresh. Fries had way too much salt on them, though. Space is tiny - even if you can get one of the 5 seats at the bench it can be very crowded if a few others show up to order."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen the maenad on True Blood get whipped up into a frenzy as she vibrates thousands of times per second. That quite possibly might be what happened to me when I bit into \"The Priest\" burger at Queen East's latest addition (and my newfound addiction) to Toronto's billions of burger spots.  Ok, maybe that maenad comparison might have been a bit of a hyperbole; I didn't vibrate thousands of times per second... it was more like a gluttony-induced shudder. But I had my reasons. \"The Priest\" burger might have been one of the best I've ever had. And I have LOTS of burgers in my time. Lots.  I'd say the hallmark of any good burger is the actually patty. Apparently the clergy at The Burger's Priest--love that name-- grind up their beef several times a day to ensure fresh taste and top quality. And it shows. The cook even left it slightly pink inside (on purpose). They must have confidence in that meat, right? I mean, you'd never eat a burger served medium at McDonald's without having to file a class-action lawsuit afterwards.  The second hallmark of a good burger is the toppings. And this is where it gets interesting. \"The Priest\" is actually a combination of the regular cheeseburger and the veggie burger. Oh, vegetarian options, so boring, so taste-free. SO WRONG. This is one of those delightful times that the healthy option is actually way more unhealthy than the unhealthy option. Oh the irony. This veggie burger is a slice of cheese sandwiched between two portobello mushrooms, breaded in panko and deep fried. Somewhere Homer Simpson just drooled.  My friend told me TBP's style of burger is the closest thing you'll get to an In-N-Out Burger in Toronto. Well that just saved me LOTS of time and effort because I was almost going to plan a trip to California to experience these little tastes of heaven.  The room is small and the air conditioner is powerful enough to cool down the Roger's Centre, but who cares, it's kind of cute. The location is actually quite ideal. It's right across from the Beaches Cinema, so you can easily grab a bite and head to a show. It's also really close to the LCBO, so you can also grab a bite and head there too, if you're so inclined.  Besides the over-enthusiastic welcome (I assume this will mellow with age?), the only gripe I had about my experience was the price. My combo came out to be around $17. Ironically this is the same amount you'd pay for the A-MA-ZING burger at Harbord Room, and that comes with service and a beautiful setting. Maybe an adjustment would be appropriate? Just a suggestion.  But there is only forgiveness in my heart for The Burger's Priest. I'll be a faithful customer for a long time."}
{"text":"Best burger place I've had in Toronto. Hands down.  I know we have laws here to to make sure the beef is well done, but I love my burgers a bit pink in the middle, and the Burger's Priest does this beautifully.    I tried the double-double.  The loosely packed patty is nicely cooked, seared on the outside and oh so juicy on the inside.  The bread and lettuce are fresh, and the cheese is beautifully melted; the double double was reminiscent of some of the finer burger's I've had in my life, most comparable to Shake Shack in NYC.  I want to knock off a star because of the price point ($9 after taxes is a bit pricey for a smallish double patty burger - think In' n' out size - with no drinks or fries, out of the downtown core with no seating), but this place is the best I've had in the GTA, so I'll give it 5 until I find some place better.  Because of the location and price point, I won't be frequenting frequently, but I'll have to drop by next time I've a craving for a good ol' burger!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that I don't like hamburgers, never have.    After eating here I can't say that anymore.  I won't eat them every day but when I feel like  a burger this is where I'm coming.  We had the bacon burger and a single cheese burger along with the chili fries and a vanilla milkshake.  The chili fries were really good.   Layers of crispy fries and chili with shredded cheddar cheese on top.  The layers of fries were still crispy and the chili was equally tasty.  Now, the burger.   Moist delicious need patty with no sign of filler, nice bun and fresh toppings.  Simple and delicious.  Milkshake?  Equally creamy goodness.  Coming back for sure.  Period."}
{"text":"The burgers are truly religious!  Once you try one of their burgers you will be converted and preaching to all of your friends and family about joining the Burger Priest cult --- uhh -- religion --- I mean... tradition!  The buns are toasted to perfection.  The sauces are sensational.  The burger meat is truly addictive.  It melts in your mouth and keeps you wanting more.  When I came here the line was literally out of the door.  However, they have a TON of staff working and they are all friendly and cheerful even with a constant line up out the door and orders coming in like mad.  The wait is not too long at all and well worth it if you are looking to taste an amazing burger!  Try out the secret menu that you can find out on their website and you will not be disappointed.  This is by far the best burger I have had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes. The places is trendy looking and clean. The music sucks to the point I wanted to stick the plastic fork in my ear.  For a chain place I found the fries over cooked and the gravy was thin.  The burger was good so there was a positive aspect.  I may or may not return.  For the price it's a bit high but. Its not out of the park.  I found this place to be ok but not the big wow I was hoping for. It was good.  but not great.  I enjoyed it for a change anyhow"}
{"text":"http://mmmilovefood.wordpress.com/2012/09/16/the-burgers-priest-a-truly-religious-experience/  After hearing so much hype about The Burger's Priest, I finally ventured down to Queen Street East to quell my curiousity. Located in a small unit in a sketchy part of town, the fast food joint is standing room only. I stopped by for a late night bite on a weeknight, and there was still a long line running out through the front door. When I finally got through the doors, I was overwhelmed by the aroma of fresh ground burgers cooking on a flat top griddle. The decor inside was simple, but I was impressed by the subtle nuances, like the confessional booth screens that accent the front facade of the counter. It was hot in the small space and I was sweating like a whore in church.  I've had a lot of burgers in my lifetime, but very few come close to the sinfully delicious Priest Burger. It's a cheeseburger with a special addition they call \"The Option\" - a juicy portabello mushroom with cheese, deep fried in batter. Ground and seasoned on site daily, the fresh beef patty is packed with flavour and grilled to juicy perfection. \"The Option\" is like nothing I'd ever had before. It looked like an onion ring on steroids.  My first bite was orgasmic. As my teeth penetrated \"The Option,\" I felt a warm explosion of creamy cheese jizz in my mouth. Sorry to sound crude, but those words really are the best ones to describe how sinfully delicious The Priest Burger really is. The bun is soft and fresh, and sops up the creamy goodness that spills out of the burger. At a premium price of $9.99, it's not a cheap burger, but absolutely worth every penny. It was one of the best burger's I've ever had!  I can't wait to go back. I discovered that they have an unseen menu that they only post on their Facebook page. They've got secret burger concoctions like \"The High Priest,\" \"The Tower of Babel,\" \"The Blue Steel,\" \"The Magnum\", and the aptly named lamb burger - \"The Messiah\"."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Probably because I can't eat dairy, which is the secret ingredient in everything. I settled on a plain old hamburger and was pretty underwhelmed by the quality of the patty. There was really nothing special about it. I totally forgot about the secret menu and perused it when I was eating. Everything was pretty cheese-heavy.  The fries were really good, but that was about it."}
{"text":"Bacon double cheeseburger. This is all you need to know....  I used to go to the Yonge location, and would always have to find parking and there was no space there to sit and eat. At this location, there is ample parking and seating!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, tasted quite fresh. I wouldn't mind going again here in couple of months. Good selection of beef and chicken items and desserts. Very hip place. Though the burger I order had a tad little too much salt in it over all good burger."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype was about. The burger was good but not out of this world.  However, it definitely beats any other fast food chains like McDonald's, hero burger, or Burger King."}
{"text":"I have been waiting in anticipation to try this burger and I am sorry to say that I might have hyped it up too much for myself.  I had the cheeseburger combo with my regular toppings, fries, and a drink. I was surprised on how small the burger was for the price. The burger almost passes for a slider. The taste was just okay and it reminded me of a McDonalds kids hamburger. The bun was dense and stuck to the roof of my mouth. The fries were mediocre and would've tasted better with gravy because they were half soggy.  I would only come back if there was no line ups and was on the way. The location is pretty difficult to park and the place is cramped. I would recommend adding another patty or trying out the priest burger (which I should've gotten)."}
{"text":"Location: On Queen West, close to all the shopping. Street parking available but check zoning as most of it is metered. Also, good luck finding a spot.   The place: Very small, bare bones decor kind of place. I would estimate about... ten tables or so. You basically order, they give you a number and then call you when your food is ready.  The goods: Both my friend and I ordered the California Classic, except I added bacon to mine. Or rather, they added exactly ONE slice (that wasn't crispy, like I requested). The burger was solid, though the flattened buns didn't really work for me. I mean, if you're going to give me a juicy burger then I need something besides my multiple napkins to absorb the juice, no? My friend and I both found that they were cheap on the toppings - for example, we had exactly 3 pickle slices each (and don't forget my one slice of bacon that I paid an extra $1.69 for). As well, I think that the burger was meant to have caramelized onions but this was not the case. It was a slice of onion that was sauteed. This is not caramelized. In any case, the burger WAS good but I've had better. The fries were awesome.   Service: OK.  Price point: For two burgers, fries and a soda, the total was $23.   I'd go back but skip the bacon, and ask that my bun not be flattened."}
{"text":"It is one of my favourite places for a premium quality of shakes and burgers. How ever  Still questioning their way of cutting fries . Its like crumble fries ?!  And their floor is never cleaned !!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and it did not disappoint. I ordered \"The Priest,\" which is a cheeseburger with \"the option\" on top. You can see them making the burgers right in front of you - no frozen meat at this place. There are some comments about the burgers being small - true, they are smaller than a lot of places out there, but they're using fresh ingredients and cooking them perfectly so I still think it's a good value. I also like that they didn't overload it with toppings. The option was the total show stealer - I'd go back for that alone, but on top of a perfectly cooked cheeseburger? Money. Fries were great too.  Why 4 stars instead of 5? Like others, I found the place just too small which really took away from the experience. I was prepared for the lack of seating and didn't mind that, but there wasn't even anywhere to stand and wait for your food! No matter where I stood I felt like I was in the way. I'd still go back, though - the food was worth it!"}
{"text":"Burger Priest... great name!  Expecting something heavenly, but this isn't the Cardinal, and far from the Pope.  Ordering a hot dog was a mistake - overlooked and under dressed.  I don't mind paying $4.50 for a delicious shake, but this one falls short in size and taste.  Beverage choices are disappointing - Fairlee Juice, Cott Cola and Nestle Water?  There's choice of great brands as well, but only in cans.  I won't make this a regular stop with California Sandwiches sharing the lot."}
{"text":"Again, I had the Vatican City but only that.  I tried the chili cheese fries for the first time and they seemed really soggy.  The burger was good but for some reason the one I had in Vaughan seemed better... strange.  The fries I ordered that didn't have cheese on them were much better.  Crispy, hot, tasty and just the right amount of salt.  The chili cheese fries I wont' get again... wasn't really a fan of them.  The Vatican City was what it was but as I said the Vaughan one seemed better I don't know why.  The Riggs and Murtaugh shake was amazing.  I am going to try making it at home one day and see how it turns out.    The next trip to BP I'm going to have to try something different to get a better gauge of the burgers.  Still, a really good eat.  The place was packed... I was ready to take it to go but a table opened up so we ate in.  There was a posted sign upon entry that their liquor license has been submitted so it seems they are going to get booze in some shape or form soon.  Beer would essentially make this place complete."}
{"text":"We had the california burger and the high priest. The california burger had a different bun - really good and a lot of meat juice. The high priest is similar to a big mac but the quality is a loooot better lol each burger came with a lot of fries.   It's more expensive than McD's but you pay for the better quality. Great burger place!"}
{"text":"Huge line ups, small burgers compared to competitors, milkshakes too small, and bad fries compared to competitors.  For these reasons I consider holy chuck and five guys better.    These burgers for me fall into a category of artisan burgers.  Where there is a focus on buttery melt in your mouth patties, few toppings, super soft bread that nearly turns to mush from the oily patties. The whole burger is so oily and soft you almost don't have to chew.  It really does melt in your mouth.  It is not a traditional burger.  And not something you could eat everyday, without risking your cholesterol level.    In the same way we wouldn't eat foie gras or pork belly everyday, so is this burger.  It is a great burger surrounded by disaster ( line up, portions, fries).  It is something all burger enthusiasts should try at least once."}
{"text":"Lets take this opportunity to discuss the physics of the burger and in what ways burger priest is deficient in their burger technology.    The bacon spends it's whole life striving for crispy goodness. Yet why at the burger priest is the bacon not crispy? crispy bacon adds texture and that slightly burnt meat taste that is essential to a burger, especially one as soft and greasy as the burger priest. Check five guys burger for how to prepare bacon the proper way.   Burger toppings. There is a serious lack of them. Too much focus of the burger's design is placed on meat and bread. Again this comes back to texture. Veggies are not only good for you, but add essential texture to break up the stretches of greasy meat.    After ordering the combo and upgrading the double cheeseburger to a bacon double, how is it possible to not be full? considering that this combo is a few cents short of 20 dollars you'd expect to be full. Yet I can honestly say i could eat 2 combos to feel the fullness of one combo at some of their competitors(five guys).   Chili fries. I don't care for them. But the burgers are so small, every effort must be taken in order to approach some semblance of fullness. Thus I got the chilli fries combo. I find them boring. Even the regular fries are disappointing. Mcdonalds has more exciting fries.   The cookies are surprisingly awesome. Next time I might just go back for their ice cream sandwich.   Overall, I think there are better places and better value to be had. Yet I recognize the burger priest's place in the evolution of the burger. It is therefore essential study material for any burger enthusiast."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  This the third Burger's Priest location I've been and it does not do justice to the quality of the rest. The Queen East and Queen West locations are way better. I got a bacon cheeseburger with a gluten-free bun (this location had a gluten-free bun while the others have a low-gluten bun). Unlike the other two locations where my burger is moist, flavourful and dripping with delicious grease, this was dry, bland and just meh. I was thoroughly disappointed and will not return to this location. The fries, which are fully gluten-free as it's the only thing cooked in the fryer, were decent.   If you're in the area I recommend walking 5 minutes to the Queen and Spadina location instead. The burgers are made better there and the wait time isn't as long during lunchtime."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon double cheeseburger with stuffed jalapeno and a side of regular fries.  The burger tasted really good and the jalapeno added a nice spice to it.  It was really busy on a Saturday night but staff were ensuring the tables were wiped down quickly and service was fast given the number of people there.  I think for just a burger, it's expensive but still might visit again.  The tables are pretty spread out which is better than their Queen location."}
{"text":"Best burger ive ever had.  I travelled from Markham to this location  twice JUST for their burger.  1hr drive (back and forth) well worth it!"}
{"text":"This Burger's Priest is way smaller and because of the size it just seems more crowded although it can only accommodate the amount of customers of the size it can hold... basically your \"1 unit\" storefront on Queen West.    I didn't come to eat but rather just get a Riggs & Murtaugh shake.  I've been craving one for weeks and finally caved being so close to BP, I had to get one.  Like all the other Burger's Priests out there you pay at the cash and wait for your stuff to be made.  It's all made to order and the line for waiting at the right side of the pick up was pretty crowded.  I guess I'm just used to having more space in the burbs?  Smaller space makes for more noise and closeness.  Welcome to the city.  Maybe it was just me but the person helping me at the cash seemed jaded."}
{"text":"Had the Vatican City. Fan of the original grilled cheese and not the ones they had that consisted of bread ends?  The burger was great but the price is a little high in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went to California, ate some In & Out, made me miss Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Small but I don't care. It was worth the drive. The wait is very short, burger is FRESH AND JUICY! I inhaled the burger. I got it with the Keto Bun. It was moist not like cardboard. Usually those taste like . NOT THIS ONE! I loved every bite! I'm getting another one for later! love this place! The crew is nice and fast!"}
{"text":"You know what's good? A good burger and this place is good but I can't recommend it too highly because of the price. Make no mistake, this place is expensive for what you actually get. A standard cheeseburger, and we're talking a small cheeseburger here, is about $7.00. If you order a combo with fries and a drink it's about $13.00 with tax. It ain't cheap.  Yes it's juicy and made with fresh beef with a good sear and flavored with salt and pepper as it should. Yes the beef is tasty. But the size of the burger is small and every time I go there I feel ripped off.   The fries are plentiful and there's more than enough to share between you and another but they're average and nothing to write home about. Drinks are by the can.   I find this is a place to go once in a while, it's not a destination like other burger places might be. It's a, \"late night and let's get something\" kind of place. Not that that's a bad thing. I just hoped that it would be more."}
{"text":"My first review had to be about burgers! Only because my husband is obsessed and we frequent the Priest quite often.   I remember the day when only 1 burger's priest existed now there's 3-4..5... !  Either way it's still delicous! I prefer this location because it is true to its roots, small, in and out style (no pun intended), cash only, and you eat it in the car. What more do you need a summer day than good company, music blasting, burgers and a cold pop!  I think it's best to keep this one short and sweet because Burger's Priest speaks for itself.  Be sure to try to the vatican! It's my fave!"}
{"text":"Well worth the trip to the east side! Been going for over a year now.   Consistent, no frills, hands down one of the best burger place in Toronto. Hell, even compare to places like Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Always so good but so bad for you.   A good location in the west end, but a little in the middle of no where. A good place to stop and great a bite while running errands.   There is seating here, unlike the original location, which is nice. It was yummy, and up to Priest Standards."}
{"text":"It's just a burger...  I've heard so much about this place so I decided I must try it. I went to the Beach to see fireworks for Canada so this was the perfect excuse to get a burger (I rarely eat junk food). I've never considered burgers a \"cuisine\". It's just patties on buns with stuff. It's just a burger. I can make the same thing at home from either (fresh) ground beef or frozen patties.   I've had cheap burgers at McDonalds/Burger King. I've had \"moderate\" burgers at places like South Street and Hero burger. I've had fancy and expensive burgers at places like W Burger. Frankly after eating a High Priest burger, I felt the same way I felt each time I ate a burger. It's just a burger.  However, I am grateful for burger priest. If this is supposedly the best burger, then there's no need for me to keep trying new burger restaurants. I can save my money on \"real\" food that's much healthier and more delicately delicious.  Don't get me wrong, burgers are delicious. I just don't see the hype about it. It's like what I feel about poutine. You can put anything on fries and it'll taste good. You can put anything on a greasy salted beef patty and it'll taste good."}
{"text":"Easily one of the cleanest tasting burgers that I've ever had. I went with my regular lettuce, onions, tomatoes with a bit of ketchup and mayo default as toppings to a regular cheeseburger. Definitely stopping by again whenever I visit Toronto. On a side note: the fries were alright, the burger stole the show."}
{"text":"I live in the area, and have seen line ups outside the door.  Today I finally give it a shot.  A little line up, and a big disappointment.  Get there and there is one guy ahead of me at the cash, by the time she takes my order she takes 4 phone call orders.  WTF, who am I, I thought I was a customer too.  I think they are a little too cready taking orders.  Don't answer the phone when there are people waiting.  Bad start, get my cheese burger and fries home and find the burger to be tiny.  Bit over priced if you ask me.  It's taste is ok, a little let down for all the hype I hear about the place.  The fries were gross, tasted way too oily and threw half of them out.  I think I'll stick to Licks or Harveys for my burgers."}
{"text":"The burger's priest is awesome. Come here expecting it to be a \"treat\" and indulge... so don't even bother if you're not hungry! I usually get the priest since I love the option, but also want a beef patty. Vatican city is kind of wicked too.. if you can finish it.   Fries and chili are good, but not a huge fan.  There's a good amount of seating here.. other than that.. it's just like the other locations"}
{"text":"OK so burgers are entrenched in North American culture.  That said with so many burger choices out there today finding just any burger is as easy as finding a major intersection it seems.  From worldwide chains to national chains to local chains to mom and pops the choices are virtually endless...  ... and then comes along a place like the Burger's Priest.  With the quantity of burgers I have consumed in my life from all across the entire continent from coast to coast and everything in between I have to say that this local place is probably the best I've had to date bar none... AND I've only had one of their burgers (Vatican City).  At this point I am intrigued to try other combinations of what they serve just because what I had was so good the only way to tell you how good it actually is, is to have you try one yourself.  There are no out of this world toppings, nothing fancy or expensive or imported here, just plain, solid awesome technique and results.    Let's face it, the base ingredients for fast food burgers is really nothing that can be taken too far from the base that would transcend the fundamental ingredients.  You have beef cooked in a variety of ways, bread used to hold your meat and whatever else in between that makes it either standard or different depending on how far out you decide to go.   While I cannot comment on the rest of the menu, even the fries because I was so full that I didn't even try the fries or chili fries, I can only go on the one single burger I had yesterday, the \"Vatican City\".  This burger is pretty much your basic double burger with only one real exception.  The buns are made from grilled cheese sandwiches made from hamburger buns.  So both the top and bottom \"buns\" are essentially mini grilled cheese sandwiches.  I can tell you that this made all the difference in the world on how this burger tasted because while I know the familiar American cheese flavor that goes so sublimely with beef patties this brought the experience to an entirely different level.  These little cushion treats were like buffers of heaven holding the contents of deity class meat between the souls of the holiness that at a certain point in time may lead you to believe that any other burger is sheer blasphemy.  The burger patties were just melt in your mouth goodness.  Apparently they are cooked flat top style.  The toppings which I had (everything but pickles)  were complimentary and did not overpower or overshadow the meaty cheesy goodness of the rest of the sandwich that was the main attraction here.  The onions added flavor, the rest of the toppings wouldn't have been missed if they were in there or not.    The grilled cheese buns just hooked me, right then and there like a hungry newborn baby to a mother's teat I simply could not get enough of the burger while I was eating it.  It was an awesome experience that I wish to repeat... again and again.    The only downfall of this place is probably the fact that their food is so good and not good for you that it may kill some of the locals.  Thankfully we have universal health care in Ontario to perhaps mitigate that situation as much as possible.  By the way this place has a menu that is posted at the store and then there is a \"secret menu\".  The Vatican City falls under the normal menu.  The most expensive burger \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" is basically a Vatican City with 2 added \"Options\".    A single \"Option\" is cheese placed between 2 portabello mushroom caps, breaded and deep fried.  Ya and the Horseman has two of these added into a Vatican City.  The burger is over 20 dollars.  The Vatican City is about 12?  To get to the secret menu you have to answer a skill testing question and as of now the question is: \"How long was Noah on the ark?\"  and the answer is 370 days.    I went ahead and ordered a milkshake as well.  I had the Riggs and Murtaugh in reference to the characters in the movie series \"Lethal Weapon\" (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover).  I had to look it up, apparently it's a vanilla milkshake mixed with chocolate milk.  It was really very good and a very nice sweet compliment to a very savory burger.  Would I return to the Burger's Priest?  The answer is not yes, it's a Hell yes or Heaven's yes whatever you believe in.  I do believe I will return to pay tribute to the burger gods."}
{"text":"****1/2  There are just so many puns I could add into this rating about having the most heavenly or divine burger, but I'm sure many others have already glorified the hell out of the burgers at Burger's Priest, so I'll keep my review nice and simple.  This burger joint is located literally in the middle of nowhere and if I weren't on a pilgrimage to experience the immaculate and juicy patty wedged between the \"Option\" (cheese wedged in between 2 Portobello mushrooms which are then deep fried), there is probably not a cold chance in hell I'd ever frequent this area.  For that I'll say a thousand Hail Mary's.  My only \"beef\" is that the wait for a burger is like a slow road to redemption.  I waited a little shy of 10 minutes for my burger.  It should be noted that the burgers here are cooked over a flat top griddle as opposed to a charcoal broiler, which to a person who doesn't barbecue mean much. But if that translates into tasting one of the juiciest and yummy burgers in Toronto - I'm all for flat tops!  The worst part about it being in the middle of nowhere is that the teeny weeny eating area (3-4 maximum occupancy) leads most of us to devour our burgers on the street like we just redeemed our meal tickets and decided to convene outside.  I can't complain much as I chose a rather low-traffic time to go and it was relatively empty.Descriptions are non-existent. If you hadn't heard about the \"Option\" prior to, you wouldn't have a clue as to what it is.  They also have a \"secret menu\" which you can discover on their Facebook page if you're up for joining a burger cult/brotherhood of sorts.  Verdict:  The burger was worth the wait.  The hype is not just all talk.  The burger truly is spectacular.  I will never eat at McDonald's ever again!  The price of one will probably ensure that this is not a weekly indulgence, especially if you order fries on the side.  But it was so worth the $15 (about $10 for a Cheeseburger with the Option + Fries) I spent to have this divine experience.  I think I've been converted!"}
{"text":"Bless me father for I have sinned... I haven't had a Vatican style cheese burger in a little over 6 months but I want one right MEOW.    Place: The place is small and at time is standing room only.  It's cute and chic interior design.  Food:Their menu is simple they pretty much serve burgers and fries.  They have a veggie option and ice cream but that's about it.  I'm fine with that.    I ordered a cheese burger with grilled cheese buns.  It's a heart attack wrapped in paper but so worth it.  It's juicy and delicious.  The grilled cheese buns are perfectly melted/ toasted and just give the burger a little extra.    The fries were good but like some reviews say nothing special.  I love fries with my burger so it works for me.    They have a cookie ice cream sandwich.  Its huge and the ice cream is delicious.   Service:  You order, pay and wait for your food to be called.    Tip: Check online for their secret- not so secret menu."}
{"text":"For the price I paid, i was really disappointed. Can't go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger but for some reason I didn't really enjoy it.   But Especially the cheesy fries. What on earth.. They just shredded some cheddar cheese and placed it on the warm fries. Nothing melted! In my opinion the cheese should have been oozing hot otherwise forget it.   Nothing to do with this location specifically, I am a burger enthusiast but I'm done with Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"I have tried the original Burger Priest on Queen Street in the Beaches area and hoped that this location would serve up to the same expectations and it surely did. Despite the long lineups outside the restaurant, it was worth the wait as the lineup moved pretty quickly and after waiting 10-15 minutes for our burgers to be made, it was very fresh and melted in my mouth. Right now Burger Priest is my fave burger joint as you won't be disapppointed! If you are feeling super hungry and daring, try a burger on their Secret Menu."}
{"text":"Im probably one of the few that find burger preist just average. They are tasty but nothing to special. And not that filling for the price i usely get the Vatican which is double cheese between grill cheese bun. I do expect melted cheese but its half way yhere. I find myself finishjng the thing in a few minutes and still wanting more. For a 13 burger yeah should be more filling."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out, really was not impressed, the burger was average and far from amazing, the chilli fries were ok, I could make better on a camping trip, lastly the staff were very rude!"}
{"text":"I don't really understand why people rated it with four stars!  The meat is tasteless. I've been there twice, and it didn't fulfilled my expectations at all.  There are waaaayyyyyy better burgers in Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped in today.  First time trying them.  Very good, a little slow but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Heard numerous amounts of good reviews about them and of course I got to give them a try. I had their \"the priest\" burger, it was fantastic. The portebello mushroom was over an inch thick, it was literally half of the burger. The patty was very juice, and filled with meat flavour. Another burger that I have tried was the \"Magnum\". It was heavenly. The blue cheese was the highlight of the whole burger. At first, i thought the blue cheese would over power the flavour of the burger but instead It adds a little kick to the overall taste. The only disappointment with my experience at this restaurant was that they actually messed up my order and I wasn't given all the food that I have ordered. But since it was a take out, I didn't bother going back to then and complain."}
{"text":"On food quality alone, I'd give this place 4 stars.    However, I feel like Yelp is a place to look at the overall experience including the pricing although David Chang may disagree with me.  What makes this lose a star is the price.  I got the High Priest Burger for $9.79 + tax.    For that price, I would expect to be full.  Not even close.  Even though it came with two patties, I think they were only a 1/4 pound combined.  Speaking of 1/4 pound, the High Priest burger did seem like Burger's Priest take on the Big Mac.  While the quality of meat was amazing, i can't get over the value proposition here.  Paying over $11 with tax for a burger that is just a snack size doesn't sit well with me.  I was so hungry, I ate something 1 hour letter. So for the overall value, I have to dock it a star.  Verdict: Good, once a year experience.  Too pricey to be an every month option. Not as great as I thought it would be. :-("}
{"text":"So happy they have a location near financial core. Best burgers in Toronto, hands down. The Option is a MUST. So good!"}
{"text":"Small location with very limited seating so may be best for takeout but the burgers do not disappoint. Excellent selection on the menu and we can't wait to return and try more!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I really didn't have high hopes for their veggie burger, however this has to be there's veggie burger I've ever had! The patty is two portobello mushrooms smothered in cheese then deep fried, it is so delicious!  The service is quick and efficient as is the environment, for sitting down and eating here it is a bit difficult. However, totally worth it! Grab a burger and walking down queen west is perfect!"}
{"text":"I really don't get it. A small burger with no unique seasoning on a plain Dempster's bun? THIS is the best restaurant in Toronto? Maybe it was hyped up too much, maybe waiting there for 15 minutes to get a burger made me think it was going to explode in my mouth and food would never been the same again?   Either way, it wasn't worth the drive, the wait, paying for parking, eating in my car or dealing with hipsters. Honestly folks, you wouldn't believe some of the people in this place, it was hipster-ism to the next level. But I digress. The Chilli Cheese fries were better than the burger but, again, decidedly lacking in any discernible flavour.   I do like the fact it's legit beef and ground on-site, but like a bottle of wine that is bottled at the Chateau, that alone doesn't make it good, its just supposed to add to something already great, which, in the case of these burgers, I cannot concur with so many of my fellow Yelpers and professional food critics. Although, I do give credit to a small business that was able to make it despite the odds (and I'm sure it is making money hand over first based on the line-ups); I never want to see a small business fail so I'm glad a lot of folks are enjoying their food. It's just not for me."}
{"text":"The place: Apparently the original Burger's Priest location, this is a small restaurant with a couple of bar stools. The burger: Had the High Priest. Two patties, with a bun in between, special sauce and cheese. Pretty much a BigMac with higher quality ingredients. Overall it was a good burger but nothing to go out of the way for. Next time I would choose a different burger, something more original. The fries: crispy not to greasy. Bottom line: high quality burger, but very reminiscent of a elevated Big Mac. I would suggest trying a different burger at this joint than the High Priest. Also they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Small little place. There are a ton of costumers, and definitely not a lot of seats. My friend and I were lucky to have a couple leave right when we arrived. I had my friend save the seat while I ordered. The place only accepts cash (american and Canadian). The cashier was nice enough to put in my order as I went to get cash. After ordering, I had to stand in a long line waiting for my name and number to get called (probably around 20-25 minutes). I ordered two high priests. I enjoyed the burger. Was it the BEST burger I've had? maybe not, but it was definitely worth the try.  Their fries were pretty stellar though."}
{"text":"I was surprised with a trip here for my birthday because my friend had heard that it was a good burger place. We walked and were instantly greeted and asked if we had any questions. Feeling extremely hungry on the streetcar ride over, I asked for the double double and an order of fries.  The first bite of my burger literally made me think, \"OH MY WORD, I would sell my momma for this burger\". It was incredibly juicy and tender. It was a bit greasy and messy but I'm a firm believer that some of the best foods have to be messy. Only thing I didn't like were the fried onions I had added to my burger. They didn't taste too different from warm regular onions and weren't worth the $1. The fries weren't anything special but I was too in love with my burger to care. The bread was a bit soggy to from the grease but compared to the taste, it's something I can live with. My friend laughed that by the time he turned to ask how I liked it, I was done my burger and looking at my greasy hands like I was in awe of what I had witnessed. Maybe I was.  When we arrived the place was empty and we were able to sit at the tiny booth they had. I love the other recommendations of sitting outside and I definitely plan on going back to do just that."}
{"text":"This was my third time at a Burger's Priest, and my third location (first time I visited the original location, on Queen East, next was Queen West). Burger's Priest burgers are pretty reliable, so we knew what to expect. We both had the singe-patty Fiery one, which is a bacon cheese, with hot peppers. (I'm not sure if this is a new addition to the menu or not, but we were drawn to it because it resembles our go-to item on the Shake Shack menu.) We added all the toppings except ketchup. We shared an order of fries. The service was friendly and prompt. The place wasn't busy on a warm Sunday afternoon. The food was good. The patties here are tasty and the burger architecture and packaging are reasonable, so things stay together. The only drawback on the order today was that everything surrounding the patty was on the chilly side - the bun, the pickles, etc., as if they were just taken out of a super cold fridge. The tray was ice cold. If things were room temp, that would help keep the grub on the appetizing side a bit longer. Toasting up that bun would make things better, too."}
{"text":"Always fresh burgers, quick service considering the large numbers of people they serve.  The fries are fresh cut and tasty as well. He sure to check out the hidden menu that is available online for some twists on the original."}
{"text":"Best burgers.  Period.  Its the reason there's always a line around the block."}
{"text":"It's fine. Nice loose grind on the burgers, which were cooked perfectly. Thought the Vatican had a good ratio - wasn't too big or too cheesy.  The fries were a bit of a let-down, kind of starchy and undercooked."}
{"text":"i am not a big fan of burgers. I really like this one. The meat is very juicy."}
{"text":"Great food offset by a relatively shitty dining/customer experience. Basically, if they fix up the customer experience in all areas this place would be between a 4-5 star experience.   The food: -cheeseburger with smoke: 4/5 (fresh, delicious, not too big, and the smoke jalapeños are a must!) -peters denial chicken burger: 3/5 (tasty, but super messy and salty) -fries and gravy: 4.5/5 (excellent fries, delicious gravy that must be an in-house recipe)  The experience:  -we went at 630pm on a Friday night, so it's understandably busy!  -tiniest tables and stools to sit on, and everyone is crammed in here fighting for them  -the two girls at the cash register just do not give a shit...borderline rude, certainly not attentive or helpful, and just scraping by doing the bare minimum required to not get fired  -there's no cutlery anywhere? For a place that's crammed and serves messy food, it would make sense that customers can self serve napkins and cutlery of all kinds -washroom was fine but smelled like marijuana lol I guess that's just queen west though!"}
{"text":"I got \"The Option\" which is the veg burger. In terms of veggie burgers, pretty comparable to the one at Shake Shack. My friends say the Shake Shack meat burgers are better though.  Try Top Gun burgers in Kensington if you like it here!"}
{"text":"So. Gross. But So Good.   The KFC and Harveys in the area must be kicking themselves.   CC and I  got there just before the lunchtime rush. At 12:30 and being a noob I think I was holding up the line.   I got 'The Priest' with no cheese. It includes the Option (breaded deep fried mushroom stuffed with cheese), burger patty and cheese ($7.99). Way to gooey for me but so tasty.   I heard about a secret menu, and here is the NOW Magazine rundown  \" You'll see the High Priest, a Big Mac clone built on a Double Double with an additional bun spread with faux Mickey D secret sauce. The Option becomes a Religious Hypocrite when paired with bacon  A Noah's Ark when layered with campfire chili and cheese (all $8.99).   Replace the buns of a Double Double with grilled cheese sandwiches and get a Vatican City ($9.99). --this sounds so gross but probably tastes yummy  Squeeze the Option's deep-fried portobello into a Vatican and it becomes a Tower Of Babel ($14.99). Tell them you want your Double Double (with extra fried onions, $8.99) cooked Jarge-style (pronounced Jarz-sh) and they'll fry it in ballpark mustard.    Then be sure to go for a 6x6 - six beef patties and six slices of cheese on a bun ($14.35).  And don't forget to ask for \"smoke\" if you want a deep-fried jalapeño pepper added to anything. \"  I mean, for my first time, I had to try it. Next time I'll go Jarge style.   Cash only.   There's no seating. Pick a sunny day and take your meal to the park or like some others, plop yourself down on the side of the KFC parking lot."}
{"text":"Burger was pretty good.  First Time to the new Vaughan location.  Price was decent and decor was nice.  Pretty quick and staff were nice."}
{"text":"the burgers are okay, they're not great, they're okay, what sets them apart is they are flamboyant and greasier than anything you will ever eat, but they are strictly an expensive novelty, a novelty that i have ordered several times.  where the burger's priest fails, is it is a very long wait, you can't fault them for being busy, but there is something wrong when it takes 30 minutes to prepare a burger for take out when there are 6 people working the burger station of the kitchen, sorry, but as a former chef, this is a bit embarrassing, like i said though, i have gone back when i'm craving something disgustingly greasy.  the burgers here are a small step up from 5 guys burgers, but if a 5 guys burger was next door to this place, i would go there instead, its cheaper, faster and my god the french fries are miles beyond those of the burger's priest."}
{"text":"I've been to Burger's Priest couple of times now and I have to say the burger's are freaking delicious. But the sizes are relatively small. If the prices were balanced with the sizes, then it would get a five star from me. Me and my friends had to go to chipotle which was right across the street because we weren't full. My only wish is that the portions were bigger."}
{"text":"The location was clean, very loud and quite crowded. The service was friendly.  Between two people,  we ordered the cheeseburger, the vatican city, fries and a mint chocolate chip milkshake.  The burgers: Super greasy, kind of bland and the patty was nothing special.  The fries: Portion was good but the actual fries were too small - its like we got the small discarded bits. Once again, just frozen fries that were fried - nothing special.   The milkshake: I thought I ordered mint chocolate chip? I see a few specs of chocolate but overall, tasted like an average vanilla milkshake.  All in all, super hyped and definitely not worth the price. I've gotten a better burger at Big Smoke @ Yorkdale Mall."}
{"text":"Before ye read on, this review is packed full of meat is my religion-esque comments. You have been warned.    I should have worn my meat pants! (You know the pants you wear when you know you are going to be indulging in a significant amount of meat).  I had been desperate to make my way to BP...anywhere that has made a religion out of making good burgers is full of win, in my humble opinion. Meat is my religion and I have now found another place of worship.  After what was a rather epic journey there, oh TTC streetcar...you are such a loose canon, we arrived at my meat Mecca. Now, fore some reason I had got it in to my head that there was somewhere to sit, I do not know why, so praise be the weather was fine.   The shop was very busy and we waited about 10 minutes for our food. I was impressed with their selection and secret menu. I opted for a bacon cheeseburger on a GF bun...sad that I could not have the priest burger as the bread crumb coating is not GF, the priest burger looked amazing. However my burger was extremely tasty. The fries are so good, crispy and well seasoned. What I would like to see is a little homemade ketchup as I am not really a heinz fan...if I find out now that they do such a baby I am going to kick myself!  The toppings for the burger...I refer to the lettuce etc was fresh and crisp.   Service was friendly and efficient.   I think I need to try the Lawrence Ave location next."}
{"text":"Seriously good burgers! My favourite is The Priest which is a cheeseburger with a fried stuffed portobello mushroom on it. The Blue Steel is also good if you like blue cheese."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Toronto, I stop by the original Burger's Priest but this time around I didn't have time to backtrack towards east TO so on the way out, I decided to check out one of their several restaurants that had been more or less opened recently.  This location has plenty of parking so that's a big plus for me in comparison to the original spot and they have a restroom so no need to carry around a bag of disposal hand wipes because you can wash your hands after eating your juicy burger.  There's also tables and seating (though when I went there it filled up in a matter of minutes) which is nice since the original spot only has a bar with stools for 4 people.  Service is great and helpful.  I decided to change out my routine and get their California burger, which I'm betting is an In-N-Out wannabe, though they openly confess their love for In-N-Out (i.e. they have a framed photo of an In-N-Out restaurant in their original location). It's not quite like In-N-Out but nonetheless it was good. I'd probably go back to what I normally order next time though and leave the In-N-Out to whenever I go back to California.  I do wish Burger's Priest had a soda machine so that I don't have to keep paying for sodas since they sell them in the individual cans/bottles (including water).  I have a top ten burger spots I've been to and Burger's Priest definitely makes the cut (which it did with it's original location but this location makes the food just the same).  Here's how this place breaks down on my top ten burger list: 1. Burger Bar, Las Vegas (NV) 2. Healthy Junk, Anaheim (CA) 3. GBurger, La Habra (CA) 4. Left Coast Artisan Burgers, Seoul (KR) 5. Abbey's Burger Bistro, Baltimore (MD) 6. Shake Shack, NYC (NY) 7. Gourmet Burger Kitchen, London (UK) 8. Burger's Priest, Toronto (CANADA) 9. Root Down DIA, Denver (CO) 10. In-N-Out, California (CA)  Parking: Large shared lot Price: $10+ Wait: 15 mins after ordering"}
{"text":"Went July 1st@430pm best the dinner rush no lineup. Monday lunch out the door. Took it home even though there were seats a little warm in there. Double bacon cheeseburger with saute onions and the works and fries. I liked the burger, different loose pack but juicy. N I need to try the secret menu next time. I thought the fries were good despite other reviews at different locations. I know it's new but I wouldn't stand in a line out the door like Monday.  I'll definitely go back but not cheap $16 for what I ordered but Links is next door and it would be over $10.Ill pay for quality and fresh."}
{"text":"Believe the Hype. Best Burger in Toronto!  You won't believe the way they prepare their burgers. Incredibly juicy and melt in your mouth meat.  VERY RICH!  I might not be able to do this burger often, but it's a treat when I do!   I order simply the Double Cheeseburger, Fries and a soda.  It's expensive, but it's worth it.    Also, really amazing staff!  Seriously, I was expecting jackasses behind the grill, but everyone was wonderful to chat with and they made the experience terrific!   Enjoy the Priest - and they've found a fan in me!"}
{"text":"Forgive me father for I have sinned. Yes gluttony is a sin.  I finally gave in to the hype and decided to try the Burger's priest. I had to find out if it lives up to its hype. Cashier recommended the Vatican city burger. I suppose that's their most famous burger as most Yelpers seem to order it.  Burger was served in a doggy bag and was greasy everywhere. I loved it. Praise Jesus! Not sure if the burger was served on a fried bun or pancakes. There supposed to be veggies in there somewhere but I couldn't taste them over all that grease. I appreciate the extra napkins handed to us. Quick, friendly service.  Location is spotless clean. Catholic themed. I was a little intimidated to be honest. $15 Burger's priest hat, perfect for fanboys.  Ya I'm a fan. But to be fair I will eat anything covered in grease (Girls, don't get any ideas in your heads)"}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing!  Love the options and the meat quality.  The food alone is probably worth 4.5 stars, however there are a number of things that prevent that.    First, eat it hot and its amazing.  Wait, and your jarge style cheesy poof is gonna just be a mushy mess.  Even hot its nice and gooey, but melted cheese just tastes better hot.   In order to eat it hot, you need to find a table.  Good luck with that.  Seating here is limited.  There are also huge steps to trip over just getting to the counter.  NOT FOR KIDS or large parties.  Most people seem to get it to go, however that prevents you from enjoying it HOT.    Prices are high.  It's a good burger, but this is priced in the $$ range which demands high expectations.  I've burgers just as good or better for smaller prices.    When it comes down to just the burger though, my Pope Jarge Style (5) didn't disappoint.  Amazing flavor and quality!  Love the Jarge style fried cheese thingy you can add to any burger.  But you gotta eat it hot.  That Vatican dog is a joke. Too small. Don't get it unless you're really craving a nicely grilled regular hot dog and love overpaying."}
{"text":"I went to The Burger's Priest for the first time last weekend and was absolutely blown away by how good my burger was.  I had the Vatican City, which is essentially a burger but with the bread replaced with a grilled cheese.  I couldn't believe how tasty EVERY SINGLE BITE was.  The fries were pretty tasty as well, but it's the burger that had most of my attention.  It took maybe 7 minutes for my order to be ready...but well worth it for a quality meal.    Looking forward to tasting their other menu options...but I'll definitely go back for the Vatican City again."}
{"text":"So I finally decided to give The Burger's Priest a try. We had just finished 120K bike ride and always enjoy eating burger and fries afterwards. We used Foodora to place our order and everything arrived in the time we were promised so that part was good.   What I liked: The burgers were well cooked and flavourful, there was a good burger patty to bun ratio and the buns themselves were fresh and soft. The fries were crispy without being overly salty and there was a good amount included with the combo.   What I didn't like: the burgers are TINY - we went by the Foodora picture which looked like the patties are a decent size but I doubt they were any bigger than 4oz. We ended up heading out to find something else to eat afterwards. If you're hungry - keep that in mind. Order a extra burger or a double patty. We also asked for extra pickles on the side and ketchup for the fries and those were no where to be found. Not sure what was up with that.   Overall, it was a so-so first experience. We might be back to give them another try - but there are other options in the area so probably not any time soon."}
{"text":"If you want amazing burger and would like to get it blessed too, come down to Burger's Priest where every burger is named after some biblical person/place or event. I wonder if they'll ever come up with an Apocalypse Burger that will just absolutely be delicious and at the same time destroy your insides.  Anyhow, the patties are juicy and infused with cheese that's just gooey that just clings to the meat with eat bite. The toppings are fresh and clean and overall, the burger was not greasy or heavy at all. It was just really good.  Honestly, the fries weren't all that great in comparison to the burger so I didn't really spend too much time eating it. I would say it was on par with the fries at GBurger and definitely notches lower than the fries at In & Out. Speaking of In & Out, they have photos of famous burger joints from around North America with saintly names and there was a photo of an In & Out sign with the caption reading \"Saint In & Out\". I was proud of that.  Well the first burger was so good I ordered another burger immediately after eating my Priest Burger.  There's no on-site restroom and they don't have free tap water. From my understanding, the wait can be very long as in up to 45 mins just to order according to my cousins who live down the street and have been here multiple times so I went 30 mins after they opened on a Tuesday and I was able to order in about 10 mins (excluding wait time for the food to be made).  There's very limited bar seating. I believe there were only 6 barstools and a narrow bar table but honestly, this spot is right across from the beach so get your burger and drink, head down to the beach, plop yourself down in the sand or on the park bench and enjoy your burger and view. (Lots of attractive women playing volleyball. Wink, wink)  I'll definitely want to return here next time I visit Toronto and this place is definitely going on my burger list.  Here's how this place breaks down on my top ten burger list: 1. Burger Bar, Las Vegas (NV) 2. Healthy Junk, Anaheim (CA) 3. GBurger, La Habra (CA) 4. Left Coast Artisan Burgers, Seoul (KR) 5. Abbey's Burger Bistro, Baltimore (MD) 6. Shake Shack, NYC (NY) 7. Gourmet Burger Kitchen, London (UK) 8. Burger's Priest, Toronto (CANADA) 9. Root Down DIA, Denver (CO) 10. In-N-Out, California (CA)  Parking: Very limited street (not worth driving here, better find parking elsewhere and walk) Price: $6-$14 per burger plus drinks (water must be bought as well) Wait: Can get very long as in 30 mins just to order"}
{"text":"I have been to this location too many times to share publicly (i am not proud of my behaviour) but good burgers call out to me.  The first time I came to eat here I ordered a cheeseburger off the menu...(it was good) the second time I came I ordered off the secret menu.  Now two things that you should know: Most women eat like a baby bird, i eat like a horse. When a restaurant has a secret menu- you order from said menu!   It's like you've been admitted into a secret society, you don't go back to normal burgers, you venture off into unchartered territory. (And thats what I did) I ordered the vatican city: and it was glorious!    But that wasn't enough! I had to keep coming back until I finally decided to try something I've never done before. I'm a big fan of food shows like \"man vs. food\"  and \"diners, drive-ins and dives\" and I would be lying if I didn't admit that a part of me wanted to eat a gigantic burger at least once in my life to say i've done it. So i crossed it off my bucket list the day I ate nothing all day and ordered the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It was huge: i fell in love with the Option but after being more than halfway through the burger I got tired of it's mushroom taste (but thats just me- mushrooms aren't my thing)  Otherwise, the burger was epic and I still can't believe I ate it. Not bad for 5\"2 and change....lol"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance/reason/opportunity to try this place out.  Must agree with most of the other opinions, the burgers here rock, even if I chickened out and didn't go for \"The Priest\", settled for a double-double with bacon and fried onions...  One word:  Food-coma  If you're planning on operating heavy machinery, or headed out to perform surgery you might something a little lighter....maybe the option  But that was exactly what I was looking for and they more then lived up to their online rep...  Staff was friendly and food was ready quickly, now that summer is on it's way the small amount of space should hopefully be less of an issue, after shouldn't burgers be eaten outdoors, think Bar-B-Q....."}
{"text":"You know there are great burger places that you hear about but never seem to find one when you crave a good burger.   Well on my way home I stumbled upon Burger Priest and I had to try one.  The menu is minimalist as are the toppings.  Which was fine by me.  I did note the guy ahead of me had just ordered 10 different burgers.  So I figured I might be in for a wait. Nope, 7 mins later I was eating a well cooked party with the toppings as ordered.  Since I was throwing caution to the wind I added a chocolate milkshake. The shake was fine but nothing to make me say wow but then again the burger was the star.  And this thing lived up to its billing.    You could taste this was a beef patty and then it wasn't frozen or with other added stuff. The bun was ok and I wondered if it could hold together a double patty with bacon and cheese.    Needless to say I will be back to try a double cheese burger.  To be continued."}
{"text":"I took my team here as a treat.  It was Wednesday and Payday to boot.  We arrived just after 1:30 pm.  Each employee made a separate order for a total of ten burgers.   Personally I had the High Priest ( double cheese burger) with fries and a chocolate milkshake. All 10 orders were made quickly and exactly as ordered.  To a person, they said their burger was well made, hot with a fresh tasting patty. Given the generous portions we could have easily split the order of hand cut fries.  And whether you like them plain or with ketchup or with malt vinegar they were great.  I didn't get chilli fries only because I ordered a very delicious milkshake.   The team all said the Priest was worth the walk and the price to have one of the best burgers in Toronto."}
{"text":"This BP is like any other BP. But it deserves to be mentioned as it is open till 4AM on the weekends whereas their other locations close around 10-11PM. Late night secret menu burgers and fries, yeah!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the city, I posted 2 things that really bothered me about this place and they fixed it. Theres no doubt that this place makes the best burgers in Toronto and area. This location especially, I went again twice and both times the burger meat was amazing. Hope they never change, worth the money. The fries are even good!"}
{"text":"I love a well made burger and this place has great burgers!  Dropped by just before noon and it was already busy and just got busier and louder as we got closer to lunchtime. I went with the straightforward cheeseburger because I wanted to taste the burger without all the extras. It was delish. The fries were ok-ish. But the gravy was a big let down. Watery - bleh!"}
{"text":"Our new go-to place for a really good burger. Their menu is fairly diverse. Chili fries are too dry for my taste, but the milkshake a must and the regular fries are enjoyable. It is generally fast and always a treat. Try their signature High Priest first. You'll be converted."}
{"text":"Ordered the Vatican City.  I was afraid it would be too rich, but it was surprisingly delicious.  The presentation didn't come out as aesthetically pleasing as the pictures but tasted better than I expected.  Meat was very flavorful and the grilled cheese was perfect."}
{"text":"These guys are taking over and I love it. Consistency is the key to having a successful chain and this doesn't seem to be an issue because whether downtown, uptown or in Woodbridge the burgers are identical and outstanding.."}
{"text":"Burgers are all about preference so this place is just not mine- super thin burgers like McDonalds are what you get here and all on the overcooked and dry side. The fries are tasty. I like a thick and juicy burger to be the showcase, not relying on condiments for interest. The lettuce wrap is shredded lettuce- pretty lame! There are much better options in the city for a yummy and juicy burger!"}
{"text":"Big tasty burger, didn't get to finished it. Very busy and loud atmosphere. Its a fast food style restaurant. Order at cashier and wait for your name to be called to pick up your order."}
{"text":"Burger's Priest is just behind Holy Chucks and Five Guys for me, and it is #1 in my bfs opinion. Their meat is good but I am a fries person and they need to get better fries! Adding chili and cheese on it didnt improve it much. Anyways, best burger choices here are any on the secret menu where there is at least 1 beef patty and 1 option patty. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about Burger Priest from friends and was excited to see this location opening on the west end. Took my family for a Saturday lunch; burgers were average at best (mine was way over cooked).   Overall too much hype and not enough substance. For a great burger head to Apache Burger or C and Dubbs and save some $$$."}
{"text":"This place is ok- I hate that there's nowhere to sit down and it doesn't strike me as especially special- the meat is really delicious however. Solid option."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. Tasted fresh. Portion size was good. Their chili cheese fries were also amazing. Will definite come back when I come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Buttered bun and the deep fried panko jalapeños are a must!   Definitely not healthy for you, but it doesn't make you feel like trash. If you're looking for a treat, this is the place to be.   I ordered through the Ritual app and that was very reliable and quick - no mistakes and they were friendly with giving me my takeout.   However, I do wish they had a hot sauce option. They might have named it differently, but it was definitely not free. Lots of add ons adds up the price. Free add ons are pretty basic, nothing exciting: tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, onions, mayo and mustard."}
{"text":"I finally had my first experience with Burger Priest and I hate to say it but it might be my last.  Lets start off with the ordering.  We ordered 2-Bacon Double Cheese Burgers 1 order of fries and 1 can of pop.  I was totally WOWED by the $27.00 bill.  I didn't say much because I was excited to have the BDCB.   I finally received my order after a short 20 minute wait **cough cough**  I sat down super excited to eat my burger but when I opened it I thought there had to be a mistake and that I received the burger off a children's menu.  After a few minutes I realized that this was the size it was supposed to be.  The burger was the size of my palm.  It was extremely small.  The burger was a little on the salty side but yet tasty which is the only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars.  When going for a burger and paying $27.00 you would expect this burger to be super huge and super filling.  The portion of fries was very generous if you are into paying that much to be filled up by saugy fries.  Probably will not be going back I had such high hopes"}
{"text":"I ate their rendition of a double cheese burger with signature toppings.  Just writing to attest to the other reviewers noting the burgers being easy to devour, having freshly delicious patties, and balanced with a noticeable amount of bread. All these points work their magic making a memorable indistinguishable burger.  Not sure why people base the ratings on not being a healthy choice, I mean I know of no delicious burger place that will save your heart.   I will go back to try more items, on occasions for treating myself."}
{"text":"So completely underwhelmed. Sometimes these super-hyped places end up living up to the hype, and sometimes they're a big disappointment but hipsters love to perpetuate the hype because it's cool. The burger was fine--but it was just fine. And way more money than I need to pay for an average burger. Fries were also....fine.   Honestly, I'm way happier with Five Guys or, ideally, Shake Shack.   There are five stools for seating here, so don't expect to get a seat.   We waited about 20 minutes for our two burgers and one fry, then had to do battle for two seats while the entire restaurant filled with people so we could barely get out.   Hell to the no will I be going back."}
{"text":"I love these burgers, and I'm not even a burger fan.  Seriously, I'd rather eat a chicken burger or a hot dog or a smoked meat sandwich than a burger.  I don't know what it is about these burgers, but I crave them unlike I've ever craved a burger in my life.  I know they've got some crazy concoctions, but I like to keep it simple and limit myself to an uncomplicated cheeseburger.  Everything about this burger is perfect - the bun is soft, the cheese is great, and the meat is so tender and flavourful; it practically melts in your mouth.  The fries are also perfect.  I love my fries on the crispy side, and the whole order is deliciously crunchy (without being burnt or overdone).  This particular location has a handful of (awkward) seats, but it's honestly easier to take your order to go.  If you do want to sit, just be prepared to wait a minute or two - people move in and out pretty fast.  The service isn't the speediest, but the food is always fresh fresh fresh.  Also, they take credit cards at this location as of recently.  Hallelujah, Burger's Priest!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good no matter what time of day. I came here on a late Saturday evening. This was my first time visiting the Adelaide location and the quality of the burger was just as good as the ones that I got at their queen street location. It was quite busy the night I came with the line going almost all the way to the stairs by the entryway, but they were still able to prepare my order relatively quickly. The best part about this location compared to the Queen street one is the greater amount of seating available, so you don't have to take your burger to go."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try the vegetarian burger which was the portobello mushroom and I was absolutely blown away. By far the best vegetarian burger I have ever had and it was made very quickly. I love the ambience of the restaurant itself as well. I will definitely be making another trip there soon."}
{"text":"YUM. I had The priest--\"the option\" + beef patty--omg! the deep fried portabello mushrooms and cheese just made the burger one of the best burgers i've had in Toronto!  the menu on hanging from the ceiling had NO descriptions of the burgers at all so we had to quickly get the menu on the website on our phone to see what each burger was.  definitely had no room to sit, and it was cramped in that little space, so had to take it to go. i was salivating in my car trying to rush home ASAP to eat this thing. the fries weren't so much of a hit for me. a little soggy. the closest i could compare it to is swiss chalet fries."}
{"text":"Cames here the other night for some dinner after class. 2nd time visiting the Burger's Priest,  1st time at this location.    Love how spacious this location is, compared to the one at spadina and Queen, it's gotta be at least 2 times bigger! It has a variety of seating styles to suit anyones preference.  I ordered the option,  imo, noootthinng sounds better than a panko battered portobello mishroom stuffed with cheese :D Also added a side of their regular fries.   Service at the cashierwas nice, no problems or rudeness there. Waited a reasonable amount of time to get my order too. Although there was technically nothing wrong with my order; Option and fries were hot, The correct toppings were on it, etc. For whatever reason, I wasn't as amazed or Impressed as I was during my furat Burger's Priest experience. But speaking I amanner not comparingto my 1st time here, it was an awesome dinner.   Little on the pricey side for a burger and fries, but with the quality and care they putinto their food, they're prices you'd have to expect to pay. I will most definitely come back to this location :)"}
{"text":"Tried the Cali burger yesterday.  Staff were nice and professional, venue was clean, burger was good but not as amazing as the hype, fries were delicious.  Solid burger spot."}
{"text":"Still the king of burgers in my opinion. Service always consistent, never any issue with order mix up or anything like that. This locations relatively bigger seating area is great. The bathroom is also always been clean and stocked.   Look forward to going back to this location on a monthly basis."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is more of a 3.5 than a 3. The burgers were okay. A little greasy but had a nice beefy flavor. But she thought the fries had a weird taste?  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers to go please! We were checking out Graffiti Alley nearby and got hungry so we stopped by Burger Priest. So glad we beat the lunch rush because it took less than 10 minutes for us to get our order. You gotta listen carefully for your number to pick up your order because the noise of the searing burgers, staff taking orders and people talking is pretty loud.   Since we were planning to continue our Graffiti Alley tour after lunch we decided to dine in. We sat at one of their teeny tiny tables. Have you ever sat in a kindergartener's chair in school? They had 8 tables with 2 chairs each, 1 table where you can stand and eat and a bay window that has a table that can comfortably seat 3 people. Most people order to go.  I had the Burger Priest with \"The Option\"  (Cheeseburger with two roasted portobello mushroom caps breaded with panko stuffed with cheese and fried) with mayo, tomatoes, onions and lettuce. I added the deep fried sliced jalapenos to spice things up a bit. The burger was small but really thick, I couldn't fit it in my mouth. The patty was flavorful and juicy and the veggies fresh. I loved the portobello mushrooms. It had a nice contrast of textures between the spongy mushroom, crunchy breading and melted cheese. I'm glad I added the jalapenos but I could only handle eating two since they left all the seeds in them. I handed the other two to my hubby for his burger.  Hubby had the Fiery Furnace burger (Bacon Cheeseburger with crushed hot peppers). It was a tasty burger but very mild in spice. Was much better after adding the deep fried jalapenos which kicked up the spice level considerably. Loved the bacon, it was thick and smoky. We shared his fries which reminded me of the bags of fries from the neighborhood fast food joint. These fries were thick, greasy and salty with little bits of crunchy fry ends scattered throughout, food coma inducing indeed!  At $30 for two people it is pricey but a good treat once in a while if you're in the neighborhood. Don't go during rush hours unless you like waiting. They have an ATM. Bathrooms very clean.  Pssst...make sure to check out their online secret menu."}
{"text":"The burgers here are delicious and they have come up with many delicious combination. I thought that the prices were a bit steep and for two of us eating burgers and only ordering one order of fries and one drink we should not have to pay $40. The food again was delicious and I would come back here in a heartbeat but they need a little bit more creativity on the menu maybe mixing beef and chicken items they should take some pointers from the burgenator."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great burger, look no further!  This place is hands down the best burger you will ever have.  There are several locations across the city, each with equal quality.  The food is FRESH and made-to-order. I highly recommend the Vatican - which is a burger in between two grilled cheese sandwiches, but their regular cheeseburger is pretty great too.  They have combos that aren't advertised but you can get a burger, fries, and a drink.  You can order ahead so you don't have to wait in line.  If you walk in, prepare to wait, but it is well worth it.  I can't wait to have my next burger from this place!"}
{"text":"I really would like to give this place a 5 star rating but they are a bit  OVER PRICED. This whole secret menu thing is confusing because A. you really need to research online to find out what it is and then B. When you actually order from it, you have to know what you want as it is NOT posted anywhere because it's a secret you are shocked at the price! But it is the secret burgers on that menu that make this place worth trying. But it is so small inside and crowded with the order area and then waiting area and it is totally take out as there is no place to relax and eat unless your lucky to get a stool by the doorway with people bumping into you while you try to eat in the dirty counter/stool area. The burgers are impressive, the fries and shakes are NOT. But if your willing to pay for 2 people close to 50.00 for 2 burgers, one fry and one shake and stand in the lineups..then this is your place."}
{"text":"Not worth the 23 bucks for 2 burgers (small and greasy) a fries and a can of pop. Harvey's across the street would have been better value for money. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but rave reviews from friends and colleagues alike for Burger's Priest. I wanted to see what the hype was all about. I went just after 1pm and the line up wasn't too bad. I was even able to snatch a seat! For my first burger here, I went for the basic and got the Cheeseburger. My thinking is to test how a burger joint does their classic burger. I don't want any fancy frills to disguise the taste of what's the most important thing in a burger, the beef patty. This is how I test every burger joint I try.  The burger was good but there was no mind blowing or orgasmic reaction after the first bite. The beef patty was moist and delicious and pretty much what my family makes on the BBQ grill. That might be why I wasn't too impressed. I'll try one of their special burgers next time and see if all of the fancy frills is what make the burger really taste good."}
{"text":"Both burger on low gluten bun and fries were phenomenal. The staff are sweethearts too."}
{"text":"Overpriced small burgers that taste really good. These things are basically the size of something you would find on a kids menu.  The burger was really good.I got a single patty cheese burger,but I would need about 2-3 to actually get full. They have good fries here! Actually crispy, not soggy like 5 guys burgers. Over all was good, just overpriced for what you get. Basically paid $14 for a snack"}
{"text":"REALLY REALLY GOOD~!~ THE option (fried portebello mushroom stuffed with cheese) --- just exploded with cheese greatness. I am a not fan of cheese, but even I quite enjoyed the stuffed goodness. The meat patty was awesome.   I will go for sure when the craving for a deluxe burger starts to linger!!~"}
{"text":"2.5 *Stars* for what The Burger's Priest offered me as a seldom Burger Muncher.  Small Shop walking inside I waited in line until a lady told me to go up FRONT.  Apparently it's not the line, it's just a decoy.  Those people already ordered and awaiting their meal.  A somewhat stylish setting mixed with a diner feel when it gets busy and when they decide to turn up the music to drown out the chatter.  Stylish because of those LIGHT selection and Photo Frames along with the 6 seater bar counter while everyone eats or waits outside the door.  Simple options but still needs explanation to newcomers because of the names they chose to give to the menu.  The Priest Combo($14.99) was what I got and it does look steep in pricing so it cost them half a *Star* for what I determine to be my value set as a real person doing real reviews.  It was a Cheese Burger with a Panko Breaded Mushroom Stuffed with Cheese then Fried.  Whatever I did in the morning exercise, I gave back to The Burger's Priest.  It came with re-fried Fries which is standard fare but I can skip that next time.  I overheard a cook showing a Rough Grind Ground Beef Ball to some customers to explain its FRESHNESS and when I tasted it, it was exactly that and to some would say it is unpretentious for sure however this Flat-Top cooked Burger Patty isn't as juicy as lets say Harvey's which there was one right across.  I do LIKE the \"Option\" which was crispy tasty Panko Crusted Portobello Mushroom with Cheese Stuffing.  The Bun itself seems to be simply used as the holder of the material inside as it doesn't have character on its own.  Maybe a Burger person would like this more but for me, it's not quite the Burger of choice."}
{"text":"The first time I went to The Burger's Priest, it sucked. The burger was dry; it tasted like there weren't any condiments on the burger and I had a hard time choking it down. However - I decided to give it another chance a couple of years later, and I'm glad I did! I had The Priest - which is a cheeseburger with \"The Option\" (fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese) on top. It was so good!!! The fries were also yummy. I don't know why people complain that the burger is small - how much food do you possibly need? Mine was enough food for dinner and lunch the next day. It is a bit pricey, but unless you plan on eating here every day, I think it's well worth it (assuming the food remains as good as it was on this particular visit)."}
{"text":"Serious quality control issues as this location. Check out the pic. Queen Street location is pictured on top."}
{"text":"This location is super tiny and always busy so it does get quite crowded... It gets a little confusing to figure out where the line begins for your order as everyone is standing around chaotically. But it's worth it for the burgers.   Every burger is made to order and fresh off the grill. I watched them put the ground beef on the grill and flatten it which makes me happy to know that they're fresh! Because of this, it does take a little longer for your burger! I believe Burger Priest is one of the best burger places in Toronto. I got a cheeseburger with a few toppings and the taste of the meat is fantastic :)"}
{"text":"The double cheeseburger I had at this location was nothing special. I wanted to try something normal after going big with the pope my first couple of visits and I actually prefer the local Five Guys for a cheesburger. I like the concept maybe mine was just a little too greasy.  The Pope is too big to eat but is an experience and I try to get whoever I bring to try it as well.  Either way I love this place and will be at the opening of the Woodbridge location in May"}
{"text":"Burger Priest finally opened in Woodbridge!  Went on opening day but line was huge and was barely moving so returned during the week.   Tried the Holy Smokes my first time and much like my regular double cheeseburger experience at the downtown location I was disappointed. The patties taste like they have little to no seasoning and it appears that condiments are supposed to double as 'seasoning' or something.   Second time I got the Pope (again from the not so secret menu) and it was good. I've had the Pope at this location and the Yonge/Sheppard location twice and it is my favourite burger at this place. Still not very well seasoned but much better than a regular cheeseburger or the Holy Smokes.   Had to argue with my cousin so he wouldnt get a regular cheeseburger for himself and my Uncle, I told them it sucked and that trying the Pope would increase the chances he liked the Priest and would ever came back. They both liked it.   I will come back to try some more of the secret menu but advise anyone against getting a plain non secret menu burger as there are better ones just a two minute drive away. Some of the secret menu items represent a burger experience.    The Pope is a four star and the cheeseburger and holy smokes just a three.   The staff here is very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"When it came time to figure out where I'd be eating while in Toronto for the World Fantasy Convention, I knew that in the midst of all the fine dining I had planned, one stop was going to have to be at the city's best burger joint. (Finding a great burger has always been high on my list when traveling.) But which restaurant would that be? I tossed the question out on social media, and though there was intense disagreement--you'd have thought that I'd started a discussion on the presidential election--the consensus settled around The Burger's Priest.  So last Thursday morning, for my first meal in Toronto, I bombed into town from Richmond Hill with so many co-conspirators we needed two cars. When we reached Burger's Priest, I was surprised to find it was take-out only, with nowhere to sit, and soon realized that there were two locations--one which apparently seats around 20 over on Yonge Street, and the one we ended up at on Queen Street East. But as that wasn't going to affect the taste of the burgers, I didn't really care. Besides, all those parked cars filled with people chowing down on their burgers told me this was food worth eating whether it had to be done sitting, standing, or running in place.  Our group squeezed into the small and already-crowded storefront, and while some of my friends studied the menu, I had no need to. I'd already taken a look at the so-called secret menu, the one that only appears online, and had decided on a Vatican City burger, which is \"a double cheeseburger squeezed between two grilled cheese buns.\" And as we'd made our way to Burger's Priest, one of my friends read aloud from that menu on her phone, and so planned to order a Magnum, which is \"a regular hamburger plus blue cheese and bacon.\"  When I placed my order, it got a reaction from the servers. I don't mean they acted impressed or anything like that, but it was an indication that they realized I wasn't just an American who'd wandered in randomly, but was someone eating there because I wanted to eat THERE. As for the toppings, I got it with the works. Why not? After all, this was a burger I'd crossed international borders for.  We returned to my car, where I unwrapped my prize on the hood, while some of my friends huddled in the car against the wind. I didn't join them, because I knew that with a burger like this, the juices and toppings would have ended up in my lap.  And--my Vatican City Burger was glorious! Those grilled cheese buns were not, as some of you might think, too much, but rather added just the right amount of gooeyness to two perfect patties. It might--and I say might--have been the best burger I've ever had. It was so good that it made me think a trip to Columbus, Ohio was needed so I could try another Thurman Burger at the Thurman Cafe and see if the memory of it as the ultimate burger stood up.  Now as for the accompanying fries, I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. Not that they weren't GOOD fries, and at any other restaurant I'd have found them acceptable, but a burger that good deserved GREAT fries, and so paled by comparison. What might be the best burger I've ever had should have been accompanied by the best fries I've ever had, and these weren't those. But I'll take responsibility for that--none of my friends expressed any disappointment, probably because their expectations weren't as high. (It's the fries that lower my total rating to 4 stars rather than 5, because the burger itself was a definite 5-plus.)  If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'll definitely return. Only this time, I'll head over to the Yonge Street location. Because while a Burger's Priest burger is definitely worth eating off the hood of your car, I don't think it's mandatory!"}
{"text":"Average at best.  Unseasoned burger Dry Overpriced Overrated Shulda went to McDonalds...  Honestly the amount of people who love this place makes me emotionally disturbed. If you have ever had a sirloin burger you would know what 4-5 stars tastes like. 16$ for an average burger, fries that seem like someone barfed chilli on it and a canned drink? Thank you for wasting my time.  Edited to 2 stars: they forgot to give me my cookies."}
{"text":"Best burgher in Toronto. If you are hungry i suggest \"the pope\". Amazing"}
{"text":"Our burger father who are in heaven (or Etobicoke?) Shallow fry our onion rings Thy fries will be well done Our burgers on a bun Thy number will be rung (when your order's ready)  ****  It seems the burger priest is as divisive as any real religion. Believers are fundamentalists and disciples  from the church of Licks that was located next door seek redemption from what they are hoping to be a religious burger experience.   Firstly, I love a 'new thing' as much as the next overweight, food obsessed citizen of Toronto but I have to say after coming to this burger church 3 times and consuming most of their menu I simply don't get the hype. The burgers are so greasy I can actually feel my heart gasp as every clump of beef slides down my gullet. I can see how some could mistake grease for juice - but boys and girls - this is grease. We know this due to the film that covers your hands as you pick up the burger. Additionally, the burger itself has no seasoning or any ostensible flavor other than beef which I get some would like but their sauces do not add enough flavor to compensate. It just is kinda bland (and greasy, (just in case you missed that))  I think the meatiness flavour sans salt/seasoning could work if there was some golden searing of the meat to develop flavour. The meat is grey and that is exactly how it tastes. The greasiness and the blandness are connected, the meat doesn't get seared (i.e. not cooked at a high enough tempreture) and so the fat oozes from the burger before it should.   The bread doesn't hold this level of grease well and gets soggy very quickly so don't even think about takeout be user by the time this baby gets past 2 minutes you have a soggy mush. I feel they would be better off putting this cholesterol heart attack inducing patty on a baguette as at least it would soak up the excess fat   I've eaten a 'high priest' which is their version of a Big Mac (way too much bread) and had a side of chile cheese fries (just average). There regular burger is fine but has all the same issues highlighted above.   The place is clean, ingredients seem super fresh and it feels hip and happening over lunch so like many religions there is a lot of glitz but perhaps not that much substance.   Sure it's better than McDonalds but is it the second coming of the hamburger or the resurrection of French fries? The answer, I'm sorry to say is 'no'. I will have to seek burger redemption elsewhere :(  Amen."}
{"text":"Burger's Priest does the standard hamburger a good service. You can see the ground beef behind the counter waiting to be formed into patties, which is a sharp change from almost any other burger joint you'll come across. I don't eat red meat, but my wife sampled the cheeseburger. She was impressed. \"The Basic Burger done right.\"  I had the confusingly named veggie burger called \"The Option\". It's basically a battered mushroom slice and cheese patty that is deep fried and served like a burger. Definitely not like any other veggie burger I've had, but it was good. I'd say more crispy on the outside like a falafel.   FYI, this place is super small. There are a few seats inside, but expect to take your meal to go if you want a place to sit comfortably. In behind the building across the street (on the south side) there are some fresh picnic tables. Looks like they were put out for the office workers of that building. If you want a place to sit, thats a good option."}
{"text":"Got the California burger + fries and shake. Seriously the BEST burger I have ever had. Meat was fresh and cooked exactly to my liking. Shake was wonderful consistency; great flavor. Fries, you could definitely tell they were fresh. All around 5 stars"}
{"text":"Always excellent quality food. I drive for miles from different cities just to eat here. Burgers are awesome, fries good service great."}
{"text":"I suspect that I can't really chime in with anything new here.  Indeed, they do make one tasty burger, perhaps the best I've ever had in Toronto.  The fries are top notch too.  I kept things basic--I know there are all kinds of \"secret\" and fancy cat burgers you can order but for a first go I wanted to judge on a basic cheeseburger.  Sure enough, it really was everything people say it is.    (But, at the end of the day, it is still just a hamburger.)  I'm a short bus ride away from going here more often but never do.  It is primarily a take away joint and until the summer, taking your burger over to the park or beach for a picnic isn't really an option.  (It is a really small shop--hardly any space to wait).  By the time it got home, it would not be as good--greasy food as to be eaten as hot and fresh as possible, IMO.  Besides, I'd torture everyone on the bus going north.  I'm no burger tease!  Also the wait is well...yep, it seems like there would always be a lineup here.  Good things do come to those who wait but again, it is just a burger.  Recommended, most especially if you live nearby."}
{"text":"Before going to this place, you may want to visit their website.  They have a separate menu with various burgers not listed on their menu at the restaurant.  I had someone give me a funny look when i ordered the Noah's ark combo ... Just to note, Noah's ark = a burger with chili + cheese.  (Hey buddy, what is a Noah's ark ... followed by 90 second of explanations to the guy about the secret menu that could be found on the burger priest website on his smart phone.)  Anyways quick review. A little expensive for fast food, but they do have some good items.  I don't come here often, but when i do, i try to have something different.    If you're a vegetarian, you can order something that tastes good, without feeling your friends got 'better' items than you did."}
{"text":"I've been to the beaches location before but it's my first time here. Definitely more spacious and more room for people to stand inside to wait for their orders as well as additional seating. The lady at the cash was rude so I probably won't come back to this location. She looked annoyed that I didn't know what the toppings were (as it's been a while since I've eaten here). When I came back to buy a drink, I couldn't hear what she was saying over the music so I gave her $1.25 instead of $1.45 and she just stood there looking at me without saying anything until she finally said \"it's $1.45.\" I don't know if she was having a bad day or if this is how she usually speaks to people but she should be retrained or just fake a smile.   As for the food, I got the Option which is the vegetarian option. Not my fave veggie burger I've ever had but was definitely enjoyable. The fries are served in pretty big portions and are delicious!   I would have given 4 stars but I'm giving 3 due to the cashier's attitude."}
{"text":"I love this place.  4 horseman is the best burger.  I will come back again and again"}
{"text":"One thing that keeps me coming back to this place is their consistency.. They have good toppings, nice chewy bun, good portion size, but a little on the pricier side.  In my opinion, I enjoyed 'The Option' more than their regular burger.  Wait times are fair, there wasn't so much seats, but most of their customers do take-out orders anyways, I like how their patties are juicy and burgers are delicious.   If I were to compare this to Fresh Burger though, I still believe Fresh Burger is better. Both places offer great consistency and these 2 places are the best burger places for me."}
{"text":"This place is quite the rave evidently, so we decided to check it out. First impression, couldn't hear what I was thinking. Music is ear-splitting loud, and everyone is yelling to compensate. Note to Toronto establishments: louder is not better. Food handlers prepared the burgers with bare hands, and handled other things simultaneously. Not good food safe handling Practices. I won't go back solely based on this. Burgers were salty.. Tasty, but only slightly a notch above Wendy's. very unpleasant experience to sit in there as it was so blaringly loud, could not wait to leave.."}
{"text":"Great place! Hard to heard when they yelled out my number. Not a big deal. I'd come here again for sure."}
{"text":"The best in the area!!! The portions are smaller but it's juicer and \"home made\".   I only get the chilli cheese fries and bacon cheeseburger..it's always 10/10   Price is a little more but it's great quality."}
{"text":"The best burgers in Toronto.  I usually get the Priest burger with the stuffed portobello mushroom.  However, I do find it a bit on the greasy side compared to the Shack Stack at Shake Shack, which is what I'm used to.  But since there is no Shake Shack in Toronto, Burger's Priest is a good alternative."}
{"text":"With a name like Burger's Priest, I had to try it at least once.   I notice nowadays that places like these don't really have combos with the usual fries and drink,  but tend to charge for each separately.    Looked online before visiting and saw the infamous \"secret menu\" sans pricing.   Arrived and still decided to just try something off of the menu instead and maybe try one off the secret menu another time.   We both ordered the High Priest and loved it.  Flavourful enough and average portions.  A bit on the pricey side to be honest.  The fries were good, but a little small as I will assume it was the end of the bag or something.    I would say that it was definitely worth the drive up to try, but I wouldn't make myself a regular here as I would probably go broke if that was the case.  These burgers are nice once in awhile I suppose.   Will be back eventually."}
{"text":"Had no intention of coming here but while driving discovered it last minute. Strangely, found this location to be open on a Sunday which isn't the same for the other location we visited. Tiny restaurant, limited seating. The burgers are pricey here, around $16(?) for a combo includes a burger, drink, and fries. We found the menu pretty okay, we didn't know about their secret menu so we just ordered off the reg menu. Ordered double bacon cheeseburger, a high priest burger along with the combo. The fries were overly salted, the beef they use must have a high fat percentage because the oil was everywhere (soaked through the buns) it made the buns soggy and wet. Which I am not a big fan of, the burgers were good though- just don't expect anything lean. Ended up ordering their \"Ice cream cookie sangwich\" with chocolate ice cream, you have different choices. It was really good and the ice cream didn't melt fast which made it even better. I am a fan of their food, but I would probably come back for their burgers and the ice cream cookie sangwich for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered burger from work. 5 High Priest Burgers. Service was great and on time. I would definitely order food from this place again.... Only on my \"Cheat Days\"....:)"}
{"text":"Good burger, wouldn't say it is the best be definitely a place where you won't ve disappointed with the burger"}
{"text":"I'm a born and bred California girl....so....hamburgers are a pretty big deal to me.   This itty bitty joint is located on a busy corner but you're pretty much out as soon as you get in.   Ordered The Vatican ($13) because it comes with GRILLED CHEESE BUNS!!!! For the sake of my body, I normally eat half of any burger...but this one was all me :) Please visit this place if you're from out of town! I rented a bike just so that I could get here and consume a million calories and not feel so guilty afterwards since I'll be \"biking\" back *flips my hair*. It's been almost 2 weeks since my visit and I'm already missing you."}
{"text":"I like'd this place.   Plus they played some good music, even though it was kinda loud - to the point where it almost made it difficult to hear someone talk.     I ordered the Holy Smoke burger.   A double cheeseburger with deep fried jalapeños.    The burger itself seemed on the plain side, but perfectly cooked.  The jalapeños really helped.      The fries seem to be pretty good too.    They were crisp on the outside but still soft and potatoey (is that a word?) on the inside.     I'd come back.    I'm interested in trying their chili.....  I'm glad we had cash on us because it's a cash only establishment."}
{"text":"They should call it Tiny Overpriced Burger.  Nice cheeseburger but nothing special, just tastes like a homemade burger. 5 guys is waaay better in my opinion. Bigger burger, better toppings and much tastier. Too much hype, does not deliver."}
{"text":"A go to for sure.  Keeps us fueled up and ready for action.  One of us loves the triple with bacon.  We all get the burgers as lettuce wraps, tastes great and the staff are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I am well aware of the hype surrounding Burger's Priest, but I was underwhelmed. The burger  patty was dry, the fries were burnt, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it :s. I suppose hype can distort some people's senses.   Considering the price for what you get, I expected more. Perhaps it's the new location that was the issue. The chocolate chip cookie was amazing though."}
{"text":"Why do all the BPs have such awful seating?   Oh well at least the burgers are awesome, this is probably best burger in Toronto and closest in quality to my American favorites, Shake Shack and In & Out.  I strongly recommend any first timers to get anything other than a normal hamburger or cheeseburger cause honestly those taste like any other burger.   You can also go online now and check out the 'secret menu'.  Lastly a super tip is to call ahead and order so you can just drop in and pay and get out. In the summer, I just grab takeout with friends and take a seat on a bench along Spadina."}
{"text":"Location is a out of the way, but in warmer weather you can bring your burger to Qew or to the nearby park.   I'd definitely recommend ordering something from the secret menu or at least a double cheeseburger. First time I only ordered a regular burger and didn't seem anything special to me till I'd tried all the secret ones, ie Vatican, etc.   Tip: Go early and don't expect to sit in restaurant."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand the hype of this place.  They're really expensive, the patty is thin, bland and not all that filling.  The fries are nothing special that I couldn't have bought from a supermarket.  For a meal that cost almost $20, I could've gone to A&W or Hero Burger for half the price and equal quality if not better food.  For the record, I had the Magnum, and it is in no way worth the price I paid for that thing.  This particular location is much cleaner than their other location on Yonge and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Came to Burger's Priest for only the second time. This was my first time at the Queen St location. Although still small, the restaurant had a decent amount of seating.  Having just come from a nearby gelato place for pre-dinner dessert, we weren't super hungry. Hubby ordered the Option, and in usual fashion, I ordered a cheeseburger (because cheese makes most things better). This my first time trying the Option. It was perfectly fried with a crunchy exterior for the portabello mushrooms and gooey cheese. Hubby appreciated that it wasn't crazy messy, unlike the stuffed portabello at Holy Chuck. As for my cheeseburger, it was pretty standard fare but I did appreciate that I could taste the beefiness in their burger patty.   One of these days I will work up enough appetite to try the Vatican, which I have had my eye on since first trying BP 3 years ago. I love grilled cheese, so what's not to like about a burger sandwiched by grilled cheese sandwiches?! Oh yeah!!!  (59/100)"}
{"text":"This is a burger place with a more polished feel; the interior is decorated simply but with a classier feel than your typical burger joint. It was difficult to find a seat but we managed to snag a table during the wait for our food. The fries were ready before the burger. They call out your name and your number when your order is ready, and you have to pick it up from the counter near the back of the store.  The chilli cheese fries were quite good, though the cheese wasn't particularly flavourful. I didn't try the burger myself but my friend said it tasted \"just like a McDonald's one\" -- though I would give this review the benefit of doubt. I think perhaps the seasoning is similar to that of McDs, but the meat looked to be of a better quality. I was surprised that they use shredded lettuce instead of whole leaf lettuce, which I prefer. They didn't ask or offer any toppings and just gave the standard with onions and lettuce and tomato.   I would probably say this place has gotten a lot of hype, maybe a bit more than it deserves. The burgers are pricey, so it's really best worth your dollar if you're looking for novelty appeal. I liked the setting and didn't mind the wait but the food was just alright. As some others have mentioned, it is cash only."}
{"text":"The priest is now starting to expand its locations and wood a bridge has its own  These guys make a high quality burger  The special is their California classic with secret sauce and a single is $8  It's pretty straight forward with everything tossed in a paper bag. No plates or cutlery for you  Burgers are made fresh on the premises so you can expect a slime free meal not a frozen puck that's been reheated. They are juicy so knapkin are in order   Now they really lack condiments at the tables which at this price point is very surprising and one must go begging. Hey owners you need to fix this!!!  So by the time you add fries and a beverage you will get change back from a $20  Usual line ups but it moves quick and ventilation is strong so you won't go home smelly  Place is very noisy every time I was there   Enjoy a cow for lunch!  Oh and add a ice scream sandwich for $5 which is ice cream on a toasted bun  they call it the Vatican on Ice  They do the buns in a different way. The buttered and cooked on the flat top or their cheese bun that has a slice of cheese inside it"}
{"text":"Here's my confession: I moved to Toronto in July of 2010. Prior to my visit to the Burger's Priest, it had been nearly 9 months since I have eaten a decent burger in Toronto -- and believe me, I've tried plenty of them. I was beginning to give up hope... until I was saved by the Burger's Priest.  On my visit, I had a cheeseburger. First: the meat is perfect -- hand-formed patty, juicy juicy juicy, high-quality meat, soft pillowy bun.  The burger would have already qualified as Toronto's best, but then... the piece de resistance: The Option -- which, as other reviewers have mentioned, is two pieces of portabello mushrooms with cheese in the middle, breaded with panko crumbs and deep fried. HOLY MOLY, that thing is the bomb. It's got the texture, flavor, and artery clogging amazingness that sets this burger apart from all others.   The fries are not so great -- kinda soggy, I thought. And the only thing this place is really missing is a milkshake to go with such greasy deliciousness. But the amazingness of the cheeseburger + Option transcends this small sin.   Now, my holy burger trinity is complete: In-n-Out, Five Guys, and now the Burger's Priest. I may not have seen god, but I have certainly seen the light of a damn fine burger.  Pro tip: No room to eat here -- take your food to go, and drive the short distance down to the park to enjoy your burger communion."}
{"text":"Simple. Fresh. Fantastic. Although I was offended by having to pay an extra $1.79 for a Low Gluten bun"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for carnivores and herbivores alike. Went here after a walk around woodbine park and had one of the best veggie burgers of my life. In the first bite, cheese literally exploded out of the deep fried portobello mushroom burger. It was heaven. Highly recommended. Boyfriend with the actual meat burger seemed equally if not more pleased."}
{"text":"New location! When I went, it had only been open a couple of weeks. Love where it is on Adelaide - close to Roy Thomson Hall and other entertainment centres - this is the perfect location for a burger joint.   At the Burger's Priest, you can dress your burger any way you like so for our burgers, we tried to load up on the flavour.  We ordered (prices exclude tax):  A single cheeseburger: beef patty with cheese, dressed the way you like... the beef patty is amazing - flavorful, juicy, fresh - and the bun is soft too. For $5.79 for just the burger though, it felt too small. Value-wise, their cheeseburger is a 3 stars. (A double cheeseburger sells for $8.49.)  California Classic Single Burger: This was our absolute favorite.  It's their cheeseburger with a ring of sauteed onions, sandwiched between buttered buns, topped with their secret sauce, lettuce, and tomato. It was delicious, hands-down. One of the best burgers we've ever tasted. The buttered buns make a nice difference by adding to the burger's overall flavour - a more warm and rich taste. Whatever is in their secret sauce should stay in the sauce - great flavours! The single sells for $7.39; double for $9.99.  This burger for me is an automatic recommend. 5 stars!   Jarge shake: Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry shake for $4.50, it was creamy and rich but didn't particularly stand out as a shake. Then again, you come here for the burgers. It was a 3 stars.   Overall, this burger place is great - I recommend going for their special burgers instead of going in for a classic cheeseburger. You won't regret the extra flavours!"}
{"text":"Great burger!  Be sure to order from the 'secret menu'.  I had the 'Vatican City' burger which is a double cheeseburger between TWO grilled cheese sandwiches used as buns.  Just awesome!  Also added bacon, fried onions and deep fried breaded jalapeños to the toppings.  Is it the best burger I've ever had?  No, but it was a great burger nonetheless and was a fun experience.  The Burger's Priest is just a small place, packed, standing room only.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"my gawd ppl, what are you worshipping? tasteless and small overpriced run of the mill burgers? absolutely nothing unique about this place! except that it clearly makes a mountain of cash from its sheepish fans. closed on sundays and cash only, am I the only one that can see thru this sham of an eatery? thats the problem with social media, most commentators are not discerning enuf and thats why average places like this get top status, but really its just an indictment of the poor taste of the peole."}
{"text":"Walking in, I wasn't overly impressed with the decor. The seating isn't great either. The girl working the register acted like she hates her job. I ordered a burger ($7.60) with cherry pepper jelly, fries, & a can of soda ($4.68) The girl made it a \"combo\"..I paid full price for every item.. their claim is the burgers are fresh & I agree. The patty was flavorful & juicy. The toppings & bun were also fresh. The burger was small though. The fries were average. I didn't leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Always very happy with their food but the larger space and parking were an absolute godsend.  The Tower of Babel is a burger after my own heart. The wonder of their burgers is the quality of ingredients, expert skill of prep, composition and construction, and the miracle of not feeling like a bloa  Chilli fries are very fulfilling but could use a lot more heat. Primo shakes with chocolate, vanilla and strawberry at the same time. I intend to try their other deserts soon.  Best burger ever."}
{"text":"Being a major foodie, I had yet to try Burger's Priest. So I finally  decided to try this place and the hype is definitely real. I ordered the Pope burger which is basically the Priest with an extra patty which came up to about $16. The price is definitely on the higher end of burgers. The burger was quite good and flavours were spot on. After this experience, I've become a big fan of their burgers. Overall, it was a pretty good dining experience and I would definitely go back again and again to try their other burgers especially the ones on the secret menu."}
{"text":"There's really nothing I can say but echo what's already been said dozens of times. This place is amazing. It's nearly identical to Shake Shack  (in New York City) in terms of taste, and that's saying a lot.   I had the Priest, which is comparable to the Shack Stack at Shake Shack. Just amazing.  Tips:  1) Make sure you try the sourdough bun! 2) There's a secret menu on their website, check it out before going!"}
{"text":"Burger's Priest needs no introduction. They make burgers in a style that is very similar to the famed In-N-Out in the west and Shake Shack in eastern USA. Endless combinations of their juicy burger patties (which are ground fresh daily) and their \"option\", which is their take on a veggie patty (a panko-crusted, cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom).   My favourite burger is the Priest, which has one cheeseburger patty and an option, with all the fillings. I also had the black and white shake, which is a combination of chocolate and vanilla, and tastes similar to how I'd imagine Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme milkshake would.   I was there at their grand opening today, and waited in line for about 40 minutes. The line was consistently the same length, even as I was leaving. Though they were in their first hour of operation, you wouldn't be able to guess it from the looks of it. Their service was just as consistent as I've experienced at their other locations.   I haven't tried too many of Burger's Priest's offerings because I love the Option/Burger combo so much, but I'm confident in saying that you'll be happy with whatever choice you make. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers,but alot of people recommendations were that its one of the best burger places in Toronto. I have had better its kind overrated and their fries are not the best, but will visit again when I am craving burgers and around the area."}
{"text":"$6cheeseburgers that are well worth the money. Good quality patties and ingredients with cheese included.  The fries ($4) resemble New York Fries but without the skin. Low sodium, small pieces, crispy, mostly hollow. Better than McDonalds fries so its satisfying. A good amount for $4 but doesn't beat Costco quality"}
{"text":"There is no other burger on earth. Only the priest.   Get a double, priest of Pope.   Everything about this burger is perfect. It's not gourmet. It's just a simple fast food burger but made with great, fresh ingredients.   Don't take them to go. They aren't as good 10min later. Just eat it. Right away.  Oh Jesus this place is next level.   Far better than shake shack and in n out in my  opinion. Similar style."}
{"text":"Really delicious juicy and flavourful burgers.  I am not one to order super heart stopping burgers in the first place (aka ones with double patties, added fried things, etc) although I am sure those are tasty! I stuck to the classic and ordered a cheeseburger which was so so so good.  Side note, I am a pickle gal, and their pickles are really good!  Service was friendly and efficient, I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I know I'm a little late here - Burger's Priest has been a thing for a few years.  I hadn't previously made a visit b/c their original locations were not known to have much seating, and with a tot in tow, that was an issue.    The Vaughan location does have seating, so off we went.  I had a double cheeseburger, my husb had the holy smokes (double cheeseburger with the deep fried jalapenos).  We had plain fries and an order of chili cheese fries.  First - the burger was insanely delicious.  So juicy and flavorful.  My complaint is that you have to eat it fast so it doesn't fall apart in your hand!  Other complain is the lack of exciting condiments.  I dislike ketchup, mustard, mayo - would love a burger sauce or tasty aioli.  (This is why I love Fresh Burger; burgers are as wonderful as BP, but they have a delicious burger sauce).  The chili cheese fries were A+.  My biggest complain about chili cheese fries is the lack of cheese.  BP's chili cheese fries were loaded with cheese, and therefore, delicious.    The service was fast, the order correct.  The seating was good, but get there early b/c it was really busy (we arrived at 5:45pm on a saturday).    Drinks are canned/bottled and WARM.  turn up your fridge, please.  All in all, the burgers are worth the hype."}
{"text":"They have the secret menu in the restaurant now!! Lol you use to have to google to figure out what the items were on the secret menu before but not anymore! Woo!   I got the Pope! Which is the option (portobello mushroom with cheese deep fried) between two beef patties and its honestly amazing!! The option which is their vegetarian option is so good and the cheese just oozes out when you bite into it. The beef patty is super tasty and everything just tastes so good together. I definitely couldn't finish the whole burger by myself and had to share hahah. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I ordered uber delivery and the food was horrible. The fries were cold and stale and no ketchup was provided. The burgers had one skimpy tomato...and no mayo or ketchup, despite requesting for it. I had such a horrible experience that I will not be going back to this location.  They really need to improve the quality of the food at this location."}
{"text":"Tiny, cramped and the source of the city's most delicious hamburger! Had the High Priest (think Big Mac made with actual food products) and fries. Ingredients were fresh, service was friendly. Absolutely worth a taste if you love a good hamburger."}
{"text":"Had the Option burger ($7.99, vegetarian) which is a portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese then breaded with penko crumbs and deep fried. It was pretty tasty although not much mushroom flavour came through (pure cheese). The breading was really nice; the crispy texture really added to the burger. The burger is small considering the price.   I was quite disappointed with the fries. They were old and soggy with no flavour. I ate less than half before I (sadly) threw them out. So I paid an extra $4.89 for soggy fries and a drink - not worth it.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Been here once. Loved it. Expensive for small portions. The bill was $33 for two burgers. Although the food was good quality it still didn't fill any if us. Impossible to find parking. Park further and just walk, its not worth the effort waiting around for a spot."}
{"text":"First thing. both my partner and I got food poisoning from this place.  So I'll never go back.  I love burgers.  I'm not stranger to a good burger.  This wasn't great at all.  The flavour profile seemed like a glorified McD's burger.  I guess that' why some people like it so much.  There are many amazing places to get burgers in the city.  Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"They have gone down hill.  8$ a burger that looks as taste like a Wendy's burger.  Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"Yeah it's a pretty solid burger at a pretty penny. Oops they don't use pennies anymore do they? The burger patties are juicy and the bun is soft. The fixins round out a complete burger. I would say they are more like the In N Out side of things rather than Shake Shack. Burgers here come close to those flagships burger joints as far as quality, not quite there as far as taste. But probably one of the best among the burger joints in Toronto. Just wish the lines weren't so crazy and the burgers were priced like in California."}
{"text":"This is a nifty little place. I really liked the compact size of it. They've done a nice job with the small space they have.   I ordered the California burger (I think that was the name) with fries. It was SPECTACULAR. It came on a thin milk bun, which was very moist and not terribly filling. The beef itself had a very fresh taste and did not taste like it was from a grocery store.   If you order this burger, go for the double. It's worth every penny.   Bravo Priest. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Popped in here based on the name of the restaurant alone and we're not disappointed. The menu names made us laugh and the burgers, fries, and shakes were perfection. Despite being burgers, everything tastes light and fresh."}
{"text":"Been to this Vaughan location of the Burger's Priest a few times. Heard good things about the chain and even better things about their other locations. Apparently, this location is subpar compared to their other Toronto locations. I have not been to any of their other locations so I cannot compare. However, I can say that the burgers here are good but a bit too greasy for my taste. The service is usually quick and efficient, but occasionally slowed down a bit by a backed up kitchen when it gets busier. Wish they had more topping choices.   The California Classic is delicious and my personal recommendation. The secret sauce they use in this burger is absolutely amazing. It's the best part of the burger, even more so than the meat and buttered buns. The fries here are nothing special and quite bland actually. The drinks offered were mostly cans of pop. I always skip getting a combo here, as it's not worth the price point to me. Single burgers were $7.99 and doubles are upwards of $9. Would go back just for the California Classic burger...and its secret sauce."}
{"text":"I only tried the basic hamburger / cheeseburger but can say I look forward to returning and trying out the rest of their menu. The burger meat itself was juicy and had the flavour and texture you look for in a quality hamburger. The basic toppings were all fresh. Service was quick and friendly. Prices range from $7 to the low teens. I would definitely choose burger priest over similarly priced hamburgers like south street burger."}
{"text":"It's a good thing this place is out in the beaches 'cause a girl could easily put on the pounds eating here... a girl that sees no shame in having a bacon cheeseburger a day that is aka me!  There are a lot of comparisons to the IN-N-OUT chain in California and I'd agree if you think IN-N-OUT back in the day as a mom and pop shop.   Burger Priest is less fast-food than the popular california burger chain but they have similar principles...  Fresh ground meat, cooked on a griddle, and soft buns. They also have similar toppings for their burgers but only in that they're mostly simple toppings like ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickles, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, cheese, bacon, and fried onions. I didn't see the thousand island type dressing that IN-N-OUT uses though. There burgers are a bit bigger, patties a bit more free form, and fries are also a larger cut. (Yes, I have made enough trips to IN-N-OUT to know the cut of their fries, lol!)  One main difference is \"the option\" deep fried mushroom stuffed with cheese. Yes, you heard me correctly. I imagine this started as the vegetarian option but I don't think mushroom stuffed with cheese can be considered a vegetable.   Their fries were a bit greasy when we went and I think they use yukon gold potatoes which I love to cook with but as fries they can be a bit sweet. Still really good but not the best fries I've ever had. Want to try their chili cheese fries next time I'm there.  The location is small, with a tiny row of bar stools along the wall. Kind of hard to eat there when it's busy but great for take away and sitting in the nearby park when the weather is nice, or driving down and getting take away... just wish they had a drive-thru...  Fresh food does take time so expect a wait for your burger of at least 10 minutes even when it's not busy but it's worth it.   Overall I'd say burger alone is 5 stars, fries 4 stars, location & set-up maybe 3, but I'd drive out for their burger any day..."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch Specialty: Classic American Burgers Location: 1636 Queen Street East, Toronto, ON (Opening Soon - Yonge/Lawrence) Menu items: The Vatican with Chili Cheese Fries  The line-ups, overwhelming crowds, comfort food smell and juicy back-to-basics burgers, is what's making The Burger's Priest the talk of town.  To best describe the Priest's burger selection, I will simply break it down for you...lettuce, onions, tomatoes, processed cheese, ketchup, beef pattie.  When I arrived at the Burger's Priest on a Saturday afternoon, I came with an illusion of having one of the best burger experiences. My illusion turned into extreme happiness, when I realized two things; one, they have a \"secret menu\" that only gets published on their Facebook page, not a super secret, but cool nonetheless, and two, the Burger's are just simple American style burgers. There are no added crazy ingredients like what you would have at the Yellow Griffin, or the need for fancy ingredients like John's Burger at Marben.  What you get instead is a juicy custom blend of ultra premium beef, grind multiple times at the premises, with a ton of flavour and a perfect grilling technique. I am not quite sure how to best describe this buttery and tasty burger; but I can tell you this much - it is by far the BEST simple American burger I have ever had. Amen!  The Vatican burger was my selection for the day and in my mind one of the tastiest burgers on their menu, or secret menu I should say. What I liked about it is the fact that the Priest added another American tradition to this burger - Grilled Cheese. Instead of having just bread, they made it a grilled cheese, top and bottom! Now that deserves a Hail Mary right there!  But my praying did not stop there! As if I hadn't have enough greasy goodness for the day, I decided to also treat myself to the Chili Cheese Fries. I mean, after all, I need to ensure my fellow foodies get to read a great review.  The fries are plain and good; crunchy and just cooked right. The Chili Cheese sauce, well that my friends is another one big hit at this place. In my mind these fries, and to put it in fancy terms, are a De-constructed version of the burger, with the fries just replacing the bread. Simple, tasty...amazing!   Foodies Must-Know:  1. Burger's Priest Queen location just does take out; although they are opening a North York location soon, which might have some seating arrangement. 2. Burger's Priest only takes cash  3. You can call ahead to order for pick-up  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting too much because of the Burger's Priest hype.  This place is ok, but it's definitely not the best burger in Toronto.     I had the Priest Burger - what better burger to judge a place by than its namesake menu item?  As others have said, don't bother asking questions when you're there.  Look up the menu, including the \"secret menu\" online before you go.  It feels like that's a big part of what this place is all about - hipsters feeling like they're insiders and telling each other that they went to Burger's Priest.  Back to the Priest Burger - it tasted ok.  It was small for the price.  An average burger, really.  It didn't live up to the hype.  I'll give them another shot some time, but I've had better burgers at other places nearby - Great Burger Kitchen, BQM, and Craft Burger (now Big Smoke)."}
{"text":"I only went here because I read about how Daniel Radcliffe said the burger he had from here was the best burger he has ever tasted. I don't know what he was thinking.  I went on a Saturday evening which is probably the worst time to be there. The place was packed. I waited SOOO long for the most basic burger. it was okay, but certainly not exceptional. The meat was crumbly which I'm not too fond off, especially since I ate the burger while walking on the street. I can recommend places with MUCH better burgers for Daniel Radcliffe or anyone who was not impressed with this place.  As for being cash only, that's the way it should be!"}
{"text":"The Burger's Priest was the best burger I've had. My sister and I tried the Vatican City It was absolutely perfection in what I like in a burger. I live in LA so usually I consider In N Out the best burger. But The Burger's Priest was way better than In N Out in my opinion. The fries were golden and crispy and the burger filled me up for my flight back home. The place was a bit small but My sister, Aunt and I found a place to sit and enjoyed a delicious burger.   If you are a burger fan I highly recommend trying the The Burgers Priest."}
{"text":"Great tasting burger, cooked with perfection. Juicy enough that it doesn't need any toppings.   I prefer it without cheese."}
{"text":"Talk about going over and above! I love this location by far my fav one in Toronto! I either go eat at that location with my friends or family or we order it via UberEats or DoorDash. This time I did it via DoorDash. My fav things to order from there is the High Priest and the Stern fries!!! The stern fries are out of this world! Now they only had one of the two fav things on the DoorDash menu so I called the store and spoke to a Corey! Now this is an awesome person, he figured out a solution so that we could get me the stern fries even though they are not on the menu and because of the trouble he gave me a cookie! Really can't do better than that customer service! So thank you that location, thank you for always being great, from the front line girls who take the orders and fill up the pop in the fridge to the cooks who have to yell out names and surprisingly got my name right!! Thank you! Side note, momma bear orders, the Priest with the Option but does well done on the Portobello mushroom and burger, and my brother orders the Cali Classic! All great options but like I said my fav is the high priest with extra pickles! oh and the cookies are on point too!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've had. Was tasty and filling. Wish it was a little cheaper though and be prepared to wait awhile in line depending on the time. Also not much seating."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and a cool variety. Only issue is the price, but keeps me coming back for the flavor.  Recommended for lunch."}
{"text":"4.5/5  I'm going to start with the cons, since there's only one main one, which is that they only accept cash, which in this day and age, is insanely annoying. I'm gonna say it to every vendor, please accept debit and credit cards, it makes it easier to spend our money at your location. I should add that there is a TD just around the corner, so it kind of helps, but only if you're a TD bank account holder. That's the only con.   Ok let's get to the burger already! I ordered the cheeseburger (I wanted to keep it simple) with fries, my buddy, who is a vegetarian, got the option (which is two portabella mushrooms with cheese between, breaded and deepfried). It took just under 10 minutes for the order to come through, even though it was a full house.   The burger was a foodgasm in my mouth! It was so tasty, and easily one of the best burgers I'd tasted in ages (and let's be honest here, I'm pretty promiscuous with my burger eating habits...). It was a fairly small cheeseburger, but good value for what you get, and it was more on the soft side of the burger spectrum, as opposed to the patties that are harder these days.  Surprisingly, I liked that aspect, and it just melded everything together really well. The fries were simple, yet delicious (it's hard not to eff these up). From what my buddy ordered, he said the option was super tasty, but buyer beware, this can be really hot right after ordering, so don't bite into it too soon. BE PATIENT YOU PIG. In the future, I'd recommend getting a cheeseburger with the option in it, and skip the fries, since this will fill you up real good.   As for the service, the woman at the cash was super nice and friendly. That's about the only interaction I had with the staff. One cool thing she mentioned to me when I asked her if I could recycle my can was that they subscribe to a garbage/recycling sorting service which sorts everything out, even if it goes in the same bin, so good for you guys!  Atmosphere-wise, you're in a small space full of people with one common goal; eat burgers, so it's pretty sweet. I actually like the fact that within this small space, an ethos of friendship is fostered between burger-craving humans. Asking strangers if you can borrow a seat if it's not being used, or even squishing in beside a stranger wouldn't seem like such cardinal sin here, which is kind of nice in Toronto. Rejoice in burgerism with others and make some friends while you're here :)"}
{"text":"I forgot what it is like to taste a hamburger.  I mean I eat lots of meat pucks but I always pile on a bunch of condiments and extras.  Add some avocado, mustard, relish, onion, whatever, and by the time I'm done, I have an enjoyable meal that doesn't stay faithful to the category.  I ordered the High Priest for lunch, and got a complete burger where I could taste the burger--and tasty it was!  I added nothing to the burger except my jaws-a great combination. A taste of pickle here, a sheen of lettuce there, nothing overshadowed the burger itself. Thanks Burger Priest for resurrecting my appreciation for burgers!"}
{"text":"Messy burger I had. Greasy. Fattening. Messy. Still loved it though. Small joint. Order at counter...Wait for your number to be called...Sit down and dig in."}
{"text":"Super delicious burger! I had the option and did not miss meat one bit! The portobello mushroom fried up with cheese was delicious. So good! I loved my creamsicle float. Creamsicles are my fave and they even have the diet orange crush to make it with (less guilt lol) highly recommend yet wish the actual restaurant was bigger. Basically a great place for takeout. Just walk over to the park with your meal and enjoy"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  The quality of food is a 4/5 stars but the price drops the overall review.  I ordered the priest combo and was impressed by the burger itself but damn the option is a hefty piece.  No complaints about it but it was really heavy.  The burger was made fresh and tasted amazing but in the end the combo costed $16 and I can't let that one go."}
{"text":"Omg! Best. Burger. Ever. Simple but full of flavour with great contrasting textures between the traditional and oh-so-fresh white bun and ground-in-house beef patty. I make sure to save all my burger cravings for the Burger's Priest! So worth the sacrifice."}
{"text":"So here's the story: found out that The Burger's Priest was opening in Port Credit just minutes from my place. I was thrilled. I'm a huge veggie burger connoisseur (if there is such a thing) and the fact that Port Credit doesn't have a South Street, a Hero Burger or a Big Smoke has been bugging me for some time now. I would have gladly settled for a Harvey's or even BK.  I know that meat eaters may not think much of the veggie burger but searching out the best ones has long been a passion of mine. Sadly, that search will not include even giving The Burger's Priest a shot. Why? Because their veggie burger isn't a veggie burger.   Now I don't know if it's fair reviewing a place that I haven't actually tried and I certainly won't object if anyone flags this review. But their \"Option\", a crusted portabello mushroom thing, is NOT a veggie burger! A soy based meat analogue is. A bean burger is. One of those veggie patties with all that random stuff works. But mushrooms are a potential topping, not the burger itself! There's no protein, it reeks of laziness and it just doesn't work as a \"burger\" with all the normal or even abnormal toppings. It's a mushroom sandwich, nothing more. Again, it could work as an add-on to a regular or veggie burger but not as the main event. ARGH!!  So I'm very disappointed in Burger's Priest because I was very much looking forward to having a killer (veggie) burger option in my 'hood. Oh and I guess I should probably disclose the fact that I absolutely HATE mushrooms. But you probably already knew that."}
{"text":"A bit chaotic - but we came with another family during the height of family dinner time. (Saturday, 5pm)   Burgers were really good - the buns are fresh and the fresh ground beef had awesome flavours. You can taste the subtle onion and spices that other burger places just don't have. Impressive. The Chili fries were a tad disappointing but the regular fries were really good. My kids even got the cookies for dessert and even the cookies were fresh and tasty.   Sadly, however, the madness and loudness of the joint tainted the experience a bit.  It could have just been the time we came. I'm used to places that are loud and kid-friendly but this was almost extreme. Next time, I'll have to come at a different time."}
{"text":"Oh man.  You haven't lived until you've tried the Vatican.  It loses a star due to the extremely limited seating.  The best burger's ever.    There's nothing else for me to say."}
{"text":"I ordered one of the secret menu burgers from this restaurant, called magnum. While the burger tastes great, I cannot help lamenting about the small size of the food. It is very expensive for such a tiny burger. On top of that, the service was really slow; the staff was almost chatting all the time. I could have gone to other place so I wouldn't be late for my movie. I wouldn't go back to this particular joint. Maybe other places would have served their burgers faster and better. Everything about this restaurant is overrated."}
{"text":"After seeing the once perfect score on Yelp!, I had to check out \"The Burger's Priest\".   I'm glad I did, because I'm in love.   I've been twice since and both times it's been incredible.  I highly suggest getting the pitch from the owner if you haven't been before. My text alone could never do his pitch justice. He's so passionate about burgers, and so descriptive that you have to try not to drool as he goes through each and every menu item in what sounds like an oft repeated speech.  I go for the namesake burger - \"The Priest\". It's essentially a cheeseburger with the veggie burger on top. It's not going to keep you under your daily calorie limit, but it'll leave you wanting more.   The burger is more than enough to satisfy you, but if you choose to go for the fries, they're pretty good as well. They taste like McDonalds fries before they changed up their oil/recipe. It's like going back to the good old greasy days of Mickey D's.   If you love burgers like I do, \"The Burger's Priest\" is a must.  Tip: It's cash only!"}
{"text":"So good! A little pricey, but if you want a quality fresh burger, you gotta eat here!  The California is my favourite, not too heavy. And the fries are awesome.  Gravy is okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"Burgers are really good but honestly the size is pretty small for the price! Fries are crunchy and the portion is big.  A bit overrated in my opinion. Don't go or order if you're on a budget!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. They took forever to prepare my burger and gave me the wrong sandwich!"}
{"text":"Of course we're all fans of The Burger's Priest but how does this Vaughan location hold up?  Quite well in fact! While I find the seating and layout a bit uncomfortable and uninviting, the staff and service is great and the location is easy to get to, for the most part.  While I was there they were advertising a new burger (limited time maybe?) called Esau's Birthright. I gave it a shot and mother of god was it delicious. Could be my favorite thing I've had there, and that's saying something.  This location like many others offers delivery but I can't imagine any hamburger that holds up well to delivery outside of a few minutes, and really for the price you're paying here, I think you owe it yourself to only eat the burgers piping hot. But to each their own. Maybe one day I'll try it, who knows, maybe I'm wrong.  I will be back here many more times, this I do know."}
{"text":"Lines are usually way too long, not worth the wait....mediocre tasting burgers, don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"My go to favorite for an affordable burger in Toronto used to be 5 guys but now that I've tried the single cheeseburger at Burger's Priest, I have a new favorite. The burger is juicy and cooked just right and is really cheesy! On top of that, it has a nice soft bun and of course all the standard fixin's. I'll definitely be back to try some of the more \"gourmet\" specialty burgers!"}
{"text":"So I ventured out today to test the Priest. I can say that it is certainly in the top 2 or 3 burgers in the City. That is not to say it is up to the international standards of lets say a Shake Shack or Corner Bistro in NYC, not for me anyways. But for the Burger wasteland that is Toronto it was pretty damn good. I ordered the double double medium rare. What I got was really great meat cooked medium rare on a flat top as I had hoped. The burger tastes like meat as it should, not like spices, not like condiments, not like smoke, not like brioche. Like a burger.  The bun was good in that it was unobtrusive. I hate too much bun. However my guess is that the bun would be better for the single patty, as it had trouble holding together once soaked with the juices of the med rare double. My recommendation would be to get a new bun ever so slightly more substantial or get a different but more substantial but still minimalist bun for the double and the priest. A commitment to the perfect burger should not take the bun / meat ratio for granted. By the way, I think the Stockyards is as good, and it is more substantial."}
{"text":"Staff here were awesome! Hilarious and totally accommodating for all the stupid questions I had about the secret menu and new menu items.   Food was equally on point .  My friend got a cookie and she loved it and also the new Peter's Denial. She said it was great and the perfect size!   Overall. Love this location, lots of windows and light, great staff and great food."}
{"text":"Bless us oh lord and these, thy burgers, which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Make us ever mindful of the needs of our bellies through Burger's Priest, Amen.*  I've eaten here once and I can't wait to get back. I've heard rumour that there are additional things on the menu too that aren't listed. I can only imagine that you need to get to a certain level of priest-dom before you can even see, let alone understand, these delights. If that is the case I'll be at this church as oft as possible until I understand thy ways.  *Amazing place for a burger, grab one and some fries. Fries which are truly delish. Some of the best of both in the city. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place I decided to try it with my MealPal subscription, that day it was offering \"high priest burger\", which is like 2 big macs stacked on top of each other. I was expecting a huge burger but it wasn't as huge. The burger meat was delicious, sauce was good but oher than that there wasn't anything much special about it. Normal price is 9.99 plus taax, which is I think overpriced for take-out. If you are gonna eat in the restaurant it has a nice atmosphere and might worth the money more since you are using the facility as well."}
{"text":"Sooo good! We went at lunch time & waited only 5 mins in line . . . no too bad compared to what I was expecting. If you are with a group you may want to split up and send one person in as there is only room for about 10 people inside (& it's always busy).  My husband got the cheeseburger which he described as \"good, kinda like Licks\" and I got The Option with fries topped with lettuce, ketchup and onions. Now, it's rare that food lives up to how good you imagined it, and I had really high expectations for their \"vegetarian\" option. I actually had a dream about how good this \"burger\" was going to taste . . . seriously! It actually exceeded my expectations in both size and flavour! I was worried that it might be too cheesy or runny or even hot to eat but it was absolutely satisfying and super tasty. Fries are decent too. I am not a burger person, and, to me, a burger is a burger is a burger. But The Option was an absolute reason to return and wait in the crazy lines.  Try it you won't regret it! If I return I would get the \"hypocrite\" which is the Option topped with bacon . . . . . . yum. Ps. there is a park just 1 block south if you prefer not to eat your burger in a parking lot!!! It's close enough your fries won't get soggy, promise! Pss. CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about the popularity of various burger joints popping up all over the downtown core.  Among them, The Burger Priest was one of many.  Though the reviews were quite positive, I found the burgers for the size to be quite pricier than usual and small. If you're spending at least $10 for a burger you'd expect it to be something along the lines of an ANGUS BURGER, South street, HERO, Dangerous Dans or even Licks.  Taste wise, the burger I ordered was pretty good, it tasted fresh with  all the ingredients included but was quite disappointed on how small the burger was overall...looks like they'll need a REAL PRIEST to forgive this place for ripping it's clients off lol.  The layout of the place is quite spacious however I can see this location lack seating arrangements if it got busy. In terms of service, the people were kind and helpful.   I've experienced better....."}
{"text":"Read as 2.5.  Came for lunch on a weekday and found it full. The kitchen/cooking was \"open\" so yes, you could see them making the burgers, but because the restaurant itself was so small, the entire place also smelled like burgers...  They don't take debit, but there is an ATM on site, so it's a little better. The wait for food was pretty short, considering the place itself was packed. Finding seating there is a struggle, since most of the tables are for 2's. There are two \"larger\" spaces, probably for at most 4 people, by the windows, but those seats are really shallow, and more a ledge than a seat.   The burger itself was well done, typical gourmet burger - price and quality, so nothing too extraordinary there."}
{"text":"In a nutshell - Overrated. Snarky. Pretentious. Overpriced. Mediocre.  After hearing that TBP is \"the best burger in TO\" and \"comparable to In N Out\", we were excited to finally try it. The menu had no descriptions so I didn't know what the heck \"The Option\" or \"The Priest\" burger was. So I asked the short blond girl behind the cash register for clarification. I guess asking questions at TBP is a huge faux pas because I got an eye roll, a huff, and a bored/hurried/sarcastic explanation. Every single time we said anything, it was met with such a bad attitude and lots of snark.   Yes, I know that I could've looked at the menu online. Yes, I know that there's also the \"secret\" menu. It's not that secret if everyone knows about it and it's been blogged ad nauseam. But is asking a question really that bad considering we were the only ones there (we were there at 11:30 am on a Friday). Would it have killed them to add descriptions to their simple menu? Or is that an affront to the hipster commandment of \"if you don't know then you shouldn't be here\"?  God forbid you actually want to eat there! They had 5 stools and a tiny counter but it's only for people waiting for their orders. Alrighty then.   The burger - the meat was bland and lacked flavour. It was missing that all-important sear that good flat top burgers have. The cheese was overpowering. The bacon limp. The bun was soft but it turned mushy. Mediocre at best and overpriced for the quantity.    The only redeeming thing were the fries. Fresh and crispy and salted just right.  TBP has a loyal following. I guess there are a lot of people who like middle of the road burgers with a side of pretentiousness and snark.  I, for one, remain a burger atheist and not a converted follower of The Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"3.5 = Rounding up to a 4...  This spot reminded me a lot of the burgers you get at Shake Shack.*  Thin beef patties, super melty cheese, soft bun. Yum!  After an afternoon of wandering the neighborhood I was excited about a yummy burger.  And that's exactly what we got.  Fresh, piping hot, cheesy burger with loads of pickles (thanks for those Burger's Priest!)  Prices were on par to what we're used to at places like Shake Shack - a few dollars more for a better burger experience - and I felt like the burger quality was top notch.   The fries on the other hand were nothing to get tooo excited about... very plain jane fries.  Some crispy, some soggy.  Just a bit inconsistent.  Taking a half star off for this...  The other star I'm taking off for the super small interior.  Not sure if this is the case with all the BP locations but this one is super small inside w/ only 6 super small tables, maybe 8.  This is definitely a 'order-to-go' type of place.  We were lucky enough to get a table but while finishing our meal the line of customers waiting to order and to pick up felt like it just kept creeping closer and closer.  I think we'd try BP again in the future, b/c it was pretty darn good, but maybe we'd try and find a location that's closer to our airbnb/hotel so we don't have to squeeze in at the restaurant.    *One of my fav burger spots in NYC."}
{"text":"Burger and fries were great! The chocolate milkshake on the other was not, it tasted like overly diluted melted bland chocolate ice cream."}
{"text":"Burgers are ok, restaurant is hyped up and service is slow. To me, the wait time for service is pretty bad for the mediocre nature of the burger."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Toronto, for sure. Super juicy meat, creamy cheese, crunchy lettuce, and the pièce-de-résistance, The Option. Its a portobello mushroom cap stuffed with cheese, crusted with Panko breadcrumbs, and fried. Its the PERFECT addition to a burger. I had the Priest and it was incredibly delicious. Will totally return."}
{"text":"I've been here another half a dozen times since my last review and I still like them but I wanted to remove half a star for the crappy buns(but yelp won't let me).  Maybe they changed or maybe they have always been that way but the only thing I hate about this place is the buns they use.    The place is too small to expect everyone to eat here so they should consider the fact that these burgers are going to be in transit for a few minutes before they are eaten.  In just 15 minutes the bun can begin to disintegrate into mush and ruin an otherwise great burger.    New buns and/or take out containers are very much needed."}
{"text":"No apologies for the blasphemy I am about to commit here, but I have a very fucking difficult time understanding how Burger's Priest is \"the BEST burger joint in Toronto ever.\" I just fail to see it as such, and the continued flow of hyperbolic overhype and appearances in top burger places in town (often at #1) lists bewilders me. There's seems to be no end to people deifying (if not literally) The Burger's Priest and claiming it is the #1 burger in Toronto, which quite frankly is getting annoying. (I'm convinced there's literally a cult behind this; foodies who go around screaming \"Believe the hype!,\" like that Yonge-Dundas street preacher who famously freaks people out with \"BELIEVE THE LORD!\") A second visit has failed to change my impressions. Maybe I am due for an epiphany.  I ordered \"The Priest,\" with everything, which basically looks like a glorified Big Mac. The collision of cheese, mushrooms, and other things turned out to be a rather boring greasy sad mess of flat flavours. All I tasted was some meat, fat, and melted cheese, that was barely enough to register a drool. It was boring and unimpressive. I expected a much bigger and mindblowing burger for the price paid, for what's the hype's worth.  My friend ordered \"The Vatican\", which apparently comes out of their \"Secret Menu\" (http://www.theburgerspriest.com/secret-menu/) (oooh, spooky... what a load of pretentious crap; like is this a cult thing for special people in the know?). It is basically a bigger version of whatever the hell I got, with not a lot of difference in taste. And he continues to insist that it is the best shit in town.  Well, I ain't converted!  This particular location at Queen and Coxwell is incredibly tiny--they discourage you from eating here, especially if it is busy. Best to grab and run--run like hell! There's no washroom either--thank goodness for the KFC nearby. The staff are about as enthusiastic as a typical McDonald's. Severely overrated much; I sure won't worship this hipster-hungry superlative overhyped-to-death booger joint."}
{"text":"It's good because it's simple. Loosely packed fresh beef ground on site, normal toppings and buns, nothing too sophisticated. It's all the little mods to the burgers that makes this place great. Grilled cheese buns. Blue cheese crumble and bacon, the cheese stuffed portobello mushroom option - highly recommend for burger lovers.  Update on October 31st, 2014: -Although great, the prices are extravagantly high for something that is really quite simple. I don't believe the menu items are fairly priced, and thus I am reducing my star rating by 1."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the city hands down, the hype is deserved. The choices alone are always exciting, which, coupled with the high quality of the meat and *most* of the toppings makes this a premier burger joint. However, it loses a star in my books because I fall firmly on the side of fresh cheese in the cheeseburger debate. I was disappointed when I found a processed cheese slice hiding under my bun. There should at least be an option for the real stuff for puritans."}
{"text":"Went there after reading rave reviews of the place. Tried their single patty cheeseburger with grilled cheese buns. It was something different, unique and quite cheesy but nothing special. It was just all right. Not likely to go there again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  My friend was raving about Burger Priest for sometime, so tonight she finally brought me there and it was love at first bite!  I ordered the Priest, which consists of 1 beef patty plus a cheese filled, garlic seasoned battered and fried portobello mushroom with all the fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup and pickles).  It was incredible.  So juicy, so beefy and so gooey!  They must make their patties in house as they look and taste so good. They lose a star because their fries were not memorable.  I hope they change their fries or serve onion rings.  :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I know I'll probably get flak for this review but I really didn't think their burgers were worth any of the hype I heard or read on here. They are excessively greasy, bland and lacked toppings I like (ie hot sauce). Also they are pricey for being so mediocre. They really weren't anything special at all and it pains me to say that because I was so excited for this place. I will instead be going to Bare Burger, which is infinitely more delicious and diverse than this restaurant."}
{"text":"Over hyped, and expensive for what you get.   I was bar hopping on Queen west and passed by the famous Burger's Priest that everyone talks about. I thought to go in and check it out.   It's a very small place with hardly any seating. They take cash only and everything is pretty expensive.   I had the Magnum burger which is blue cheese and bacon, they don't have a large selection of toppings and only had a few standard ones (ketchup mustard lettuce onions etc)   My Burger and fries with NO drink was almost  $15 which I thought was pretty expensive.   The burger was OK but not amazing, the patty was very thin. It looked like there was hardly any meat.   The fries were short and stubby and tasted ok but like any other fast food place. The nearby A&W has better burgers and are cheaper than here  I probably wouldn't come back, for what I paid I feel like I should've gotten more."}
{"text":"Went to Burger's Priest last week and I must say I'm a big fan of their burger.  I usually just get the double cheeseburger and don't bother with the fries.  The fries are not good at all, but the burger more than makes up.  I feel sorry for the Harvey's across the street!! LOL  The regular burger chains don't really hold up to \"home-made\" type of burgers that are sprouting up across the city."}
{"text":"I ordered the High Priest with fries. $10 for a burger.... really!!!! I must say the burger was good but for 10 bucks I should have the wow factor and I should be kneeling, praying to the burger gods for such a great burger- but not today! I asked to ketchup and mustard and could barley taste them. When I had a look they were so skimpy on all the sauces. This place is waaaayyyyy overpriced for what you get. The buns are your standard buns. If I am going to pay that much money I will go up the street to Royal Meats where everything on the burger is high end. Really do not see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Sometimes, simple is the best. Burger's Priest sticks to the simple rule of KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid!! There are no lavishly designed burgers with cheese that noone can pronounce on the menu's. You don't have a condiment selection of 500 items.   Now if this place only served burgers, it would get 5 stars. However, I do have to subtract a star because of the fries. But burger-wise, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"First off I am not really a burger person.   Second off my friend and I only came here b/c he was hungry after a late evening and wanted a quick bite.  I just wanted to nibble on something.  I ordered the cheesy fries.  They looked like a glob of orange.  The fries at least were thin and crisp but other than that....I really don't know what to say.  I had a bite of my friend's burger.  It was lackluster to say the least.  It was empty when we were there so not sure if that is indicative of anything of not.  I'll keep walking by next time I see it, I guess burgers and me just don't mix."}
{"text":"Customer service was friendly, burgers were decent except for the gease. But overall, what bothered me the most was how dirty thus place is. Decent the fact the customers has lessen. Good burgers but unclean. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"The Burger's Priest is a completely unpretentious, no nonscene, grassroots burger \"hut\" (it's hard calling this a restaurant when it doesn't really have a table and only 4 or 5 stools). Regardless they know their meat and they damn well know how to make a mean burger. With only two real menu items - a beef patty, and their amazing \"priest\" (read: vegetarian) patty -  and about a few other sides, you know they're focusing and making sure they do burgers justice.  I've been losing interest in hamburgers over the years and when my friends (notably Payam Z. ) wanted to drag us around to have a burger near the beaches, I wasn't all too excited. But damn am I glad that I went along and became witness to what really puts ALL other burger places in Toronto to shame!!  I'll let you read through others who are much more capable then me describe about how amazing this place is and how down to earth the staff are, but I guarantee you, you will not regret your stop here if you're looking for a good burger!"}
{"text":"We tried the 'What's Right' combo (double cheese burger, chilli cheese fries, drink and cookie),the Vatican burger, the banana shake, chocolate shake, vanilla malt shake and the grape drink. Total $51 roughly. The price is a bit steep for a burger and fries joint, but... it is the novelty that your paying for and not just the food quality. I can safely say the Vatican burger was amazing and very filling, we split the chilli cheese fries between 2 people and had leftovers. Our 1 year old niece throughly seemed to enjoy the cookie lol. In all it's was a nice experience with good food in a clean environment. We shall be returning to try items on their 'not so secret' menu. Minus 1 star - They never gave us the drink with our combo, nor tell me where to grab it...noticed only after writing the review. Not impressed, but certainly not a factor in us returning, things happen."}
{"text":"Best burgers I've had in the city.  Burger priest now in etobicoke. Packed and obviously very successful, didn't take long. A line at 10 pm on a Thursday. Inside it's very loud, fortunately there is always outside."}
{"text":"Tried quite a few burgers in Toronto, this has been the best.  I completely avoid during peak / busy periods.  Shop is incredibly small and packed.  Regardless of the five stars, it's a must avoid then. Fantastic burgers and fries.  A+"}
{"text":"Lot of expansion for burger priest. Great to see it in the West. Tough to have mediocre burgers after being here.."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time today...and after reading all the reviews, I was expecting a pretty fantastic burger...I left a bit disappointed.  I ordered a regular burger - it tasted good - like real meat, but wasn't particularly worth raving about.  I prefer the fancy burger joint closer to my house to heading out this way.  The line up was long - my bf had the priest burger - also just ok.  PS it's cash only (I order heard some guy come out ask his girl for cash)."}
{"text":"I believe this is the original location of burger's priest.  The first few times I can here I wasn't particularly overwhelmed.  Then I discovered the Option!  The option is comprised of 2 portobello mushroom caps stuffed with cheese and panko crusted into a patty of sorts and deep fried.  It's delish.  They ask you how you want it dressed.  I get everything.  They recently opened a location in Vaughan which I also tried.  Driving out this way for this seems a bit anti-climatic because there is super limited in terms of seating so the dining experience is a bit sub par.  I don't consider sitting on the sidewalk next to the neighbourhood bums to enjoy my burger a supreme dining experience.  However the burgers are good.  The Vaughan location has seating...the neighbourhood bums here are just people who work and live in the area, and aren't really bums at all...  *somehow my review for the queen street location got moved the vaughan location*  They are both tasty."}
{"text":"Burger's Priest has been blogged about and reviewed as the best burger in Toronto - but don't buy into the hype.  Burger's Priest is located on a lonely strip of Queen Street - it is easy to find because the line up usually goes out the door.  The menu is pretty basic, about half a dozen different burger choices, fries and an awesome selection of pop.  I have had the basic burger twice and both times was underwhelmed.  The quality of the meat is good, but it lacks flavour/spice and is pretty greasy (even by burger standards).  The fries were good, but not excellent.  Seating inside the restaurant is extremely limited, so you are expected to take your food to go.  I guess for all the hype, the cost ($12+ for burger, fries and drink) and the wait - I was expecting something better than a mediocre burger.  If I was in the area, hungry and there wasn't a line, I would eat there again - but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"I heard some good comments and reviews for this place. If not mistaken, I believe this is a chained restaurant and this location is the second one in Mississauga. However, I have to say that I am very disappointed by this visit.   There are so many burger restaurants around. Most of the time, I have to be very careful when I order the burger because they usually come with big portions. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. As the photos I took, the buns and the meat patties are so small compared the premium price I paid for.   I meant there is no much to say about. The waiting time is about 10-15 mins for the burgers. For the taste compared to its price, I rather buy a burger from McDonald's or KFC. Yea, it is very disappointing. I really want to give a 1-star rating but I do care to give an opportunity for a newly opened business. I will try this place again in another few months. Hopefully, they will make some improvements to the operations AND, on the quality of the burgers which are pretty much the only primary food they are proud of here."}
{"text":"I went to Burger's Priest about two weeks ago and I received 42 napkins with my order. I put the napkins into my backpack without much thought, but slowly over the next couple weeks I began to appreciate Burger Priest's great napkin service.   Spilled ketchup on my pants? No worries, I have napkins. Knocked over my water bottle? No problem, I have napkins. At another restaurant, \"I brought my own napkins, thank you\"  These past two week have really opened my eyes to having spare napkins with me at all times. Thank you Burger's Priest.  Oh yeah, I got the portobello mushroom burger and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ohhhh myyyyy loooorrrddd. This is the best burger I have ever had. Seriously. A burger is a burger - it can usually taste good regardless. But this is heavenly (see what I did there???).   First of all, don't go here hoping to grab a cozy seat and chat with friends inside. Take it and GO. It gets super duper busy, the lineup during the weekends/dinner/lunch time is all the way around and past the next door convenience store. I had THE PRIEST. It's a cheeseburger PLUS the option.  The option is this magnificent something...portobello mushrooms, with oozing cheese, breaded and deep fried. I felt an artery clog just from writing that and I would do it all over again. And then of course there's the meat - I'm pretty sure they just use some kind of secret, ground up beef sprinkled with angel dust...  The bun is kind of small so it's messy in the best kind of way. There were around 5 people working behind this tiny counter and they were fast and friendly.  There is a secret menu. Google it because I don't know how secret it is and I am NOT ready to get kick off of yelp OR kicked out of B.P. for revealing it. It shouldn't be hard to find, I think it's on their Facebook page. Yeah, I'm a fan.  I didn't get the fries because fries are fries, it ain't no gooey portobello mushroom concoction.   GO HERE! GO GO GO GO! In my option THIS IS THE BEST BURGER JOINT IN TORONTO. And then go to the beaches, cuz I love it there :)  xoxo"}
{"text":"This place serves a wonderful, greasy burger; however, the people working the counter give you the idea that you are just bothering them by being there.  I would definitely eat there again.  But this time, I would be prepared for the attitude."}
{"text":"The chairs in the restaurant look like stools, so they have no backing. This is very uncomfortable. The burgers were good, the fries were not. The kitchen staff all had face earrings and tattoos. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Really great experience here. Our first time, so we appreciated their patience.  Especially as the line grew.  Tried the Vatican which is a double geese burger sandwiched between two grilled cheese sandwiches.  Yum!  Also tried the \"option\" which is a delicious pocket of cheese hidden in a much room capsule and breaded and deep fried.  Yum!  Fries were okay.  They were all tiny - not in quantity or total amount, but literally short fries.  No salt.  Sodas by the can, but no place to recycle.   Better than most US similar burger joints.  Most similar to shake shack from a burger perspective.  Can't compare to other Canadian places - since it's my first place above the border."}
{"text":"Really bad at making their mistakes right. Experience left me hungry and annoyed.   Ordered for pick up via Just Eat, app told me it'd be ready in 25 mins. Got there after 30 mins and the restaurant hadn't even put my order in the queue yet.  Instead of making my food immediately to make things right, they told me my order would be behind others and be 25-40 mins more.   Who waits over an hour for a burger and fries?! I cancelled and went got a faster meal elsewhere.   Being busy is one thing, but make customer's issues a priority to resolve for crying out loud!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best burger places in gta. The service can be fast or slow depending on the day and time you come, but I feel like it's worth the wait. If you want to skip the line just come before the lunch hour or after - I guarantee you won't have to wait 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Very happy with the service this time around. It took them less than 5 min to get everything ready. The quality of food is great (as always). I got double pruned and my bf got California classic. Both very very juicy and delicious. Amazing fries as well! Yum!"}
{"text":"As great as the concept is, the burgers are not fresh and overly greasy. The novelty will wear off soon if the quality of the food doesn't improve. Even the buns were unsatisfying."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for lunch today...double bacon cheeseburgers and fries. Absolutely delicious....and even at $30 with an order of fries and pop, worth it. Hot, fresh and seasoned perfectly...one of the best burgers I've ever had. And we topped it off with two fresh chocolate chip cookies to gild the lily."}
{"text":"These burgers are \"last meal\" good. Meaning, if I was on death row, I would request one of these as a last meal."}
{"text":"Made the drive out to the Queen location to finally try a burger here.  Tiny place, barely room for people to line up, order and wait for their food, and there was a line up when I got there at 330pm.  Ordered a bacon double cheese with fries.  Wanted a shake but they don't have them here.  Took about 10 minutes for my burger as place was real busy.  When I got my food it all became worth it.  Burger was steaming hot, cheese oozing out the sides, generous piece of bacon hanging out.  Perfect size for me, was able to finish the burger and most of the fries without being stuffed.  Burger cooked perfectly, nice and juicy.  Def will come again.  Excellent burger.  Next time will try the chili cheese fries.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"If Jesus made your burger this is what it would taste like.  I have a very strong frame of reference when it comes to burgers.    I am from Northeast Ohio, home of Akron's Swenson's and Skyway Drive-Ins,  Whitey's in Richfield and there is a Sonic Drive-In located in my town.   I have had Culver's throughout the US Midwest and I have had In-N-Out Burger in Southern California and Las Vegas as well.   But The Burger's Priest was about the best burger I ever had in a long time.     The burger was very juicy, consistent and the ingredients were top notch.    And the fries stacked up to their burgers well, places like In-N-Out, Sonic and many others have fries that pale to their burgers.       The downside to this particular location is that they did not serve milkshakes at the time I was there I do not know if this had changed.   This alone cost them a 5-star rating from me.    Seating is very limited here, I ate at a counter facing the wall, but I did not care, they burger was simply too d**m good."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Look on the website for the secret menu for extra items that aren't in the regular menu.  Gotta have the cherry cola with the burger and fries."}
{"text":"The vibe: busy busy burger joint! Small, fast food chain. Limited seating.   The food: this is the best burger in the city if you're craving a classic, fast food style, all American burger. Don't expect gourmet. Haters of this place or those who thought it doesn't live up the hype just don't get it. They just don't. The burger melts in your mouth. Even though it's filling, it leaves you wanting more. And more.  My go to meal: the double. Double cheese, double patty, baby. Mmmm.   Secret: ask for dipping sauce for your fries! It's a delight!"}
{"text":"Burger's Priest is finally this side of Yonge, and it's just as good as the original. For those first timers, be sure to get acquainted with the not-so-secret \"secret\" menu available on BP's website. The options here might cost you a little more than the advertised menu, but it certainly makes for a more gluttonous experience. I recommend Jarge-style on pretty much anything, it adds a tasty mustard sauce cooked into the patty as well as some delightful fried onions.   The shakes are good, albeit a little pricey. I'm a fan of the Riggs & Murtaugh, more for the cultural reference to a certain long running buddy-buddy cop series.   Now be warned, you will likely wait if you come anytime during the lunch rush, which kicks off just after 11:30 during the weekdays regardless of the weather. So be sure to come early, and if that's not a possibility, bring a book or some good conversation partners. One thing to keep in mind, it's well worth it, these are the best burgers I've had in the city.   The staff here are efficient and friendly and it's cash only, but an ABM is located by the washrooms, also several banks just around the corner.   It's a pilgrimage every burger lover should make and many thanks to the BP folks for making it that much easier for us western folks."}
{"text":"I have known about the burger's priest from a TV show long time before I came to Toronto.. I was looking forward to having it very much but it really disappointed me.   I went there at one February afternoon and ordered the priest. It was so small but still cost more than$10. The burger was too greasy and I had to add more ketchup to make it taste better.. Btw, the cheese inside was great and stuff were all very nice.  Maybe I expect too much but I still think there are more tasty burgers in To."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. If you're a burger fan, then this is your place. The burgers are a bit smaller than at some places, but the flavor and quality is a 10/10. And I'm a huge burger fan and have tried most of the burger joints around.    oh, BTW, There are biblical verses about Noah's Arc written on the walls and there's some sort of secret menu that they don't advertise unless you answer a riddle on their website.     Yes... very weird indeed."}
{"text":"4.5 / 5  The Burger's Priest is a fantastic cheeseburger joint, only second to Holy Chuck (at least from the burger places I've tried so far anyhow).  Before I get into the food quality, let me just make it clear that this is certainly not the sort of place you'd want to go if you expect short lines, adequate seating, or just space to move and breathe in general.  And this issue doesn't only stem from the fact that the restaurant is small, but also because it's just an extremely popular place and there's constantly a huge lineup even at obscure hours that you wouldn't expect to be busy.  My two friends and I went on a day where it was raining, and yet there was still a huge lineup going all the way outside and (obviously) no space to sit inside.  This is definitely not a place you'd bring a girlfriend/boyfriend or anyone else very special to you.  Now that that's out of the way, we can get on to the aspects that redeem the aforementioned missteps, which would be pretty much everything else.  The service, food, and prices were all good.  The employees were friendly, the food was prepared fairly quickly despite the long lines, and the final price was actually not as much as I expected.  I had a friend who said he went here and was upset with having to spend a whopping $28, but my final bill for the pope burger plus fries and a drink was around $18, so I was glad to see that the prices weren't ridiculous.  The burger itself was fantastic.  The patty was extremely juicy, had a good texture and just screamed quality overall.  The veggie patty known as \"the option\" was probably even better, oozing with cheese as you bite into it.  The toppings were also fresh as was the bun.  Taste wise, this place is not quite as good as Holy Chuck but it's extremely close.  One area where the burger's priest didn't really shine though was the fries, Holy Chuck easily has the priest beat in this category.  However my friend tried out the chili fries and said they were great so maybe it's just the regular fries that are somewhat bland.  Overall this place is great and I'd recommend it to anyone patient enough to wait in a long line and have to go somewhere else to find a place to sit down and eat your meal.  However, if you're able to travel, Holy Chuck is a better option than this place, so go there instead."}
{"text":"A burger that put me in a foodcoma; double grilled cheese buns and a deliciously juicy patty. I was in the middle of a beach volleyball tournament and didn't think I would be able to make it back on the court.  Juicy, beefy, greasy and oh! so satisfying. What more is there to say? This is as good as it gets, a burger above others. The fries are also done right; fresh, crispy and lightly salted.  This is burger nirvana! =)"}
{"text":"The burgers were average, the fries were great.  The atmosphere was awful!  Small tables, super loud music.  I wanted dinner not a club atmosphere.  I'd eat there again but it definitely would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Massively overpriced and overhyped.   Got a shiitake mushroom burger. It was tiny, excessively greasy and overpriced!! Avoid."}
{"text":"I had the Option, and I have to say it was definitely something different than what Ive had before at other hamburger joints.  If your looking for a heart stopping burger, this is the place to go. Such a massive, yet small looking burger. Definitely left me full in the end.  Jam packed with cheese, and seasoned with pepper, is all I tasted to be honest, and a hint of the actual meat.  The fries were great. It's pretty much the same fries from McDonalds, but these are obviously cut fresh and taste great!  Honestly, try it out if you want something more than your ordinary burger!"}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers but I tried my first veggie burger here and it was amazing! There service was great, fast & very friendly!   I reccomnd It to anyone who wants a quick bite on Queen west!"}
{"text":"I came and waited outside to exchange money (US to Canadian dollars) for about 15 minutes, and by the time I walked in, they had ran out of burgers- what!?!  That totally sucked.  If you come here, make sure you come earlier because they run out of meat.  I did get the \"the Option\" though and my goodness, AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am SOOO glad I got this and if I come back again, I would totally get this again versus the beef burger probably.  It was portentous that the beef burger ran out.  It was a portobello mushroom stuffed with cheddar cheese, covered in panko bread crumbs, and deep fried.  That first bite, when the cheese melts with the crunchy breading was delicious.  The portobello mushroom actually was meaty and almost tasted like beef.  My only complaint is that on one side of the patty, the cheese wasn't melted and tasted a bit cold.  But in general, amazing goodness.  If you come here to get a burger, definitely consider \"the Option.\"  It's amazing."}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is good. It's not fancy. The burger choices are pretty standard fare. They use regular-ass white buns and processed cheese. The place is tiny. So damn tiny. There are 3-4 bar seats set up against a wall, and there are signs that say, \"You can't actually eat in here, this area is just for waiting.\" And it's still so damn good. You need to eat here."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about \"The Burger Priest\". One of their many locations was the one in Vaughan. We were in the area so decided to come here for dinner. As per fellow yelpers recommendations, I went for:  The Vatican City Burger (Double Cheeseburger Squeezed between Two Grilled Cheese Buns) Wow the buns were like 2 soft fluffy grilled cheese pillows, with the burger beef nestled in between them. Of course not the healthiest of burger, but heck I came all the way to Vaughan, I might as well go all out. It was delicious, moist meat and all the works too.   Chili Cheese Fries & Plain Fries. Their fries certainly taste different, and I'm guessing it's the oil they use. Nice crisp and has a certain yellow tint to their fries. Chili fries was loaded wth beans, grounded beef and tons of cheese on top! It was very good!  Mint Chocolate Chip Shake Nice thick consistency and was quite tasty as well. Only thing was it was so thick couldn't really suck it through the straw. Wish they had thicker straws.  My husband's order: Red Sea (Cheeseburger with Chili on Top) He said it was ok, but said the burger fell apart on him. But I think it's inevitable when it's like a sloppy joe filling.   Grape Cremesicle He didn't really like the combination of the two. Said it tasted weird.  Overall, I enjoyed it and would probably come back with some friends to try other burgers of theirs."}
{"text":"Tough to swallow the whole premium hamburger notion, in a place that looks as clean as a TTC subway.   Actually,  the subway station isn't littered with crumbs of hamburger patty bits and paper straw wrappers.   Clean up your act BP.    That said, the burgers are good.   They're cooked on a flat top so they are a little greasier than places that char grill.  \"Grease is Good\" (spoken in your best Gordon Gekko imitation )"}
{"text":"there was grease everywhere, I like greasy burgers but not a greasy pot!"}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good.  Filling, tasty and a lot of options to choose from.  I'm a huge cheese fan, so I tried the burger sandwiched between two grilled cheeses (can't remember the name).  It was awesome.  But definitely something I'd only get for a treat because it's SO greasy.  I would skip on the fries as they were soggy and gross.  Tasted like the oil hadn't been changed for awhile.    Overall I would come back here if I was looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"It's good...I just have heart burn after eating the....I don't know what it was but it was a cheeseburger with the option.  I've had it when I got home previously so it was nice.  Today I had it fresh there and maybe that's the difference.  The cheese got all melty and it was too greasy.  It didn't help the bun was soggy towards the end...  But....I can't help it...hours after I felt full to my stomach and heartburn, i cant' stop thinking about their burger.  Two combos set me back $30.25.  Not cheap by any means....I tried to tell myself that comign here was a better option than going to burger king or anywhere with frozen patties...I need to get a loan before I come here again though...steeep!"}
{"text":"Ok I finally bit, I'd heard alot about this place and I was kind of hesitant to try it based on some of the bad vibes some people have mentioned (poor customer service) being the big one.  The bench that people talk about in front of the place is not there today.  Does that mean the owner doesn't even want people eating their food close to the premises?  He wants to put as much space between the store and the customers?!  I heard this place was cramped but that was an over estimation.  When we got there, the line did not snake out of the resaurant which was good.  But, when I got inside I notice a sign \"Waiting area only, do not consume food on premises\"  Geez, why even bother having a little counter there at all.  Might as well take that down too.  We ordered a cheese burger, and two priests, two fries and one drink.  A combo is not really a discount, I say this because when I asked for the price diff between our three burgers, two fries and then add a drink it was a dollar or more difference.  Don't be fooled into thinking there is a special combo price, there isn't.  Not only that, they don't even give you a receipt and i forgot to ask.    I seriously felt as though I was in an episode of seinfeld in the soup kitchen.  I was afraid to make eye contact with staff.    There was a plate of money by the cash which sort of resembled the cash tray at church but I'm not sure because I'm not catholic or christian.  Would make it easy for anyone to take some money and use it on their order.  Are we expected to tip massive amounts (there were a couple of fives in there) for mediocre burgers?  The cheese in the option was real cheddar, but the cheese on teh cheeseburger was most likely a slice of kraft single, would have expected real cheddar cheese for that price.  All in all it was an hour of our time at this place, bout 15 mins to order and another 20 mins to get our food and then eating time.  After we ordered, the line went out the door.  It's not THAT good to warrant such waiting times.  Truth be told, I find the religious stuff really 'IN YOUR FACE'.  There are no pictures of the food, I shudder to think what it's like for people who havent' read about the menu online and inquire about the menu in person amidst the massive line ups.  A newspaper article painted the owner as some kind of person that has 'suffered for his life work' in food.  Really he is a #($$ I say this because I was talking to someone whose friend owns a gym which the owner went to, he was really disrespectful, using foul language on the phone.  Mind you, when he was asked not to use disrespecting language in the gym, he stormed out.  Few days later he apparently apologized for his behavior after realizing there was no comparable gym in the area.  It may be some kind of legend, but I believe it based on the cocky attitude of the place and it's website.  Sort of a \"holier than thou\" attitude.  Customers are what keep you in business, treat them with respect or they'll cast you away when another new burger joint arrives (at this rate it won't be long)    It's a novelty at best but we wouldn't go out of our way for this place."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER EVER!  Very small little burger joint that can deliver the goods. This place is ridiculously packed with people the moment it is open but that burger is definitely worth the wait.  They got the regular burger, cheese burger, and their signature burger the Priest Burger which is a must get item. The patties on the burger is so rich and packed with flavor and juice. The weight of the burger is also ridiculous, those people on a diet don't come here unless it's your cheat day, even then you might regret it b/c you'll automatically gain 5lbs easily.  Their burgers range from $7-$10 plus tax of course, normally I don't justify paying that much for a burger but it is so DAMN good, destroys any burger that I've ever had in the States.   If you had to choose only one burger to get, get their signature Priest Burger. The reason being is b/c of that deep fried cheesy portabello mushroom that they add. The juice that comes out of that burger with the cheese just dripping off of that deep fried mushroom, is just amazing.  The moment you bite into it is just OH YEAH.  Item to definitely get  - Priest Burger"}
{"text":"Frites fraiches incroyables. Je sais qu'ici le burger est roi mais ce sont les frites qui m'ont marquée. Il faut les prendre à part, mais ça vaut le coup (3,5$ HT), vraiment ! Ils ont un bun sans gluten (!!) -oui, je suis heureuse ici. Je crois qu'il y avait un supplement quand même, en tout cas TTC je m'en suis sortie pour un peu plus de 8$ pour un cheeseburger sans gluten. Qui était bon. Pas fou, mais bon. Le pain avait bon goût, ne tenait pas très bien certes mais GF oblige.  Après, si vous voulez faire les choses à fond, ils ont des burgers bien plus fat, bien plus gros mais pas plus de choix que ça. On peut rajouter l'\"Option\", une sorte de galette dégoulinante de fromage avec un champignon, le tout frit, ou prendre la version double, ou les deux ensemble.   Côté déco, pas de croix partout, non c'est plutôt sobre et classique. A noter, il y a une machine pour retirer de l'argent au sein du restaurant, mais qui facture le retrait (malin). Du coup je suppose qu'il n'accepte pas les cartes.."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries were good. The fries were a little too salty for my liking but they had a lot of good flavour and crisp to them. The burgers were good, nothing to write home about. The menu is nothing spectacular. I felt many way better options downtown for a solid burger and fries meal - especially for the money."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom because she wanted a burger before Derby practice, and it was nearby. Plus she had mentioned it before. I have been trying to find a good veggie burger, and most are passable but not very good.  It must be said that Burger's Priest has probably the best veggie burger I have had in my 10 odd years without meat.  Nice soft bun, good quality toppings (all the basics), but the 'patty' was absolutely amazing, deep fried portobello stuffed with cheese? yes. please. I took a bite and cheese exploded out the other side of the burger, I was able to take it and wrap it around the remaining burger twice and there was still plenty inside. It was ridiculous. and so incredibly good. the fries were pleasantly crispy and a decent amount, I left absolutely stuffed. The place itself doesn't have much seating (about 6 stools facing a wall) so it's probably best to grab and go, but as the weather is getting nicer just eat outside somewhere."}
{"text":"Reallllly good burgers here. Probably the best Toronto based burger chain."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Very greasy but if you wanted to eat health the. You would go to Freshii and not here.  Service is always good, Straight forward right to the point.  I'm not sure how I feel about the high counters, they seem a bit uninviting. But I'm not there to socialize with the staff. I'm just there to get greasy burger and hate myself after. Lol."}
{"text":"My favourite burger in the world!  I think it depends what kind of burger you're into, to say this place is a 5. To me it's the best because the burger is so juicy and the bun that they use is soft and tasty. When I bite into it, its heaven.   It is a bit greasy and Holy Chuck is the closest burger I can think of, but I prefer this burger place.   The only thing I wish is that they are bigger in portion and that if they can be a bit less pricey.   The first place I've been  to is the one by the Beaches, I believe. That place had long line up, down the street already. I want to go back here again!"}
{"text":"Don't get the hype. 1st visit I shared a Vatican burger... Just ridiculous & beyond greedy. But to be fair we expected that. 2nd time I had a simple cheese burger.... Meh.  Too greasy and uninspired. Much better burgers within walking distance."}
{"text":"Even though I'm not big on burgers, this place rocks. Have been here twice. First time I got the California burger, second time the Red Sea. Both were really good. My problem is I took my food home to eat because the seating is so limited. By the time I got home, my burgers were a little soggy but still so good. I want to try the Option after reading Faye C.'s review. Next time I'll wait for a table."}
{"text":"I caved on Saturday night, and my boyfriend picked us up a cheese burger & fries from this place. He'd be moaning for his Burger Priest fix.   I was so disappointed. The burger itself, had no flavour.  I must admit though, when my bf had shoved this burger in my mouth times before for a bite, it tasted good. This time however, it just wasn't happening. I ended up squirting a big pile of ketchup on my plate, so I could dip it, just for some flavour. Not a good sign.   And the fries were a messy mushy mess. They were barely cooked.  And I thew them ALL OUT.  The burger was greasy, if that's what everyone is referring to when they mention the words, 'moist', 'juicy' ..   Two thumbs down. I won't be driving out to that end of the city for this."}
{"text":"This place opened up earlier this year and having been to the other location on Yonge St. I had to check this place out. The burgers are amazing and I always get the poutine fries and the shake to go with my burger. The hamburgers are home made and very tasty.  Price wise for burgers it is on the high side but when asking for great tasting food you should expect to pay higher."}
{"text":"Just kind of okay, really. No avocado, no pineapple, just greasy massive cheesy burgers. Burgers are fine, but nothing incredible.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you are a burger completionist in need of trying everything."}
{"text":"After walking by this place time and time again I finally made my way through the front door and Indulged in one of those sacred burgers Saturday afternoon. I came here around 11:30AM Saturday while trying to get a burger fix for my friend and found myself drooling over the menu and also getting one myself (I ate like a disgusting animal on Saturday). The menu here offers an array of different burgers and chicken sandwiches with plenty of toppings and specialties to please even the most picky burger lover. I ordered something that was called the Red Sea. The Red Sea is a cheeseburger topped with there own homemade chili! Now this burger is by no means neat, in fact, it fell apart all over my hands but that's kind of what happens when you have chili on a burger, eh? I absolutely loved the burger and it packed quite a filling punch at that. Overall, this place is probably the best bet for a delicious burger on Queen St West and maybe even the whole city, you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"burgers. perfect burgers. no bs toppings, no fancypants, nothing. just burgers. done right."}
{"text":"Great burgers, probably one of my favourite burger joints.  Love their \"option\" as it's different and tasty. Service was a little slow at this location but to be expected since they make everything to order."}
{"text":"Tried just the regular single patty cheeseburger and fries as it was my first time visiting this place. I was looking forward to trying it out after hearing so many good things about the restaurant. Average burger, not bad fries. Nothing special and very expensive. The cheese on the burger was just the typical Kraft singles. I didn't try any other items from the menu. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great patties, simple fresh ground meat!  Buns and cheese are pretty generic but don't take away from the magic of the patty.  This place is small and seems to have a large following."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has one hell of a burger! It was flavorful and juicy. With lots of different menu items, I look forward to return visits."}
{"text":"Wow.  The hype surrounding this modest little place is a spectacular feat in its own. On  a Friday night at dinnertime, on a pretty out-of-the-way Queen Street strip, the lineup was well out the door. It took about 25 minutes just to order! The energy was lively and friendly in line, and  I must say, my expectations were mighty high.   It is rare that I indulge in a burger. 95% of the time I opt for veggie burgers over beef, but I thought this special excursion East warranted a classic burger experience. I got the cheeseburger topped with \"the Option\", a deep fried, cheese filled, garlic-y crispy mushroom.   There is no seating so we, along with many others, sat street-side on a cold bench. As I dug into the burger, the three words \"oh my god\" were uttered more than a few times.   Is it worth the hype? I'd say yes. It was very very fresh, juicy and absolutely delicious. But at the end of the day, anything deep-fried and cheese-filled is going to taste good. Nothing revolutionary.   The fries were so-so.   I'm very curious to go back and try \"the smoke\", a \"secret\" option of topping the burger with a deep fried jalapeno I believe.  Oh man. Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"So yes, it's a delicious - if expensive - burger. But honestly, a somewhat disappointing experience: - Cash only - really? Why?? There is an ATM, but as another reviewer mentioned, who likes to pay $2 on top of what you're already spending. I work in the area, and pretty much every lunch spot takes at least Interac, if not Visa. Not cool, BP, not cool.  - Kind of hectic vibe, and tables are not cleaned between customers, which is kind of gross.  - NO recycling. C'mon, if you're hipster enough that you can't have Visa/Interac, surely you must be down with recycling. Big turn off."}
{"text":"Pretty good! :) My husband says it's the best one of the franchises. This location!  I get \"the option\" and it's always on point. . . Cheesy, crunchy deliciousness!  He always gets the beef. . . And says \"it has real cow taste\" (whatever that means) but meatlovers seem to understand!  It's our go to. . . .\"don't wanna cook tonight\""}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I want to order this and eat it every day forever and ever. I can't speak to the meat burgers, but the vegetarian fried mushroom (\"The Option\") is divine. It is the most delicious veggie burger I've ever had, and that \"secret sauce\" is something else. Also, the fries are enormous and delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about this meal. Plus, they finally take cards now! So no cash on hand? No problem!"}
{"text":"I have visited Toronto two times in 2014 and both times I have visited The burger's priest and both times for the same reason....the Vatican City.   The Vatican City is a double cheeseburger, cooked on a griddle perfectly.  The double cheeseburger is then sandwiched between two grilled cheese sandwiches.  The grilled cheese sandwiches seem to be made from 2 bottom hamburger buns because the burger fit perfectly.    The burger is juicy, cheesey, and surpsiing not as messy as one would expect.  Additionally, their fries are pretty good, although I wouldn't come here for them.  Anytime I am in Toronto, I will be sure to come here."}
{"text":"BACON CHEESEBURGER Really delicious and fresh-tasting. That patty is as fresh as it gets (I saw the raw patties in a tray behind the counter...and boy oh boy, that patty was a gorgeous pink). Juicy meat with minimum grease. I do feel like the burgers are a bit small for the price. I needed have gotten a double patty in order to be full (and that would have made my burger alone close to $10!).  CHILI CHEESE FRIES I really liked the chili cheese fries here. Packed full of flavour and the portion is pretty good. They smother it in cheese, which is always welcomed.   REGULAR FRIES Meh. Not very crispy. Not too special.   TOPPINGS FOR YOUR BURGERS: - ketchup - mustard - mayo - lettuce - tomato - onion - pickles  RANDOM TIP There is a liquor store right next to the Priest. Get your burger to go, grab a tall can from the cooler and head over to Woodbine Park to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!! Busy place but worth the wait for fresh food.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I won't go on as some have about this highly hailed burger haven, but I will say that the burgers are quite good here. I like but don't think gourmet of the buns which most closely resemble Wonder bread, but the beef is flavorful and juicy, the soda selection is above average and the wait time isn't as crazy as The Beaches location is during summer hours. Good fries, great burger."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! CASH ONLY!  CASH ONLY!  No debit or credit available but an on site ATM is available  A solid 4 stars for me. went here with my buddy LC and we both ordered the priest ($9.99), fries ($3.99 i think) and a can of pop ($1.29). we were lucky enough to get there by 11:55, and were able to sit in their limited eating area.   the burger was cooked perfectly and was seasoned right. the option was crunchy and was oozing with cheese on every bite.   the fries though were MEH - one less star. I would skip the fries as they really did nothing for me. I'd rather go to McDonalds or the KFC beside this joint for fries.   POP was just the standard pepsi / diet pepsi fare. got a diet mountain dew  WILL BE BACK -- just for the burger. Skip the fries and call it a day.   check the photos as I uploaded some pictures of my meal as well"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I got the Vatican burger, the chilli cheese fries and the strawberry milkshake. My boyfriend ordered the orangesicle milkshake and the double bacon cheese burger. We both loved it. If you love grilled cheese I recommend the vatican. It's delicious, the bread was golden brown and very cheesy. It has two patties but I wished I just got one because it was so big it was hard to eat since I don't like getting my hands dirty. The chilli cheese fries were the best I ever tried and trust me I order chilli cheese fries everywhere. Even though in the end I felt like complete poo, I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"You know, there are so many gourmet burger joints in TO, it's hard to say why you should go here because it's a take out joint.   There's a counter that seats 4 people and is usually crowded, you'll end up eating in your car because it's too cold to eat outside. Not a date place or a group thing.  The burger is great. it's not a giant sloppy mess, it's tasty, juicy and their lettuce and tomato are restaurant grade. So it's got that fresh, from an organic farm taste and color.   Their chili cheese fries are delicious! This thing can be a meal itself. As an american that's not okay... But this is the land of poutine! It's pretty filling, don't recommend planning to eat it all if you're health concious or a girl.  Overall, it's a good place but it being a take out joint was a disappointment."}
{"text":"The smell outside was amazing and the taste delicious. I think the church theme is cute, complete with offering plate for tips. It was quite evident the ingredients were fresh. When I go to normal fast food restaurants, it is out of desperation, and I usually have to force myself to eat the food. Conversely, this was fast and fresh. An enjoyable meal that I wanted to eat. And yet, the cost to portion situation is lacking.  I don't have a large appetite at all. I almost always have to take food home from restaurants. Yet, I just made my inaugural visit to Burger Priest, and while I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, I am still hungry. I just ordered a regular cheeseburger and a strawberry milkshake. The regular cheeseburger is supposed to be 4 oz, but perhaps that's before it's cooked?  They warned us that the burgers weren't that big and if hungry, we should probably get a double. I didn't feel that hungry at the time of ordering; in fact, I may actually be more hungry now than I perceived myself to be then if that's possible. Personally, I'm a fan of the small burger. In its compact form of thinly sliced beef when added to a nice bun, cheese, and ample toppings, the burger is culinary fung shui. That fung shui is easily thrown off by things like adding an extra patty. It throws off the meat to toppings ratio. Also of note, they put lettuce and tomato on against my wishes, and after taking them off, the amount of pickles and onion felt sad and insufficient. But back to the main rant... The humble cheeseburger is delicious but small, yet still manages to be $6! It's $4.50 for quite a small shake.   Together, hubby and I had a cheeseburger, double bacon burger, chili cheese fries, a canned Coke, and 2 shakes, which cost $35. Yes, food is expensive here, and we could have basically eaten at The Works for that. The quality of the meat is likely not as good as at this place, but I would be full.  Updated: I have since discovered the Option. I was hesitant initially because it sounded like it would be too much food and it is fried, but eventually decided to give it a try so I could come here for more than a snack.... Plus portions seem to run on the small size. The Option is cheesy goodness sandwiched between portobello mushrooms with a fried exterior. I can now come here and dine happily for about $8+HST.  Oh, you should also know that while the burgers themselves are epic, the fries and shakes are nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Came opening day and it never disappoints just as good as the Queen east location but a lot closet to home!  Which may not be a good thing as I will be here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the fact that they are here in Mississauga now, and they have debit now! These are by far my favourite old school burgers, if you want charbroiled you hot the wrong place but if you want amazing tasting and fun secret menu items this place has it. Just make sure you try a Vatican City with Smoke Jargen Style once in your life, and the next day run for at least an hour!"}
{"text":"Ordered for takeout and they forgot one of my listed items which was my beverage. Never ordering from them again. Make sure to check your order when delivered!"}
{"text":"Pretty average. Don't see what all the hype is about.  Not a bad burger, but the space is tiny, people pushy and overall inferior experience. Had much better beef and burgers in regular restaurants around Toronto. Not cheap either and the 'cash only' policy is really a pain in the back side."}
{"text":"The third location of this chain, out on the Queensway, is on the same level as the other two stores. Everything is fantastic! For those who have never been to any of the locations, you have not lived! I tell everyone that you aren't a true Torontonian until you've had a Burger's Priest burger!  The experience at this location was with a friend of mine who had never been to this chain before. She was very impressed with the quality of the burger as well as the juicy-ness of it. Their fries (which I've always found to be their weak spot) were golden and crispy and this time I had no concerns.  Overall, what stands this location out from the others was the amount of seating available. This location has about 20 tables and even though there were a lot of people dining on this particular day, there were still empty tables.  As always, if you have never tried this place, you are missing out. Become a 'true Torontonian' today!"}
{"text":"The burger's priest resides where George's chicken used to. The new owners have definitly cleaned up this tiny hole in the wall with a minimalistic style. Being as tiny as it is there is little to no seating but this does not make a bad burger. I decided to take on the their signature 'Priest Burger' which is their small batch ground and seasoned cheese burger cooked 'Merican style on a flattop topped with their vege-burger (a portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese, rolled in panko bread crumbs and deep-fried).  The burger meat was delicious and savory. The portobello I could leave but that may have been that it wasn't cooked all the way through and had a cold clump of cheese in the middle.  Next time I'm in I think I will simply have their cheese burger and fries combo as it would be more than sufficient and I hear their fries and superb."}
{"text":"Must Try! Tasty burgers, huge line ups @ lunch time, but worth the wait.  I tried Veggie burger from their Secret menu (which is not displayed at the restaurant but accessible online) \"Religious Hypocrite\" is a Veggie burger with bacon!  Crispy, Scrumptious! Loved every bite of it!"}
{"text":"Omg. So F*cking good. Made me a Believer! (Bwahah had to.. the place is full of religious puns). I never order burgers when I go out..but I saw this place on Yelp when planning my T.O trip and the pics of cheese melting out of everything made me wanna check it out. It gets busy but the staff keep the line moving pretty efficiently. You get a number and wait.. don't let it fool you though, you may have 16 and buddy beside you has 4 and you end up with your food first (HA, SUCKA). I got the one with the option in a cheeseburger.. so basically a cheeseburger and a little sent-from-heaven portobello mushroom cheese fried thing in it. Think of a Jalapeno Popper but with portobello mushroom. God DAMN. So so so good. Not too greasy, super juicy. Fries were good, but come on, you go for the burgs. Will be back for sure. Also, please open in OTTAWA."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about The Burger's Priest, we decided to make a day of it in the Beach, and this would be our first stop.  We arrived during lunch hour, and the little place was incredibly busy. I can't say I envy the people working the counter, but they had a demeanour that was almost depressing. The joint itself is very small and the music is loud enough that a few customers that went up couldn't hear the cashier; you're best off heading out to one of the parks around.  Now on to the food itself. The meat they use for the burger is ground on the spot, and you can tell. It's very soft and juicy, even being well done. The bun is just your average store bought quality, and the cheese on the burger taste very processed. The burger is not over flowing with flavour as it is, and having a better cheese could have gone a long way to helping.  But the thing to complain about the most is the size of the burger. It's tiny, and not just for the size. I'd be surprised if you could find such a small burger at any other place in the city. For what you're paying, it's really disappointing.  We also had a side of fries. They tasted great and fresh, although the fries were incredibly soggy in a little bag. They were okay, but once more.. the portion is small.  After we finished lunch, we were both disappointed by the cheese burgers and fries. The Priest offers a 'secret menu', which can be found by Googling the term. We'll have to try an item, or two from the menu, but I don't believe it'll change my opinion. We paid $17 for two burgers, fries and a coke. This might seem in line with a place like BQM, a bit further west, but when you consider the portions are half the size and you're not receiving anything special toppings wise, it boggles the mind.   When we're in the neighborhood, we'll try them again, but I put them in with the ranks of Chippy's & Burrito Boyz right now. Everyone flocks there because it's hip, but I don't know why."}
{"text":"Holly mother of greasy burgers. The High Priest is like a Big Mac on crack! I also had the California, it is A- amazing, the freshly made meat patties are so juicy and greasy, the special sauce... Oh the special sauce. There are no words. This place gets insanely packed and there's nowhere to sit but it's all worth it. I live in California and everyone always talks about In & Out but you don't need that when you've got Priest! Yummy in my tummy."}
{"text":"Note: Preliminary Review based on Opening Week!  This famous Beaches burger join has now opened in trendy Queen West.  The interior is notably more upscale compared to their other location.  They offer the basic standards or burgers, cheeseburgers to which one can add \"Smoke\", i.e. panko-crusted fried jalapenos, or stuffed mushrooms.  They also offer milkshakes, a few options of fries, and the \"Vatican\", which is vanilla ice cream between a grilled cheese bun....not sure what to make of that.  The burger was relatively juicy and greasy.  Nice, housemade ground meat.  They don't ask how you'd like it cooked, and it comes out pretty well done.  I liked the flavor, but the seasoning was inconsistent throughout the patty, and I felt additional salt was needed.  The fries were fine...a portion large enough for 2-3.  They were very short and stubby and also a bit short on seasoning.    We generally liked the place, although the 20 minute lineup was a bit of a deterrent.  Seating is moderate with some itsy-bitsy tables that are somehow already wobbly.    Clocking in between $5-$6 the burgers are not that much more expensive than McDonald's and way tastier.  I'll update after a follow-up visit or two."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. Best Burger i've ever had in my life.The first thing i eat when I arrive at Pearson airport. I've eaten every cot dayum burger from the more popular ones like In & Out, Five Guys, Shake shack, smashburger, big smoke, etc down to the local mom and pop burger spots in the US & Canada....and nothing touches my soul more than this specific burger priest location. The only other location that comes close to this would be the one on adelaide in downtown toronto. I always get the bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, grilled onions and secret sauce. The price could be a little better. It could also be a little more clean but hey its a burger spot not a michelin star restaurant."}
{"text":"My Toronto friends were telling me about how amazing the burgers are here, so straight from the airport I was brought here to try it.  It was a good burger for sure, and it hit the spot, but it was far from the best burger in the world it was hailed as.  Kind of wish I went in expecting nothing, but I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and give them the 4* that I guess they deserve.  But I was pretty close to rating this 3*.  The meat was too well done for me."}
{"text":"A long overdue but finally tried the Burger's Priest for the first time and it was pretty good! Staffs were friendly and the food came out quickly. It was a bit pricey for a burger but the cheeseburger I got was very soft, juicy, and just delicious. I'm not a huge fan of burgers but I mean, I would take this over the fast-food joints. I would love to try their milkshake the next time!"}
{"text":"Always deliciousness to be found at the Priest.  Now that I no longer live in TO it's probably been five or six years since I last had one of their burgers. It's great to see that a once tiny independent burger joint has expanded to the point of being bought out and is now expanding across the country.  I went with my usual High Priest which was great as always. Unfortunately what knocks this review down a couple pegs was the service. The staff cleared through the line fast enough that we didn't wait long, but the ordering process was tough. The girl working just seemed like she really didn't care. The place was busy and loud and I couldn't hear what she was asking me. I repeatedly had to ask her to ask again and I had to lean in every time. They also forgot about my milkshake. They made it, but it never got put on the tray. By the time I realized it was missing and then had to wait to get someone's attention, the shake was partially melted."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try The Burger's Priest for years but never got the chance because Yonge and Eglinton was out of the way for me. One day my mom and I were driving up on Weston when my mom pointed out the restaurant asking if that was the popular burger joint she's been hearing about. With disbelief, I drove into the plaza to confirm what she saw and it was indeed Burger's Priest!   They weren't open when we got there, so we decided to come back in a few hours to have lunch. I ordered The Priest which is the regular cheeseburger + The Option burger, along with regular fries and a drink to share, and my mom ordered The Option burger. I loved the simplicity of the patty and how it wasn't not over seasoned because I was able to taste the freshness of the beef. The portobello mushroom with the cheese was amazing! My mom enjoyed her burger as well but wished she had ordered The Priest after trying mine. On a separate occasion, I ordered the same burger but instead got the Chili Cheese fries. They topped the fries with their chili and loads of cheese, which was melted to perfection.  I am definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty but I would say small. There are other burger joints nearby with bigger and as tasty burgers. For value, I'd go elsewhere, but, as I said, the burgers are good.   The lineup at 1 pm was horrendous and I must assume at noon it will be worse. I had eight people in front of me, and it appears that there is no great rush by counter or cook staff to speed up the process. Maybe they are trying to bring back the slow food idea. Not sure."}
{"text":"WHAT!!???!?!!!? TWO STARS! Why this place is AWESOME! It has FRESH BEEF and burgers with COOL NAMES, unlike those evil chain places. IT even has an OFFERING PLATE for tips!!!  Ok, beyond the fact that this is a kind of cool place for upwardly mobile white people who are now in their thirties with kids who need hip-ness in midday packages along with a bit of hipster anti-establishment edge...  1. The seating in here is jammed and uncomfortable. 2. The beef is fresh, but the burger, while a respectable size, is dripping with grease and too salty. If McDonald's served this burger, there would be community outrage for all the grease. 3. The fries are average. 4. A burger, fries, and a can of cola runs around 17-18$. (Belonging costs in Hogtown are high.) 5. Behind the cute names, they are a conservative religious operation. Scroll down on the website to watch videos of cool young pastors telling you how to be saved. I do not consider this in my review because I support their free speech rights and my right to support or not support carefully packaged religion. It is worth noting for those who are fans or foes of the approach., 6. You will wait 20 minutes from the time you walk in until the time you get your burger. The pick up system (with the jammed tables and lines) is a bit of a challenge.  All in all, the fresh burger is just not that good for 11-12$ with tax. Yes, you will feel cool when you come in, but perhaps with a bit of greasy regret when you leave. Two and a half stars."}
{"text":"First came here on the heels of all the hype. Like a lot of places in Toronto, the \"Best ----- in Toronto\" is a moderately satisfying, but less wonderful version of what you might find in other Canadian or U.S cities. This was not the best burger, but it was good. Here are a few points on this location...  1. Burger, fries and canned drink was 16$. No great bargain. For the price, the burger should be amazing. 2. The seats (if you can get one) are too low and uncomfortable. Cold air (in winter) blasts you every time the door opens. 3. The burger itself was good. The amount of fries they give in an order is generous.  4. The fries are possibly better than the burger. I don't love fries, but these were great. 5. All in all, it is a good burger that is worth trying.  I liked Burgers Priest, but no more than Burger Works or similar places where I can sit comfortably in warmth, have a comparable burger, and for basically the same money have multiple side item choices.  Three and one-half stars."}
{"text":"Wow - is the bar for burgers incredibly low in Toronto or are people hypebeasting the shit out of this place?  What a letdown.  I had a feeling this place was overhyped but I figured I'll give it a shot anyways since we were in the area.  So you line up and herd in like cattle to the slaughter (yup - much like your meal).  The staff are a mix of smugness and 'I-hate-my-job' frowns.  So I ordered 'The Priest' - which is the cheeseburger with 'The Option' (two deep-fried Portobello mushrooms filled with cheese made into a patty).  For $10, this was a deal only in comparison to the $8 they want for the cheeseburger or 'The Option' alone.  So, it's not exactly cheap.  Add in the fact you have to line-up and they do not allow anyone to eat their burger inside the place (that's some Burger Nazi shit), this should be a spectacular burger, right?  Wrong.  For the money, it's an alright burger.  To be a value pick, the burger would have to be quite a bit cheaper.  But when you have to line up and there's no place to sit, I expect a burger that'll make my toes curl.  And the fries were pretty horrible - oversalted and dry.  Why did I line up for this shit?  I've stood in line for up to an hour for 'gourmet' hot dogs and hamburgers before... let me tell you kiddies, I've had burgers/dogs so good they not only changed my life but everyone I've ever had sex with.  Burgers so good that my vision turned to greyscale after the dizzying array of flavours and textures of a delectable burger left my life forever changed.  And get this - I paid the same money and they even let me sit in their restaurant as I ate my meal.  Imagine that.  The Burger Priest's motto is \"Redeeming the burger one at a time\"... really?  You guys have declared yourselves the champions of the burger?  Well - at least, you definitely are priest-like - you tricked a young man into putting your meat into his mouth..."}
{"text":"Loved the burgers there! Service was good and the food was amazing! Been there more than once, and it the food was great every time. Would highly recommend it, especially the High Priest burger!"}
{"text":"Worst Fries Ever  I've been here three times, and won't go back.  Every time I go, the fries are BURNED.  The oil tastes like it's been frying for months and there's burnt fries in it.  Burger is OKAY at best.  It's real beef for sure, and fresh.    They do try hard in the customer service arena.  It's obvious they care about the customer experience...   But I want a good side of fries with a gourmet burger... and it is true this is a burger joint, but in my opinion, they need to have the right sides to make the meal a success.   There are other places I go to for gourmet burgers that get the fries right, and their burgers taste better too :)"}
{"text":"$1.69 for 1 piece of fatty bacon? Really burger's priest? Stick to the regular menu folks. And you really expect me to tip? #gettapplease"}
{"text":"I remember when I had my first burger back in their east location,  and it was amazing! Maybe it was that I was expecting something awesome but I must say the burgers are AVERAGE... and expensive for an average burger. Love the concept,  like the different options (few but original)... small burger, tons of fries. Hubby had a milkshake too and that was pretty goood. We had the Blue Steel burger (kind of cheap in the blue cheese) and the priest burger... I would come back if I am craving a burger and I am around, but wouldn't make the drive."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make...... not to the priest; but....to my body!  Forgive me BODY, for I have sinned....  Consumed one Vatican City and left with the wrapping paper clean It's double cheeseburger in between sandwiches with grilled cheese Sandwiches are buttery and patties are juicy in between Cheese melted just right and held bread and patties tight  Forgive forgive me.... had a milk shake instead of tea it's thick, creamy and as smooth as dolphin's skin gulp, gulp, gulp and finished the whole cup with a grin  Forgive forgive forgive me..... a hidden secret is going to reveal the answer to their secret menu which is in their website hiding still \"How long was Noah on the ark?\" 370 days can no longer be concealed Popped up in front of my eyes is the full secret menu with more sinful burgers for real  Forgive forgive forgive forgive me....... Again again and again I will meet each and every burger in Burger Priest!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for food, three for service.  Food: Just as good as ever. Some of the best burgers in the city and now they have southern fried chicken breast sandwiches w/ gravy.  Service: We ordered two sandwiches and they got both wrong. They made one order a combo that we didn't ask for. For the other, I put in a custom order: a cheeseburger w/ a chicken breast thrown on top. Instead, I got a double chicken breast sandwich. Since I wasn't paying attention and the prices are usually expensive anyways, I didn't look over the receipt and we didn't notice the gaffes til we'd already started eating. Rather than go back and correct them, we took it in stride and enjoyed it while making a mental note to review the order carefully w/ the order taker next time so they don't screw it up."}
{"text":"This place is becoming the go to spot after watching a movie across the street. Got the double double combo this time with lettuce, tomatoes and onion on the side cuz that's how I'm used to it, not w/ the burger topped w/ everything in the cupboard so you can't taste the meat anymore. Burgers are still good and juicy, the bun needed a bit more toasting and the fries lacked some crispness, but had the right amount of residual grease to hold on to the salt. This place is really 5 stars for Toronto, but it's about on par w/ Shake Shack and 5 Guys so the 4 stars overall still stands. Think I'll go watch some more movies this month."}
{"text":"Solid burgers. Try 'em with fried jalapenos. Also try the orange creamsicle milkshake. mmm"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the small, soft, light, crumbly burger from The Burger's Priest. But certain claims are true:   1. Busy as hell, minimum 10-15 minutes wait at all times  2. Small burger, comparitively speaking  3. Not enough topping choices - while I agree that the TBP is all about simplicity, it's competitors do offer a wide array of toppings - sauteed mushrooms being one among my favorites.   Nevertheless, this burger does not fail to melt in your mouth - yummy goodness. I can finish one within minutes and not feel too bad about it."}
{"text":"Goodne... Graici... Mmmmme! These burgers are absolutely scrumptious! My colleague picked up the burger for me so I can't quite review the pIace. But from what I hear, their business concept is interesting, and their website forwards to a church website every Sunday.   Now, what I can review is the food; I decided to be not-so-adventurous and opted for the cheeseburger. Here's a breakdown:  Burger Buns: comparable to McDonalds in size, smaller than the Burger King Whopper.  Inside: pick and choose ... I don't go fancy so I had ketchup, mayo, lettuce and tomato. Some other choices? Mustard, onions, pickles, pepper, etc.  Patty: nice and crumbly homemade patty, good flavours. Nice consistency!   Cheese: the good stuff. Doesn't taste cheap, doesn't taste like cardboard.  Filling? My colleagues usually order 2-3 burgers each... I usually get just 1 because I like it light. It's definitely a lot lighter than your usual burgers.  Sides: fries? I hear the fries aren't that great. But haven't had them, so no comment.   Price: a burger is about $5.99; that's inexpensive for a nice gourmet burger.   That's it, folks! Best burger ever."}
{"text":"We checked out the Burger's Priest last night. GREAT burgers!  Things to know: - virtually no seating - 5 high stools next to a counter - so best to go with the takeout option - small kitchen, friendly staff - BIG tasting food  Menu has your basics, burgers with options like cheese, bacon, fried onions, the normal other condiments.  Has a veggieburger \"the Option\" (portobello mushroom).  Has a combo that is a double double, with chili cheese fries, a drink and a homemade cookie.  Here are my comments:  Wonderful burger!! I had the double double with cheese and fried onions.  These folks understand that it is about the meat! It is like rib steak ground up and formed into patties.  They have fantastic flavour, and they don't cover it with a lot of sauces, so you can taste that meaty goodness!    They come on regular size soft white plain buns, so finally a place that doesn't overwhelm you with too much bread and other flavours that detract from the burger itself.  My hub had the double double without cheese.  Said it was one of the best burgers he ever had.  The fries were fine.  Again plain jane, and that's a good thing.  Next time I am trying \"The Priest\" which I believe is one beef pattie and one of the veggie option.  Sounds awesome to me.  Expect it to be very busy on the weekends.  We see a line up out the door frequently. Anyways -- we will soooo be back!  Parking is on the street -- also for those of you grabbing a movie at the Alliance Cinema across the street, think about this as your dining option beforehand.  Just keep in mind that it lends itself more to take out!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the Burger's Priest after hearing all the hype! My sister and I ordered cheeseburgers and my 6 year old got a plain hamburger. One order of fries was enough for the 3 of us. Burgers were tasty and fries were great. My kid devoured that burger in minutes! Place was very busy but we didn't have to wait long. Washrooms were clean. This a great place to stop for lunch! Will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great texture, really tastes like they care about the ingredients. Beef is high quality and cooked perfectly, buns are really good too. Service inside is great, although take away lunch doesn't diminish the flavor. Becoming a regular spot to head to."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday after 2pm & it was busy. I got the single California burger. I was disappointed the onions were fried like a whole onion. It says sautéed onion, can they not sauté the onions separately...would have tasted better! Like another review, if the patty was turned on its side to let grease drip then burger wouldn't be too messy. If they did that all the time then bun would not be soggy! One advice grill the buns before putting burger, then buns won't be soggy (for orther types of burgers selection). That's why I ordered the Californian, or sometimes the Vatican so no issue with gross buns."}
{"text":"This is a split review The California Classic burger, Jarge-style - 5 stars The pricing - 3 stars The long wait for the food - 2 stars The I-don't-know-why-the forks-are-hidden - 1 star  I visited Burger Priest during a CMYE Burger Brigade.  We had, like, 20 Yelpers, so the atmosphere was electrifying.  Don't think it is typical.  I ordered a California Classic burger ($7.39), and I added the Jarge-Style option ($1.49) from the secret menu.  The Jarge style really impacted the burger, because the patty was super moist with fried onion juice and mustard.  The burger was soaked wet.  The onion strips were delicious.  I don't know what they did to the bun, but it was a flat bun that didn't feel starchy.  I would say I like this burger is the best among all the ones I tried during Burger Brigade CMYEs.  This is because I am sold on sauces.  And this sauce ROCKS.  I enjoyed this burger.  I also wholeheartedly recommend the Jarge style option.  Now the wait for the burger was like 15 minutes.  It took longer to get the milk shake.  The price was a tad on the high side at $8.88.  But this is a unique burger with a modern interpretation, so I am willing to splurge once in a while.  As the Yelpers were sharing one poutine, I needed a fork.  Burger Priest sells fries and poutine, yet they hide the forks behind the counter.  I had to jump all the people in the long line to ask for a fork."}
{"text":"Drove by this place a few weeks ago and thought I will have to visit, well, tonight was the night. I walked in the door and was greeted by what seemed to be everyone living on Queen St E. I thought the joint had a sit down area and was sadly disappointed. I walked up to the counter and placed the order, handed over my debt card and was told to visit the bank machine in the corner, so far this evening was going south. Recieved our order in a short time, by then we had a small space to eat so we took advantage. I will give them one thing, who ever created these bugers of paradise must be a genius, it was simply delectable.  The double cooked fries were excellent as well. Maybe the first time ive seen my son ever finish a meal and excited to do so. Id surly visit again but may try the Yonge St location with seating .   Went back 2 weeks later and had the same burger but it wasn't the same, it had lost its excitement, just meh"}
{"text":"I've been to the Burger Priest on Queen and Spadina and without doubts this location is just as good. I've had their Low Priest through mealpal and their burgers are real juicy. Doesn't feel too heavy in my opinion and the environment is actually quite nice and ventilated.   Inside design is modern and spacious - more so than the location on Queen. You can dine in or do a quick grab and go as well."}
{"text":"Wanted to stop by and grab a quick burger while leaving my wife and 3 kids in the car.   Took almost 40 minutes.   Burger was good thought. Wife unimpressed."}
{"text":"I loved every bite of my burger from here!!! We were first time visitors to Toronto for our two year anniversary and were so excited to explore the city! Not having directio nof where to eat, we had looked at Yelp for ideas. We wanted something quick and easy for lunch and decided the Burger's Priest sounded amazing. It did not disappoint. We ordered the Vatican City (which uses grilled cheese buns!!!) and the chicken sandwich. Both were great but I'm already wanting another trip to Canada for the Vatican city melty goodness. It's a good thing we don't have any in Chicago or I'd need to buy bigger clothing from eating this every day!!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are so good. The food is consistent and alway fresh. A little on the pricey side but we'll worth it. Only down fall is that they don't take debit or credit. So you have plan ahead. Only reason I gave this review 4 out of 5. Join the 21st century and get an electronic form payment Armo."}
{"text":"Oh Toronto, I feel in love with your city years ago during the summer months and I so loathe your extra brisk winter weather. I need to stick to visiting your city in the summer months where I can walk off the food I eat in your city.  But, I won't be getting food from here ever again.  This is one of the first times Yelp and Food Bloggers have steered me wrong. This has been on my places to eat for some time. Well we were in the hotel getting extra tipsy off cocktails and decided to order delivery. It seemed like the logical thing to do....drinking and eating greasy burgers.  They use hurrier.com for their delivery service. It was a $9 delivery fee with a $1.25 service fee but we figured we would have spent that on a cab so we didn't mind as much. They came in the timeframe given and food came piping hot to our door. Still no complaints.  It would have been nice to have ketchup in the bag but we felt that the burger probably wouldn't need it and the fries weren't the main event anyway. The fries...fresh cut is the only positive thing I can say about them. No salt. No flavor. We also got an order of chili cheese fries that seemingly added no flavor either. We ordered the High Priest and the Double Cali. There was no seasoning on the burgers, couldn't taste this \"secret sauce\" and it was so over cooked. I love a griddle cooked burger but not this one.   So overrated! Please save your money...I spent $47 in total for a meal that Was extra disappointing!"}
{"text":"This is the third Burger's Priest location that I've been to and the space is as small as the other ones. I don't like how they never make the restaurant bigger, offer more seating space, and just allow a better environment for all the people constantly lining up.   It took me a good 20 minutes from the time that I started lining up to when I got my food. It was so hot in the store that by the time I got to the counter I wasn't really craving for a hearty, cheesy, fatty, greasy burger anymore, so I opted for a small Peter's Denial instead. It was like $6 ish after tax and when I got my food I was very disappointed.   The burger/sandwish was pretty small and just didn't look good at all. Trust me I tried my best to take a good photo out of it. Taste wise it was like meh, the gravy was like something made from powder, the meat was kinda dry and over cooked, and the corn was definitely not fresh, probably made from frozen corn.   I don't believe the Peter's Denial was worth the price I paid and the lineup experience was terrible. Oh and the cash only rule bugs me. Next time, if there will be a next time, I'll just order online beforehand to avoid the painful lines."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try out the food at priest burger. We've heard stories that it was the best burger in the GTA and got a lot of high praises from friends and colleagues. I finally got a chance to try it myself and find out the truth.  We wanted to keep our order simple, cheeseburger and a high priest burger. It should be enough to judge whether the praises were accurate.  After a few minutes of intense wait, our order arrived. Unwrapping the greasy wrapper and taking our first bite, we felt like we were in playland. All our stress gone and life struggles gone. It was just all about the burger. It was a simple burger in a bun with the very basic toppings. Yet,every bite goes down smooth. It was possible the fastest I've ever devoured a burger. The order came with fries which was a nice salty suprise. Can't go wrong with the basic combo.  The only downfall are the high prices. And the fact that is unhealthy. It was greasy and I'm not sure if butter was used but felt like my buns were drench in it. The prices were a little high for my liking which will prevent me from stopping over a go to spot. I will opt out to go somewhere cheaper. This combination is a perfect storm for a heart attack.  There is no doubt that the high praises are true. I'm a believer and when I'm ever on a cheat day. You will find me here. Best burger joint in Sauga for sure!"}
{"text":"Though there's been a hamburger explosion in our fair city, Burger's Priest still remains the finest and most reliable purveyor of the meaty concoction around.  I'd been to this location a few times before, but it was this particular visit that finally encouraged me to do a Yelp write-up.  I ordered a double hamburger and asked for it topped with everything (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onion).  A few minutes later, my burger was ready for eating. Honestly, I wish I had taken a picture because this was hamburger perfection. A big part of what make's Burger's Priest such a reliable choice is their flawless method of cooking their burgers. They cook 'em on a flat-top griddle and push 'em down till there's an absolutely exquisite crust on the burger.  Oh, that crust. It's what keeps me coming back for more. It helps, of course, that their meat is clearly of a very high quality and absolutely devoid of pointless filler or seasonings. (A little salt and pepper does the trick.)  Seriously, I can't say enough about this hamburger. I'm almost happy there isn't a Burger's Priest near my place, since I'd most likely be there several times a week."}
{"text":"Oh, Burger's Priest. How far you've fallen.  When Burger's Priest kicked off the still-going-strong burger fad several years ago, they completely reinvented how Toronto ate their hamburgers. It's important to remember that before the Priest came around, the \"meatloaf\" style of burger was virtually the only thing you could get at restaurants.  Before I go off on a complete tangent, I'll just say that Burger's Priest's smashed-griddle style of cooking their meat remains my favorite way to eat the venerable dish.  But my last few visits to this particular location have been nothing short of devastating. Though they're still smashing their meat on the griddle - you've gotta love that crust that forms - the Priest seems to have cheapened out considerably on the quality of their product. What was once a beautifully juicy burger is now a dry-as-all-heck disaster.  On my most recent trip, I went with a double hamburger with all the fixins. I also want to mention that even though there was only one person in front of me when I ordered, it took almost a full half hour to get my food. I did see a few different delivery people come in while I was waiting, so the staff has clearly decided to prioritize folks ordering online over those standing right there in the store. Stupid, if you ask me.  But I digress. I finally did get my burger and it looked quite promising. Two thick patties armed with that glorious crust that can only come from the griddle. One bite told me things had gone very, very wrong at some point, however.  The burger was dry. Like, inedibly dry. Like, so dry you have to take a big sip of water between bites. Like, so dry that you spend minutes chewing one mouthful. It's dry.  I really didn't enjoy my meal, is the bottom line. I'd rather have been eating almost anything else. And although I did finish, I was seriously tempted to just throw the whole thing away about halfway through.  Burger's Priest, get your act together. This is crazy."}
{"text":"Wow, completely disappointed after all the best burger lists Burger's Priest is on and high reviews I've seen on Yelp. I didn't really taste anything that overly impressed me.  Burger was fine if small... really need to get two patties to make a decent sized burger. The fries were also good, but why are they cut so small that I get ketchup on my fingers every time I try to dip one? Maybe I'll go back for another try on the Priest or option but not in any hurry."}
{"text":"the burgers were good, but very small. the line-ups are usually really long, and it's not worth the wait.   i don't understand why this place is so highly ranked... i think it's been over hyped. if you choose to go, make sure to order a couple burgers for yourself because 1 is not enough."}
{"text":"Before I start, I have been to over 50+ burger joints within the GTA with my close friend. We both enjoy burgers very much and could eat them literally every single day if we had to.  Now on to the review:  Burger Priest has one of the best burgers in the GTA, hands down.  - The bun doesn't turn moist while attempting to eat it. - The ground beef is cooked perfectly, not too soft and definitely not burnt. - There is always a perfect amount of toppings on the burger so your not licking your fingers every two seconds. - The beef and the bun compliment each other very well  I have had the The Pope and The Vatican City about 3 times each and they are both equally my favorite two burgers.  The milkshake is also good if you want to cool down during a hot summer day.  In all honesty, Burger Priest does hold true to the hundreds of reviews on many different sites - you will NOT be disappointed.  The service is also exceptional - you have to wait about 5-10 minutes but that is when they are extremely busy and it is to be expected.  If you are looking for a delicious, fair priced burger - do not look any further than this place.  5/5 Stars."}
{"text":"Really busy place so get there early! Took about 30 minutes to get the food so if its cold outside more than likely you are waiting.  I had the Holy Smokes burger as I am a fan of spicy and it was delicious."}
{"text":"There wasn't much of it, so I will get the good stuff out of the way first before I bite into The Burger's Priest. The burger (albeit small for the price) was fresh and had a decent seasoning and there was a really cute blonde calling out names. Now that is done with, the not so good.  Starting with the menu, since that was the first annoyance encountered. I suppose it is the fancy thing to do, but just putting \"The Option\" means absolutely nothing. It's location on the menu made it seem like it was just a banquet burger or something similar. When asked what it was, it was a pretty snarky answer that was given in response that it was a portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese and fried; as if that is just pure logic based on the name. Never having been there before, only hearing that it was a good burger, and happening to be in the area is the only reason we were there. Not from a website or anything that would be descriptive of the food itself or how to order. Pretencion should be left to Starbucks, not a place that looks like a drab dive bar, but I will get to that shortly.  Now I move to the bun, but not happily. I don't know where or why this decision was made (I can only imagine for time and price), but using a bun that resembled in shape and taste to a Dempsters bun is not really what should be housing a $5.99 burger. That is okay for a family BBQ with the kids, but for a restaurant to make that decision is just lazy. At the very least give us some sesame seeds! To be getting such rave reviews and be handed something in a bun like that is a little ridiculous. Then again, maybe the \"Cheeseburger\" was part of a kids menu and I just didn't realize it.  I understand that they didn't want tables and all that comes with that, but I have never been so cramped while eating a burger. There is a bar-ledge with 5 stools, but the last of the 5 closest to the door actually blocks people coming in and out. I actually had to step outside to put my coat back on because there were 6 people in the restaurant and there was not enough room. Space is money, but someone should have sprang a few extra dollars to find a slightly larger location. If you have ever ate a hot dog while waiting in line to see a big concert, that is what it felt like eating this child-size burger. Hmm...maybe it is actually a restaurant FOR children, someone maybe should look into that.  Bottom line...do not eat here on Sunday if you want to keep your faith..."}
{"text":"Ordered: Four horsemen of the apocalypse and Vatican City.   Burgers were FANTASTIC! Nice crunch on the grilled cheese part. Lots of cheese. Not overly greasy for the amount of meat.   Value, little on the pricey side of about $20 a burger, but as a treat it was worth it.   We would return and drop the cash for them again.   Was about a 20 minute wait for our food, and they probably could find a better way to speed up their service, but they had a good system going."}
{"text":"The meal was enjoyable.  I had the fiery furnace burger and it was good but I've certainly had a better fast-casual burger elsewhere.  The smoke (fried jalapenos) were a tasty add on."}
{"text":"After talking to a couple locals who had raved about this place, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try since it was close to where we were staying. It is located on Queen West, across the street from McDonald's. We had taken public transportation to get here, but it didn't look like there were plenty of spaces to park.  Walking in, the restaurant was surprisingly small. As many have said, there is not much seating (less than 10 tables) and seemed very cramped together. You order and pay before finding a seat.  The Vatican ($11.59): 5/5. My boyfriend had chosen the Vatican.The cashier had stated that the burgers were made of the highest quality and only make the burgers to order. My boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, especially because of the fact that the buns are made out of grilled cheeses (Yes. You read that right.) The burger was packed full of ingredients and the patty was dense. He has a huge appetite and his burger really did the trick.  High Priest ($9.99): 3/5. I had chosen the High Priest. As someone who is from the West Coast of the United States, this reminded me a lot of an Animal Style burger from In 'n' Out. The patty was a bit on the drier side and lacked some seasoning, however the plethora of ingredients compensated for both problems. Though the burger was good, I could not seem to shake off the fact that they were so similar, yet this burger was almost double the price.  Though it was not the best burger I have ever had, I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to test this popular Burger shop. Ordered a loaded Option and it was not bad. I say not bad because I'm contrasting my \"1st bite\" experience at Shake Shack with the shack stack burger (IMHO best burgers in the world), and I presume this is where Burger Priest got the \"option\" inspiration from.   The meat was definitely fresh, but was a bit bland. The bun texture was a bit course and the fresh toppings were acceptable. The most disappointing part was the undercooked cheese inside the fried portobelo mushroom. Overall, the burger but lacked the wow factor and the orgasmic melt in your mouth sensation a Shack Shack burger exhibits. My justification for the first star deduction is for the price, Priest's lacks value for the money and the final products quality does not warrant such a premium. Second star deduction is for my undercooked shroom. Priest is probably the best burger in T.O. and if your craving Shake Shack it is the next best alternative."}
{"text":"In a nutshell...  Probably the best burger joint in the immediate area. Pricier than average. Massive wait times. Limited seating. Messy order pickup process (they need to display order numbers on a big screen or something because you can't hear anything). Good shakes. Maybe the best vegetarian burger I've ever had (The Option). Mediocre fries - taste is good but not a fan of the texture."}
{"text":"Completely delicious! If you find yourself at IKEA, skip the meatballs and try this place instead. The cheeseburger and vanilla shake were fantastic, the fries were just okay. All around good experience!"}
{"text":"Holy slow service! Burgers are ok. Way overrated! Had the chili fries...soggy and cold. Two people cost over 35.00"}
{"text":"This is my first negative review on Yelp but I had a really disappointing experience here.  I've heard so much hype from Toronto friends and maybe the Toronto locations are better run but I was totally underwhelmed and a little grossed out here.  So the food is EXPENSIVE. And I don't mind spending many dollar bills on good food. But this was expensive for TINY portions of completely greasy food in a dirty restaurant that had zero maintenance cleaning-wise that I could see because it looked like it had been a few hours since anyone swept the floors or cleaned the tables.  And there were several hairs in my food. Which is SOOOO NASTY. Come on! I've worked in food service and it's not hard to put on a hair net for your shift underneath your hat.  Needless to say based on the price and the portion size I would expect flawless service and restaurant cleanliness but nope!  Sorry Burger's Priest but you have to step up your game.   PS if you want a REAL burger with way more fun flavors and combinations go to Holy Chuck's! Clean restaurant and 5 star quality meat and toppings. And no I don't work for them but I have to suggest a better option for anyone reading this."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a trip to Toronto on a recommendation from someone my bf heard about it from. We looked up their secret menu, which requires you to answer a question or two regarding bible stories, on their website. I decided on the Tower of Bable burger, which uses two grilled cheeses for the buns. This thing was HUGE! And I'm not usually a burger person, much less a big burger person. But I ate the whole damn thing. It was, hands down, the best burger I ever had. The location is extremely small, with only 4 bar stools, but it's worth grabbing a burger here. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Mmm, believe the hype: Burger's Priest makes one legit delish burger!  I haven't had the pleasure of checking out the other locations yet, but decided to check this newly opened location out a couple of days after the opening.  Like expected, there was a huge lineup. It goes pretty fast, though, and I don't think I waited more than a total of 20 minutes or so for my food.  This location has a decent amount of seating, and in the time that my party & I were there, we noticed a lot of people comnig and going, so if you hang around long enough, you should be able to grab a table no problem. One issue I did find though, was there was one person sitting there \"reserving\" two tables, for a long amount of time (~45min or so), not even eating or orded yet, just waiting for friends. I think they should likely crack down on that as it's not really fair to those who already have their food.  The PRIME table spot is in the corner by the window!  It's sort of a hightable/booth and you can actually squeeze quite a few people in there and it's quite comfy! If your party is larger you can sit with the tables nearby, too :).  The service I felt was a bit mixed, our cashier (who, by the way, had an awesome Venasaur x Poison Ivy shirt on) wasn't too friendly, but I found the cooks to be super sweet!  Now down to the good stuff: the BURGER!  I kept it simple with the double cheeseburger and that's exactly what it was: two patties, cheese, with all the fixins. The meat was sooo juicy and delicious, not to mention fresh! It's a simple burger, but done perfectly. I think simplicity can be a hard thing to pull off since all the ingredients need to be executed perfectly, but really, it almost was a perfect burger. I only wish it was a little less greasy.  My friend had one of the burgers with the deep fried portobello mushroom, and as soon as she bit into it, it just OOZED with cheese. I WILL be coming back to try that sucker out!  If you pop by here for a burger check out their floats, malts, and shakes! They are delicious! You can also choose any pop you want for the base of your float (and they have some of the more non-generic things, like Diet Crush! YES!)  Can't wait to try out more stuff on the menu!  Will be back to OmNomNom soon!"}
{"text":"I've seen some reviews and to rate based on whether Onions were raw or cooked, greasy burger, to each his own but this burger is tied with Shake Shack for me. An awesome burger has to be juicy i.e. Greasy. A dry burger is horrible. I ordered the double cheeseburger at the Bloor location and it floored me. Cooked right on the spot, you have the cheese nicely melted and the juices flowing. Was only in Toronto for the weekend and I had to have another one before I left. Arrived to a street food fair and to my surprise, Burger's Priest was there! I had one with a nice cool Ace Hill Pilsner. Soo tasty and delicious....I had to have another! And I am NOT a daily burger eater. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the fries. Were very good albeit waaaay too salty."}
{"text":"The burgers here are AMAZING!!! I'm giving this 4 starts instead of 5 starts because there wasn't enough seating and the menu print was very small. The menu can be bigger and better organized. I came with 5 others and our food came out within 15 minutes so not bad at all. The fires were great. All of us enjoyed our burgers. The vanilla shake was okay - not really worth the 5$ price so I won't get it again. I decided to get the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was AMAZING!!!! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We finally tried this new place on the weekend and it was jammed packed but had a great vibe!     We ordered the Single California (one patty, sautéed onions, bacon, lettuce, tomato and a \"secret\" sauce) and fries.  Since it's made-to-order, the wait was probably about 10-15 minutes but they have an assembly of people behind the counter making the burgers.  The buns are grilled and buttered so it resulted in a very rich burger.  The meat itself was fresh and not greasy but, keep in mind, it's a very loose burger but not too messy.  I would probably pass on the butter next time because, as I mentioned, it was quite rich; however, I didn't feel gross afterwards.  The fries are kind of like that old school Swiss Chalet style - not bad but I would have preferred if they used longer cuts of potato instead of the small, little pieces.    The restaurant itself has limited seating - we just ate in the parking lot since it was warm and sunny.  The service was very friendly and it's extremely clean in there.    I would suggest that, given the high prices (about $15 for the burger and fries) and the fact that it is a burger joint, it should have had napkins more readily available - we were only given two each of those little thin white napkins ... maybe it's just me but, if you're going to charge those prices, don't be stingy with the napkins.  I also thought that, for the price and that it solely concentrates on burgers, it should have been offered on a classic brioche bun and not a Wonder Bread type of bun.  All in all, a pretty decent place but quite pricy so I don't think I'd be visiting it too often."}
{"text":"Came here for a burger as one of my friends said they had good burgers and people from work would come by twice a month for a burger run.  Ordered the original was was ok, wasn't as amazing as everyone says it to be. I think the veggie option would have been better.  A little pricy for a take-out burger."}
{"text":"After hearing much talk about this place, I finally met with the Priest - the burger, that is.    Though I didn't feel very adventurous on my first visit, I didn't regret my choice of a cheeseburger with bacon and fries. I liked the meat. I loved that these were hand-made patties and were perfectly sized to fit into my belly. But once I finished it, I craved to try the infamous Priest burger.   I got my wish when my friend treated me the other day. I'm glad I tried it because I probably won't order it again. I liked the panko-crusted Portobello mushrooms and I liked that it was stuffed with cheese but I just found that it was way too much food for me. I struggled to finish it and at one point, I couldn't eat another morsel. But not to worry, none of it went to waste: my friend's dog was more than happy to eat the rest of it for me.  As you've heard the Burger's Priest isn't cheap. However I can appreciate their efforts in using quality ingredients, like their beef, and to keep their menu as simple as possible.   I'm not in the area that much but they're definitely worth a treat when I know I've been good!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, the Burger's Priest cooks right. I'm not sure about other products there, but I tried one of their burgers. The burger wasn't that fancy, but it was quality. Sometimes quality is all that matters.  Some burgers are just over the top. I am not always so sure about those burgers."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was because we got it for take away or not, but the burger was pretty damn soggy. I mean the entire buns were clear, pretty unimpressive. The meat in the burger was nice and juicy, but overall wasn't impressed. Giving them the benefit of the doubt because of the fact I ordered it to take away and ate it 5-10 mins later.   Won't be eating again, fries were rubbish."}
{"text":"I only had the chili cheese fries which were fine - didn't care for the shredded cheese that wasn't melted on top and the sitting was kind of uncomfortable plus they took a bit of time and weren't that friendly. My friends who had burgers seemed satisfied but they weren't raving. It was good enough though!"}
{"text":"Expect a line up when visiting this great burger place.   Tight space, so be prepared to get your order to-go. If it's a good day, stroll down to the beach and enjoy the food there.  Great burgers that are cooked perfectly with appropriate amount of fixings and aren't too big. I'm not a huge fan of over sized burgers. Highly suggest trying the chili cheese fries.   Worth the wait and price point. Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"I think this place does well cause of drunk hipsters. No where near as flavourful as Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Burger's Priest for a while and have visited many locations. The High Priest burger is my favorite. And for the most part, I usually eat-in.  However the Port Credit location has a basic problem in the winter.....the interior is very cold and every time someone opens the door, you're reminded that you need to eat with your coat on. This of course has no effect on the initial burger quality or any effect at all if you choose take-out, however if you plan to eat in, be forewarned that its not exactly a warm intimate environment.  The prices are on the high side with one double burger and a can of pop coming in at $13.05 with tax. The fries are good but they provide enough for 3 people so thinking that I will have to throw away most of the order, I seldom order the fries. If you're with two or more people, sharing will make the overall cost, better."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I ever had! I got the Vatican with the option which is a portobello mushroom breaded and stuffed with cheese. Amazing! And beef was fresh and didn't feel that sick feeling after having a greasy burger! Will definitely try again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Burgers..burgers...so many to choose from these days its hard to give a 5 star rating for them, but the Burgers Priest...is very close with a 4.5.  This was the last stop of the Yelp GTA Burger Brigade and it was one of the best places so far.  I have heard about Burger Priest in my travels for great burgers and I jumped at the chance to go eat with other burger affcienados.   There is a number of different styles of burgers at the Burger's Priest (BP for short) , but what really pulls them apart from other burger restaurants is the shhhh....Secret Menu....This menu consisted of many religious themed burgers ranging from the \"Tower of Babel\" (2 grilled cheese, veggie burger, cheese burger with and extra patty ) to \"Noah's Ark\" (veggie burger with meat chili and cheese)  all of the selections on this menu are pretty over the top.   One of the other defining factors that makes this rank high on my burger list is the way that they cook the meat.  FLATTOP...IMAO is the best way to make a great burger.  You get crispy edges, juicy flavor and taste you just can't get from a grilled burger.  On this visit (first of many) I had the Vatician City with Chili (2 grilled cheese and a double cheese burger with chili). One of the messiest burgers I have ever eaten, but oh my Burger's Priest!!  soo good.    Service was quick and the restaurant was average and clean.  Enough seating for about 30 ppl.  If your looking for burger redemption from all the chain joints...repent your chain burger loving ways and convert to the Burger's Priest!!"}
{"text":"It's like God sent us a taste of heaven in the form of a burger.  The Vatican City is my all time favourite - grilled cheese sandwich buns, with two juicy patties in the middle. I'm drooling just thinking about it, and I've already had dinner.  Their ice cream sandwiches are also huge and ever so satisfying on a summer day.   The only negative thing I can say about this restaurant is that there isn't much space to eat inside the restaurant! And trust me, these burgers require lots of space for mess making. Regardless, the burgers are delicious and a must-have. They make them fresh every day! Often they run out of burgers by the end of the night - that's how good they are. Go and try it! NOW!!"}
{"text":"Bumpin atmosphere, good music, \"young/hipster\" environment, not much seating so it's a more of a grab and go type place  had the BEST BURGER OF MY LIFE here!  I ordered the double Vatican - so the top and bottom buns were grilled cheese sandwiches.  The key was in the beef, amazingly juicy and flavourful.  It's too bad that I was only a tourist in Toronto, if ever I am back in the area I would be here everyday for lunch.  This place needs to make a location in vancouver!  Can't say anything bad about this place."}
{"text":"This place is soo overrated and hyped up, and I finally decided to try it after reading such great things about this apparently gourmet burger. It was not.   The burger was just average and nothing special, in fact my burger was a bit burnt around the edges and there is seriously nothing outstanding about it and bland is probably the best way to describe it. There was a lack of tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and that special ZING when you eat a really good burger. Not to mention it was EXTREMELY expensive (3 burgers and 1 fries was $30), an amount that I would've rather spent at five guys and gotten a much better burger."}
{"text":"I don't get the rave about this place, went there for the first time tonight and had the High Priest burger, fries and a chocolate shake. The burger patty was fresh but the High Priest is basically a Big Mac knockoff with bigger pickle slices. Fries were decent, but the shake just tasted like old ice cream. For $20 I was not impressed. There's way better burger options in the same area for less."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood on our way to Ashbridges bay when we passed by here. Since I'd read so much about it, I figured it was time to finally try it. I only got a cheeseburger with lettuce tomato and mayo and it was quite a it smaller than I had expected. However, it was most definitely tasty. Also, I am not a huge eater so I can never finish bigger burgers so this was a good size. For guys or bigger eaters, I don't think it's enough. I didn't have fries but have heard and read that theyre not great.i wouldn't know or care as I am not a fries person. The burger will have me back again if I'm close by.  Oh yeah, tiny, squished and long lines but there's lots of places to iconic nearby and the lines move quick.  No debit or credi cards accepted, cash only."}
{"text":"Went with my cousins who are big foodies, so i highly trust their judgement for any place they recommend in their hometown.  Coming from the east coast, we claim Shake Shack as one of our own. Looking at their menu, they offered a similar option called the Priest, which consisted of a cheeseburger and the Option (a panko crusted mushroom stuffed with cheese and fried). I had to order this to get the curiosity out of me and to see how it measured up to the Shack Stack. Dare i say that it might have tasted better than Shake Shack?! Or could it be the hunger inside me that ooh'd and ahh'd at every bite? Either way, this is a great burger and VERY filling, i would even recommend sharing if you aren't greedy. The beef patties taste really fresh and have the right amount of juicyness to it.   The fries are good as well, one portion can feed 2-3 people. The crispy ratio is just right, Not overcooked and not undercooked.   Seating inside is limited as it can probably seat about 20 people. There is parking at the back of the store.   I would prefer this place over 5 guys. If you are willing to spend $7 at mcdonalds or another fast food place for a burger, go here instead and have it fresh and you won't feel queasy afterwards."}
{"text":"The good: one of the best burgers in Toronto. Juicy (check), filling (check), loaded with good stuff (check), fattening (thank god it's zero calories... Check). Honestly you can't go wrong with the priest burger. Two portebello mushrooms with the beef patty and cheese is match made in heaven.  The bad: waiting for the burger while you are hungry  The ugly: waiting for the burger while you are hungry and there's a line in front of you :(  Neutral: there is seating at the Adelaide location (limited in the original location)."}
{"text":"Burgers Priest is what Yelp assumes at five stars...in the land of burgers, it's as good as it gets. First timers are recommended the Bacon Double Cheese. It actually melts in your mouth. Other suggestions: Chicken burger, High Priest (like a Big Mac but I thought the cheese burger was better) and the fries with chilli sauce (you can do 3 people on one order). You can't eat this too much because it's sinfully delicious (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"If you are ready for a super greasy burger and aren't watching your weight this is one of the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love Burger's Priest, their burgers and their cookies! And should I mention the stern fries? Yum! Buttered buns are a must!  This location is the best of all... The difference is quite visible.   I've ordered food from the other locations and they always seem to miss something. It's unfortunate that the other locations are not up to par but Queen West always gets everything perfect!"}
{"text":"I ordered the option via Foodora. Don't get me wrong the burger was delicious, but I was expecting something bigger. It felt like a snack size option, rather than a meal."}
{"text":"Tiny little place, simple menu, which we appreciate. Had the cheeseburger, absolutely delicious, though a bit small.  Fries are the skinny variety, which I love, and there's vinegar at the lone bench customers can sit at (4 patrons comfortably).  Moved here only two years ago and this is the best burger we've had yet, by far.  Staff were very nice.  Would defintely recommend this place if you are into burger \"purity\", no fancy toppings or breads, just really good burgers."}
{"text":"There's no where to sit inside. Squat on the curb with your burger and fries and be happy. It's really so good."}
{"text":"I don't give a FCUK if the burger's priest is the Starbucks of burgers, it delivers full flavors when I need it. My snobby burger friends think there is better, and my poor friends think it's pretentious, but shit! The Burger's Priest delivers. EVERY TIME, MAN!  I am the sloooooooowest eater. I have closed many a restaurant. However I ate their bacon and blue cheese burger in less than a minute. It's probably because my stomach had time to reflect on its' past life choices and make room, in the lengthy time I waited for my burger. Like why were mofos lining up at 4:30 pm? I was at least unemployed at the time. But gawd that burger was so good, that I still think about it. I should have had another. But there will always be  tomorrow. thank god The Burger's Priest is expanding - YO come to cabbagetown! I will personally welcome you with a dance."}
{"text":"Went way back when they first opened. So far, they make the tastiest burger yet, imo. The fries aren't that great so I usually don't get them, they're the shoestring kind.  My only gripe with the place is the price. Not only are the prices high, but the portions are small than compared to other competitors. I would like to see either bigger burgers or reduced prices. I only come here now when I've forgotten the taste."}
{"text":"OK it's a long wait...but it's really good! Once in a while it's fine.  You can see the ground beef balls laid out on a cookie sheet right next to the grill, and they look absolutely delicious (yes, of course when you can picture what it will be when it's cooked. I don't eat raw meat).   I had a single cheesburger and it was delicious! The portion was not too big, the patty was so juicy, but not runny. The patty was nice and hot, without burning your mouth. All the fixings are great, you have to get them all!  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The game of \"what is the best hamburger you can eat\" is the kind of game that you're guaranteed to win.  Many have argued that this is Toronto's answer to places like Shake Shack and IN-n-OUT.   It's a totally safe comparison.     I can't really figure out why they call PJ Clarke's one of the 'saints', but that's neither here nor there.   I love the branding and overall feel of the place.   Exactly what this city needs.   Is it the best burger you've ever had?  No.      Is it in that upper echelon of hamburgers?   Absolutely.  Should you go?   Yes."}
{"text":"Good food not so good staff on cash.  Kids who are not totally on the ball.   We come often and ordering or simply picking up a phone order is a challenge for the staff on cash"}
{"text":"I had to come to see what this place is about. I was not disappointed one bit.  Arriving at around 2:15pm today (Friday), the lineup was actually still quite long. At first there was mass confusion of which line was for ordering and which line was for picking up (minus .5 stars). Eventually that was solved and I placed my order (Cali Classic with extra onions).  Then the waiting began. And continued. 2:20. 2:25. 2:30. 2:40. There were orders after me that had their food before so I asked if they lost my order (minus .5 stars). They assured my order was coming, and at 2:45pm I finally got my burger.  Putting the waiting aside, the burger was absolutely delicious; everything what'd you think in an excellent burger: Juicy patty, delicious but not plentiful toppings, and the bread was on the crispy but sweet side! A nice touch to probably the best burger I ever had. Too bad the previous two mishaps prevented me from giving this place 5 stars, but if you have a good 45 minutes to an hour to kill, this is definitely a must for the burger lover."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was more excited about: The burger, or the fact I actually found a seat in this busy place. I managed to eat-in here! At 1pm on a Saturday in the middle of Woofstock!  Anyway...the fact I ate in here wouldn't mean much if the food wasn't tasty, right? Well, the burger I ordered was, indeed, tasty. I had the blue steel burger this time around (had a different one in the Queen West location). Pretty basic burger, so if they can't even do this one good what makes me think other burgers would be worth the price?  Thankfully, the patty was extremely juicy and full of wonderful herbs; similar to the Queen West location. The blue cheese was thick and definitely had the blue feel to it. (Your tongue should be blue at the end. If not, they didn't do it right.) Perhaps the bun itself could be improved, but I know their grilled cheese buns are infinite times better.  I would probably stick with the Queen West location in terms of seating, and since I'm typically never by The Beaches in the first place. Still lots of love for the original branch though!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in the city! The Priest burger with the molten cheesy portobello mushroom patty also simply known as the \"option\" takes this cheeseburger to the next level!!! Check out their secret menu (it's on their website) I would recommend this spot to all burger lovers!"}
{"text":"I do not eat meat therefore, when a friend insisted we go to Burger's priest, I was  bit nervous.   I was thrilled to see they had a portobello mushroom burger that did not contain any meat. THAT burger is BY FAR my favourite vegetarian burger in the city! It has a crunch to it and the texture of the portobello mushroom is simply perfect.   I have not visited Burger's priest in a while but will def be going back soon !"}
{"text":"Over rated! Over priced! 21.65 for a combo. It had a double patty burger with fried onions, hot peppers, fries and one can of pop. Very greasy burger. Be careful when they ask you if you want certain toppings. They dont mention that each one if very expensive. This burger had a trace of lettuce, NO tomato. It looked big because they put an extra half bun in the center. These guys have nothing on Five Guys. Dont bother."}
{"text":"This has become our go to place for burgers.  The way they press the burgers and cook it on the flat top creates a crust that makes it one of the best burgers.  The quality is good and consistent at this location."}
{"text":"Cannot get fresher than this! Burger meat was fresh, moist, and unfrozen. The size was smaller than I expected. I got the Fiery Furnace. Although I expected some spiciness, I ended up tasting nice crispy bacon.   I only wish this place had tables and chairs, instead of only 4 bar stools... The space is also very small. I would say it can only fit about 5-6 people, at most. However, This place is not hard to miss. A giant yellow sign with big bold letters is pretty apparent."}
{"text":"I heard this place has some of the best burgers in the GTA. So, I went ahead and ordered:  NEW YORK'S FINEST TAXI SERVICE. This is a cheeseburger with G14 sauce, lettuce, and tomato.  It tasted like a typical cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato. The G14 sauce looked like a mix of mustard and mayo. The ingredients were also pretty fresh. Wish I ordered something from the secret menu, as I didn't find this burger very special. It's definitely a bit better compared to other fast food burger joints.   Side note: A man rushed into the store, swore and yelled at the employees about the garbage cans being full and not thrown out, and then pushed his way into the kitchen. I assume he's the manager at this store. As a customer sitting and trying to enjoy my food, I was quite frightened. Shortly afterwards the employees started to tell customers that they're closed even though the store hours say they're open till 9:30. After seeing the manager, I wanted to leave anyway. I wouldn't mind trying other Priest burgers in the future but I'll likely go to a different location."}
{"text":"Got the high priest, which is basically a nice big mac. It's good. Reminds me of (Washington state) Five Guys burgers, tbh, but I prefer 5Gs by a small margin.  Fries were serviceable but nothing special. Again, I prefer Five Guys (this time by a large margin).  The restaurant has very little seating, and the tables kinda blow."}
{"text":"\"The Option\" is by far the best vegetarian burger I have ever had in my life. M only wish is that it was a little bigger in size because it's on the dainty side but the flavour is unrivalled. SO good!"}
{"text":"This has to be THE BEST burger I've had.. and I do love my burgers.  I went up on a girls trip to Toronto and we had listed out restaurants to check out.  This wasn't on our list, but one of the girl's cousins really wanted us to eat here.  My goodness, am I glad we went.  The restaurant is a tad narrow with not a whole lot of seating, as I came to realize  that's a common thing in this city.  Their burger menu is posted on the wall behind the register.  I asked the cashier what the most popular items are and she said the Californian(?.. i can't confirm this because it's not posted on their online menu) and the burger's priest (duh!).  I chose the californian and the wait was a bit long from the ordinary for a quick service restaurant.  Our burger came in a brown paper bag and was wrapped in a way to easily eat the burger.    Juicy, pink middle, right amount of cheese, toppings were fresh, but the best part was the bun.  Call me crazy but the bun follows the meat patty in \"what makes a good burger\".  I've never had a crunchy, crispy bun.  The bun reminded me more of a slice of bread (that could be it, actually) and the texture reminded me of a grilled cheese.  In fact, on their secret menu, you can get grilled cheese \"buns\" on your burger.  Wtf, why didn't I know about this in advance?!  I'm done with basic buns.  Hellooooo grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"First time I went here an hour and a half before they closed and they were out of beef. Pretty annoying when you have to make the trek all the way to coxwell on queen.  I finally tried this place last night. The burgers are damn tasty. I had a look at the secret menu (http://www.foodwithlegs.com/?p=3136) before I went there, so I was all prepared.  After waiting about 15 minutes in line (for which I was told was not long), I orderd the high priest. It has a big mac style construction (including some secret sauce) and was, well, like i said, damn tasty. The meat was super juicy and the whole thing had a lovely greasy delivery. I practically inhaled the thing in like a minute. I should have gotten 2! The fries were salty and greasy and reminded me of mcdonalds fries from the 80's (when they were still using beef tallow to fry them). maybe thats what these guys are doing.  They need to be open later and on sundays. get some non-believers behind the counter. I predict this place will still be around in 50 years."}
{"text":"Sooo overrated! I got a burger with blue cheese, bacon, sautéed onions, mustard, mayo, and pickles. I should have been in flavour town! Bland bland bland. The burgers are pretty tiny too. Definitely not worth the $17 for a meal. They don't even season the fries!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered The Option, California Classic, and The Cheeseburger, which we were all pretty disappointed by. The buns/burgers were a LOT smaller than we had expected, especially for the high prices. Also, the $6 milkshakes are not worth it; not thick at all."}
{"text":"I had the Option, which has, in place of a regular burger patty, a breaded and fried portobello mushroom filled with a lot of cheese. It reminds me of the Shake Shack veggie burger.   I also had the chili cheese fries, except they were out of chili so they made some onion-french-fry concotion instead. Both were pretty good but I'm not sure I'd come back since it's slightly pricey for what you get, the restaurant is very tiny, and the food is not particularly special to me."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Port Credit neighbourhood. Worth the wait, but small portions if you don't double it up. I got the bacon cheeseburger jarge style.  It was really flavourful and the toppings were fresh.   We ordered the chilli cheese fries, which were good, but i would have preferred regular fries with gravy.   The whole Christian theme is a bit weird, no one seems to mind though."}
{"text":"So many reviews already, I don't have much to add except: - Believe the hype... that is one juicy, delicious, perfectly grilled burger. I just had the cheeseburger, nice and simple. It wasn't actually too big compared to other places. DC had the Priest and the \"option\" is genius. Mushroom, cheese, and a lot of oil... all my favourite things! - Urgh why are hipster foodie joints so stuck up? (-1 star). We asked if we could order something off the Secret Menu and the guy is like, \"I think you just answered your own question. It's secret for a reason. Friend us on facebook and maybe you can see what's on the secret menu.\" Seriously?! - Also interesting, they are not being all ironic with the religious references. On the website, there is a link \"the gospel\" and you might think it is gonna be all \"lets redeem the burger!\" but it is actually the gospel gospel. Like, New Testament of the Bible style. They are closed on Sundays because they are all at church."}
{"text":"Nice burger. Nothing fancy( not much of fusion burgers with out of ordinary ingridiant)  just a well maid good quality burgers. Great for takeout or sitting in"}
{"text":"Key Features: The Option...  So here's the deal - everyone says this is the best burger in the city.  And it's a tasty burger.  It is.  There's no denying how tasty it is.  And, when they put \"the option\" on top, well - that's a little something special as well.    What is this option?  It's a giant mushroom, stuffed with cheese, deep fried.  Sounds good right?  But to get it on your burger - you're looking at ten dollars.  Ten dollars!  You just made the trek all the way out the east end of Toronto.  Some might argue, they should be paying you for taking the trip - but, no, the East End is growing, and - so - why shouldn't it have a lovely little burger joint?    If you charged me ten bucks for a burger, I'd sit there - I'd eat it.  I'd like it.  But the thing is, you can't sit there.  You just can't.  Eating inside is not allowed.  And there's nowhere around to go.  So, either you spend twenty minutes walking to the beach, and eating it there - by which time your burger is cold.  Or, you sit in the KFC parking lot, and scarf down your meat-wich.    This aspect?  It's not ideal.    Sure, the burger's good.  It's really tasty.  On its own, there's no reason not to love it.  The option makes it a flavour treat you can't get anywhere else.  But - the price?  That takes it down a peg.  The inability to actually enjoy your meal, due to seeking a place to eat it?  That takes it down a peg.    Go there once, say you've done it, and appreciate the experience.  If you have a friend with a car - trick them into taking you back.  After all, that burger tastes a lot better sitting in the passenger seat, than it does sitting, cold, on the curb.  But, if you're looking for a good meal, well - there are probably better... options... out there.  Ohh - and it should be noted, one ten dollar burger probably won't fill you. So, that's strike three, I guess."}
{"text":"This location could not be better situated for me, personally. Literally a block's walk away from where I usually hang out, the wholesome patty deity is sinfully convenient.  As far as the food goes, my usual gripe with burger's priest still exists. It's pretty pricey for an average-sized burger. Even though I complained about the cramped, oily space of the original location, at least it had that greasy hole-in-the-wall aesthetic appeal. This new place with the spacious seating, blacklight, and shiny floors makes it just seem like another semi-fast food place with a good but slightly expensive burger.  I'm adding an extra star because they were playing soulDecision when I came by. Nothing beats a Canadian pop boy band throwback. Fun fact: the lead singer of soulDecision is the guy who sang in Armin van Buuren's \"This is How it Feels\". Weird world colliding, huh?"}
{"text":"I don't pretend to be a burger or a meat connaisseur. Maybe I'm simply not knowledgeable/cultured enough to recognise the godliness of this place.  I just think it was cramped, and far, and busy, and cash only.  I had the Priest. True, the patty meat was very succulent, and the option was oozing with cheesiness goodness... But I don't know if it'd be worth it to smell like oil for the rest of the week to come all the way out here (it is so far!!).  I took a shower as soon as I got back home.  (Preparing for the onslaught of hate messages--hey, send them as compliments and I might just approve them! ;D)"}
{"text":"This review may be a reflection of the hype surrounding the B's P but I was thoroughly disappointed with the burger and fries. The burger meat was tasty and fresh but small (I had the high priest which is like a Big Mac type). I don't think not had any sauce on it even though it was supposed to. The fried were pretty soggy and small. For a cost of $17  it was very low value. You can get a better burger at almost any pub. I prefer Hero burger too"}
{"text":"I'm a little late to the burger craze, or perhaps I missed it. Anyway, I tried my first Burgers Priest burger today and I gotta say I was underwhelmed. Greasy, very small, with a prefab bun. Not worth $7."}
{"text":"A moist burger with traditional fixings, burger priest doesn't disappoint. While the fries and milkshake are not recommended, the burger by itself is a worthy dinner item. Prepare for a modest wait as everything seemed to be made fresh. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I really liked my burger. I got the Vatican. The concept of it was great, and the food tasted fine. However, I feel that the burger was vastly overpriced.   Also, the building is absolutely tiny. Getting a table in the middle of the week was difficult, and when we finally found an open one, it was uncomfortably small and uneven. It was constantly moving, causing our waters to almost spill. I understand that to work with that amount of space you need smaller tables, but at least fix or replace the broken furniture."}
{"text":"Great core burger with neat unique add ons.  It's not the best burger I've had in Toronto but it is the best takeout burger I've had and the best value for a great quality burger.  The secret menu on their website is a cool gimmick and has some very delicious options to check out.   I'll be back...maybe tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Ordered from their 'secret menu' ;burger topped with a cheese stuffed, deep fried, mushroom. I thought would be the exact cure for our hangovers but, we left feeling unsatisfied. All the hype and long line may have convinced me this was going to be the best burger I've ever tasted but, after leaving with our 2 burgers, can of pop and small fries (for $30) we both agreed we wouldn't be back. Bun felt soggy and I wish they offered some sort of spice like jalapeños. I gave them a 3 because it was still decent, we liked the fries and the variety."}
{"text":"Grill upon order, definitely worth your time to wait and  the money spent! The burgers are marvellous as well as the cheese fries."}
{"text":"i ordered the vatican burger and it tasted like a more luxurious version of the big mac from mcdonalds. the sauce tasted the same but the quality of the burger was definitely better than mcdonalds. i ordered the chilli fries and i did not like that due to the chilli being too dry. i definitely like the burgers here"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger in Toronto. The Vatican (which is on the secret menu) is literally a burger surrounded by two grilled cheese sandwiches. Two things to keep in mind if you want to enjoy your experience here: 1) it's pricey 2) it's not fast food."}
{"text":"Some of the juiciest burgers I have ever eaten. I strongly recommend the double cheeseburger. It was just pure bliss!!! The High Priest was alright, but I felt that the pickles overpowered the burger. Next I'll try the Magnum then I will update the review."}
{"text":"Can a burger ruin your life?  Only time will tell...  It's taken me quite some time to come to terms with this place.  It's by no means fine dining...  The kind of stuff I LOVE to poo poo thanks to my starving-artist lifestyle and exposure to UBER-fine-dining.  (My last gig was at a place where the \"cheap\" cars were the BMWs and Mercs)  I honestly have been left speechless (nearly) by this place.  My first visit EVER was last week.  I had gone on a whim and a strong recommendation from one of my other starving-artist pals.  Being the nerdy googler that I am, I looked up what I thought I might like to try and off I went.  My first visit:  regular cheeseburger AND the \"Tower of Babel\" (which is a \"secret\" menu item).  I rode my bike thinking it would be a great way to convince myself that my gluttony wouldn't be too much of a factor that day...  So I went in, ordered my burgers, received my order and then rode down to the beach and enjoyed my burgers with a lake view.  I started with the cheese burger.  It was simple.  It was delicious.  It contained ALL the elements required for burger perfection.  Mind you...  This is by no means a gourmet burger.  This is just a brilliantly simple and classic execution.  No saffron mustard, no gourmet cheeses, no herb encrusted breads, no panoply of toppings.    Getting back to my second item: The Tower of Babel.  O...M...G!!!!!!  It was bite after bite of ooey, gooey, deliciousness.  It's not something that you can eat all together... Even with a mouth such as mine and a gluttony that knows no shame.  You simply MUST break it down somewhat to get it in your mouth.  Being the purist that I am, I did try.  And oh, how I did try.  Honestly though, the tower is simply too much over-the-top ooey-gooeyness for me.  I guess I'm getting old.  That said...  Once I had finished my 2 burgers I hopped on my bike and rode home.  The air was hot, the sky was blue, and by the time I got home I decided, that I had to go back...So I just turned around and rode straight back for dinner.  The staff were somewhat surprised to see me again so quickly but they happily took my order for 2 more fantastic burgers.  My dinner visit I had the \"High Priest\" and a double with \"smoke\" (panko battered, deep fried, jalapenos)  I once again returned to the beach and eagerly crammed down my two burgers.  While utterly stuffed during my ride home I kept obsessing about what burger I wanted to try next and how I was going to keep eating them without suffering a horrible diet-related fate.  In all honesty, I have NEVER before in my life ever obsessed about a burger for so long after I  ate it.  So much so, that I had to go back again.  This time with my wife and son.  Will I be back?  I'll have to use all of my will power to try to NOT go back.  But of course I will fail miserably.  Damn... these are some tasty burgers.  Damn you BP... You're going to kill me."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time since they opened in the area. We live in thw area but weve never been in there.   We ordered:   The Vatican (made with two grilled cheese)  Chili cheese fries Cheese burger  Cheese burger w. bacon  Side of fries 2 pop Mint Chocolate Chip Smoothie   It cost us around $40.   The vatican my husband enjoyed.  My six year old enjoyed the plain cheeseburger which was just one patty and a decent size for kids. I liked my burger, which was on the small side. The chili cheese fries was a bit much with the topping and it got cold quickly. The smoothie was amazing. But the fact that the pop isnt fountain drink, you better drink that can of pop slowly.   The seating was ok. It was a little sucky with the chairs  being small rectangular without a backrest. Winter time you have no where to put your coats. The tables are fairly small. Its not as family friendly. But the food was good for first try."}
{"text":"I ordered the Blue Steele burger. Very small burger. Couldn't be more than 4oz of meat. Surprising cause I'd thought they'd be much larger considering it was $9.95! The service was very slow as well but it wasn't very busy at all. I also requested the fries to be well done but they were simply warmed over & served as new. All-in-all not very impressive."}
{"text":"Burgers are good but a little pricey. Nice atmosphere though. Fries are good. Just be prepared to pay 13-14$ like at Five Guys."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but it was more hype than anything, Personally,  I don't think you get the value for what you're paying for. I ordered the cheeseburger with all the toppings they offer, and when I received my order, the burger was much smaller than I expected. They do give you a great amount of fries, but they were definitely not the best tasting."}
{"text":"There may come a time in everyone's life where you go on a journey to find a one of a kind burger experience. Burger's Priest will certainly help you get closer to that journeys end. No other burger spot I've ventured to delivers this kind of mouth watering experience time and time again. Each bite is as juicy and delicious as the last. I recommend the bacon double cheese burger with fries and a milkshake to take you there. Don't forget to throw in a freshly baked gooey chocolate chip cookie or two for good measure."}
{"text":"It's foregone and everyone is aware of this but best burger in the city (and it's not even close). Best I've ever had anywhere frankly. Get there early for lunch or you'll be waiting for a while."}
{"text":"Kind of maddening seeing the low reviews. Makes no sense but in any case... All time favourite burger and it's not even close. I don't like anything fancy just 2 cheeseburgers, no fries. Make sure to grab the free parking in the lot beside the building."}
{"text":"The Queen Street location is tiny but their burgers are fantastic! If you aren't easily offended by their foodie blasphemy you will probably get a kick out of getting your free range, grass-fed burger here. There are only a few stools to sit on so be prepared to pick up your burger to go. They only accept cash but do flex when it comes to making burgers.   I did not want a High Priest so they got me a low (one patty) version. My friend got an inverted Vatican City with the grilled cheese sandwich on the inside of the double patty hamburger. Server made his own milkshake for me: A Coffee Crisp Shake! Mocha with vanilla. Delicious.   Place is so tiny, no sign of a bathroom so do not plan to stay for long!

{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Hectic and busy all the time, but worth the wait.  Fresh delicious burgers, great malts/ shakes, and scrumptious fries make for a satisfying meal.  Have been to this location a few times since opening and I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch.  The place was packed with suits.  We stood back and read the menu board and then ordered our burgers. The server was helpful even though it seemed chaotic all around us.  We got our number and sat down. The tables were not wiped in the entire time we were there. Our burgers came out very tasty. The bun and meat and toppings were all fresh.  Our fries were soft and soggy and mostly nubs. But lucky for them I like my fries that way.  There were no forks to dip those nubs into ketchup to be found so we just used out fingers. Parking lot is shared and a little tough to maneuver around."}
{"text":"I save my burger consumption throughout a year to very high quality, good stuff (haha like in & out) and burger priest got the vote when I was in Toronto and they really delivered. The burger sizes are not overwhelming, and the ingredients seem to be of really great quality. They have this cheese stuffed onion that bursts when you bite into it with the burger...very very delicious."}
{"text":"I don't mind paying for good food. But this place is Over priced and really nothing special! Disappointed.."}
{"text":"Quoting my sister \"it's the only way to have a priest in your mouth.\" I'm talking about the burger. Get your mind out of the gutter!  Seriously, best burgers in Sauga. Moist, beefy and tasty. The chicken burger was good too.  If you're ever wondering what Jesus would do, come here. The last supper, oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with the hubby.  Very delicious.  Did you know that the owner used to work for In-N-Out?  My husband read up on the place and provided that factoid.  Atmosphere:  cramped space.  Not much space to sit - only a small counter with four stools.  We arrived around 12:45 and the place was still packed from the lunch rush.  Food:  amazing!  Juicy burger, lots of flavor.  First fries I've had that actually have replay value.  They don't turn into little hard sticks like other fast food chains.  I had the option, which is basically portabello mushrooms and cheese battered and fried in a bun with lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard and mayo.  Hubby had the priest, which is the option + a cheeseburger.  Would definitely go here again.  Service:  pretty quick, although we were at the end of the lunch rush.  It'd be cool if they opened up a place with seating."}
{"text":"Had a double bacon cheeseburger. Very formidable fast food burger. Reminded me of the Habit in the states. Lots of char flavor. Loved the fries. This place will definitely scratch the burger itch."}
{"text":"Best burger ever hands down. I've tried Big Smoke Burger and other similar burger joints, but nothing beats the Burger's Priest. Their burgers may not be the largest ones, but in terms of quality, nothing beats them. I like this location in particular because it has more options (shakes) than the original and there's room for people to sit and eat."}
{"text":"I hate to compare any burger joints with our west coast famous drive thru (burger place with the big yellow arrows on their logos), but this place is a little bit overpriced and I was quite underwhelmed with the quality and taste. I mean... If I am going to spend $10 for a burger with fries I would expect something like a restaurant served juicy burger. After waiting for the longest 10 mins of my life, all I got in my hand is a boring miniature with two stingy slices of bacon. The chili cheese fries was ok and the cheese wasn't even properly melted. The bill was actually $12. If I have to spend over 10 bucks on a burger combo I will definitely go somewhere else. Now I realized how spoiled Californians are in terms of selections burgers."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Hands down THE best burger I have ever had, and believe me I've had my share of beef, chicken and veggie burgers.   My boss mentioned Burger Priest to me and so I checked out the reviews and knew I had to have it. It's a little out of the way but after convincing Boyfriend - who doesn't even like burgers, to go here for dinner, we get there and hop into this ridiculous line up. Not a good start for him but not a big deal to me, everyone's gotta be waiting in the cold for a reason right? 20-25 mins goes by, which seems like forever when you smell grilled meatty goodness, fresh fries and everyone around you is telling you how delicious it is, but alas we order...  I get \" The Priest\" - cheeseburger + \"The Option\" (mushroom caps stuffed with cheesy, creamy garlicy goodness, battered and deep fried) Boyfriend gets a double cheeseburger w/ bacon and \"smoke\" (panko fried jalapenos),  we share chili cheese fries w/ smoke, no drinks.  Food in hand, tummies grumbling we run across the street to Harvey's and buy drinks so we could use they're warm spacious seating. haha, genius. After the near 30 minute wait for these burgers, we finish them in under 10! They are absolutely incredible. The patties are made from REAL fresh ground beef and are so juicy, with a touch of pink in the center (how it should be), the option is the most delicious ball of fried cheesy yumminess that you never knew you needed and the bun is glutton free and simply the vessel of which delivers this holy delight. The chili fries on the other hand we're good. Nothing as heavenly as the burgers, but still good. Boyfriend even loved his burger and can't wait to go back, as for me, I'm currently drooling just thinking about it...  **Heads Up - buy drinks from Harvey's and you've got a great place to sit and eat - call in and order ahead that way you beat the line - cash only - WATCH WHERE YOU PARK! Boyfriend got a $60 ticket"}
{"text":"I never liked burgers before my boyfriend made me try one from here. The menu is small but they don't need a big menu (although they have a 'secret menu'). The burgers themselves are small so it's not a feat that you have to conquer - it is a lot of grease but the portion makes up for it. I think the reason why I love their burgers is in the seasoning of their meat.. it's like an avalanche of flavour.. that's why they don't need fancy condiments. I always order the cheeseburger. They even use processed cheese and I still love their burger (weird because I'm a gourmet cheese lover). The line ups are typically long and even if you are first in line you will wait 5-10mins. The float is pretty good. Cash only. Price has a lot of value."}
{"text":"Okay, here's the set up... We just spent 4-5 hours doing the Tough Mudder course and we were all dirty, tired but most important of all, freaking hungry!!!  Sometimes the only way to satisfy that freaking hunger is a freaking burger!  My friend suggested Burger's Priest as it was on the way home and I've always wanted to try it.  Being 4 pm on a Sunday, the place was not too busy the place had ample seating.   I decided to go for the well known Vatican City with everything in it which was a double cheese burger sandwiched between two grill cheese sandwiches.  It was (pardon the pun) heavenly!  The grill cheese bread was more like a pancake and the beef was really juicy and tender and just greasy enough to be delicious!  Definitely a must try!  Staff was friendly and courteous while the food came out pretty quickly.   The only negative thing was that the fries were pretty bad...too dry and overcooked.  Not sure if this is the case with all locations but the 3 of us couldn't even finish one order.  Next time we will just go for the burgers which were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Quality beef and ingredients. Pricey though. For $9.75 for a double cheeseburger, I'd expect more.  Not a memorable experience that I'd recommend to others visiting Toronto as a \"must eat\" place. Still tasty."}
{"text":"This too good for everyday. The \"Option\" really is unique. Chilli cheese fries were just messy enough, but statewide over the top. Will definitely by back."}
{"text":"Worst time ever.. With 20$ you can get better deals and better burgers at McDonalds or Popeyes or Banh Mi Boys right across the street. Waste of time and the nastiest burgers I've ever had. Also the fries are salty like I'm actually eating salt. Total waste this place is popular just because of hype stuff on Instagram. Please save your money on something that is actually worth eating."}
{"text":"I had heard that this place had the best burger in Toronto. So I went there to check it out and I got the Priest, a cheeseburger that also has an option on top (an option is a deep fried portabello mushrooms stuffed with cheese). It was good, but the bun did not hold up at allllll. I sat outside on a bench and I struggled to eat it. The next time I went back I learned from my mistake and I got a plain cheeseburger. The bun this time held up perfectly and melded with the paddy and the cheese. It all just melted in my mouth, and I was thinking about it hours later. Sometimes I randomly think about it still. When this place comes to the west end I will become a regular."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go to the soft opening for the new Burger's Priest in Port Credit tonight, and had a great meal. The new location has a bigger space than some of the others, so you shouldn't have a problem getting a seat. It also has the same delicious menu.  I was able to try the California Classic and Religious Hypocrite when I was there. The California Classic was super delicious. I got it as a double, so it was a double cheeseburger with a pile of fried onions on two buttered buns. I would definitely consider ordering this secret menu item the next time I'm at the BP! The Hypocrite is the option with bacon, which was good, but I was really missing that burger :)  I also had the mint chocolate shake, and fries. The fries were tasty! And the shake tasted good, but it was hard to drink. There was a lot of whole chocolate chips left, and maybe wasn't pulverized enough. My friend had the same problem with the strawberry shake. Hopefully they iron that out.  I'm sure this Burger's Priest will be a big success in the neighbourhood. Enjoy Port Credit!"}
{"text":"This location is the WORST and needs to be shut down. Where do I start?  Service: they don't wear nametags, but the girl at cashier was rude as hell. When I told her I wanted Jarge style she asked if i wanted anything on top. I said no just what comes with the jarge. She gave me a dirty look as if im WRONG about my order and repeated \"you only want cheese mustard and onion?\" And i swear an \"ew\" almost came out. I said yup, just that (which us exactly how u order jarge and eat jarge...adding other shit would defeat the purpose.  Anyways. I got a receipt with my name on it and number 47 on receipt but noticed another lady had number 47 as well so good thing i caught that bcuz she almost took my order.  THEN above all that...they didn't give me jarge style!!!! It was a plain effin' burger with nothing on it!   EFF THIS PLACE! Rude as hell, and they don't know what they are doing. Go to OBQ burger instead which isnt much further."}
{"text":"The Tower of Babel. Sacrilegiously orgasmic.  Only downfall is the wait time...but what do you expect from the burgers they gotta make? But the MAIN reason I only gave it 4 stars, was the lack of seating. So busy, yet they don't give a shit about their customers being able to seat down and eat? Disrespectful if you ask me."}
{"text":"By far, my favourite burger place in North York, Woodbridge, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, and Markham area!  The Priest Burger is soooo awesome and is my favourite on the list.    They take 2 portobello mushrooms and then sandwich cheese inside it and deep fry with with panko crust. Then they add a awesome 4 to 5 oz patty and that the Priest Burger!!  The bun is perfect size, the beef patty is just hanging out of the bun a little bit and then it starts to get messy as you continue eating it. The cheese melts out of the portobello mushroom at a perfect rate everytime!! With a single big bite, you can taste a perfect portion of each distinct layer!!  Everything is just so perfect about this burger everytime!!  My mom normally doesn't like eating burgers, but she actually finished the first burger and asked if we could order seconds!!!  If you're a vegetarian, this is the place to go - hands down the best veggie burger you will ever have!!!"}
{"text":"A quick update. It's as though someone was reading what I wrote and took every complaint to heart and were waiting for me (who orders the same thing twice with this screwy name?). The chicken was definitely still in pieces but the bun held together this time, the gravy and corn working with the sandwich rather than against it. I didn't quite need the shower I needed the first time. Hebrew on the wall replaced with Greek..go figure. French fries are pretty awesome and should be for what's charged for them."}
{"text":"As a first-timer to any Burger's Priest, I thought my experience was as per the 3-3.5* Yelp rating, A-OK!  What to expect?  Loud pop music.  Soo loud that you probably won't be able to carry on a conversation.  And depending on what time you dine, it may/may not be busy as this location is newly opened.  Price-wise, burger's are like ~$10 average, a combo with reg fries will set you back $15.  Chilli fries were $5.99, milkshakes ~$5.  Contrary to the \"secret menu\" at In-N-Out, the prices vary and aren't the same as their other burgers on their posted menu which to me, sorta defeats the thrill of getting a deal.  Size-wise, the actually patty is a little bigger than McD's and freshly pressed - no chewy burgers here.  Do not expect a larger portion just because you're paying more.  I thought it was a reasonable portion, but people with bigger appetites might find it on the small side.  Taste-wise - good, messy, greasy (depending on what you order), but not heavy.  Bun is probably buttered, but nice 'n fluffy.  That's the best way I could describe it.  For me, BP will be a \"once in a while treat when I feel like a burger\".  However, due to cost/health, I probably won't become a regular.  TIP:  \"Secret menu\" is ONLINE only.  No Wifi on-site."}
{"text":"Have been twice. My daughter told me they had gluten free buns and fries and that they were delicious. She was right. My first time was a single, upped it to a double as I was quite. hungry The food is simple, delicious AND fresh. No real complaints although a real milkshake would be nice. We will be repeat customers, which is saying a lot as I live in Thornhill and my business is in North York so it is a fair drive for us. Yes - it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went to the Queen West branch yesterday at 7:30 pm.  First impression: Dirty tables, Used and unused napkins lying on the floor, narrow seating with lots of elbow jostling space to cozy up with strangers at the next table.  From Order to Delivery: Reasonable wait times, but no space to wait.  Ordered the Bacon Double Cheese burger and fries, paid $15. Really?? For an ordinary slightly dry burger? Have eaten better at a few Irish pubs. Disappointed,, we will not bother again.  Looking forward to try the Burgernator at Augusta Ave., Kensington market."}
{"text":"Got the option! Veggie burger. With ooey gooey cheese inside. Love it! Definitely craving them. Btw don't let the pics fool you, kind of on the small side. Feels like the size of my fist. :)"}
{"text":"Holy!!! Amazing burger! I got the High Priest was The Option, absolutely divine. Best burger ever!!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best burger I've had in my life ! There burgers are melt in your mouth juicy and lots of flavor ! The burgers priest is a must try ! Amazing fries as well !"}
{"text":"Checked out TBP last week at the Queensway. It was a bit busy at 5pm, but luckily no wait in line or too long of a wait for the burgers. However, by 5:30pm a line started. I had the single California burger. Also had fries and a root beer float. Burger = pretty darn good. The bread was just amazing! Fries were pretty good too and the float was okay. $7.99 for the burger which sure, it's a little pricey, but I'd purchase it again. I'd skip on the fries and float though!"}
{"text":"My greasy addiction; so sweet the affliction.  Save me now oh hallowed grill and grant my soul...er I mean tummy...that eternal satisfaction.  Modest like a monk this place grants you salvation from hunger with their amazing burgers.  If you're having a \"Big Mac\" attack try their high priest burger or if you feel sinful try their very un-forgiving secret menu: http://www.theburgerspriest.com/secret-menu/"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about how awesome this place was so I'll give it another shot.  I just had the priest and it was really tasty.  The cheesy fried portabella mushroom was a great touch on the the tradition cheeseburger concept. I have a feeling that I'll need to be really drunk and really hungry the next time because I want to give some of the outrageous mountain high burgers a try. I should make sure I have $50 on me when I do because this place is expensive."}
{"text":"I haven't had a tasty fresh ground beef burger in a while.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Single California burger and it was amazing.  Fresh fresh fresh!  The buns inverted, were toasted with butter, ummmmmm, yummy, special sauce, lettuce, tomatoes.  Fries were awesome as well.  Got to go!"}
{"text":"These are some quality burgers and they are DELICIOUS!! Worth a try if you are ever in the area. The only downside is that it is a bit too oily for my personal pref. It's almost like juicy..but oily juicy. Other than that they make great burgers!"}
{"text":"Burger's Priest changed the way I see burgers the first time I had it, and the new location doesn't disappoint. The same great patty with the perfect crust on the outside and just the right amount of cheese and toppings. You taste every ingredient and they come together perfectly.  This time I also tried the chili cheese fries and wasn't impressed. No skimping on cheese or chili, but lacked seasoning and the fries were nothing special. I'll go for a milkshake or float next time instead :)  For those familiar with the secret menu, they seem to have most of the secret menu posted at this location. This location also has more seating than the one at yonge and lawrence I'm familiar with, though it's still hard to get a seat because there was a line to the door the entire time I was there.   PS at Burger's Priest I'm a plain single cheeseburger kind of girl. They have all kinds of combos but the simple ingredients are just so outstanding I see no reason to mess with that. And did I mention this is literally the best burger I have ever had?"}
{"text":"Been to Burger's Priest about three times now, and I always enjoy my food. The beef is so fresh and well cooked, it kind of just melts in your mouth. They also have a secret menu that you can check out on their website!  A basic burger such as the Low Priest would only cost around 5-6 dollars! My friend ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and chili cheese fries which totaled up to around $20.   If you're up for a challenge, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (secret menu) is a must try. It can get sloppy though, so be careful!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent here! The burger fries and oh that orange creamsicle pop drink....amazeballs!"}
{"text":"After hearing many reviews from my friends, I've decided to finally take the plunge. Was quite shocked that there wasn't a lineup as I was told there would always be a line for this place, so I'm definitely off to a good start. Placed my order for the Vatican and this is where the only problem I had was. After placing my order, I expected to dine in only to find that there are no seats. After about 10minutes, I managed to snag a seat just in time as my fresh burger arrives.  Vatican is a cheese burger with the buns replaced with grilled cheese sammies. Fantastic idea! Every bite was just cheesey and buttery goodness! After my first bite I soon understood why people loved this place! If you're looking for a healthy burger, this is definitely not the place for you. The law of diminishing returns did not apply to this burger. Every bite had the same initial level of satisfaction till the very end. Be prepared for a mess though!"}
{"text":"I literally felt my arteries clogging as I chomped on this deliciously unhealthy burger.  The Vatican is a cheese burger wedged between two grilled cheeses. That sounds like death doesn't it? Well, it also tasted like it. I can't deny that it was good, but I felt my arteries clogging as I ate this burger.   It's definitely an interesting concept, but I don't think I'd ever attempt to eat the whole thing by myself again. It was so filling that I couldn't finish my chili cheese fries :( which made me pretty sad.   My meal with a drink, burger, and fries came out to about $20, which is a bit pricey in my opinion.   I thought it was pretty clever that you had to know a couple answers to a few questions to access their secret menu online."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at the Burger's Priest. I'd never had one of their burgers before but had heard they were good so thought I'd check it out.  I got there just about noon.  I ordered a High Priest burger (minus the cheese, lettuce and onions) and a Diet Coke.  The fella taking my order asked if I wanted to make it a combo (so add fries) and I said okay.  It came to about $16 including tax.  Whether you eat in or take it out, your meal comes in a bag.  The patties were good ... tasty and juicy.  But the bun didn't stand up and it all ended up kind of soggy and mushy, especially the middle bun.  I'm not a fan of big buns but I think they should make the bun a bit more substantial.  The fries were good, though I only had a few.  When I ordered my burger, I hadn't planned on getting fries.  Once I got added the fries, I should have downsized my burger to a single patty.  There were a lot of fries so here's a tip ... if you go with someone, just get one order as it will be more than enough.   I'm glad I got a chance to see what all the fuss was about but I don't think I'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"Emmmmm! If you are looking for good, simple delicious hamburgers and fries then you have come to the right place..........Priest Burgers. I had the California  Burger. All meat no fillers in the patti. Probably could have eaten a double beef Patti but a girl needs to watch her figure :) French fries were fresh and finder licking good. Service was fast, friendly, and the lineups move fast. Looking forward to my next burger.   Very few seats, so you need to be fast to grab the next available table. Good music. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here the other night (st Patrick's day) ... Around 930 PM. Of course everyone was craving greasy burgers after a day of drinks... I don't blame them. This location which is way bigger than queen was PACKED but not obnoxious packed... The turn around with table is great and they get you your order ASAP. Their burgers are the best and the fries are huge for one order. So impressed with how clean the restaurant  was kept ! This is still my fav burger in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place has expanded so much now that I find one everywhere I look.   The burgers here are pretty good. But they're getting too outrageous for me. When it first opened there was only a few burgers and an extensive secret menu. Seems that most of their secret menu is not that secret anymore and they had to resort to much crazier secret menu items.   This place mimics or pays homage (depending on if you like their burgers or not) to a bunch of different burger places. For example, the High Priest = Big Mac, the Priest (burger with portabella mushroom) = the Shack Stack at Shake Shack. While I think the intent comes from the right place, I always find myself comparing to the original and it never being the same as the original.   Overall their burgers are pretty good and the fries are not bad, but definitely pretty hyped up."}
{"text":"I have been hearing from many people about burger joints popping up all over the GTA. One in particular is Burger Priest. I decided to try it out on my lunch break. This location is hidden in Weston road in Woodbridge. The menu is impressive and very tempting with the unique toppings. I'm a meat lover when it comes to burgers, but their vegetarian burger sounded just as delicious. The vegetarian burgers was called The Option. It was two portobello mushroom caps, panko crusted, stuffed with cheese deep fried. I ordered The Priest burger which was the best of both worlds. It's the Cheeseburger with The Option on top *Drool* Looks like I'm going to work extra hard to fit into my wedding dress fitting next month YOLO!  The service was friendly and helpful for newbies to the joint and the place was fairly clean for lunch rush hour. The wait wasn't that long to get my heart attack burger. I enjoyed every bit of it, and it was delicious, but I felt quite gross after I ate the burger as it was super greasy. I don't think I'd do that to myself again, but I did enjoy the burger!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers! I am pretty loyal to Woody's, but happy to see they took over a bit of a run down building and really cleaned it up. Lick's next door must be feeling the burn!  We went when it was pretty new (maybe a week), so I'm willing to give a bit of leeway on some things. But the burgers were as good as always. I am surprised the High Priest is on the main menu now, guess it is no longer a secret! The secret menu is available online to those in the know.  I like this location so much more than the Coxwell location because there is a place to sit!"}
{"text":"I like it....but...  1) Making me hunt down your secret menu online, is a pain. I had the High Priest, which is their version of the Big Mac. Google \"Burger Priest Secret Menu\" I am forgetful, and change my mind easily when i see something tasty on a menu. There is just a basic menu on the wall, but have to be in the know for their full menu.  2) It is popular and small (no seating area inside for eating, just waiting!), so the lineup is down the street (15 min wait). There really isn't anywhere to sit and eat. There is a library across the street that had a bench open up luckily. But otherwise we were kinda stuck.  Anyways, i had the High Priest, which was really good! A much better version of the Big Mac that's for sure! Very good meat, and it is all made right under your nose.  Don't let my review scare you, definitely try Burger Priest. Just have to have your wits and patience about you before going."}
{"text":"This place is close to where I live, so I've been a couple of times. The burger is okay, a little greasy like everyone says, but it definitely fills you up. I usually just get the cheeseburger, but my husband gets the Priest.  Cash-only, no place to sit when it's crowded, which I can live with.  However, the service is terrible. The girl behind the counter was so rude the first time I came in, and I didn't really know what to get. My husband usually orders, but we had the dog in the car, and we were parked in a spot where we might have to move (we knew ahead of time that we wouldn't be able to eat in, because of the dog). When you come to this place, you definitely have to know exactly what you want.   Even after, the next few times I still find their service rude. I mean, this isn't really \"fast food\" like McDonalds, this is pretty expensive gourmet burgers. It has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Blessed is this burger that thy are want to eat. Order I shall and order I did. 'What can thy get yee oh burger lover?' thy nubile cashier thus asked. 'Thy double hamburger I shall feast on, with thy pickles, thy onions, thy lettuce, thy tomatoes, thy ketchup and mustard', I did respond. 'Would thee like fries and a drink', she tempted. Tempted thy was and thusly ordered thee fries and coke.  It happened that I needed to sit and wait for thy feast of feasts. I sat on thy rail along thy wall of scripture and awaited thy golden bread and accompaniments. Not a mere five minutes did thy expeditor of thy burger establishment call out my name and hand me my order.  Oh what glee, what joy, what amusement did thy fries have in store. Golden yellow and thusly fresh cut and fried, thy taste was justly decreed delicious, thy fry, no slave to competition. And I shall carry out judgement on yee fries and thy judgement is they compare to no other. And with an outstretched arm and with little trepidation I do declare thy fries to be a winner.  And they burger, how do thee compare?  Blessed are the chefs that created thy burger. Blessed are they whom bought the beef and thusly ground it in house. Blessed are thee whom made such a multitude of flavours for thy slave of the burger to enjoy. Had thy burger been half as tasty it would of sufficed.  Thy Burger's Priest has brought thee out of home and across the sea of traffic to thy doors of flavour and enjoyment. Thy burger, and thusly all it's toppings, be thy greatest of the great where altogether thy toppings and thy meat and thy bun shall blend together and melt in thee mouth. Blessed is the Priest whom has made perfection in burger form.  Blessed is he who has drowned his competition into mediocrity. Thy need only be thy Priest, and all shall pass over the others as thy have not done in the past. And mother's and father's shall tell thy child that in this city thy Priest is king, thy Priest is perfection, thy Priest is burger bliss.  Thus it is our duty to laud, to praise, to exalt, to adore, to bless, to elevate and to honour the Priest that has performed thy miracle of burger magic. He took as from average to okay burgers to redemption and celebration. Therefore let us recite a new song of praise, let is recite Hallelujah, Praise Thy Burger's Priest!  Out of 7 The Burger's Priest scores 7"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!! The first time I had this place I couldn't wait to go back. I bring my friends here all the time and they love it.   The burgers here are amazing, not too much in them and all the flavours are balanced yet you can still taste the amazing beef.   Price here for what you get are amazing, I got the High Priest burger (shown in the picture) which is 2 beef patties and an extra bun in the middle for 10.49. For a giant burger like that, it's a very good price since you can eat it as a stand alone meal. fries are 3.99 and cheesy fries are 5.99 if you're looking for a bigger meal. You can also upgrade most burgers to double patties.   The seating isn't ideal here, very small tables and seats but they're big enough if you're just two people. they don't have any seats for group expect maybe the booth type seating by the window, still a squeeze though. We stopped in at about 3:30 and it was empty but skip to 4:00pm and there were no spots left. so this place fills up very fast, luckily people don't sit here for a long time and usually run in for a quick bite so while you're ordering someone may clear out.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal and anyone who is a fan of good beef. If youre not a fan of greasy burgers you may or may not be that into this place, it's not the greasiest but it's not a dry burger either. Some burgers have more toppings than others and may be a bit messier than others."}
{"text":"A must try according to Yelp so we're getting it to-go for our flight back to Seattle. 3 stars may changed once we eat it. Can't wait! Update: so the Vatican City was sooooo BOMB!!!! So frickin' delicious! They should open one in the States (especially Seattle!!). Giving it 5 stars!!!!!"}

{"text":"I'm not as impressed with the Queen West location of The Burger's Priest. Maybe I was spoiled by going to the Yonge/Lawrence version on off hours and not having to stand in a huge line up. Or maybe I'm burning out on greasy burgers.   Secret menus are fun (Vatican City for the win!) but every time I go there seems to be less and less distancing TBP from something Five Guys."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the low priest.  Generally i love burgers but I was disappointed by this one. I took it to go and ate it about 5 minutes later.... it was already cold. All the ingredients seemed cheap except for the patty. This is something i would expect from McDonalds, not a fast food place that charges 10+ dollars for a burger.  The meat and bread was definitely the highlight which was unfortunate because the rest of it should be so simple  I also got a milkshake which was very think and enjoyable. I would certainly recommend this to any folks who come in there.  Another issue i had was just the overall environment, its kind of a mess with some people being called by number, others by name and a lot of people standing around. In addition if you sit down there is no room for the people next to you to sit. The chairs also have no room to hang your coat...   Overall decent food, excellent shake, bad atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place FOREVER but had never been. Finally decided that today was the day..... Now that my best friend and I are on the quest for Toronto's best burger! WELL...... This was TOP NOTCH!!!!! Super delicious! I had the California burger. The bun was so full of buttery goodness that I had to use a napkin after every bite, but I didn't care! I did pick out some of the onion because there was a bit much in there, but other than that...... PERFECTION!  WARNING: it's cash only here!!"}
{"text":"Paid $18.75 for a Burger, Fries and Drink Combo.  I was expecting some awesomeness of a burger but honestly it was the same burger you would get at any other mom/pop burger restaurant.  It's worth giving it a shot still for your experience and saying that you got blessed from them.  I say Check it out at least once"}
{"text":"We tried this new location last night around 8:30. The smallish line took ten minutes to get to the front, our orders were placed and we were given a number (but they seem to be handed out randomly, not in numerical order a bad idea as it turns out).  Ten minutes later my number was called for my shake only and I nursed it as best I could but by the time I was finished our meal was still not ready. I went up to the counter and a sincerely mortified manager said he'd rush everything and he certainly did as five minutes later I was picking up our burgers.   He offered to do for us whatever we wanted, money back, anything! I suggested some kind of a coupon for a return visit and he asked me to come back after our meal was finished to pick it up.  There was still nothing but smiles at the table a full forty minutes after we'd arrived because the burgers are just that good. So good in fact that Returned to the counter and shook the managers hand and said thanks but no thanks to the coupon. \"The sincerity of your apology is enough.\"  We'll be back."}
{"text":"A true hole in the wall spot that becomes too crowded much of the time as customers award lay search for a spot to wait to hear their name called out.  Having said that the very expensive (at almost ten bucks) High Priest burger was as tasty I remember having since the opening of the original \"Licks\" in the 80's, a mile or so east on Queen.  I live in South Mississauga but I will be back, it was that good."}
{"text":"Great Burger Place!  The burger's really are juicy, but the place is a bit too loud for my tastes.  It is pretty expensive. I got a burger for $10.70 and I was still hungry after."}
{"text":"Oh dear.....looks like I love artery clogging burgers! This one was definitely the best I'd ever had... How could it not be with grilled cheese, butter, beef patties (cooked to perfection) and god knows what else was in there. I was here for the last 2014 Burger Brigade w/ some awesome Yelpers. This time, instead of ordering a crappy cheeseburger, I got the Vatican. Holy craps!! It was absolutely delish!   My hubby ordered the High Priest burger and it honestly reminded me of McD's Big Mac. He was also disappointed and ordered the Vatican after. Crazyyyyy! At least now we know to def. order the Vatican here !   Wish they would list the secret menu on site though instead of just online... and the prices! Yes I know... it's supposed to be a secret...  High Priest Burger is $ 9.79 Holy Smokes $ 9.68 Vatican City $ 11.59  Will definitely be back again....maybe next month for my bday so I can grab the Cheesecake Factory Godiva Cheesecake close by ......... :D   Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Defiantly one of my least favourite burger joints. Not a lot of options and not very many toppings. Also, fries were not up to par. How does one screw up fries?? Ask burger priest. They were small and short, hard and very oily. The quality of frozen fries they use is unacceptable and offensive to the human taste buds. Defiantly won't be going there again unless some things change. Service was good though. Their staff were polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Another one opens up. I half expected there to be a significant decline in quality but haven't seen that yet. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"finally got my ass in gear and went here to break a vegeterian friend 3 year non meat streak.  it was worth it and it was meant to be. we got there just in time for the last three burgers.      tip: do yourself a favour and add the smoked deep fried jalapeno's."}
{"text":"I haven't had a burger priest burger in 14 months! I had the double cheeseburger with bacon on a lettuce \"bun\" and shared a chocolate milkshake.   The burger was good but the last few times they haven't tasted as good as the first time I had one of their burgers. Thus the 4/5 stars.   The milkshake was amazing! Worth the $5.40 :)  And large enough to share as well. We had the chocolate flavour.   Still a great burger and I'm happy that Uber Eats delivers. Today the delivery took a long time (it was a stat holiday)....& the fries were soggy by the time they got to us (1.5 hrs after we ordered on the civic holiday/stat holiday Monday)."}
{"text":"They make a mean burger. As others have noted, basically In-n-Out burger just more hip, better quality, about twice the price, and no secret menu as far as I can tell.  The burger is just freshly ground beef. There's no egg, bread crumbs, barbecue sauce, etc. mixed in with the meat. Generally I'd consider this a bad thing but it works here, though it does mean the burgers fall apart because there's nothing to bind them.  \"The Option\" is real winner here. Rather than a lame veggie burger they give you two portobellos sandwiched around a pile of cheese, breaded, and deep friend.  And, best of all, the Priest ($9.99) gets you a cheeseburger and an \"Option\"; the best of both worlds. So freakin' amazing.  The fries are good but didn't impress as much as the burgers.  The owner was a little intense with his pitch about his vision: \"We're not a gourmet burger joint, we're a California road side burger house with some New York flair\". A little much perhaps but at least he's passionate, fun, and friendly.  Also, we showed up at least 1.5 hours before closing and just after we finished eating they ran out of burgers and closed up. Would have been a bit of a bummer if we'd got there 15 minutes later. So call ahead if you're showing up at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Love this location 1000 times better than the Queen and Spadina one. They take debit/cards, its much more spacious and its closer to the movie theater we go to :) we had the Vatican, which was amazing of course, and left extremely happy"}
{"text":"Okay, there's certainly a vibe and strategic marketing element, but the burgers are too small and not filling.  A burger should be something that hits home, is filling, affordable, and gives the every-man what he needs to make his meal.  Burger Priest is for those who have taken the every-man burger and added some glitz.    The burger to bun ratio was in favour of the bun; the whole burger was too small; the fries were okay (but I suspect I got the top half of a burned batch); I couldn't see the ingredients so I don't know if they were fresh (but given the rush I suspect they were).   Moreover, the burger to dollar ratio was in favour of the dollar (but rent is high on Queen St. West).  Way too many people and such a long wait for such a small burger.  I expected more, I hoped for more.  Maybe another day, maybe another burger."}
{"text":"Planned out my journey to Burger's Priest today - 40mins travel time (TTC). I dragged my friends along and we couldn't wait to sink our teeth into T.O's BEST BURGER! I finished it in about 5 mins,..juicy meat, bacon, cheese...GREATNESS. I didn't enjoy eating it outside in the rainy weather though. They need to expand a little, i'd like to sit iNSIDE."}
{"text":"Would love to give 5 stars but took one off because their fries were just weak. I'm not a fan of soggy fries. But I know some people are into that. Their burgers r awesome. I highly recommend getting any burger Vatican style if u r up for it. It's gonna be heavy but worth it. The option is also very tasty to add. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I had a heavenly last day--I was runnin' through The 6 with a bloated stomach. Before I made my last Toronto food stop at The Burger's Priest, I had Sweet Jesus. (Okay, I lied. I stopped by a random pizza place for water, but we all know that Nestle water ain't exactly holy water.)  Without the recommendation of a coworker, I probably would've never cared to look twice at this place. Being from a city where a burger place is within reach on almost every corner, frankly, I get easily tired of the sight of burgers (*gasp*). But when he told me of beef patties that were sandwiched between two grilled cheese buns, known as the Vatican City, I was sold. I don't know about you, but I pictured excess melted cheddar cheese coming from the bread and running through my fingers like a waterfall.   This thing was heavy--be prepared to not want to have another meal or move for the next few hours. Firstly, the burger was great. The patty was cooked well and the toppings were all perfect. I ate this before my flight and didn't even bother looking for food when I got home. The grilled cheese buns, on the other hand, weren't what I expected--they were thin buns, each with a thin slice of cheese--but I honestly wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this burger and a burger with regular buns because the grilled cheese didn't stand out. Pricey for burgers, but I also realize that they thrive on the gimmick."}
{"text":"This girls from that burger place called to get the F*** out and told me that I belong to ISIS as me as a customer?  I never had a chance to order a Vatican burger but the girl who was a cashier  told me it will not accept my burgers orders while the burger store is going to close in 5 minutes while I was there about 9:20 PM that I was treated me very unprofessional to me for their extreme poor customer service.  She were very discriminated and disrespect me and I will never ever go back there again!  Other burger store like Harvey's or McDonald's will kill the Burger Priest chain due to your poor customer service at the one on Queen Street East of Coxwell!   What a shameful why to treat me as a customer!"}
{"text":"Delicious every time!! Had the bacon double cheeseburger and chili fries! Extremely good and filling! Forgot to take a picture...was too busy stuffing my face =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for so long. I got the magnum and I was less than impressed. The burger meat lacked flavour and the overall size was smaller than we thought it would be. The fries were not greasy which I liked but there were many very short pieces that we over cooked and super crunchy. The shake was a watery consistency. Not a good first impression on us. Paid almost $40 for this underwhelming meal."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with BP, maybe its just this location, I don't know. What I do know is this....   Hubby and I went to try this place out yesterday for the first time. When we walked in it was packed (good sign right?) we were enthusiastic. We placed our orders and looked for a place to sit- sadly not enough seating areas. The service was excruciatingly slow and the music was so loud you couldn't hear the orders being called out.   Once we got our order we dug in.....to much disappointment the burgers looked so sloppy and thrown together  (mine was cold)  and both burgers were so greasy it saturated the buns they came in...so disgusting...i actually had to blot the burger down with napkins.   It also tasted so bland!   The fries were good at least.  We got home and within minutes I started feeling sick, threw up and hubby ended up with bad stomach cramps.   Not worth $30+ dollars. Id rather have a McDonalds crappy burger anytime."}
{"text":"My all time favourite burger joint. Quality of the beef, the variety of choices and the prices are what make this place a solid 4.5!!! Must try is the the priest which is their cheese burger topped with a Portobello mushroom cheese bun!"}
{"text":"Walking into this amazing establishment was took me to burger church and I was have a moment. I didn't eat my burger right away but later that evening that burger was still equally delicious, but my root bear float was on point! That ice cream was fantastic So much so that I was tempted to have a second one, but constrained myself because of all the attractive people sitting around me!   Can't wait for my next trip to Toronto for my next religious experience! Praise the burger!"}
{"text":"So after a few months of not being able to get east-end, I went back on New Year's Eve (best time to visit a busy burger joint ...ever and kudos for being open until 9:30 p.m.). After visiting Holy Chuck, I felt The Priest crew were not as friendly but the staff proved me wrong.   The new manager was very nice asking me how I was and how my burger was. It was refreshing to actually talk to the staff when I know they usually can't. That said, the fries weren't as good as I've had previously but the burger still tastes as good as it has.   To many more locations."}
{"text":"Love their burgers. The bun is soft and the burger juicy and hot. The only complaint is I always am so so thirsty after eating it. Also 10$ for a relatively small burger is something nice can't justify everyday.  It sure is yummy though"}
{"text":"The best way to describe their standard burger is like a high-end version of a McDonald's burger - in terms of size, and style.  It's a very good burger, but you'll probably need two to be full.  The fries were great - anytime I don't need to add anything to my fries, I know they're great fries."}
{"text":"I've heard and read so much about the Yonge and Lawrence location, I just had to try the place out now that it's just down the road from home.   My initial thought, wow, this place was busy, then I realized the line was for people waiting, but ordered already. There wasn't much in the way of seating either.   I tried the California burger, the kids shared a cheeseburger, and each had a juice, and the wife also had a cheeseburger and we shared a can of pop and all shared an order of fries, for $40, which is on the high side, especially when you see the size. To say the least I left hungry.   The seating is extremely cramped, and poorly laid out, get your meal to go!  I'll give them the interesting burger ideas and the burger did taste great. I heard a guy describe it as \"mother's milk\", I don't even want to know what that means. I'd be willing to come back for take out, if they ever increase the size of their burgers."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place and had to try and, yeah  nothing special. Unseasoned burger on a non toasted bun, does not work for me. On the whole the experience was just eh, regular. I can make a tastier burger at home, not knocking them I am just saying, very regular."}
{"text":"i've been here three times. mediocre every time. that being said, it all depends on what you're looking for. if you want something reminiscent of a mcdonald's hamburger - moist bun, patty fried on a flat top, stringy fries - you will die for burger priest. if you want something with some char and some texture, you won't be blown over. personally, i found the meat to decent, but underseasoned. the meat at grindhouse is superior and gbk is better seasoned. and unless you want to smell of umami for the rest of the day, i'd also recommending eating the burger outside."}
{"text":"A few things pop to mind when writing about this place:  1) The burgers are pretty good. 2) The \"Priest\" which is two portabello mushrooms with cheese deep fried, was pretty cool, and tasty. 3) The fries were twice fried it seems, fried once (or perhaps baked) and left out to cool, and when you order them fried again so they come out nice and crispy. 4) They don't have a restroom that customers can use. This is a pretty big negative for me. I do a lot of walking, and coming to a place without services means I can't drink water with my meal. 5) The burgers are rather large patties, but are not cooked to temperature. There was no option. They came out medium, which is fine, but I would have preferred the option to get mine rare. 6) The options for toppings is rather limited to your standard basics. No grilled onions, mushrooms, no jalapenos, etc. 7) No option for bacon? That made me pretty sad. I'm not a fan of cheese on a burger, but there was no option for anything else on the burgers here.  I probably would not return, but if someone was thinking of going here I wouldn't shy them away. If it's your first time, and you like mushrooms, cheese and fried things: Try the Priest.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The only missing star from this place is their seating space. All of their stores are quite small and busy so there is a line up all the time.  However, it is always worth the wait. Their burgers are very juicy and the sizes aren't as scary as some other chains. Honestly, I prefer quality over quantity and find that a burger that is well-made is better than one that I can hardly fit in my mouth.   The pricing is on par with other burger chains, in the $10 range. My preference is for the priest."}
{"text":"Learned about The Burger's Priest through a negative review someone left for Walburgers. We decided to take a chance and it was well worth it. The place is tiny but the food was great! My boyfriend had the High Priest burger and I had The Token (buffalo chicken). We also shared cheese fries. Everything was delicious. The special thing about Burger's Priest is the \"smash\" approach to their patties where they literally small a ball of beef on the grill so no two burgers are made the same. I recommend this place if you're looking for a quick lunch bite. I read in other reviews that their cookies are delicious (and they did look delicious) but we had other plans for dessert so we didn't get one. Maybe the next time we are in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"So after reading about the hype I went in and ordered what else...High Priest burger ...which ended up being too expensive for what you get although the beef is fresh the secret sauce is not all that great, for my side I ordered fries with gravy, gravy is soy base and was quite good, they throw in a moist chewy chocolate chip cookie which I thought was a nice touch, but the meal with tax for one person was $18.15 which is pretty steep fora fast food meal.."}
{"text":"I had this. I was so happy. The \"Vatican on ice\" from the burger priest. Ive thought about this in my younger/fatter years. But i was thinking of chocolate ganche in the grilled cheese. These guys  put Chocolate ice cream between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches. Amazzzzing!!! Crunchy, cheesy, buttery, a little salty, sweet & very decadent. It killed all cravings. Guys take your pregnant woman here. It litterally made me say jesus Christ. No wonder everything is religiously named. It kinda played tricks on my head. It was like, I was eating a burger and desert. Hitting 2 birds with one stone. I really didn't need to eat my other burger after this ,but..... I did. Had to see if it tasted as good as it looked. I had the priest. A fried panco mushroom patty with oohey gooey cheese inside. The cheese was just waiting for you to bust it open.  I'm happy."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here (courtesy of uber eats), so I can't comment on the actual experience of going in and ordering. However, I can comment on the food (uber eats is simply the delivery vessel). I have ordered twice - mainly because the first time my order was so completely wrong and I still wanted to try the burger. The first time I ordered, I selected the gfree bun, and also wrote a note in the notes section that my meal needed to be made gluten free. I ordered the high priest (a fancy Big Mac). It came on a grilled cheese sandwich bun - not gluten free obvs, which an additional grilled cheese sandwich in between the patties. So yeah, a complete waste - at least I got a refund.  The second time my order was actually correct. And although their gluten free bun isn't the best, I've had worse. And the high priest really does taste like a fancy Big Mac - something is gfree-ers must live without.  The fries were just okay. They were a bit too thin for my liking and overly oily. The whole meal made me feel like I needed to do a cleanse after. I doubt I'd ever eat food from here again"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a pretty good burger. Love those fried jalapeños and the mustard-grilled patties. But it's not THAT much better than Hero Burger a few doors down (or P & L Burger a few doors up), and there are just a few too many shortcomings for me to bother with the lineup again, even though I live just around the corner.  1): they've started getting careless. Last time I ordered a burger, they forgot the bacon I asked for. I paid for it, but I didn't get it. I was halfway through before I realized so I wasn't going to go back and ask for it, but this kind of thing really bothers me. You're making a burger, not doing advanced calculus. It shouldn't be that hard to give the customer what they have asked (and paid) for.   2) It's just way, way, WAY too loud in here. They blast some really terrible pop (Spears et al) at eardrum-bursting levels even in the middle of the afternoon when it's not that busy. Why? I can only assume to keep people moving. They want you to eat your burger and get out. Ok, fair enough, I get that the idea is to turn a profit. But if you want to make it an unpleasant experience, why not go the whole hog and hose the place down in urine, or turn off the heating, or get rid of the lighting? Seems inconsistent. I guess the idea is that they want to LOOK welcoming, so you'll come in (and buy), but they don't want you to stay.   3) The whole no debit/no credit thing. Really, cash only? In 2015? I understand those fees are a killer for small businesses, but I wouldn't mind paying a small fee for the convenience of being able to use a card. Right now I invariably get to the counter and place my order before remembering that I probably don't have enough cash to cover it (because I don't carry cash, because, um, 2015).   To summarise: good burgers, but they make it too difficult for me to keep coming back, which is a shame."}
{"text":"It is delicious, but it's just sooo greasy. I ordered the California burger and there was literally oil dripping out each bite I took.   Also, I feel like the burgers are decently priced but adding the \"combo\" is essentially adding some not-so-special fries with a drink for $6.00. Which makes your meal cost around $18 after tax. I thought the combo sucked and I'll only order the burger from now on lol.  Other than that I hate places that have crappy seating, I mean burger kings seating is probably 10x better than here."}
{"text":"I tried the Vatican which comes with grilled cheese instead of regular buns. Ran me about $20 with fries and a drink. I was pretty pumped to try it because I was looking for a good burger place I can go regularly in Toronto. And this was before I knew there are five guys in town. I also read very good reviews and Vatican was on some kind of must try list.  It was a strange experience. And it has to do with the grilled cheese. I guess my expectation was a patty and toppings between some toast bread. However, the bun felt like glutinous/soft dough with cheese inside although I think they just make it with regular buns. With the meat patty, the feeling in my mouth was strange and to be honest kind of creepy. I remember liking the patty quite a bit and wishing that they were surrounded by non creepy buns. I remember them pretty thin individually and juicy like shake shack patties just as how I like them. I might have fared better with just classic cheeseburger.   The fries were fine. They use some kind of nut oil (probs peanut) cuz you can taste it. I got a lot of the short pieces which made me feel like I was just served a bunch of leftover fries from different tables.   Soda was obviously great. Go crush.   Not worth the money. Indeed a hype. If you can't even control the doneness of your patty, why spend so much money on a burger when theres five guys. They are made to order, juicy patties, cheaper, and much better and probably longer fries."}
{"text":"My search continues for the perfect order here.  And I did not find it today.  Sure, I ate half of my burger before I even got back to my car in the LCBO lot.  Sure I inhaled the rest of it before I was able to pull out into Queen Street.  Sure it was still one of Toronto's best burgers... but it wasn't the perfect order, the one I will repeat again and again.  Last time I wasn't sold on the fries, and told myself that next time I would just get 2 burgers.  Today when I walked in, I had a crisis of financial conscience.  I didn't want to pay $5.29 each for 2 burgers, so I got one double burger instead ($8.80 out the door).  The meat was juicy, the flavours were robust and divine and the bun was delicious as always.    But the meat to bun to condiments ratio was undesirable.  The double burger is too much burger, sandwiched into one bun.  The flavour of meat was overwhelming and I could have had all the toppings or none of them and it would have tasted the same.  Like cow.  So my friends, I dare say that my second trip to Burger's Priest was still not the 5 star experience that I want it to be.  My order next time will be for 2 burgers, no fries and I'll buy a lemon tea beer at the LCBO.  We can get to 5 stars together."}
{"text":"Lived by here, but never got a chance to try it, cause i always stop at kfc cause its cheaper.  I felt like going for decent food for more money so i tried burger priest.  They burger was delicious, fall off the meat ground beef, so tender.  Don't know know what kind of beef they used but it was juicy.  To order, I went in and order.  Most of the people standing there are all waiting for their orders, i was like behind 15 people waiting.  I figure, well if so many people are waiting, it must be good.  And it was.  Took about 10-12 minutes cause i was far behind the queue.    Only thing i didn't like was the explanation of the menu.  What is \"the option\" and what is \"what's right\"? So i just ended up ordering the double.  Good place if your willing to spend a bit more for a burger."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, and had the cheeseburger and fries each time. Best tasting burger I've had in years. The ingredients are fresh and menu extensive. The service is efficient and friendly.   One order of fries is quite big so if you're not very hungry you could split the order with your \"dining companion\".   I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"great burgers, juicy, messy, tasty, but its a crowded little unwelcoming space, get it to go."}
{"text":"I'm not even a burger person, and these burgers have changed my life!!! The meat is the star, and I don't usually get anything fancy as this is the best way to taste how good their product is. Thankfully, there is a large turn around, so even if there are no seats when you arrive, by the time you get your burger there is usually a free chair. All and all with all the overpriced, trendy burger joints out there, this one is consistent and always serves a hot fantastic quality burger."}
{"text":"More Hype than Hallelujah!  Simply mediocre and not worth the money.   The priest burger was okay, but the fries were not (the oil was likely too hot when they dropped the fries in).  At $34 for two combos I can't say I'd be going back again."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this review short as I'm not a burger kinda gal but I sure enjoyed my burger at the burger priest.   I ordered the priest burger with the works. The ohhhhh so soft bun went so well with that tasty juicy patty. The fries must have been deep fried in lard because despite being kinda soggy, it had a really addictive taste to it.   It was definitely one of the better burger I had but shake shack is still my favourite. The only complaint I had was the wait. We waited 15 mins to place our order and another 15 mins to get it."}
{"text":"Just had a solid High Priest and some fries.   Respectable burger.   My buddy in town from California agree that Burgers Priest is  legit squashing quickly his boasts of IN N OUT"}
{"text":"Amazing meat , good portion for fries. Def better than five guys. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"So, I like to tell people that I love burgers, and I certainly eat plenty of them when I travel, but I am sure I blushed and flinched when asked what I thought of Burger Priest. Cause yeah, I had never been. Ick! Well, now I can finally cross this chain off my list! I dragged a bunch of my friends to Burger Priest several weeks ago, and believe it or not, but it was not hard to find 6 friends who had never been to Burger Priest either! Yeah, I wondered whether this knowledge warranted more introspection - were we the only weirdos that had never set foot in a Burger Priest joint in all of Toronto?? Sad.  Anywho, I had spent a great deal of time studying the menu at home, so I knew that I wanted to get The Priest because I was curious about both the regular beef patty, and The Option (their vegetarian option - a custom blend of cheesy goodness sandwiched between two roasted portabello mushrooms, breaded and deep-fried). And since I was starving, I decided to make it a combo with a coffee milkshake and fries. The total for this combo was approximately $21! Yep, $21! WTF?! But in all honesty, I had faith that this was going to be one of the best burgers, if not the best burger, that I have ever had. WRONG! I hated The Option! It was all cheese, which normally I would not have minded cause I LOVE cheese, but the problem however was that cheese had WAY too much garlic powder. All that I could taste was artificial garlic! So much so, that I could not even taste the meat! What a complete flop! The only saving grace were the fries and the shake. The fries were fried to perfection and plentiful, and the shake was thick and not lacking in coffee flavor - in a very good way. My friends were also not impressed, and the only person that was happy with their burger was the friend that got the special burger of the month which was a play on a Thanksgiving meal - fried chicken, gravy and corn.  Overall there was no value for money, small portions, and flavors were not balanced. Of course, we are not burger connoisseurs, but we all left wondering what the hell we missed! Why all the hype??"}
{"text":"All hail the High Priest! So much love for the Burger's Priest's scrumdiddlyumcious (sp?!) take on the BigMac. Happy to be across the way from these guys. It is cash only so I highly recommend heading to the lcbo for some juice and cash back - then boom - it's suddenly a perfect night in!"}
{"text":"A damn fine burger. This is how you'd make burgers at home if you knew how.  I still need to delve deeper into the menu, but the Vatican, and High Priest are both worthy creations. But it's hard to top the simplicity of the double double.  All the little drawbacks: cost, lack of seating, lineups... all that doesn't matter, because the second you bite into your burger you forget where you are, who you are, and anything extraneous that would ruin the moment between the burger and you. Go get your connection on."}
{"text":"Great burger spot! Everything always taste delicious here. I've been to Toronto a couple times and Burger Priest is always a must have when in town. Orange creamsicle milk shake is amazing as always. Burgers always fresh and always delicious. Sometimes it get busy and no places to sit in the small dining area. Bit pricey but well worth it"}
{"text":"Dropped by a few weeks ago at around 2pm during a Saturday and there was no lineup.  Place was fairly busy and the music was really loud inside (some may say too loud).  The service was friendly and food came fairly quick.  This location has lots of parking and there are lots of other food options around as well.   I had the double cheeseburger with fries and a can of Root beer.  Can't remember the total cost but it was not cheap.  Words can't describe it but this was the best burger i've had ... ever.   Patty was cooked right and it just kinda melts in your mouth.  This burger place is absolutely legit and i would highly recommend it if you're craving for a burger."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a very delicious old school styled burger with a contemporary punch! Back in the day burgers were juicy, made with solid ingredients and had great taste, not to mention they had some size on them! Today, burgers seem to have been caught amongst the fast food craze and lost their meaning and all these beautiful qualities. Burger's Priest seems to have kept this alive! The burgers on their menu are just that; flavourful, delicious, greasy, full of punch and you definitely feel full afterwards. A bit pricey for those used to the average burger joints but worth a try at least once or twice. I have had the 'pope' burger which is delicious as it comes with a deep fried portobello mushroom and cheese. Recently had the new Buffalo fried chicken burger with blue cheese and ranch sauce: very delicious, made with real slices of blue cheese and a homemade buffalo sauce that is not too spicy nor dull in flavour. Makes for a bit of a messy bite, as it drops in goodness. Grab a bottle of water and their fries with your meal, just completes then  experience.  Tips: Takes a bit of time to grab your food so be patient. Tables are very small, not really good for a group of people. Place is cramped. I advise grabbing your meal to go and hit the lakeside area, makes for a cool picnic.   $$$ 4/5 Would Go Again, Enjoy"}
{"text":"The Best Burger in TO I've been told. And after visiting I'd say check out the \"unseen\" aka secret menu (on Facebook) it's full of surprises. The \"High Priest\" isn't listed as a menu item but if you love Big Macs you'll love this."}
{"text":"I tried this place today. I'm sad I waited so long! I was VERY tempted to try the Option, but I wanted to try their burger first to see what the deal was.  I got the cheeseburger. I must say, it damn near melted in my mouth. It was delicious. Incredibly delicious.  Now I must try their Option. And maybe one day...the Priest. I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I must say though--get with the times and get Interac. Cash only? BOOURNS. Unless you have a deal with the ATM guy next door to split the service charge of the people you send there...I could understand that. ;)  Now I'll have to come up with excuses to go to the Beach(es) more!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Burger's Priest, and when they opened in Woodbridge I was SO HAPPY. The first time I visited the line up was out the door, so I came back last night with the Burger Brigade and it was still packed...but with Yelpers!  Ever since I tried their \"Option\" (2 portobello mushrooms panko-crusted and stuffed with cheese), I haven't looked back. Well, this time I needed to remind myself what their burger tasted like. It tasted like \"AMAZING\". I was audibly enjoying every single bite and trying to stretch and savour the eating experience. I had the simple cheeseburger complemented by a Dr. Pepper Cherry soda float which was perfect.  You do have to wait slightly longer for your burger, but this isn't McDonalds. The burgers here do not come from a drawer.  I enjoyed the fries, not the greatest ever but not bad at all. I am going to try the Priest next time...regular burger + option...best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"Ive been to burger priest before and had ordered the same thing, The Vatican with all the toppings. My girlfriend had picked me up this burger the other day and boy it was a flavourful burger! Thanks babe :)   The burgers are on the pricey side ( $10 + tax for one burger. No drink or fries incl.), but it was filling!   I personally recommend eating it in the restaurant if possible and not to go because it taste so much better off the grill.  This burger had two hand made patties and grilled cheese sandwiches as the buns.  One thing that i love when i eat a burger is grease and they got it! It was seeping through the bag a bit aha.   If you have ever tried holy chucks burgers as well i keep them on par. Maybe even leaning towards holy chucks a bit more!"}
{"text":"So delicious!   The Vatican City is my favourite but is not for the faint of heart! If you can handle a huge serving of beef and cheese, then you'll be fine. The buns are grilled cheese sandwiches, and there's either 2 or 3 of them. It's intense but amazing.  The High Priest is one of my favourites and is basically a healthier copycat of the McDonald's Big Mac.   The double cheeseburger is a delicious, \"lighter\" option.  The beef is fresh and high quality.   Fries are mediocre so I always hit up McDonald's nearby if I'm feeling like fries, but the burgers more than make up for the fries.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the original Queen East location.  And hipster kids hog the tables and aren't even eating!    Burgers don't seem to be as tasty as the East location.  The original is still the best."}
{"text":"Only after going to the Queen West location, did I realize how much better the original location is!  Burgers are juicier, tastier and faster.  Hubby loves his burgers Jarge style (cooked in mustard) Queen East gets a beautiful crust everytime, Queen West not so much.  And the best thing about the East location.... it's hipster free!   It's worth the drive to Queen and Coxwell!"}
{"text":"Three words: grilled cheese buns. Yup, you read that right. Grilled. Cheese. Buns.   I attempted to come here the night of NYE, but they ran out of patties! So I left hungry and a little bummed out. On my second trip here, I came by with my aunt, uncle and cousins.   All I have to say is: wow, this burger was ah-mazing. Coming from a girl who used to work at a burger joint, I know my burgers, and Burger's Priest knows what they're doing.  They have a ton of different kinds of burgers, plus a build your own menu. When I came in I tried The Vatican City - a double patty with lettuce and tomato sandwiched in between two grilled cheese buns. You have the option to do a single patty instead, so that's what I did. The burger itself was delicious - perfectly juicy, messy (as every good burger should be, according to my dad), and flavourful. I was in burger heaven! I also got a side of their fries. Their fries are small, hand cut and perfectly crispy. I was decently surprised. As someone who prefers larger fries, their small fries won me over.  They also have an assortment of sides, hot dogs, chicken burgers and milkshakes. I recently found out that they also have a secret menu which has a ton of different crazy, loaded burgers. Check out their secret menu online.   They've got a couple locations around Toronto, so you're bound to stumble upon one if you're wandering around the busier neighbourhoods.   It's been almost 2 months and I'm still dreaming about that Burger's Priest burger. Hey BP, why don't you open up a location in Vancouver? I'm sure you'd be just as successful over here!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Veggie-burger! I really enjoyed the menu as a vegetarian and have come back several times for the limited but delicious menu. It is cash only so hit the bank first."}
{"text":"These guys have really blown up and taking over the burger game in Ontario. Pretty sure they have a handful of outposts now.   Can't argue with their product.. burgers are damn good! Classic flat grill, served with some serious, heart attack inducing ingredients. I usually go with the pope, and get it Jarge- style. Basically two glorious patties, sandwich'ing the \"option\" - A breaded cheesy portobello mushroom, topped with mustard grilled onions etc.  If you can't find this, it's because BP has a secret menu. Check the website, it's not so secret. Skip the fries though - below average and you won't even finish them.     That said, it's a direct rip of the \"In and Out\" burger chain out on the U.S west coast - with triple the markup in cost. Nothing like here though, so for now...you win Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"Whenever you want a good quality burger that doesnt make you feel like crap after you eat it, This is the place to go.   They have a good amount of seating. I found it much better than holy chuck."}
{"text":"One of the best hamburgers that I have ever eaten!  Worth looking for if you are visiting Toronto and want a burger fix.    Not much for seating, so be prepared to take it to go.  Look at their website for secret menu ideas before heading out. You'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest burgers you'll ever eat!  BUT..  they're is only one cash register and usually there's a bit of a line.  So, it's not fast food.  Milkshakes here are delicious.  But the fries aren't that great.  If the fries were better, I would have given them a 5!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, The food here is great, and you can tell this is true by the long line that is always there every lunch. Just be advised, you will probably have a heart attack if you eat this 5 days in a row. Staff is very happy and friendly too."}
{"text":"Wow this place is good. I am a fan of nice burgers and this one is great. But don't think for once you are going to a place with any inkling of health involved. These burgers are a greasy, marvellous mess. The fries are amazing. The shakes are so good but soo bad for you.   If you don't have a heart attack on the way out, and aren't worried about crazy things like being health conscious. This is a great guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"The first time we went to this restaurant we really enjoyed it. My husband had a double cheeseburger and fries, that is pretty much his usual. I had a specialty burger that had fried onions, fried mushrooms bacon and cheese. It was amazing. We went back again and the hamburger I had wasn't on the menu any more. I was really disappointed. Their burgers have good flavour and the fries are good but they are pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The place was pretty packed. Its cash only...kinda bummer. But the burger is freakin good. Very juicy diner style burger. They have a \"secrete\" menu online. So good."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where I'd like to try everything on the menu, but alas, I was only in Toronto for the day.  I had the Magnum, a burger with blue cheese and bacon on it...I kept it simple, only adding onions.  I like the variety of options available, however, including 'smoke': panko-crusted, deep-fried jalepenos.  Anyway, the burger was great.  You could tell/taste that the beef was quality, and I loved that the blue cheese was actually (somehow) a SLICE rather than crumbles.  By American standards, the burger was on the small end, but you can stack em however high you like.  The price is a little on the high end for what it is.  The burger was awesome, yeah, but the dining experience wasn't great (hence the four stars).  The seating in this restaurant sucks.  There's not a lot of room, and the tables that they do have are really chintzy/small/weak.  You have to wait in this tiny little back corner for them to call your number, or else you won't hear them from the kitchen.  I also wasn't feeling the religious theme...you can't tell if they're going for serious or jokey and it ends up just being sort of creepy.  Nevertheless, I would probably get food from here again, but opt for take out next time."}
{"text":"Despite being right around the corner from TBP, I haven't dropped in, largely because of my disappointment of most of the new \"premium\" burger shops I've been too.  Today I took the bait and ordered out.  Since it wasn't busy, I spoke with the owner and one the first thing he told me was that TBP is not a gourmet burger joint but it was modeled after In-N-Out burger with some added new york flair.   Where I think he was incorrect was the gourmet part.  To some, gourmet might mean adding foie gras or truffles to the burger, but I think that TBP captured it with it's outstandingly fresh meat.  This burger was an outrageously moist, delicious arrangement.  Their vegetarian option, which is a highly inventive contraption, sandwiching cheese with two portobellos and then lightly battering with panko and frying was a huge hit.   I know they are new to the scene, but if they keep their customer service and their standards up, TBP will be a must have for burger lovers."}
{"text":"Had the High Priest and Magnum today. The burgers didn't seem as runny or greasy as the other locations which is great but at the same time the greasier burgers of the location seemed more delicious. Kinda undecided with which one I'd prefer.   This is a much bigger location, ambience is nice and definitely more spacious than most downtown locations."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out the hype that is Burger's Priest at their West end location.  Arrived around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed!  We ordered the double cheeseburger with bacon ($9.95) and the single cheeseburger combo ($10) and waited for a vacant table/seat.  We were able to sit down at the high top bar after a few minutes.  I was expecting a much longer wait for our food but was surprised when our number was called for pick up.  Both burgers were super hot and fresh, a bit on the smaller side for such a pricey burger but I'm a small eater so I didn't mind.  Fries were nice and crispy, straight from the fryer onto our place.  The generous portion was perfect for sharing.  All drinks at this location were either canned or bottled but they didn't provide a bin for recylcing.  I had to take my empty can home."}
{"text":"Still crave this burger weeks after going here.  I knew it was going to be good when I entered to the site of two people eating their burgers in silence, smiling the entire time.  I didn't know it was possible to smile and eat simultaneously.    I ordered just some standard hamburgers and cheeseburgers to take home.  The patties were freshly made in front of me and tossed on the griddle.  While I waited the two smiling guys ordered another pair of burgers.  In hindsight, they might have been high.  Regardless, when talking to them I found out they drove all the way from North York to visit this place.  However, this place loses 1 star for their lack of debit.  I understand the desire for simplicity, but in this day and age, debit is a necessity as most people don't carry cash with them.  To make things worse, there really isn't a reputable ATM within a decent walk of this place."}
{"text":"I feel like I shouldn't even have to write a review. Does this place even need any introduction? It's friggin Burger Priest! The patties are to die for!  I was the virgin on this trip and I could not believe my mouth. Just thinking about the four horsemen makes me hungry. I wish I was there!  If you are considering going - STOP. Put your phone in your pocket, the key in the ignition and drive. You have not lived a full life until you eat this burger!"}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about this chain. Well, I'm saying it loud and clear. Five Guys is simply better. For the price and portions this place is chintzy. I had the fiery one. Basically a cheese and bacon burger with a small amount of mild peppers - heck Harvey's does better. I'm not impressed. Meat is flat on flavour. Not likely to be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been to other BP locations, but unfortunately this one did not compare. The burger was fine. Not quite as good as I'd hoped for, and the wait time was painstaking. There was no lineup to place my order, and though there were a few customers, the place wasn't busy. I can't understand why one burger took them half an hour to make. Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Normally burgers are my last choice in terms of food, but I would eat here once or twice a week, all year. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"What can you say that hasn't been said about how good these gourmet burgers are.   They are so good that I would almost pay $30 just for a burger.  After lunch today I honestly thought to myself this is the meal that I want should I ever be on death row and they ask what my last meal is.  Send in Burger Priest."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers. My only complaint would be how they pack everything up. Careless, messy and not ok for a $10-$15 burger! I hate when they pack up the burgers & fries in the same bag and it pushes everything down. It gets super messy because the wrapping of the burgers is open!  Love their fries, but i wish they weren't so small, portion is great but hard to pick up when they are so small."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, maybe 3 stars on a good day. Since trying Shake Shack, I'm sad to report that the Burger's Priest burger is a pretty pale shadow by comparison. It's the same \"smash burger\" style, cooked on a flat griddle, but that's where the similarities end. The patty at Shake Shake is much beefier-tasting, properly seasoned, piping hot, RIDICULOUSLY delicious: basically, burger heaven. The Burger's Priest patty is softer, almost crumbly at times, greasy and sometimes bland, not as wonderfully seared or seasoned - just all around not as good. I can't go back to this."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger enthusiast but I was curious about the hype over this place. Went around 1pm, it was packed and loud so we took our order to go, the wait however wasn't long at all. I just got a single cheeseburger with all the toppings and order of fries, with all the mixed reviews I went in with no expectations. I thought the meat was very juicy and tasty, the bun was warm and soft and fries were very good too! The size is kinda small but I would go again, maybe next time I'll get a double."}
{"text":"I finally got around to checking what all the hype was about and I guess I still don't get it. I did take my order to go but with what I thought was wrong I don't think freshness was really the issue.   I didn't like the service the girl at cash gave. Though the guys on the line were swamped since it was noon, the man who handed me my burger had a better attitude than the girl who apparently just takes cash. The first person you deal with in a restaurant/food service place should be courteous, friendly and should at least try to smile. So boo to her.  I ordered The Priest to check out what their basic special burgers were and I was left underwhelmed. The mushroom was extremely salty and the beef was dry and crumbly. The mushroom did remain very crisp though I traveled home with the burger. The cheese in the mushroom and on the burger was pretty tasteless, probably because everything else was loaded with salt. The portion of the burger itself is quite small and unimpressive.  I also ordered a vanilla milkshake which was okay but started off tasting like banana. I think they failed to wipe down the machine between shakes.  So for almost $17 I was left unimpressed and unsatisfied. Sorry Burger Priest, you're just not for me.  Side note: I thought the whole \"religious\" thing was a joke but apparently this is some new attempt to proselytize? Check out the gospel section on their website. There should be a separation of church and sate."}
{"text":"I heard BP had the closest burger to In'N'Out in the States so after visiting InNOut I decided I would give BP another chance.  My double cheeseburger was delicious and traveled surprisingly well (streetcar 30 minutes). Service was also very good except for one thing... When I ordered I said I would like my burger with everything on it. Everything being whatever was on the little card by the cash. On that card was \"onions\" so when the cashier asked me if I wanted them raw or grilled, I thought it was a free option. It was not free, it was $1.49 and I was not informed of this. I was also turned off by how much upselling was happening in a simple transaction.  Would I come back? Probably not. The burger is expensive and I don't appreciate being misled. The good is that the burger, their core and basic product, is actually quite delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to most burger priest's and have been very satisfied with the food.  A few weeks ago I came to this one and ordered a priest with fries. I took it to go as this location is quite small and very busy.  After a few bites I found a long hair in my burger.  It really grossed me out.  I didn't want to make fuss so I didn't go back.  It definitely was not my hair because it is very short."}
{"text":"I went here because I wanted a burger like no other as in reviews and was currently in the area.The burger was big but bland and could have  used some spice.. I'm full (it's a big double cheeseburger that's why )but I don't feel like I ate something tasty it feels like I just ate at a expensive version of  Wendy's .  The chili cheese fries now that was good , and I don't even like chili but when I saw them putting one together I had to try...(No Regrets)  All in all it was not the place to eat if your on a budget ($35 for 2 ppl) or if your looking for a good burger ...I actually can't figure out a reason on why yOu guys should come here .."}
{"text":"Had the cheeseburger, probably could've eaten 5 of them. Easily the best burgers in the city."}
{"text":"It's been a little while since I've been so excited about a place that I thought about writing the review as soon as leaving and made sure to post the experience within 24 hours!!  I doubt you need to read this in another review, but I'll say it anyways; the owner(s) buy and grind the meat in small patches, and I can comfortably say I have never seen/tasted a fresher burger at any establishment! The fact that we received our burgers relatively quickly considering the lineup (4pm Monday), was greater testament to the fact that fresh food and speed can go hand in hand. I'll break the rest of the review down to sections you may or may not want to read:  The food: -The Priest, which is a double burger with a veggie and a beef patty is maybe the best burger I have ever had! I had quite a bit of trouble biting into the burger thanks to the stacked nature, but the taste more than made up for this factor. The veggie patty is a large Portobello mushroom filled with quality cheddar cheese and rolled in bread crumbs. Ah-mazing!! The beef patty is simple, but as mentioned, ultra fresh! I enjoyed watching the guys cook it to perfection. -The chilli cheese fries are also good, but I felt that the fries here, which are baked on sheets and then deep fried, are best enjoyed sans chilli and/or cheese. This is a good side nonetheless.  The ambiance: Burger Priest is not the largest burger shop I have been to, but I definitely had the best experience with the staff compared to any other place. I noted pictures of classic NYC burger joints on the wall (JG Melons etc) and was surprised to have a great discussion about various New York burgers with both of the brothers/owners (brotherhood to be verified)! Their knowledge of these joints, including even the people who select the beef for Shake Shack, was amazing. I later realized a large part of the small burger joint is run by an Armenian-Iranian family, and the mother of the boys in charge also came from the back to have a pleasant little chat with our group. During our stay, some patrons came in and asked for the owner, and he came from the back to personally greet them and chat with them. The fact that they are able to provide such a personal experience, along with speed and quality is simply amazing, and I hope they will be able to keep this up as they become increasingly popular.  Impact: -The Burger Priest resulted in an argument between me and two friends (notably Bijan V) regarding who should take credit for finding the establishment (in reality it is thanks to Yelp)! -3/3 votes for best burger in North America, with one friend claiming he has had better ones in Dubai. -The lingering taste left me dazed and drooling for the next 2-3 hours at the beach....consequently our team lost several sets at volleyball!"}
{"text":"The owner (or who I assuming is he owner) is really nice. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had but many other patrons were exclaiming that it was the best that they have had. My friend's gripe was that the meat isn't seasoned (I agree) but if you get a lot of toppings on your burger it's fine. My review may be skewed too because in my opinion the beef in Canada all tasted dif from the beef in the states. I actually would come back and try a chicken sandwich, the Buffalo chicken sandwich looked hella good.   They were so welcoming and that is enough to make me come back and try more items, I appreciated that."}
{"text":"Have fond memories of the OG location on Queen East which served up Toronto's answer to Shake Shack and In-N-Out. The buns are fresh and fluffy. The meat tastes super fresh and gets a little caramelized crust from the flattop. And all of it gets enveloped in silky smooth cheese. Add the allure of a (not so) secret menu, and you get something that's spread to more than 10 locations across the GTA. After years of beefing, decided to try a chicken sandwich, namely, The Token, which has Buffalo fried chicken, blue cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Also added an Option which is a panko crusted, deep fried portobello mushroom cap stuffed with cheese. Yeah, that's right. I really wanted to like this, but it's simply not as good as its cow-based brethren. First, the chicken is on the small side, almost slider size in fact, and buried under a much tastier mushroom which becomes the star. Second, the sauce is overwhelmingly tart with a lack of balance begging for more butter to smooth it out. The inflated price added insult to injury. Trust me: chicken out and stick with the beef."}
{"text":"In a recent past, that place had nice staff, juicy, greasy, tasty fresh burgers that were perhaps worth the price... that greasiness was what made these burgers different and original (though the reason for some to go elsewhere).  Time has passed and all of this is gone... disappeared... vanished... unpleasant mumbling cashier, dry overcooked bland burgers, dirtier smelly place but still higher prices....  Move on, bye-bye... with all the burger competitors around, if you cannot be sustainably consistent and good (and different in the good way)..."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I ordered the Priest, but it wasn't as good as the original location. The beef patty wasn't as thick and juicy as you get at the original, and the option on top not as crispy and delicious. Despite my gripes, the burger was still mighty delicious.  The fries are still junk, though. I think they need to rejig the fries recipe. I went with three buddies and two of them ordered fries. Both of them didn't finish them. Mind you, these are fat guys who eat EVERYTHING you put in front of them, so I was very surprised they didn't finish their fries. Another buddy ordered a regular cheeseburger and actually said he hated it.. I was shocked. He loved his milkshake, though.  I am very happy that this location has bathrooms, that is a bonus especially since I had to pee really bad.  Ordering was a bit odd. It was three young ladies who for some reason kept asking for my order, what I'd like on my burger and if I'd like to make it a combo. They would look at the cashier screen as a group, press some buttons, then look up at me and repeat a question I had already answered. I hadn't moved and repeated my order three times (The Priest with the works, no combo). It was like that movie Memento, but the crowdsourced version."}
{"text":"Not as great as the original location but still pretty damn good. It's busy as heck and seating can get a little tricky especially during lunch hours. I'm still not a fan of the crappy french fries at any of the burger's priests. Come on now, how can such a delicious burger place serve such below average french fries? Aside from that, burgers are outstanding. I got the armageddon last time I was here. Don't do that unless you are feeling very gluttonous and aren't worried about heart attacks. Oh and the cookies are good, too. Except after an armageddon."}
{"text":"Finally a burger worth Yelping about. The Priest is heavenly. You know it is good when the wax paper becomes transparent by the time you get to the car.  Fries are shit, skip them. Save room for another burger if you can."}
{"text":"the hotdog with the grilled cheese was really good. the vatican however was not. meat is too dry and usually i expect double cheeseburgers to just have double patties, not an extra bun too"}
{"text":"First time visiting here. First time at any burger priest for that matter.  Had always heard a lot of hype and I was super excited to try it out, however I must say it was a disappointing. The burger patty was very small. I would compare it to a burger you would receive at a charity BBQ Over cooked, lettuce was wilted, no love put into it. Damn ... It was expensive that's for sure. 2 burgers  (one with bacon) , some deep fried jalapeños? ( 5 little slices to be exact and oh man they were disgusting!! - tasted like deep fried green peppers.... ewww) and one \"poutine\" - came to $30.... had I not been so hung over I probably would have said something .... Lesson learned LOL"}
{"text":"This was my first time going here, and we choose it as it had gotten fairly good reviews. I really liked the look of the place, parts of it felt like I was if a confessional lol. I got the high priest with fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and lots of cheese. My only problem with the burger is that there was way to many pickles on it. I'd personally of asked for less next time I go. The price was not too bad for a freshly cooked burger and fries. I'd recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had is called the magnum burger. OMG - a must try with some fries and ketchup!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first ever trip to any of the Burger's Priest establishments. It was pretty good. However, I must say that I was expecting more.  The burger patty itself is made from a fresh mound of ground beef. They \"smash\" it right on the griddle. I like that. It's similar to the way that they prepare it at Stockyards. However, the meat is just not that flavourful. I prefer the Stockyards patty much better.  The toppings are somewhat interesting.   The fries were good, and the chili fries were tasty. The shakes are really nice too.  One of the downsides of this location seems to be that it's a central location, and the place is popular, so we had to wait for some 20 minutes for the order to be ready.  The prices are quite high."}
{"text":"Service was quick and the food is clean and delicious. Not too much room to sit though. We had to keep an eye out until a table opened.  I'll definitely be back regardless."}
{"text":"Really clean, no nonsense burgers that definitely hit the spot. I had a pretty decent sized order (7 burgers + fries) and didn't have to wait more than 10 or so minutes. I will definitely come back to The Burger's Priest when I'm back in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Having been to the other two locations, I already had a good idea of what to expect when I came here recently with the Yelp Burger Brigade. It was a messy, greesy, artery-clogging experience...and this is a GOOD thing.   I wasn`t particularly blown-away by the \"High Priest\" (their version of the Big Mac), but was quite satisfied going back to my current favourite burger \"The Vatican City.\" The tender meat patties are perfectly complemented by the oh-so-buttery grilled cheese sandwiches that are used to contain this oily delicious mess!  Only reason I didn't rate BP a \"5,\" is because I'm still not thrilled about needing to pay $12+ for one burger - even one as amazing as the Vatican. Until I stumble upon something better however, Burger's Priest is still my go-to place for gourmet burgers."}
{"text":"It's McDonald's without all the bad rep. Their secret sauce tastes like Big Mac secret sauce so if you feel like having Mcdonalds and you feel bad about it, this is where you would go. The burger is good, but didn't  make me fall off my chair or anything, which definitely does not make up for everything else this \"restaurant\" lacks.   It's a tiny little shop filled with people and you get in line to order in a hurry what you like. You are given a number, then herded to another line to wait in the greasy smoke for your food in a paper bag. There is no service: just impatience.  If you feel like eating in the crowded and uncomfortable small space, make sure you go with a friend who can stand in the crowd to scout and fight for a table while you order and wait for your food. There is nowhere to put your coat and bag and the seating is tiny and uncomfortable.   Going back to the food, the burger is good - nice and juicy but quite expensive: $24 for a cali burger + priest burger combo that included a soft drink and fries. Fries are kinda meh - a bit on the dry side.   I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The Burgers Priest still has the best burgers I've eaten in the world. I have tried burgers all across North America and Europe and I stand by BP having the best. My favourite is the Vatican with 2 patties in between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches. It is the ultimate fatty and glutinous meal. You will love every minute of it then want to die when you finish because you feel like you just ate 9,000 calories- very very worth it. And yes I prefer BP over Shake Shack and Five Guys and consider myself to be a burger connoisseur. Everyone deserves this burger in their life."}
{"text":"Really good burgers...really good... world class for sure...also had the portabella burger thing (think its called the priest), different and also really great. I liked their portion sizes and simplistic approach. Didnt feel stuffed after the meal, just well fed.  Their selection of drinks is a joke though. so is the attitude of the folks working there,- so cool it hurts. I will come back many times."}
{"text":"Ordered \"The Priest\", reminds me of Shake Shack burger in NYC.  The meat itself was OK but the 'option' was really amazing!  I love it.  Line up was crazy though."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I paid $5.99 for a very small burger which was good, I admit, very tasty, melt in your mouth, but microscopic!  I think most people who rave about this place don't want to admit they got ripped off and feel the need to justify shelling out so much for a perfectly ordinary tiny piece of meat. Either that or they are trendy hipster doofuses who somehow think egotistical cooks with attitude and cramped dining spaces are authentic and decide beforehand they are going to like it no matter if their senses and sensibility tell them otherwise.  I have no such qualm. I got ripped off and I'll admit it.   I can say I've tried it if it comes up in casual conversation but I will never be returning.  Don't believe the hype, folks. In all seriousness, you're better off going to Lick's. You can actually get something substantial and filling there."}
{"text":"Their double cheese burger is the best I have ever had in Toronto. Can't wait to go back again..."}
{"text":"Vanilla milkshake with malt is amazing and I love milkshakes.  And it's not like a sugar syrup LOL"}
{"text":"I just love a good old fashioned burger where it doesn't get too complicated with meat type or how the meat should be cooked. This burger is phenomenal. They put so much cheese into the priest, it just oozes out as you take a bite into it. My only qualm is that take take cash only, which for a visitor of Toronto, can be very annoying."}
{"text":"Did not have much expectations coming in after reading negative reviews for this location. However, I'm glad I took the chance. I ordered the cali burger, and it was awesome! My favourite is the bun, they grilled it so it's nice and crispy. Everything was tasty, my burger came with lettuce, tomato, secret sauce, and sauteed onions. It held together pretty good, first time I was able to finish a burger without leaving a mess. Didn't feel gross afterwards too. I would return just for the cali burger."}
{"text":"I'm from Toronto but have been living in Seattle for awhile now.  I love Toronto much more but Seattle has its upside too, mainly the great food scene.  The burgers in the West do rock !  When I heard about this Priest Burger place kicking butt in the big T, I got excited.  One of the first things I did when I came home to visit the folks was go check out The Priest Burger.  Man I was not disappointed.  They know how to make a great burger. I am a burger snob & The Burgers Priest rules.  Caramelization on the patties,fresh ground beef, secret menu, awesome !!! check it out"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. A little pricey for a burger and the space was way too cramped!!!  It was hard to wait inside and the streets were busy outside to wait. I do love their fries as they were smaller pieces with more Crispy surface area. Order the Vatican. And get a root beer with it."}
{"text":"I know there's already 250 reviews of this place, whatevs, I have another take on it and wish to address the quirks and follies of this place.  1. Size: \"This burger is tiny,\" a common whine.  A PORTION OF MEAT SHOULD BE THE SIZE OF YOUR PALM, NOT KING KONG'S, FATTY MCFATTINGTON.  Order two, that is what my son, Jughead Jones,  does.  2.  Too many rules, you can't eat inside, there is a secret menu, etc...that is why this place has character, it is just like CHURCH.  All crazy protocols that there is tension and excitement.  3.  I am convinced I am going to meet my future husband there.  When you go at prime time (6pm to 8 pm), you are crushed, tits to tail, in a tiny spot waiting for your order. There is nothing to do but Instagram, and check-in on Facebook, but when you are done that you can practise your social skills for real and maybe strike up a conversation like a real human.  4.  The fries rock.  5.  There are no superfluous condiments like feta cheese and chipotle anything. This is how God meant burgers to be eaten.  And the bun is perfection in its simplicity, no sesame seeds or stupid flaxy nuggets to contend with getting caught in your teeth.  6.  The \"Option\" is spooky, do not like!  But I like that it exists for the others.  I love going there!  There is always hope and it is close to the liquor store."}
{"text":"Wow. If you are a burger lover, this is the place to go. The food is absolutely delicious! Be careful, some of the burgers are HUGE. I had the Vatican City burger, and I struggled to finish it. Probably not the healthiest option either. It very much is a heart attack wrapped in wax paper. My only complaint is that the tables for eating in are tiny. I'd come here again. But only after I let my arteries unclog a bit."}
{"text":"4 stars very fair. Ok value, not great, and not the best burgers ever (as suggested), though very good, to be fair. Expect it to be a bit crowded, a bit pricey, and a bit overrated. If you're reading this, you probably already heard about this place and it's hype; don't expect it to live up to it's hype and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Do you love Shake Shack? This is probably the closest thing to an American burger. I always get the Fiery Furnace because it's very close to a SmokeShack burger. The cherry peppers.  The venue is only OK, same with the food. Although I'd still come back. Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Got the cheeseburger with the single patty and added bacon with other condiments. The burger was really good, the place was cute but a little pricey (but worth it). Also got a strawberry shake which good as well."}
{"text":"I became curious about The Burger's Priest after seeing it on so many \"Best of\" and \"Top 10\" lists. Even carnivores lauded the vegetarian \"Option\", so I made the journey over one night to pick myself up an Option for dinner.  Stepping into The Burger's Priest is basically the equivalent of going to church, because there are so many rules about what you can or can't do. Even though there are a couple of stools inside, there's a sign explicitly saying that there is no dining in. There's another sign on the door telling you how to line up, where to stand, etc. I guess there needs to be some law and order since it's an extremely tight space inside, and I feel like it's always pretty crowded in here.  After a bit of a wait, I traded my ticket for a brown paper bag holding the goods. Since it was cold and dark outside and I didn't want to stand on the sidewalk trying to juggle my belongings while simultaneously eating a messy burger, I had to wait until I was back at home to tuck in to my fully loaded \"Option\", which had already cooled down significantly, making the huge gob of cheese inside extremely rubbery and unpleasant. Also, for $7.99, the burger is fairly small. The breading on the mushrooms was crispy and good during the first few bites, but the deep-fried nature of the thing made me feel a bit sick afterwards.  The verdict: another one of those places where I don't really get the hype! For a place that's tiny, has no seating inside, and is a bit of a trek from the downtown core, I admit that it's impressive that The Burger's Priest has such a devoted following, even if I'm not a convert. My advice: don't come here super hungry, and don't come here with high expectations.  CASH ONLY (but there's an ATM inside)."}
{"text":"Since their first location, I used to trek there all the way from Woodbridge. I told them years ago to open a location in the bridge and glad they did. It's the perfect burger. I remember them telling me that they wanted to bring the In-n-out style burger here. They were the first to do it and now so many other places try to do the same; however, they do it the best. I hadnt had one in a long time until they introduced the keto buns, and I'm so glad they did. All the flavour minus the guilt or their delicious burgers. This new bun will now make me a more regular visitor!"}
{"text":"Came late Friday night and got our burgers quite quick. Had the California Classic which was delicious.... However, I can't say it's worth the price since it came out to almost $10 without fries. The burger I consider to be tiny and I would rather go to The Works if I'm going to spending that much money on a burger. The burger was good but felt super oily and overall had a fast food vibe. $10 for that type of burger is just not worth it to me, especially if there was nothing too special about it. If the prices were lower, I would be more willing to come more often."}
{"text":"I will be frank,I am very fond of burgers but can't eat it often since they are so unhealthy. So I like to give myself a treat once or twice a month with one and I am always looking for a place that makes it worth the wait. Heard a lot about Burger's Priest,so decided to give it a try. I had the portobello mushroom burger and o my,it was DEELEECEEOUS with the properly baked mushroom and molten cheese that  just dissolves in your mouth.However, that experience went away in a flash because the burger was so small that it felt like a snack. The prices are really high for the size of the burger you get.  I would recommend you go there when you are not very hungry or need a quick snack or if you are willing to spend around 35-40 bucks on burger."}
{"text":"As was walking by in the evening, my companion highly recommended  it, so I decided to give it a try.   The place was full and the kitchen seemed still going on full steam at cooking. There was a line up for ordering. Make sure you claim seats before ordering because it's so full. I had double cheese burger which is double the meat (absolutely necessary because your eyes always bigger than  your stomach, and as usual I couldnt finish it lol). It came to over $9 something. I think its pricy just for a burger considering they use craft cheese singles but not real cheese. I was standing waiting for my order and watching them cook, I am quite sure they dont use high quality cheese. I HATE HATE HATE craft synthetic cheese. I have puked over eating it on its own couple of times in my life so I either usually order without cheese or get cheese burger from real restaurant. If you read cheese label in grocery store usually the first ingredient is : MILK,then salt and couple of binding agents,  while craft singles' first ingredent is \"milk powder\" and bunch of chemicals. So for the sake of being pricy but using fake cheese, I have to shed a star.  The tasted amazing, however the burger is EXTREMELY salty. the salt was from the meat not from topping, so every bite was VERY salty. It was the saltiest burger I have head in my life. However the mat patty was juicy and tasty. I mentioned the salt thing, and my bf told me he thought it was very salty too and was the saltiest burger experience he ever had as well. I guess for that I have to shed another star.  Third thing, as I looking at the decor, it's rather neat untill I realize the religious quotes in black colour on the white wall something along the line\"...someone some...feel something in the womb etc. \"I dont exactly remember how it was said but remember being disturbed reading it.  So for that sake I shed another star  I think over all the place is okay, if you just order the basic burger without cheese is probably better choice for health and money wise. I think I would just go to A&W for now from cross the street their burger tastes similar. However I agree their burgers are better than Hero Burger."}
{"text":"First time trying Burgers Priest... I know I KNOW, which rock have I been hiding under?! They opened up this outpost and it is now super close to me, and quite close to the Costco I shop at. This locale is also larger than the ones downtown and on queen east, it has about 10 tables and is quite spacious. I tried The Priest which had a Panko-crusted-cheese-stuffed-deep-fried-portabello-mushroom ontop of their signature beef party, with the works. It was  delicious in a gluttonous kind of way. My fiancée opted for a more classic bacon double cheeseburger. I can't help to compare his burger to the classic Shake Shack burger. I gotta say... I like Shake's more... Sorry! Anyhow still one of the top burgers in TO. Lots of options. There's a secret menu online, but the burgers on the secret menu are just to massive for me to handle, especially on a first visit. Maybe I'll brave it on my 2nd visit... After the 'wedding diet' is over!"}
{"text":"I've tried.  I've tried so hard, Yelp, and I've tried several times.  But I'm just not feeling it.  For the uninitiated who've somehow stumbled across my review before anybody else's, The Burger's Priest is a Toronto legend.  Frequently cited as the best burger in the city, they've got a few different locations and a massive fan following.  Their beef's ground in-house, and they offer some great add-ons you won't find anywhere else (I'm partial to the panko-crusted fried jalapeno slices, AKA 'Smoke').  The cheese melts into the meat to create a gooey amalgamation that some love and some kind of think is a bit of a mess, but that no one disregards.  It's a burger with merit, and I don't deny that.  But oh, the problems.  I try to keep my reviews based solely on food, keeping things like surroundings and price out of the picture.  Good food can frequently be expensive, and at the end of the day I'm not eating the wallpaper or the chairs.  I eat because I love food, and that's that.  But dang, this place will try even my patience, and my ability to adhere to that kind of review policy.    This is a pretty good burger.  If it wasn't overpriced; if it came on something resembling a plate, to help one manage the mass quantities of grease one has to contend with; and if seating was a thing that existed any time save between the hours of 3 to 4 PM, I'd gladly make this a 4-star review.  But my last visit to the Priest for a double bacon cheeseburger with smoke, some subpar fries, and a can of Coke set me back more than sixteen bucks, which is enough to make me think twice.  I don't mind eating a burger off the folded up paper bag it came in, but holy hell, this thing is a ball of grease brushed with more grease on the exterior of the bun.  It instantly soaks through the paltry piece of wax paper provided as a wrapper, leaving you to try and stuff the thing down your throat as fast as humanly possible.    Plates are required.  The people taking their order home to where they assumedly HAVE plates are employing the right technique.  And then there's the fight for a seat.  Look, I'm not going to penalize a restaurant for the fact that there are hipsters everywhere.  Like raccoons, hipsters are extremely tough to rid from one's premises once they get a taste for your establishment.  But basically, unless you're eating with a strategized team here, you will not get a seat at any but the most awkward of hours.  You will instead watch other people come in ten to fifteen minutes after you, split their party while you wait in line, and post one person to take up a table as the others place their orders.  You will then receive your order, and look at a room filled with people not eating.  People just taking up seats in anticipation of when they WILL be eating, some time in the distant future.  The courteous thing would be to **** off the table and let someone who's ready to eat have the space for a few minutes.  But no.  Instead, the table-holders will give the food-holders nought but glares of territorial disdain, driving people like myself to seek refuge elsewhere.  Check out my review of the McDonald's across the street to see how that went: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mcdonalds-toronto-16  Seriously.  This place needs a rule that if you don't have your food yet, or at least an order number, you can't hold a table.  And as much as I know it's rough to be hustled out of a venue once you're finished eating, if you finished your burger before I even came into the shop and you've been hanging out for at least 35 minutes that I myself can confirm, it'd be really great if someone gently suggested you give up your table for an actual customer.  Food-wise, the burger's really solid.  That said, I've seen it compared favorably to Holy Chuck, and I don't think the two should even be placed head-to-head.  I'm not going to come here and find something outrageous and wonderful like a three-patty burger where one patty's house-ground beef cooked to order, one's lamb, and the other is made of chopped and compressed bacon.  There are no shaved white truffles on the fries here.  There's no point in comparing the two restaurants because they take drastically different approaches to a shared medium.    A better comparison would probably be Five Guys, which while a chain fast food burger and thus in a different category, is largely on similar footing minus a few extras. (Again, I totally endorse the fried jalapenos.  I could eat them by the fistful.)  That said, given the choice, Five Guys wins out for me, and will continue to win whenever I don't feel like making the trek up to Holy Chuck.    I'm glad The Burger's Priest makes so many of my fellow Torontonians happy.  But I have no idea why it does.   PS - I'm not sure why people are so offended that this place is cash-only, especially when they courteously have an ATM right on the premises, plus a TD and a CIBC forty yards away.  Carry twenty bucks with you.  S*** ain't hard, son."}
{"text":"If you're a burger snob and in Toronto, this is it. Stop reading this review and eat there."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. I have been to Holy Chuck and The Works as well. This came in third place by a mile. The burger was decent but incredibly small and expensive for what you get. I had a cheeseburger with smoke.  Probably would not go back. 3 stars is generous."}
{"text":"OMG. Pun intended.   (Full review coming soon. I reserve judgement until I check in a second time...)"}
{"text":"I've been told that The Burger's Priest is the Shake Shak of Canada, and since I've been craving for a Shake Shak burger ever since my one time in NYC, I had to try this place out. I've past by this restaurant at the Lakeshore location and have always seen it busy with long lines and filled up tables, and the smell of the burgers and fries coming from there would tempt me but I always restrained as I try to stay away from fast food. Since my cravings got the best of me I finally decided to give it a try. At this location the restaurant is very small, with like 6 small tables max. They have only one vegetarian option and just recently got a special fried chicken burger, while the rest are beef burgers.  I wanted to be on the safe side and so I ordered the regular cheeseburger, while my brother ordered the fries and the vegetarian burger, which was a fried mushroom stuffed with cheese.  There is no table service so when we walked up to the counter the lady taking the orders was not very friendly, but that didn't really bother me. I noticed that for our burgers we had a very limited choice of toppings that could be added. We received a number and had to wait and listen for it to be called. Our order must have taken around 10 minutes, which made this place not so much of a fast food option. The serving size did shock me. Both our burgers were literally the size of a slider, which was not worth the price. I see why people choose larger options from their menu, as a regular cheeseburger may only fill a child.  My burger was amazing though. What made it amazing for me was not only the juicy meat but mostly the bun. Their buns were the softest buns I've ever had, which were amplified by their addition of a smear of butter on the inside. My brothers first bite of his mushroom burger resulted in cheese bursting out, which wasn't a bad thing.  So, in my opinion, I think these burgers may be competitive to Shake Shak burgers. The only thing that they need to improve is their serving size or their prices, because compared to other fast food burger places they were much more expensive. Also, their lack of a variety of additional toppings was another disadvantage. Despite this, I will definitely return and recommend to all those who don't mind paying a bit more for a quality fast food burger."}
{"text":"Ordered the high priest with a side of fries. Really glad I split this meal with someone else. Did not expect the fries to be such a big serving. The burger was so juicy.. Fries standard.   Burger priest is indeed more expensive than other fast food joints but the quality cannot be compared. I'd still go to Mcd's on the regular but make the occasional visit to burger priest. If only they had a location closer to me.."}
{"text":"The hamburger was extremely greasy and the fries were almost all inedible and over cooked.  The cheese tasted processed and gross and three condiments I had asked for were missing.  The seating was very uncomfortable and too close together.  All this for almost $20 for one meal."}
{"text":"All the hype and I finally have a taste of Burger's Priest burger and see what it is all about...   Cheeseburger the most basic one with no drinks or fries comes to ($5.25). Saturday night was so busy.. and ended up waiting for 20 minute+ in the little room for my burger to get ready...   Is it worth it?? I have to say not really... at least for my basic burger.. it is really cooked with a tray of unseasoned medium looking ground beef and then form into the shape of a patty and pan fried them until it is cooked.. (Now maybe I can try doing that at home) The burger itself is quite small.. tiny... and I can imagine eating that as a snack... and still be hungry....(the cheap side of me talking!)  I should have go for the option.. seems like people are more impressed with the options...  The staffs here are really nice.. but I almost want to laugh when he asked if I going to eat in... I want to ask where?! The little shop is full of people standing around waiting for their order........that taking forever to be ready!"}
{"text":"This maybe the best Burger's Priest location in terms of seating arrangement that I have been to.  Compared to their first location where everything started, at least I have somewhere to sit and somewhere to wash my hands before and after I enjoyed my meals.  I would highly recommend The Vatican or any variations Vs the normal or my Holy Smoke. If you do want to go all the way, that buttered grilled cheese buns were just so sinfully good.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse seems to be the ultimate to order but it was just little too much with all the elements.  Overall, I found most of the food a little too salty for my preference and I would not order the fries nor the chili fries again.   I probably would be back for The Vatican.  And The Vatican Only."}
{"text":"What makes Burger's Priest amazing is The Option. It's a crispy fried portobello's with an oozing cheese center. Just look at a picture of one! The beef is never overcooked, toppings fresh and the bun is excellent. This isn't your cheap everyday burger; this is an indulgence when the cravings kick in, and they will. My staple, The Priest, is a mouth-gasm for cheese burger lovers. That's why we end up here, despite the price tag.  Other great options are the double cheese burger and The Boyfriend enjoys the Magnum (plus Option ohyeah.) The fries are crispy and fluffy, often borderline over-salted so you can't stop eating them. The Chili cheese fries are also a staple when you're feeling particularly hungry. Neither are over-the-moon great, but definitely round out a visit (and your stomach.)   Cash only, of course. Basically no seating at this location. We also like to call ahead and order to skip the line."}
{"text":"Oh heavenly being(s), thank your for your presence and manifestation known as The Burgers Priest.  All of the reviews about the awesome burgers here are true.   Tonight, being extra hungry and grumpy I ordered the chilli cheese fries for the 1st time. Good God(s) !!!   Imagine, (or reflect upon) the standard burger bits that sort of get left behind on the grill, gather them and unto them add spices, cheese and lo, underneath place a foundation of fries.   The experience was beatific !!! (yeah, look that one up)  Now taking CASH and CASH only. (There's an ATM inside)"}
{"text":"I have never been a big burger fan but this place was pretty good! When i researched \"best burger in Toronto\" this was one of the places that showed up. I got the regular burger as well as New York's finest taxi service. I thought the first one lacked some sauce and the second had sauce but it didn't taste that great. After reading the reviews, I was expecting more of a burger that's great because of its sauce like the ones at Shake Shack so I was a little disappointed in that way. Otherwise, the patty and the bun tasted well."}
{"text":"Today I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which cost $7.19 plus tax  They should have told me it would be kids size/ a slider/ a mini-chicken burger/ consisting of about 1/4 of a chicken breast.   Why would they do this? Who signed off on this? I'm furious.   Yours Truly,   Still Hungry"}
{"text":"Lover of all things burgers, and Holy Chucks, I decided to go visit their main competitor with my mother.  Location: Good parking, great location and the inside of the restaurant was very well decorated.  Food: Good choice of burgers and other food, but I found that the food did not live up to the hype (I know, I'm a tough critic, but its burgers). Burgers were very juicy and fresh and none of what I ate felt like it was frozen or store bought. I just wished that they didn't try to 'copy' holy chucks or seemed to be the same.  Overall, great restaurant, I would definitely go here again, but with all of the competition creating similar food, Burger's Priest has to make sure they are unique."}
{"text":"I love burgers and hit up this place while in Toronto for work.  The \"Priest burger\" - you gotta get it with the option. Fan-fooking-tastic! Deep fried portobello mushroom on top of a pound of beef with a brick sized amount of cheese, ranks pretty high on the awesomeness scale of burgers!!  I must say. Luckily I didn't have a heart attack on the walk back to the hotel. But a pretty damn good spin on a burger."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading so many rave reviews, and after conducting my own research of their menu, and perusing through it for 1 or 2 days, I decided to order The Vatican.  One word:  Disappointed.  What should I have ordered instead of The Vatican?  It was so monotonous in taste.  All I tasted was processed cheese.  I honestly prefer A&W burgers to this.  And it felt like my arteries were clogging up, which is what one should expect from a burger, but it really felt like I was devouring a massive chunk of solidified oil."}
{"text":"Toronto is known for its burgers, and this burger place absolutely delivers and makes Toronto proud. I got a jacobs deception and some fries. The burger was delicious and everything tasted super fresh and the portions on the fries were superb. Staff was super friendly and would definitely reccomend to anyone who wants a quick burger in the city."}
{"text":"Went to the The Burger Priest for the 1st time last night with the g/f.  Would we go back No!!! Why, 1st fruit flies were a big problem there, seating had very small tables with stools for kids and adults, one high table for poss adults, smell of grease on your cloths when you leave there, and last no to accessible for some one who is handicap.  At the moment i have to use a cane and i found getting out to buy another pop a challenge.  Well my g/f enjoyed her burger and fries, but everything i mention prior we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Burger run of 2015 is on!  Let's start with the famous Burger's Priest.  A small little diner with little to know seating.  The thing is, it was packed full of people and I already knew I was in the right place based on the line going out the door and it's January in Toronto.  If we are waiting in the cold; then it's totally worth it.  Now I didn't order out of their secret menu because didn't read any of the yelp or check any reviews. Obviously it's because it's the only way to stay impartial (and in hindsight an idiot).  Regardless what I got was:  -the priest -chili cheese fries -coke -possibly clogged arteries and with a side of stroke thrown in because I got a little taste of heaven  If I said it's delicious, it would be the understatement of the year and we just started 2015.  If I said this thing is fucking amazingly delicious we are getting closer to not being an understatement.  Now let's do the break down of the burger.  Let's go with scale the delicious from less tasty to super tasty.  Coke - Syrup? Check Carbonated water? Check.  Disgusting like McDs? Check.  Good we have a set nice bar.  Chili cheese fries - Medium cut and perfectly fried fries. Crunchy outside, tender inside.  Chili is average as is the cheese.  Forgo the Chili Cheese, stick with fries. You won't lose much and save yourself from additional unnecessary calories and grease in your lards.  We have tomato, lettuce, delicious cheese and super juicy patty which probably has a higher fat to ground beef ratio than what I am usually used to judging by the transparency of the wrapper and the paper bag that used to hold it. (I can see the light! Hallelujah!).  Of course, the hidden weapon inside is the thing called the Option. A thick juicy portabello mushroom encapsulating in a gooey glob of cheese deep fried in a batter.  It screams delicious as well as heart attack.  All in all, this place is awesome. Disgusting but awesome. I won't come often mainly because I'm lazy for the drive and also because of how unhealthy it is.  However it is the first meal that has successfully fulfilled the statement made by comedian Louis C.K. \"The meal isn't over when I'm full.  The meal is over when I hate myself.\"  Congratulations Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"I came here for a burger and milkshake. What more can a girl ask for on a Saturday afternoon, right? The line was super long and the entire restaurant was really cramped, it was pretty difficult to find a seat. The burger itself was pretty good (not mindblowingly so) but wow the milkshake was super overpriced! (Definitely prefer The Works...or even BK's Oreo shake)  I probably won't be back, but if there's one thing that I'll give BP credit for is that it's a pretty good burger."}
{"text":"Went to Burger Priest after a long bike trip. I got my double bacon cheeseburger but my girlfriend didn't get hers until 20 minutes after. They forgot her order, nothing was done to make up for it. Served 79 and 80 before 78. When you pay a lot for a food you better deliver not only the burger but adequate service to ensure they get it. Place does not take service seriously."}
{"text":"Burgers Priest in Vaughan is a solid place to get a burger.  The burgers are cooked beautifully, flavourful, good size and taste amazing. Make sure to check out their secret menu online as that might entice you even more to come.   My go-to is always the HIGH PRIEST whIch consists of Two beef patties, secret sauce, cheese, pickles, chopped lettuce, diced onions on a non-sesame seed bun. It's an amazing burger that makes you leave wanting more.   The reason that Burgers Priest is not a 5 star is because I'm not a huge fan of their fries.  They're cut up into tiny bits and don't feel wholesome.  Maybe it's just a preference but it made a difference when buying a combo! Overall, the burgers are solely amazing and definitely try it out."}
{"text":"In trying The Burger's Priest for the first time ever, I must confess that I have committed the sin... of cheating and looking up the Secret Menu even before I decided what to order.  So I headed there on a Saturday at around 12:05pm, when the lineups weren't that hectic, and with cash in hand, I made my order--a Priest Jarges-style with Smoke.   While the single cheeseburger patty was delightfully juicy and well worth the hype, I think what hit the spot the most was the mushroom stuffed with cheese and then fried (known as \"The Option\" in the standard BP menu) as well as the ballpark mustard (i.e. the Jarges-style).  All the toppings held up quite well in the standard-issue bun.  Next time I go to BP--be it the original location or any rumoured new location--I'll always include The Option in the order one way or the other.  The panko-fried jalapeno peppers (i.e. the Smoke) was tasty, but I felt that it was missing a bit of spiciness.    No comment about the unfortunately mixed-reviewed fries, because I'm never that much of a fries person when I go out for burgers and therefore rarely try them--and it's not like I don't feel stuffed enough with the Priest in my tummy.  I will definitely come back again to try more Secret Menu options, although I do think that at ~$16.00 all in with a pop (and no fries), the price is a little steep (in fact, the price is the reason why I can't quite give them a 5, as awesome as the burgers are...)"}
{"text":"The burgers and staff deserve 5 stars. The in location dining experience gets less stars.   This place was a recommendation to me and I highly recommend trying it out if you are in the area.  I loved the burgers here as they were made fresh to order and were delicious. If you have not had a great priest burger make sure to stop here for lunch. The fries were also cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of crunch to them. After your first bite of the burger your mouth will begin to water as it's just so good and always cooked perfectly to temperature. The people working at this location are so pleasant and have made the experience that much better.  I did not like the fact that the tables in the place were so small I felt like an adult eating at a kids table. The chairs were also small and uncomfortable. This is my only grip with this place."}
{"text":"I returned to pray at the Holy altar of meat. Instead of The Priest however, I went for a more modest \"cheeseburger\". Still took about twelve minutes, and I left stinking like a deep fryer (there is literally oil mist in the air here), but that burger was MIGHTY delicious.   Since there is no room to eat inside, head across the street and look behind the I'm-not-quite-sure-what-it-is-either municipal looking building ye shall find picnic benches for your convenience. It will be good.  And they have Diet Mug Root beer? Holy smokes."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first day I tried burger priests, as we walked in we were greeted with a warm smile by the girl at the cash register. There are many burgers to choose from. I got a single patty burger with all the toppings on it, it was definitely delicious not too much meat and not over cooked or under cooked. Probably the best burger I've had so far in Toronto. And the side chilli cheese fries topped it off amazingly. The only thing i have to say is that the seating is limited, however that is expected for a place in the heart of downtown. Definitely going to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Mouth watering delicious. Have I said delicious yet?  I love burgers. I love crunchy, crispy, smashed burgers with French fries.   Have I said delicious?  Check them out if you haven't already!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. First you have to get over the novelty of going on their website to get their \"secret menu\". Sorry...I'm not overly religious and have no idea how long Noah was on the Ark for. After guessing 3 times at answers, I finally got onto the menu. While some of the combinations are interesting, nothing leapt off the webpage at me and certainly nothing worth making customers visit their website to get their \"secret\" menu. The burgers are moist, which therein lies the problem. If you get them to go...by the time you get to your destination, the bun is almost inedible.  Overpriced for what you get, I won't be bothered going back again....unless someone is new to the neighbourhood and wants to see what the hype is all about. I don't get it......"}
{"text":"These burgers are huge, and messy, and super delicious. Not much room in here, have to pick up and go, also no washroom."}
{"text":"The price I paid for the amount and quality of food I received was underwhelming.   I remember trying The Burger's Priest at their first location in Toronto many years ago and it was amazing. The burgers were delicious and high quality so the price was justified. However, coming back after many years, I was disappointed.  The total came out to $29 for a hotdog, chicken burger, chili cheese fries, and a can of soda. Paying that much for those 3 items (soda doesn't really count) I was expecting decently large portions. The hotdog was so small it seemed like something out of a kids menu. The chicken burger was also quite small and the patty was very thin. The chili cheese fries was the only item that was decent in terms of portion.  All of this would have been acceptable if the quality of the food made up for the small portions. Everything in my order looked and tasted like something that could have been made using the cheapest items at a grocery store. There was nothing good or unique about the food.  I will never be returning to The Burger's Priest unless they increase their portions or increase the quality for the price that is being paid."}
{"text":"They just opened in Mississauga .I have   been to the Yonge  location and liked it. I decided to get myself a priest burger  from this location . The burger was fresh and delicious ..I like the mushroom cap  thatd insife it as it's so juicy.  They should have it on all the burgers. I will be back to try the chicken  burgers : chicken low priest and  Peters Denial.   The environment is casual and fun . I'll bring my friends to try this place out as well."}
{"text":"This location is horrendous. I've had so many issues with the service here. Staff need better training in customer service and to learn to not make the customer feel like an idiot.   However I love burgers priest and the Yonge location is a million times better."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo from the secret menu thru Foodora.  It was $19 before delivery tax and tip. What came was horrible. I would give it a zero if I could. I've eaten here before and it was okay, but the deepfried cheese substance I got with a lone piece of bacon (nothing else) was crap and should have been an embarrassment to put out of any kitchen. The chilli fries were no better. Huge fail for Burgers Priest."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my coworkers, but to my dismay this place was packed with people waiting for their orders as well as people waiting to place their orders. Avoid the lunchtime rush if you don't want to wait over 30 minutes for a burger.  I ordered the red sea, which is a cheeseburger with chili on top. I have to say it was quite delicious. I don't really know where the chili stopped and the burger started. It just tasted well integrated. I also ordered the fries, but found them to be too salty for my taste.  Great burger, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype about this place. The burgers we bland and overpriced. Wouldn't come here again. The milkshake and fries were delicious and only redeeming thing about this place. Would not recommend when there are so many other places with so much better food"}
{"text":"Amazingly good burger, A-OK fries! However, this place adds up. I understand you pay for name and quality, but when I spend nearly $20 on a burger combo, I won't frequent it as much as I'd like to.  My only complaint is the price, which I can overlook considering how good the burger is."}
{"text":"Came back! Always a good sign. Had another high priest, fries and a Coke. The burger was made same as last time, fresh, meaty and juicy!! Fries are hand cuts and on the small side but well done. Overall, I'm happy to see that the food is good every time.   Must say, never thought this place would ever make it on my list of fav burger places, my first experience with a single burger was bland and boring, but, I don't come here to order a small single burger, this place best serves specialty burgers and they do it well. Get in there !!"}
{"text":"Not the friendliest staff but I think they were in the process of training new people so they were a bit confused. But the food was so fresh, and so good!!"}
{"text":"Just ok! No need to drive all the way over to try! Five guys is better. For the price it should be served on a platter. People in toronto are in a bubble"}
{"text":"I got the priest burger. It was pretty good with a fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese. Patty was nicely seasoned the cheese was melted when I bit into it. Wasn't as greasy as other locations so that's a good thing. However my bun was cold. They lightly heated the inside of the bun but the outside was still cold so it took away from the taste of the burger as a whole. I ordered fries on the side and it was just average. A bunch of little pieces of cut fries. Meal came to about $15 which is a bit pricey for me so I wouldn't come here on a daily basis. I personally think the inspire burger at Inspire restaurant is the best burger I've tried so far."}
{"text":"BRING CASH! Great burger.  The service was ok. Music was hittin! Old school hip hop classics blended with pop flava.   I love the fries! They were Matt crispy good."}
{"text":"Awesome quality burgers that hit the spot. Their ground beef patties are always fresh, juicy and full of flavour. There's a variety of menu options but it's a bit too pricey to come here often."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers i have had, they have a nice selection of choices. I usally get the Vatican with smoke and a side Option plus fries. The side option is a vegetarian serving, essentially deep fried and breaded mushrooms in a patty. And the smoke is breaded and fried jalepenos. Good food good service but keep in mind this isnt a mcdonalds burger, you get what you pay for so this gourmet burger joint is a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Wow! All the aforementioned reviews are spot on! Burgers are heart cloggingly delicious. We shared a vatican and I'm sure my coronaries are happy I just had half vs the whole thing. Worth the trek to leslieville!"}
{"text":"Wow that's one juicy burger!  I had mine with blue cheese, just the perfect bite it needed. I found out about the secret menu. Next time I'll add the fried jalapeño peppers. I liked the chilli fries. The chilli and home cut fries are the best part. There's just one problem with the burgers and it's a pretty serious one. I just can't stop craving them!  Help!"}
{"text":"Burger's Priest has a few seats and constant traffic which is great to see.  *Me thinks these burgers must be good with all these people!!    Unfortunately, this place fell far below expectations.  It was a party of two that day.  I  ordered The Vatican City, she ordered the Priest... both burgers were too small, bland and lacking the meat (flavour) that makes a burger a burger.  Far from the best burger in the city."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Place is clean. Try the cheeseburger with bacon and fried jalapeños. The sautéed onions make the burger way too greasy, but some might argue that a burger is meant to be greasy...  P.s. They have a secret menu. I heard something about a grilled cheese bun instead of regular bun."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a quick bite before going out. Good quality burgers and not too expensive. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and good service. Haven't had a bad experience yet. They do need to come out with an original poutine as their fries aren't the best. Worth the price for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite burger all time. Their burgers are so tasty, it almost got me laid on a 1st date once. I can't take all the credit, the burgers were real sexy. People complain that they are expensive, but almost tapping that a** was an investment like all the finer things in life.   A must try for anyone in Toronto."}

{"text":"I don't normally like veggie burgers all that much, and I definitely don't like mushrooms (unless they're canned - gross, I know), but hear me out: \"The Option\" at The Burger's Priest is an absolute vegetarian delight!  As others have mentioned, oozy, melty cheese is surrounded by two portobello caps and then deep fried in panko crumbs. It's exactly as awesome as it sounds, only deadlier. And I mean deadly in a good way. At no point did I feel like I was eating mushrooms or even vegetables. Delicious and very unique. The bun was also great - simple, fresh and soft without overpowering what was between the two halves. I took my Option with ketchup, a bit of mayo and tomatoes and it stood up quite nicely to being pried apart (but watch out for the oozing cheese - it really wants out!).  The fries were OK. Drink options are plentiful. The menu is straightforward; not too many choices to make and the toppings are minimal, which was appreciated in today's world of choice overload.   Get yours to go (it's kind of the only option here - there isn't a lot of room to groove inside) - my recommendation is to pick up some booze at the nearby LCBO, get your burger and then cross Queen to the south side. Go enjoy your burger at the picnic tables behind the Harvey's or at nearby Ashbridges Bay Skate Park. Terrific addition to a sorely lacking strip of Queen Street East!  Cash only & closed on Sundays for church."}
{"text":"I have so many great things about this place and now with a new one at the west side I had to go.  The first thing you smell when you walk in is some good ol' grilled aroma of burgers.  The menu consist of your fresh burgers and fries as sides.    The seating is tight, but really all you need is a seat and somewhere for your fries.    THE TASTE As you bite into the burger you can tell the meat was grounded fresh and put together right on the grill.  It was juicy and fresh!!!  The buns were soft and nicely toasted.  We ordered chili cheese fries and it was superb because they must have use the same fresh meat as the burgers.  It was perfect - hot fries that melted the cheese and the sauce of the meat gave it an overall tang.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I had a rude awakening at the burger's priest, First hours in the T-Dot and I had to deal with a bunch of hipsters that I thought I had left behind in California.   First off, Queen Street is Toronto's Fairfax which I wish I knew ahead of time.  Amy Winehouse's little sister recommended the \"california classic,\" to which I asked if it would taste like In n Out, her face melted in annoyance and said \"I don't know I've never been there.\" Well regardless you should know your menu and know why things are called what they are called.   Her attitude also rubbed off on the home boy that looked like a hipster 30 year old Ferris Bueller. He went into the backroom right after too....I know right....for a couple minutes before coming back to prepare burgers, great. I live off of facts, and he did not put gloves on nor did he wash his hands before preparing them. On another occasion, I also saw him slicking his hair back with his hands before going back to preparing food (not my burger though).  Food...  (Note: Being the burger priest, if there were any secret ingredients he added, they weren't obvious. Thank the lord (pun intended).  High Priest Burger: The patties were grilled nicely and the secret sauce (oh, oh) was a good addition, the buns were a good bun to meat ratio and came together to form a burger you \"that's pretty good.\"   The Fries: Their fries were alright, made hot with the order but the seasoning did nothing to me, the texture did. I only ate about 8 of them before calling it a meal.  The Burger's Priest Does It Dirty  It was uncomfortable in there maybe they take this \"priest\" thing too seriously, but it was not pleasant customer service and it was not hygienic. I was a victim and should of spoken out. Where's the Boston Globe when you need them? The food is alright, if you decide you want to try it, pick a different location! According to their website there are many more scattered through the city. ."}
{"text":"I've been to Burger's Priest a number of times so a review is long overdue. Overall, I am a fan! It's no shake shack, but it's a pretty good burger option in Toronto. They also have a fun secret menu (I've never tried anything on the secret menu as everything looks exuberantly rich). The fries are also pretty delicious. If you're looking for a good burger spot downtown, look no further!"}
{"text":"Tried \"The Priest\", it's a burger with cheese, fried mushroom, beef, and you can pick your toppings (tomatoes, lettuce, etc). I think it's a little bit too salty. Also got the ice cream soda and I like it. Overall wouldn't try it again."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon cheeseburger on a buttered bun and it was absolutely delicious.  French fries are also perfection.  Best burger and fries I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Before heading to Burger Priest, a few things you should know:  - there's a secret menu on the website that you may be interested in checking out. Though I'd recommend getting the priest burger your first time.   - bring cash,  and seating is super limited,  you're almost always better off sitting outside somewhere.   - every time I've been there has been a huge lineup, so expect that. However I have never been disappointed,  it's well worth the wait.  Whether you choose to go vegetarian or not, as a first timer I would strongly recommend ordering a burger that includes the option (the option or the priest). The priest easily takes my top spot for burgers in the city.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it now. In fact, I think we're going tomorrow."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try out Burger Priest this summer. And maybe my expectations were a bit too high.  I tried the low priest with fries, my partner tried the California classic. The patty was delicious and super fresh! The bun was really good too. But I was very disappointed by the fact that they use processed cheese slices like Kraft. Also, my cheese wasn't even melted on my patty. Pretty sure those are big cheeseburger no-nos. The fries weren't crispy, and maybe we got the bottom of the batch but they were pretty much all small pieces, no actual fries.  On the other hand, my partner enjoyed his meal, and his cheese was melted on the patty. Would it try it again? Maybe if I was hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"RUN (as in don't walk) to eat here.  Nice unhealthy deep fried veggie burger option as well.  \"Double Double\" (2 cheeseburger patties) was outstanding, as were the yukon gold fries.  Trouble now will be not making this a weekly \"treat\"."}
{"text":"Felt like burgers for dinner after work and was thrilled when Angela decided to join me for dinner. Burgers aren't exactly the healthiest thing in the world so first and foremost thank you for constantly sticking it through with me. =P  Heard soo many good things about burger priest so what else can I do but to hit up this burger joint. It's quite far east along queen and after a long work day, the commute seemed much longer than expected. So as a heads up, even after rush hour, if you're heading there via ttc, it's quite the trip.  Burger priest is around the upper beaches area and kinda... in the middle of nowhere.  Burger priest is a small place that has probably seating for... 5-6. So it's primarily a takeout joint.  We were quite fortunate as we were able to grab 2 seats within a couple of mins.  They don't have an extensive menu, but boy what they have looks and smells great. It's a small place and modernly designed as a quick takeout burger diner.  Angela and I couldn't help but order the double double as the burgers are a little bit on the smaller side. She got hers with fries and I just had to get mine with chilli cheese fries.  Her toppings included lettuce, tomato and mayo.  I also got my made the In-N-Out style. I belief they call it jarged or something, not sure.  My toppings included everything but mustard.  The wait wasn't horribe at about 10 mins or so and the first bite. Ohhh mannn the hype was all valid. The burger was your typical North American burger. It was oily, fatty and the juices will actually run down your hands. But the taste, ohhh mann delicious. The patty was seasoned perfectly and cooked medium to medium rare. The toppings tho simple, complimented the burger in every aspect.  And the sides, not bad at all.  They were of the shoestring variety and deep fried well. I mean I could go for just a little bit more crispy, but still good. The chilli fries with cheese on the other end, was just okay. The next time I'm back, I would go for just the regular fries.  If I had just gotten the regular fries I might have ordered another double double jarged. It was that good, and yes a little small.  I mean the place is constantly busy and packed for a reason, so don't come here too late or leave disappointed.    Overall, I definitely enjoyed Burger Priest.  So far, the best in 2011 hands down.  Yes, it is fatty so I don't recommending going often.  I mean there was a ton of grease stains from even the chilli cheese fries that it can make you second guess your choice in coming.  But this is THE burger joint.  And it was simply dang good.  The price is still within reason for me and you will leave knowing you had a great burger.  Not those run of the mill, no no, this is the type of burger that will even turn your average burger fan leaving with smiles."}
{"text":"Giving this 2 stars only for the friendly people working there. The burger was an unbelievably greasy mess and my fries were broken and looked as though they had been reheated. I couldn't even eat them. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Super greasy. I couldn't believe how gross it was after hearing the great reviews and seeing the lineups so I went back and tried it again a few months later. Again it was an Exxon Valdez burger.  Never again."}
{"text":"Came here after reading up on the hype on various sites and Yelp. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to that hype (at least for me). You can definitely taste the better cut of meat when you eat the burger (just like Shake Shack in the States). I had the \"Holy Smokes\" off the secret menu which was essentially a double chesseburger with a few breaded fried jalapeno nuggets. The burger tasted kind of dry overall and wasn't very satisfying compared to the version you'd find at Jack in the Box (in that munchie meal). To top it off, it was an expensive burger for ~12.50 after HST."}
{"text":"Late night cravings had me finding myself placing an UberEats order for Burger's Priest close to midnight. My boyfriend is Canadian and raves about Burger's Priest but I'm American and admittedly a Shake Shack girl so I wasn't sure how Burger's Priest was going to compare but I must say that I'm blown away!  I ordered \"The Option\" which is Burger's Priest's veggie burger while my boyfriend got the \"New York's Finest Taxi Service.\" We also got 2 orders of fries and the grape Kreamsicle soda and everything was great! The burgers are a little on the smaller side (which is fine for me) but others might need to order a bit more to feel satiated. Though, for us, one order of fries would have been more than sufficient given the generous portion despite the deceptively small-looking bag it comes in.  I feel like food is always better when it's eaten at the establishment because it's fresher but I was more than satisfied with my burger given the delivery time! The breaded and fried mushroom \"patty\" was still really crisp and the cheese inside still all nice and melty! The Kreamsicle soda was a real treat and inhaled so quickly. I can't wait to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The ice cream sandwich was rock hard with store bought ice cream. The burger was extremely greasy had no flavour at all."}
{"text":"How do I put this lightly... I LOVE burgers! But more specifically, I LOVE The Vatican City at Burger's Priest. On my first visit, I could not resist the urge to indulge in a double cheeseburger served between none other than 2 grilled cheese sandwiches (yes, you read that right).   For those of you that haven't been before, this particular burger is off their secret menu (which I suggest you check online before heading there). The burgers are fresh and juicy, are made to order, and absolutely drip of heavenly goodness. Add a side of fries and a milkshake (might I suggest the Riggs & Murtaugh- again, secret menu) and you've got yourself the best meal ever.    I have been a religious customer (pun intended) for a few years now and after trying multiple other burger joints, I'd say this place is still my #1. I have and will continue to recommend it to everyone I know.  Note: There is VERY limited seating inside so don't plan to go here thinking it's a sit down restaurant. I tend to frequent it more in the summer when I can sit outside and eventually 'walk off' everything I've consumed. Price is affordable for the quality you're getting."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, and Burger's Priest is the first place we hit, as soon as we land in Toronto. Let me reiterate; I'm a 3rd gen Texan...HOME of Beef, excesses of all things Beef, and consuming anything Made from Beef..and Burger's Priest is our favorite burger ever! Get there when they open on a week day (the best time to go), order and grab a cold Coke and a stool, and enjoy the \"show\" of watching the owners and staff Really put their heart and soul into making great burgers! We like the fries,too. Don't miss THE BP!"}
{"text":"Thought i should give this a review to follow up with my previous one. This was my second visit here and both times my burger was tasty, cooked right and NOT SOGGY. Went for the cheeseburger both times. Fries nice and crisp. Very satisfied with the burgers!"}
{"text":"Great burger, right up there with Craft.  Simple ingredients make the meat the star of the show and it does not disappointment.  Only draw back was the actual portion of the burger which probably could have had another ounce or two to justify the price (not that it was that expensive $18 got us two pops, two cheeseburgers, and an order of fries)."}
{"text":"Would've been 5 stars if location was more central (it's soooo far), and if they had seating (after the long trek to get there, you just wanna sit comfortably and enjoy your burger).   Other than those 2 things, I'm a HUGE fan! And probably will be an even bigger fan of their soon-to-open Queen & Spadina branch - YAY.  ATMOSPHERE: Really fun, modern, and hipster. From décor to staff, the vibe is all cool. The shop is clean but super tiny. There's a bar with a few seats, but as the signs tell you in-store, the bar is just for customers waiting for food. You're not welcome to eat inside. So I only go when it's a nice day out and sitting outside on the curb is doable.  SERVICE: Since it's a take-out place, their speed of service is pretty impressive. Orders are filled super quick. Don't worry about the line!  PRICE: Decent price for a trendy place and okay portion size.   FOOD: Love the soft buns, juicy patty, and AMAZINGNESS of The Option. Seriously, make sure you've got The Option in your burger. Trust. Fries are okay. They do have gluten free fries, for those who need it.   And to make this more exciting (or less, for those who already knew? :P) - their SECRET MENU is now available on their website! It's pretty extensive - check it out: http://www.theburgerspriest.com/secret-menu/"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this place? Being from Vancouver, I actually stumbled upon this place by accident. When I saw the sign, I thought it sounded familiar and then realized I had seen it on some Food Network show.  Ordered something classic, the cheeseburger with fries. Damn. Best burger I've ever had in Canada. The thing was crunchy, crispy smashed burger goodness smothered in dirty-awesome processed cheese and crispy butter toasted buns.  The fries were meh, but they rounded out the experience. Only down side is lack of interior seating, which on a cold Toronto day on Queen West with nowhere else to go was a bit lame.  Wait, why the hell are you reading this?! You just wasted valuable burger eating time. GO!"}
{"text":"Food is close to the og's locations and is fast.   Unfortunately, the staff -  most notably, the order takers/cashiers are curt, rude and dismissive. I think I'll go up the street to 5 guys, food is about par, but they're much nicer to their customers.  Too bad, I much prefer supporting locals."}
{"text":"Eh..... this place is okay.   Nothing crazy special.  Always busy. There are other great places to eat burgers.   But if its your first time in Toronto, i guess this mist be on your list."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE BURGER IN TORONTO!!! The taste is unmatched. If you are really hungry get double party or two burgers! This is dine out only and you can place orders via telephone."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated sliders. Not worth the 5 blocks I walked."}
{"text":"I fail to see why Burger Priest is so popular now that Toronto has a tonne of burger joints. The food was good, but not nearly as great as the reviews suggest. Two burgers and one order of fries cost us nearly $40. The secret menu, which is clearly not so secret, only serves as marketing tool. The toppings were all too gimmicky and distract from the fact that their beef patties aren't all that great.  Not worth the price, I'd rather take my business to Burgernator or Five Guys where the star of the meal is a delicious beef patty."}
{"text":"Took two of my friends here because they read these reviews and wanted to try it. I warned them it would be disappointing.  But they refused to listen to me   They both said the burger was weak, and were pissed they paid almost $20 for a combo.  One said the grape soda saved the joint (something they don't make).   Bottom line from me, a burger can only get so good, this place is a good burger place, but the prices are quite ridiculous and insulting"}
{"text":"Good versus evil. The good will always outweigh the evil at Burger's Priest... their burgers are just so good. The High Priest, The Option, oh the deliciousness. Truly divine.   However, though the flavours they've been pumping out for years in the Beaches remain, this new location is pretty annoying. Loud music. Lots of seating. $30+ for two meals. On these facts alone, I feel like TBP has sold out big time.  Buttttt the burgers! Oh that burgers! We shamefully took ours to go and went to our car post ikea run and once we were listening to CBC2 with AC pumpin' it was aces."}
{"text":"Aw shit, I love this place. If ever there was a religion I would prescribe to, it'd be the greasy food gods.   I go for the fail safe The Priest with everything on it. The Priest is a cheese burger topped with a fried mushroom stuffed with cheese. It's a lot, so I never get any sides. Get it, thank me later.   It's true, their secret menu has a myriad of extra options, a cornucopia if you will, but go in armed with the knowledge* as they don't have time to spout off everything on it. This place gets busssssy.   PEPPER POINTS: For being worth the wait every time, oh holy one.   13/30  *KNOWLEDGE! Here is the link to their secret menu: http://www.theburgerspriest.com/secret-menu/"}
{"text":"Burger's Priest is a place I could get very comfortable with worshiping. Nothing fancy at all about these burgers but that's what makes them so so so good.  Quick greasy and with a side of awesome fries and you really can't go wrong. I was told they will be opening up another location in the west side soon and that is great news for me as the trek to Church is the only negative about this place for me."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese buns should say it all.  WAIT: Came on a Sunday afternoon around noon and there were only a few people in line.  Our food came out quickly.  ATMOSPHERE: Inside it's not super spacious but it has a good amount of tables and window seating for groups.  There was never a time where someone couldn't find a seat despite it feeling crowded.  The inside is very festive with the \"priest\" or \"faux-religious\" feel including wall decor.  There are 2 bathrooms, one for women and one for men.  FOOD: I wanted to get the grilled cheese buns but not the Vatican since it had so much inside.  She said we could make any burger have the grilled cheese buns so we just opted for the high priest but subbed the grilled cheese buns.  I think the total was about $12-13.  The difference I think is that the Vatican comes with double cheese and has a few more toppings.  HIGH PRIEST WITH GRILLED CHEESE BUNS - the buns are basically round pieces of flatter bread that have cheese between them and are grilled slightly. It's very good although some of the bread was a little soggy.  The patties are thin but still flavorful, similar to in n out.  The secret sauce also reminded me of in n out with a thousand island type taste.  The burger is big so good to share with someone else if you're not starving.  We were both impressed and would be back again.  If you like grilled cheese you definitely have to get the grilled cheese buns.  Overall, great concept to add grilled cheese buns to burgers."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short!!   Have heard so much raving about it and so I gave it a shot once more.... All I could say is great concept (mystery menu), nice staff but overpriced and overrated!!"}
{"text":"I dropped by for a quick bite on a weekday around dinner time and had no problems with the service unlike most of the reviewers. I ordered the Priest burger no combo and a vanilla shake. I found the shake to be average in taste but overly priced at $4 because of the quantity. The burger was so juicy though. The patty was very fresh as expected and the mushrooms were a nice added touch. Value will always be subjective to the individual but I honestly rather pay $10+ on a nice burger than pay even $4 for a crappy burger at one of the fast food chains."}
{"text":"Somewhat overrated. Burgers are priced at a premium, and the quality is on par with an In'N'Out Burger in the US. That's not bad mind you, but also not something worthy of the reputation the Priest has.  My experience has been that the patties are always a bit dry and get overpowered by toppings too easily. Part of this is that ultimately they're pretty small burgers (at least the regular versions), and part of it is that the burgers are essentially ground beef balls mashed onto the flattop without much in the way of seasoning.  Fries are hit and miss depending on how clean the oil is.  It's not bad. It's not great. Passable fast food at a premium. I'm a bigger fan of P&L down the street, but only barely."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5  One of my friends have been raving about BP for a while so we decided to have a get-together at the Mississauga location. I had no idea how small the seating/dining area was until we arrived. There were five of us so it definitely was not accommodating. While the few of us were waiting I was blinded by the sunlight and how hot the burger joint was. They definitely need shades so customers don't get blinded by the sun while enjoying their burger. We decided to order and sit outside instead.  Yesterday I decided to get the Vatican City burger. I don't even want to know how many calories are in this burger as it's a burger smacked between a grilled cheese sandwich. My boyfriend got the Armageddon which was crazy expensive ($20) and gigantic! My other friends also got huge burgers off of the secret menu but I don't remember what they were called. The burgers were good but I definitely don't see myself eating this anytime soon just because of how unhealthy it is lol. I also think it's quite expensive because I spent $35 just for the two burgers.  If you're looking to try a new burger joint and don't count calories try out BP.  PS: They're closed on Sundays for church"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff at register.  Girl Staff cleaning tables was treating customers like they were invisible.  No smiles or hello.  Guy stocking exterior beverage cooler was taking few products from top shelf to stock bottom shelf then placing warm beverages in front of top shelf.  First in first out ?  Great juicy burgers.  Option was nice.  Supervisor stepped in to convert order so it was cheaper.    Service was pretty quick for the busy lunch."}
{"text":"Burgers = FAN FUCKING TASTIC.  The Priest = A must eat. Fresh beef, with a deep fried mushroom stuffed with cheese. YES.  The Double Double = A second must eat, for the pure enjoyment of double meat.  I recommend getting the bacon.  only downfall, they charge you somewhat obsurd premium prices. still is no in-n-out, but a good toronto option."}
{"text":"I am embarking on my own quest to find the best burger in the city and Burger's Priest topped my list of places to try. I've been a few times now and every time we go its just packed.  It is an extremely tiny space, so eating in isn't always an option (although if you can grab a stool I do recommended staying because the burger's and fries are great when they are piping hot).   I love burger's and was not disappointed at all with my selection (1st time round a regular cheeseburger combo, 2nd trip the double double combo). I don't have an overly huge appetite but I left hungry after my 1st visit. The meat is ground fresh in house and is cooked on a flat top, which I think adds to the flavor. There are no frilly topping choices (the usual condiments along with friend onions and bacon. The fries looked like they were going to be disappointing, but  were deepfried to perfection and salted perfectly.  All-in-all it was a great experience. I am glad I moved out of the neighborhood or I would be eating here far too often - raising my cholesterol level one double double at a time!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service given that you pay so much for a burger. The owners need to get real when it comes to putting the right food in the right delivery. I ordered from them more than 15 times. Taking my money elsewhere, chumps."}
{"text":"As I mentioned in previous reviews, the hunt for my burger spot continues.  We land here in Woodbridge at small burger chain.  After so many people telling me about it, I finally broke down, loaded the fam into the van and went there.  It better have been worth it since round trip is 45minutes - no traffic! The place was half full with take out and dine in people.  The boys wanted the big one - double bacon cheese burgers!  They wanted to \"roll\" out of there. I ordered the Big Mac knock-off and a cheeseburger for the wife.  Add a generous portion of fries and gravy - dinner is on! My number was called and I grabbed two \"HUGE\" bags of food.  Went to the table and started to unpack...I couldn't figure out out which was the double burger and the single.  They were both tiny.  The fact that they have so little available toppings, you would think at least the burger should be man-sized.  Nope! The big-mac knock-off was in my opinion smaller than the real plastic thing at McD.  It tasted all right - a little too greasy and drippy.  The boys finished in a few bites and they wanted to know if we were going to order more food.  $50 and no one was able to call it a meal. We stopped by at another joint and picked up some more stuff for the kids. Until further notice, we are still with Five Guys for now.  At least the fries here were very good."}
{"text":"in the name of the father, the son, and the holy food AMEN! this establishment opened my eyes to a better burger joint, and much like a marriage, for better or for worse, till death do us part.  all joking aside, I was brought here by a family member who actually had it before I did, and this is my neighborhood. I once wrote off coming to this place because they only had a beef and a veggie option, but I guess between then and now they have added chicken and its phenomenal. we placed out order and I couldn't help but look around at the décor, a nice mix of black and white, with the windows facing the sunset side, I couldn't help but notice as well that the station they used to make burgers has the same screen as a confession booth, brought on a good laugh. took about 10 minutes for the food to be cooked, and im not sure what came over me, but as soon as I started to eat, something came over me and all the food was destroyed. the chicken low priest and the chicken bacon ranch have to be my favorites out of the chicken options, the secret sauce should be bottled as well! (do it!) the poutine was ok, and im not sure if that was just because of the awesomeness of the burgers, will try again later.  I understand a lot of people have a problem with the prices charged here, I am not on that boat. for the flavor and quality of food and toppings its not comparing apples to apples.   lots of parking at this location, just might be a bit of a walk.   transit option is only the 80 Queensway, unless you want to walk from Sherway or kipling...not my idea of fun.   in closing I just want to say this.  mcdonalds who? burger king who? apache burger who?  in my top 3 for burger places. in burger priest I trust unconditionally. worth going out of your way for.  5+/5"}
{"text":"I have no issue with the processed cheese slice. I kinda prefer it on a burger. This was a great burger, I can't lie. Had the maxi priest. We'll worth the wait. I think the only ones I've liked as much are Carnegie Deli in NYC and my old standby, White Spot"}
{"text":"They make a good burger here. It's a tiny establishment across the street from the Beaches Cinema, not too far from where I live. My brother, Eric, first recommended this place to me and couldn't stop going on about it. Now, I'm pretty picky about burgers so when I finally tried it out I wasn't even expecting much, but was in for a nice surprise.  They make what I consider \"classic burgers\". Nothing too fancy, no ridiculous condiments or pretentious names here, just five basic and delicious options. Burger, cheeseburger, double cheeseburger, a vegetarian burger (two breaded, deep-fried portobellos with cheese) and finally their signature burger, \"The Priest\", which is a cheeseburger with additional portobello. Insane.  If you ask for \"the works\" all you get is the basic tomato, lettuce, onion, and a pickle which is in line with their unspoken mantra of \"simpler is better\". However if you want to get fancy you can also add fried onions or bacon for an extra loonie (I tried the fried onions on my double-cheeseburger, pretty amazing). Condiments are also kept to the basics: mayo, mustard and ketchup. That's a good thing because you wouldn't want anything competing against the taste of the beef, which is fresh-tasting and juicy, grilled to perfection (fresh-ground several times a day in small batches). Thankfully there are no additional spices added to the beef because it doesn't need it and in fact would ruin the subtle flavour. The prices are very reasonable and a double cheeseburger combo with fries and choice of drink only set me back around $12.  The owner has an almost religious fervour when it comes to his concept of the perfect burger, but there is no need to preach to the converted because I'm in full agreement with his vision. Super-friendly service, deep knowledge of all things burger-related and a firm commitment to quality really set this establishment apart from the competition. Ironically a Harvey's Hamburger is located almost right across the street and serves as a sobering reminder of everything The Burger's Priest stands against.  I've been there twice, started with a basic cheeseburger and then graduated to the double cheeseburger combo. The fries are awesome as well, thin, golden and crispy but still soft. I'm dying to try \"The Priest\", but have to space these excursions out to give my arteries a rest.  Anyway, I've found burger heaven and just pray that the owner can keep up this level of purity and excellence. Amen."}
{"text":"One word: Burgasm.  If you're searching for a burger joint in Toronto, this is the place to be.  Heard lots of good things about this place from other peeps, and it definitely does not disappoint.  More of a place to takeout and enjoy elsewhere but if you can find a stool (out of the 5 or so there), I'd say enjoy it while it's hot off the grill.  \"The Priest\" consists of a double-ground-cheeseburger underneath a cheese-stuffed-panko-breaded-deep-fried-portabello-mushroom (comically named \"The Option\" which can be ordered by itself for our vegetarian friends).  I caution you that you should probably work up an appetite for this delicious monster.  The first bite will send the stuffed cheese in \"The Option\" to flow so it gets a bit dicey in your hands.  I honestly have to say that the combination of the meat, the cheese and the mushroom really hit the mark.  The only complaint was that I couldn't really appreciate the meat until I took a bite by itself.  Because of the double-grind, it's a bit looser and retains a lot more juicy meat flavour.  Fries were average for me (but this is a guy who doesn't eat McDonalds).  The cut were strikingly similar to McD's (as I remember them), but a tad oversalted.  I'm more of a freshcut fry kinda guy, so the next outing I'll probably just save my calories and cash for the burgers on their own."}
{"text":"Great juicy burgers  Crispy fries Limited topping No rush  Often crowded  But worth the wait"}
{"text":"No idea what the fuss is about this place.  The burgers are actually pretty gross.   Way too greasy and taste nothing special.  I make a way better burger."}
{"text":"Outstanding quality burger that is a Godly treat....staff is trained to be the city's most detached group (never a hi, nor a bye, I'm a mere # here and I'll be ok).....hot burgers-cold servers, and its all still amazing......imagine that."}
{"text":"First time at this joint for a quick bite to eat. Burgers are sub par something that could easily be made at home. Kinda bland no popping flavour that would make you want to return.   The fries however are fairly decent freshly cut and good crisp light flavour."}
{"text":"I went to Cameron House for a live show and needed to grab a quick bite after. The Burger Priest was the PERFECT post bar meal and would make an equally tasty pre-bar dinner. You can dine-in but don't expect more than take-out level service--to be expected at the very reasonable prices. There is some sort of secret sauce on the burgers that makes the patties outstanding. Buns are flipped inside out and smothered in butter to bring back fond memories of grilled cheese. Highly recommend for a quick and casual bite in the city!"}
{"text":"A Toronto must. Best quick burger place I've been to. I would equate not liking The Burger's Priest to committing a sin."}
{"text":"Finally made a visit to the much talked-about Burger's Priest.  Like every other eatery on Queen East, this one is ultra-tiny, with no bathrooms (!). There is barely enough room for the swirling line that no doubt ends out the door.  I had The Vatican (double burger, in between two grilled cheese sandwiches), fries and a soda.  A burger joint will always lose points when a) they use processed cheese and b) they don't used fresh baked buns. Unfortunately, The Burger's Priest is guilty of both. Coupled with the bland, unseasoned burger patty and you have quite an underwhelming experience.  The menu doesn't boast any high-end, exotic or even \"different\" ingredients. Pretty regular stuff here.  The \"Secret\" Menu (which is quite publicly posted on their website) is a cute novelty, but more than half of it is the regular menu! Milkshake lovers beware; shakes are not available at the Queen East locale.  Overall, The Burger's Priest had all the making of a classic experience, but really fell short. They cut corners on the quality of the ingredients, not all locations carry all advertised products and boasts a pretty run-of-the-mill menu.  Nothing special here."}
