{"text":"I have been a fan of Foodbenders and have grabbed at least a couple meals in each one of their locations over the years. The shop on Bloor Street is by far my favorite. The seasonal offerings never fail to delight and we often order lunches from them for corporate meetings. Having the food delivered through Uber eats is extremely convenient. Foodbenders offers something for every pallet and most dietary restrictions. It is great value for the quality of food they provide. The in-house hot sauce is out of this world if you can handle intensely spicy things!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet. The takeaway stuff - the sandwiches, wraps and salads - are so, so good. Delicious and fresh and really inventive ingredient combinations. Friendly people and good coffee and baked stuff too. It's more like. $12 lunch than an $8 but very worth it."}
{"text":"The FoodBenders box was my favourite UberEats instant delivery item.

I've ordered this item more than a dozen times - it was $7 for the wrap and salad. A very filling meal - the wrap is decently sized. It's loaded with hummus, lettuce, peppers, avocado, sprouts, carrots.

The kale salad is lightly dressed, it also contained quinoa, beans, corn, sweet potato, feta cheese and corn chips.

I absolutely loved this item from FoodBenders/UberEats. I'd make a trip to the Junction for this food."}
