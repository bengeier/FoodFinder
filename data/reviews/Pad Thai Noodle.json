{"text":"My fiancé and I had dinner here during their opening month. The decor of the restaurant is not particularly impressive, but I'm sure that it's a work in progress. The food and the staff, however, were wonderful.   My fiancé had the wonton soup and green curry, while I had the Tom Kha Ga soup with the lobster pad thai (house special!). I wish that I had taken pictures of our food because the presentation was lovely. And the flavor of the food was incredible--it's certainly some of the best Thai food I've ever had. My soup was rich and creamy, while the pad thai was spicy (by request) and flavorful.  The servers were very kind and able to recommend particular items from the menu. We will certainly be returning here sometime soon, and we look forward to watching this restaurant grow."}
{"text":"Pad Thai Noodle is a unique Burmese/Thai street food restaurant that deserves checking out.  If you've ever traveled to SEAsia you will surely appreciate its simple, earthy decor and flavorful offerings.  I highly recommend the Pad Gra Pow and the Burmese noodles.  The owners are beautiful people, Burmese refugees who found their way to Pittsburgh through unbelievable hardship to make a better life for their family.  Get to know these lovely people and you will be rewarded twice - flavorful dining, and new friends."}
{"text":"Zero atmosphere inside, just bare walls. The place is pretty new, so I'll let it slide. Food was just okay. Not very large portions for takeout, so don't go there starving like I did. Staff seems nice though so there's potential!"}
{"text":"Food is good but they still need to have more experience. I came in two weeks after opening. I originally called in my order but when I went to pick it up, they only had half of it. I spent a good 5 minutes trying to get someone to answer the phone as well. The inside is small, only enough for 5 tables or so. After reordering in person, I understood what was going on. The lady working the register, who was nice and friendly, wasn't up to speed with putting orders in the system. It took her 2 minutes to put in another customers order who only wanted two things. She was also in charge of the phone and taking out all the orders. I only saw 2 employees there, so they were very understaffed. The phone rang the entire time I was there, maybe 10 minutes, and no one answered it once. People were patiently waiting for their food to come out as well. She gave me the wrong order a second time but caught it before I left. The food itself was fresh and flavorful though. They only put broccoli stalks and not the flowery heads in. I was either a \"problem\" customer or they put the wrong cutting parts in. It is also more expensive then the surrounding Thai restaurants. They do not offer lunch specials. I would give them another chance but wait a few months until everything is settled down after opening."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. It is now our fourth visit and we have had a great experience each time. The food is delicious and the owner is customer oriented. The bar and out door seating is such a nice touch. It is a weekly lunch fave of ours, especially the Thai Fried Rice!"}
{"text":"First thing you notice is the decor, it's cute. Lots of live plants, I liked it. The second thing you notice upon opening the menu is the prices, this place is very inexpensive compared to other Thai restaurants. We ordered the crab rangoon, pork belly steamed buns, pad see ew with chicken and sweet n sour chicken. The crab rangoon was a lot smaller then I've seen at other places but was really tasty. The \"pork belly\" steamed buns were good, but the cut of pork didn't seem to be what they advertised. It wasn't belly. It was bbq pulled pork. Good, but had I known, I probably wouldn't have ordered it. The pad see ew was missing the basil the menu said it came with and the chicken I ordered in the dish didn't make it, I ended up with tofu instead. After tasting a bite of my partner's chicken (it was the texture of hard jerky), I'm glad I ended up with fried tofu in my dish instead of the chicken I had ordered. The pad see ew noodles were mushy and chunked up like snowballs. The sweet n sour chicken was gross. It tasted like warmed ketchup all over veggies with pineapple (and yes it was Heinz ).   The service... was SLOWWWWW. There was one girl taking care of two tables, us and another...But she kept disappearing. The table that was there before us waited a long time for their check and they were visibly agitated. We also experienced an extremely long wait for our check. The girl was friendly just not attentive.   Overall, while I appreciate getting my Thai fix at a lower price then usual, its not at all worth it."}
{"text":"My review was deleted. Already a sucker move. So here goes again.... Mr. J and I went there about two days after it opened. Now, I understand opening week jitters, but this experience was beyond any bugs that needed worked out.  I ordered chicken with peanut sauce and veggies. Did I get a stir fried dish of chicken and veggies in a peanut sauce? No. I got a breaded chicken breast that was cut into chunks, the peanut sauce was poured over it, and the veggies were soggy bits of broccoli and carrots served on the side. No sauce. This was not sold as katsu, so that wasn't the intent of the dish.   Mr. J had ramen. It was so salty that he couldn't eat it. In an attempt to be polite, he asked for a container to take it home and they brought him a Styrofoam clamshell....for soup.  Our meals came with both soup and salad. Why did he get soup appetizer when his meal was soup?? The salads were nice tossed salads, but the dressing smothered the greens and tasted purely of mayonnaise.   There are plenty of decent, and authentic, Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Go to one of those instead."}
{"text":"Wow! I am blown away by Pad Thai Noodles amazing food. I will come back as the owners are so sweet! I love comming back to try the amazing Japanese-Thai Food! This Asian Fusion is one that cant be beat. And the prices are unbeatable!!!"}
