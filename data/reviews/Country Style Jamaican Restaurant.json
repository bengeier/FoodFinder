{"text":"I was in the mood for red fish with rice & beans and remembered this spot I have driven pass. I couldn't stop eating though I was stuffed. Nicely spicy and plentiful portions. Give them a try. Missing a star because the parking situation sucks but it was just about the food for me"}
{"text":"I love love love unassuming locations that pack a major surprise. That would be this location. I ordered the jerk chicken and oxtails. The chicken was just the right amount of heat to meet the juiciness each bite contained. The oxtail was savory just how I like it. The cabbage with mixed veggies had to be the best that I've gotten at a local restaurant in years. Finally, the rice and peas! For a part of the meal that I typically see as a filler, this ended up being the highlight. I don't even know how to explain it other than deliciously intoxicating. Seasoning was spot on, rice and beans were perfectly tender, and the gravy was a generous but not overbearing amount. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really good don't pass this place up when you see it. My favorite is the goat the red snapper and the ox tails just tried the pepper steak yesterday really awesome"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant.  I Love Ox Tail.  One of the best prepared Ox Tail in town.  Plantain were great.  A hidden Gem.  Great value!"}
{"text":"I ordered the large jerk chicken. Portion sizes are really good for the price, the chicken was good but the cabbage and rice and beans was better!"}
