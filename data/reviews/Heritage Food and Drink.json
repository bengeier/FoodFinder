{"text":"Now this is a great restaurant!  It's only been open a short time but Chef Paul has got it together. The restaurant only has 10 tables, but provides a very warm and inviting atmosphere.  The wait staff is superb...very efficient but they don't hover over the table. They know the dishes and can answer any questions concerning ingredients and preparation.  The menu selections are varied and executed with the freshest of local ingredients. This restaurant kind of breaks the mold when you think of a restaurant that serves deviled eggs and pimento cheese. Some call it Southern American cuisine, we called it superb food with a presentation that you might find at a 5-star restaurant in Atlanta...but this is the small town of Waxhaw.   The NC shrimp with Thai sauce over Chinese black rice must be tried. The shrimp were flavorful and the rice was nutty and a great accompaniment. The NC flounder was moist and tasty. The hot apple cobbler was a great way to end a superb meal.  The menu changes weekly to reflect the fresh ingredients that are available.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Incredible Brunch! First and foremost, reservations are absolutely required. I am so excited to have found this little restaurant. Please know, it is best to just trust the dishes the chef has created. Refreshingly, this is not a place where you can get extra fruit on your pancakes...you can go to Stack's for that. These dishes are well thought out and crafted. Leave it! They make a VERY limited amount of freshly made donuts each Sunday. Make an early reservation if you want one. They open at 11am and were out by 11:45. The deviled eggs are amazing. My husband really enjoyed the Arancini."}
{"text":"Heritage Food & Drink is such a great addition to downtown Waxhaw.  The atmosphere of this upscale restaurant is elegant and comfortable.  The food is top-notch and includes menu items with ingredients from local farms.  Give it a try...we loved it!!"}
{"text":"A seriously wonderful treat to have in our small town.  Chef is amazing!  I have  yet to find a thing I haven't enjoyed there.  he has inspired me to try foods I wouldn't normally touch.  A definite taste bud treat!"}
{"text":"Took my wife for dinner on a Thursday for our anniversary. Nice decor. A little tight as far as seating but very comfortable.   Waiter was very attentive and nice. Knew the menu well. My wife ordered a salad and a chicken dish that she enjoyed.  I went the tapas route. Got the curried devil eggs (delicious), the Korean BBQ short ribs (decent), and the 'bacon and eggs' (magnificent).   The beer selection is small, but being a beer aficionado, I still was able to find something hint I liked. Good wine selection.   Overall, everything was fresh and delicious. The waitstaff was great. We got out of there with one entree, a salad, two tapas, an order of deviled eggs, two beers and a glass of wine for $80, without the tip included.   We will be back."}
{"text":"The first experience was underwhelming to say the least. Very expensive and very average. I however, just read an article in my local paper rating it as one of the best places in all of Charlotte. We may need to check it out soon."}
{"text":"I live in Waxhaw and decided to give Heritage a try.  Everything was delicious. Had the fried green tomatoes, GA shrimp risotto, gnocchi, and goat cheese cheesecake.   Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We just tried it for the first time.  Waiter was excellent and so was the cream of mushroom soup.  My wife ordered the grouper which was advertised as the fresh fish of the day.  It was very fishy tasting and did not taste fresh.  I ordered the fried chicken. It was supposed to have a breast, leg and thigh.  I got one leg one thigh and then a leg attached to thigh.  It was also like rubber to eat.  I pointed out that the breast was not present and was told it was the piece attached to the leg.  I don't have a PhD in chicken anatomy, but this isn't possible. It was also all dark meat. They brought me the shrimp instead which also was rubbery and really salty.  We were really dissapointed."}
{"text":"Being a native New Yorker, new to the south, I've been searching for a farm-to-table restaurant that'd fulfill my expectations. This place is it! It's a bit of a drive, and I'd recommend reservations as seating is very limited, but do make the trip! My husband and I started with a delicious salad with warm goat cheese and strawberries marinated in a balsamic vinaigrette - as well as the tempura veggies. For the main course, we chose the chicken (breaded and cooked perfectly) and the strip steak. Both were absolutely delicious. At the end, neither of us had room for dessert - but with a meal like that we couldn't say no... just had to try what else they had in store.  The desserts were a great end to a fantastic meal. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try Heritage for lunch. We arrived to a virtually empty restaurant only to be turned away by a host who instructed us ( in an extremely rude tone) that we would need to make a reservation at least 48 hours before arrival or forget about it! Both the servers snd the chef are really losing out due to poor staff judgement. Customer service begins at the front door. Lesson learned! I think we'll just forget about Heritage! PS Rippingtons was fresh, friendly, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Must go! Service, locally sourced food, presentation, quality and overall yummy goodness-5 stars. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The chef came out to our table and spoke with us.  We are signed up to get notices for their upcoming wine dinners."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best food I have ever eaten. Everything is always seasoned so wonderfully and the deviled eggs are absolutely to die for. My wife raves about this place and says it has some of the most fantastic seasonal dishes. Overall it is such a wonderful experience. I love the simplicity of the decor and minimalist approach to the overall ambience."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely outstanding restaurant. I took my folks here for dinner on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant is decorated beautifully and there is a nice atmosphere. The wait staff is outstanding and knowledgable.   I cannot say enough about the food. Everything truly is farm to table. The calamari was so light and tasty. I had the pork belly for my main course. It was just added to the menu and I hope it stays. My dad's steak was perfectly cooked and was was super tender. My mom had the NC shrimp. She wouldn't share so that tells you right there!!  I highly recommend Heritage. It's a little bit of a ride but you will be glad you made the trip!!    Best of luck Chef Paul!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice to have in Waxhaw.  It provides an upscale place to have a nice dinner. The brunch donuts are very good too!  Using local ingredients is great; some food could use a little more spice, salt.  The combinations should push the flavor forward and sometimes that is missing.  Overall this is a well liked restaurant and provides something we've never had in Waxhaw and needed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It gets great reviews; the menu reads well; and it's in a cute spot.  But unfortunately, I could find very little to recommend.  The sweet potato soup is one-note - sweet.  It would benefit from some salt and a little bit of acid, to make it more complex and less cloying.  The beet salad had potential - and is beautiful - but again, it's as if the chef lost his ability to season.  Undersalted (if salted at all).  The meringues were a nice touch, and I wanted to love this beautiful dish, but without salt, it was dull.  The underseasoned theme continued with the amberjack and duck breast.  I'm sure the chef uses good quality ingredients (the turnips were nice), but when you don't know how to season food, when you don't know how to cook to make those ingredients shine - the best ingredients can't save you.  But underseasoned is only half the battle.  We also had the duck confit pastry - which was just downright terrible.  It had an unappealing flavor, and a texture that resembled dog food.  It's as if the chef pulverized duck, walnuts, figs and blue cheese into a textureless mash, and dropped a glob of it into some puff pastry.  I could barely eat one bite.  The best dish was the goat cheese cheesecake - in that it was tasty, not cloyingly sweet, and the caramel was nicely burnt.  BUT, it shouldn't be called a goat cheese cheesecake!!  It was a regular cheesecake, with a little bit of goat cheese incorporated.  You get none of the goat cheese flavor that is so perfect in a properly executed goat cheese cheesecake.  Service was overbearing and intrusive.  Every server hovered, sweeping away dishes as soon as we appeared done with them.  If I had enjoyed the food, I would have been annoyed at the speed with which it was disappearing from my table.  And finally, my 88 year old grandmother was dining with us, and she asked whether chef could prepare the risotto without cream or milk.  The server asked the kitchen, and returned to say that yes, the chef could prepare the risotto using only wine and stock, and no dairy.  Given that, my grandmother ordered the risotto dish.  What came out was a bowl of rice, with the vegetables and protein as described on the menu.  But it was NOT risotto.  It was boiled rice.  If the chef can't prepare risotto without dairy, that's understandable.  But to say you can provide something, and then send out a bowl of rice - as if expecting that the guests wouldn't know the difference - is unprofessional and truly disrespectful.  All in all, this is a place I wanted to love, but unfortunately, it is not well executed at all.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"O.M.G..... giving 5 stars is very rare for me, but this gem surely deserves it. Hidden along the side of the street, Heritage is run by a chef that used to cook in one of the premier country clubs in Charlotte. Everything is sourced from farmers in the area. The food was fantastic (I had a special, slow cooked short ribs), but the thing that truly stands out is the amazing staff. This was the BEST customer service I've received in a restaurant so far. Always there without being pushy or annoying. There was a mix-up with my order and one of the waiters immediately took charge, corrected the situation and resolved it within minutes. Love this place, will definitely be back soon. My new favorite place to go in the Charlotte area. Who would have thought to find THIS in Waxhaw, NC?"}
{"text":"Awful, pretentious, horrible service. The only reason I'd go back is to watch them lock the doors when they inevitably close. They need to learn some manners and customer service skills."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely wonderful dinner here. Delicious small plates (try the deviled eggs!), and I really enjoyed my short rib and gnocchi main course. My husband raved about his pork belly as well. Very nice restaurant, and fantastic service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant I know of in the area that has some molecular gastronomy on their menu (please message me to correct me if I'm wrong please!).  Excellent food, great service.  This is also farm-to-table so the menu is constantly changing. Deviled egg (with powdered EVOO), pretty typical flavor but yummy.  Tried my friend's app with goat cheese foam and it was light as a cloud and flavorful.  Amberjack was a monster-sized portion and a very mild ginger sauce with snap peas.  I had a bite of the duck and pork porthouse - all of the meats were juicy, cooked to perfection and full of flavor.  2 bottles of wine, plus dessert wines to pair with a goat cheesecake and I believe apple compote.  I tried the pecan dark chocolate, which was a little too rich for my palate but had the most amazing vanilla ice cream I'm told comes from the business next door (so there's another Yelp review to come!) We sat on the patio, so I don't know of the ambiance indoors (I will say I'll be happy when that tree grows all the way in and helps with the shade :)  ).  A CSX train drove by and deafened everyone and annoying teenagers were goofing off aross the street - all easily ignored with the great company I had with this meal.   Gregory served us - he was an absolute professional, friendly and funny.  Will definitely be back.  Price point - \"spendy\" but completely worth every  bite."}
{"text":"First time to Heritage and loved it. Doesn't look like much from the outside but once inside you are greeted with warmth and respect. The apps are very good, the entrees are even better. The service is top notch and the pricing is not expensive at all. We eat out alot and this gem has just become our new mainstay. Fresh, local farmer ingredients and a creative chef lead to tasty food. They also have great desserts and they have a full bar as well.as outside, streetside dinning."}
{"text":"Great combination of flavors, textures, fresh/local ingredients, and great service."}
{"text":"This is the food that all other food gets judged against.   Everything about Heritage is amazing! The atmosphere, the smells, and most importantly the taste. The food here is the best I have ever eaten and that includes 10 years living and eating in Charleston.   I can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"It's a loooong drive down to Waxhaw, but in the end Heritage is worth every mile.  Located in an unassuming strip, the space itself is rather unremarkable.  The service is attentive and capable, but you come here for the off-the-run (and delicious) food.  Our first of what will be several visits was for the valentine's tasting menu and we were not disappointed.  Our palates were treated to courses of champagne oysters, steak tartare, deviled eggs with caviar, and asian-fusion scallops in a to-die-for ginger purée.   Choice of entrees included NC monkfish, bacon wrapped pork loin and ribeye filet.  The land meats were prepared with a slow-brining infusion of spices before being cooked perfectly to temperature.  The bleu cheese grits that accompanied the ribeye were sublime ... and I don't even like bleu cheese!  Dessert was fun albeit maybe a half notch off the rest of the pace.  Creative, to be sure: tempura-battered apple slices with a creme freche sauce for dipping and a scoop of vanilla ice cream atop a biscuit and apple compote.  it was eye candy but just didn't pop in the mouth like everything else did.   The pecan pie was fantastic however ... this isn't your mimi's thanksgiving standby, this is crafted with love.  This chef very clearly enjoys the art of cooking.  And his patrons are the beneficiaries."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Note to owners, since only one entrance, refrain from smoking as entry tables smell smoke the whole night."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed chef Paul's cuisine for years and his new Restaurant is as expected a wonderful experience. His artistry in food and taste are amazing and you will not be disappointed. Everything is fresh and wonderfu,l what a gem for Waxhaw."}
{"text":"The BEST food you can find in Charlotte (or, OK, way outside of Charlotte). I've had this restaurant on my list for years but was never willing to make the drive out to Waxhaw. It's gotta be some good food to spend over an hour in the car, but it was totally worth it.  They really mean they have farm to table. When we first sat down the waitress said they have two fish dinners left. When we ordered drinks, there was just one. They had the best duck I've ever had, and it came with the freshest vegetables I've ever had. I would highly recommend it. The duck breast was a really good portion and plumper than anything I've had.   Also of note, I had a spicy sweet potato soup that was wonderful, and I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes. It feels a little weird that their \"specialty\" is deviled eggs. I don't know anyone that loves this food, but I got their deviled egg of the day (goat cheese and horse radish) and they were fantastic."}
{"text":"As a foodie transplanted from Chicago to Charlotte, Heritage Food & Drink is by far one of the top five finest restaurants I've been to since we moved three years ago. The sun choke chips & dip were delicious & original. My scallop, complete perfection. My husband ordered the braised beef short rib w/ homemade fettuccine. I was lucky enough to get a taste, like everything else it was divine. The owner Paul was personable & chatted it up w/ us for quite a while. Heritage Food & Drink is worth the trip out to Waxhaw. I've never written a review before but this farm to table restaurant should not be missed!"}
{"text":"Another outstanding meal.  I shake my head at the reviews on here that refer to this place as McDonalds or worse. This restaurant has been rated one of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area within the last few years by actual food critics.  I'll take their word.   Anyway, as usual, the food was fresh, creative,  delicious and all around terrific.  From the chorizo deviled eggs, to the perfectly cooked, no grit scallop that i  struggle to find in high end seafood restaurants,  to my duck or my wife's trout to our desserts; it was another home run.  Our server was terrific. I will be sad when they move from this location as it is convenient,  but maybe a larger space will get rid of some of the complaints folks have had about seating options.   The trick is, can chef keep up the exceptional quality serving a larger seating. That is always the great trick. For my wife and I, we will continue to return regularly before the relocation."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for a date on a Friday night. Our reservation was at 7:30. The appetizer we wanted was sold out. The soup I ordered was....sold out.  We ended up each getting a salad and splitting a meal which was ok.  We wouldn't go back as the food was only ok and pretty over priced.  We tried this restaurant because of the reviews we had been reading and hearing about.  So, although our experience was a disappointment, we may have just been there on a bad night."}
{"text":"Love this place, farm to table for real, outside seating, inside nice decor & a full bar. Food is creative, pretty & tasty.  Leave room for desert (ginger cake yum).  Nice addition to the waxhaw main strip."}
{"text":"Worth the drive from Charlotte.  Ambience is not fancy, so no need to get too dressed up.  Service was very good.  Our waiter was good and there was another waiter that was not our waiter, but he still assisted us.  He was really great with descriptions of food and recommendations.  I love when I ask for suggestions and get lots of details back, so I really appreciated that.  We enjoyed everything we had!  My husband and I split the following:  1-Deviled egg of the day - it had chorizo and goat cheese the night we went.  Delish!  I think every time I go I'd have to at least try the egg of the day.  2-Tempura broccoli-sound simple but wow, must better than I could have expected.  Great flavor and the dipping sauce was sooo good!  3-Scallop small plate- perfectly cooked and all the flavors on the plate meshed perfectly  4-NC Trout-trout is not my favorite fish, but I love seafood, so had to try it.  So glad we did.  THe risotto was amazing and the golden beets mixed in were a treat.    5-Ginger cake for dessert!  Cake was a tiny bit dry but had great flavor.  THe ice cream with it was great.  Overall a great way to end the meal.  I saw someone next to us ask for the tasting menu.  The chef just sent out dishes for her and she had the waiter pair wine with it.  I didnt know about they would do this, but would love to try it.  This was a perfect amount of food for us.  We will make the drive back down from CLT!"}
{"text":"First time and definitely not the last! Chef Paul served locally grown food choices that had our taste buds wanting only more from Waxhaw! High quality and exceptional flavor. We will be back for another great experience. Thank you Chef!  Joyce H."}
{"text":"I'm so grateful Tonya P. put this chef's tasting together and I was lucky enough to be invited.  As there are a few others from our table that have perfectly worded their reviews, I'll just keep mine a little shorter and straight to the point.  That point is, Chef Paul is doing some amazing stuff at this little place south of Charlotte and his lovely server Sara made it quite a personable experience.  Chef started us off with a pimento deviled egg.  Great start.  Perfectly cooked, just the right amount of smokiness out of the pimento.  Served over an olive oil powder.  A little molecular gastronomy but not being pretentious about it.  Southern style fare and farm to table ingredients.  That seems to more or less be his theme, with the occasional Asian influence.  Quite respectable style.  Hopefully Tonya got some good pics of the second dish I encouraged everyone to bite into their turnip tempura as quickly as possible.  Wow.  Just a well thought out dish with great texture and perfectly subtle flavors.  There was a sweet chili sauce that brought the whole Asian vibe together.  I don't eat much fried food anymore, but will always grab something tempura here if its on the menu.  The 3rd dish was a beet themed dish and I am not a fan of beets.  This pungent root vegetable has to be perfectly roasted or sweetened some how for it to work with me, but he pulled it off.  One of the first bites was almost like a beet red velvet cake with a goat cheese foam.  I then took a little smear of the balsamic and it paired superbly  As I got down to the bottom of the parfait, the beet flavor and consistency wasn't as light.  I respect what he's doing here and a beet lover would probably think this was heaven, but those last bites were just a little bit too earthy for my palate.  Still a great dish though.  For the next plate, the black eyed peas and ham over a hot sauce were great.  Spicy, but flavorful and not overly spicy.  As for the fried oyster on top, I don't know if the tempura was just so amazing that anything fried couldn't compete or it was the fact that I havn't eaten a cooked oyster in quite some time, but the fried oyster didn't quite do it for me.  It was a good oyster, just wasn't as over the top as the rest of my dinner.  After that we were served shrimp over shiitake, bok choy, and black rice.  The shrimp were great.  Simple, straightforward, just a quality ingredient cooked right.  The bok choy and shiitake were both extremely tender and quite flavorful as well.  There was a sauce with this one as well.  Kentuckyaki.  I've made something similar before, but he takes it to a whole nother level.  More or less a bourbon teriyaki.  Yet again though, the sauce took time and effort, but it didn't overpower or become the star of the dish, it just complimented it like it should.  I have to echo Paul C's statement about the rice being under cooked though.  This is my only complaint on the night where the kitchen might have messed up a little and it wasn't me just being picky.  And trust me, I look for things to critique.  I had some crunchy bites and I just don't think that's what they were going for here.  Oh the duck breast, how do I love the.  To know that a Charlotte area chef has the attention to detail and love of ingredients to trust that he could serve his duck that rare changes my whole perspective on Charlotte food.  It was simply amazing.  The root vegetables and puree  it was served over brought it all together.  I think this and the tempura were my 2 favorites, with the shrimp and deviled egg both coming close behind.  To my surprise there were 2 dessert courses.  I'm not a huge dessert fan, but I know a good one when I find it.  The first was kind of a mousse in a parfait, but a little different consistency.  The parfait was glued to the plate with a different but yet still lovely chocolate.  A great, well thought out dish, but the second dessert stole the show.  When a chef serves you one bite on a spoon, that takes courage.  The dry powdered cocoa on top of this bite made the liquid chocolate explosion inside that much more exciting.  A must try, especially for the chocolate lover.  All in all this was one of the best meals I've ever had in the Charlotte area.  When out-of-towners ask for advice I'll be telling them Kindred's on the north side, Good Food for closer downtown and here for the southside.  Great beer, attentive staff, beautiful presentation, and most importantly as all, just serious good eats.  I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"This restaurant can be summed up in two words: Over Rated. I am a foodie who has eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the country, so when we read the reviews we had to visit. Upon the waiters recommendation, we ordered the deviled eggs and mixed greens salad. The lettuce was loosely piled on the plate which, if compressed, wouldn't be enough to feed a small rabbit. The deviled eggs were good but nothing to write home about. Our entrees were the NC shrimp which were rubbery and fried chicken which didn't hold a candle to Prices chicken coop in uptown Charlotte where you get far better chicken for half the price. Whoever rated this is as of the best restaurants in Charlotte needs a culinary reality check. Overall total disappointment at this price point. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch. Worth a drive out to waxhaw. Make sure to get your reservation in early. Food was amazing. The handmade donuts and coffe made my day!"}
{"text":"Get ready to have your taste buds go wild. Heritage challenges anything \"Uptown\". Absolutely Wonderful!"}
{"text":"We recently went to Heritage to celebrate our anniversary and we were blown away!  The food is locally sourced so the menu changes weekly and the options are varied and creative.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations based on our questions.    I had the spontaneously composed vegetable plate and my husband had the fish special (FL Amberjack).  He said the only fish he's every had that's even comparable was on our last trip to Maui at Mama's Fish House (which would've been pulled out of the pacific ocean that morning), so I'd stay that's a HUGE endorsement.  I noticed a lot of beets on the menu so I asked if the veggie plate could avoid beets and the chef was happy to oblige.  I can't even begin to tell you how amazing these vegetables were, everything was just wonderful!  For dessert we ordered a pie that came with some ice cream from Waxhaw Creamery and again - blown away.  We had a wonderful anniversary dinner and can't wait to get back to Heritage again soon.  What a wonderful little gem of a restaurant in downtown Waxhaw!!"}
{"text":"Tim and I wandered in on a weeknight not really knowing what to expect and of course having no reservations.  However, we were seated immediately. Based on where we were seated, we will not return without reservations.  Be warned...this is a small space and some of the tables are not optimal!  So, we were seated in the lower section in a row of 2 top tables.  This is less than optimal because the tables are so painfully close together.  (I was reminded of being at restaurants in Germany where you are just straight-up seated at tables with total strangers... not really my preference especially when out on date night with my S.O.!)  Seriously, being practically on top of our  neighbors, we felt awkward as we could hear their entire conversation & found ourselves to be very quiet as we realized the same was true in reverse.  So enough of that, on to the food & service. Our service was pretty good... no complaints on service except for 1 small critique about how the server described the small plates.  I think the server was overselling when she described the small plates as designed to share between 2- 3 people... maybe that works  for some but not not all small plates.    When we were there, they had a cheese plate and a diver scallop selection.  The cheese plate was fine for sharing but the scallop was not.  1 small scallop split 2 or 3 ways is not really my idea of an adequate starter, even if it was cooked perfectly... especially when the price point for that 1 small plate was somewhere in the $10-12 range from what I recall. (The scallop was sitting in some micro greens with a little balsamic, but no other garnishment on it.)    My recommendation is to order at least 1 small plate for everyone in your party. Or skip those and go for soup & salad.  So on to the entrees. The night we were there, they did not have many options that appealed to Tim so he ordered the fried chicken dish. Definitely not what he would typically go for since he's a red-meat sort of guy...but  it turned out to be fabulous! It was seasoned & cooked perfectly and the veggies that accompanied it were very tasty. It was served with fresh Greenbeans and some of of potato-thing... almost  sort of a deconstructed potato salad is how it appeared  to me.  I ordered the NC Shrimp which was served with fresh local veggies. It was totally delicious! I would definitely order that again because it was so flavorful and just delightful. I can't stress enough how good this dish was...can I give it more than 5 stars?? (Just writing this review has me craving it!)  We also had a bottle of white wine which was the perfect accompaniment to our meal.  We decided to skip dessert  because nothing jumped out at us on this visit.  But for around $100 (before tip) we had an excellent meal & bottle of wine in a wonderful establishment. I would have given it 5 stars had we not been squished together with our neighboring table.  We definitely plan to go back but next time we will make a reservation and request a different table.  I am a big fan of this chef and the whole farm-to-fork concept. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  First time there but it totally lived up to its hype!  Flavors were great.  Definitely try the deviled eggs!  Butterscotch pudding for dessert!  Definitely go!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for our anniversary after reading that this restaurant was one of the top 25 restaurants in the greater Charlotte area that you should eat at before you die. So bring foodies, we were eager to try a new restaurant in the town we just recently moved to. The atmosphere is good considering the location. The thing that we LOVED about this place is the farm to table sourcing of the food. All local and we love that!  The wait staff was good and very nice. The only reason I am ranking this a 3 out of 5 is that when we leave a restaurant we always rank our \"wow factor\" with each other and after we had finished our meals we were both shocked that it made a \"places to eat before you die\" list. It was good but it did not \"wow\" us and we likely won't be back just simply for that reason. Maybe we are just spoiled coming from eating at restaurants in the greater Philadelphia/NYC area but we have eaten at places where when we left we couldn't wait to get back. This place was nice, clean, friendly and acceptable but certainly no \"wow, I'll be back\" for either of us."}
{"text":"Husband took me in the middle of the week, so the restaurant was pretty empty. Our server was friendly, polite, and knew everything about everything. Like any higher end place, the portions are pretty small, but they were absolutely amazing. I even had beet/sweet potatoes that were out of this world, and I hate beets. The combinations of flavors in each dish were so different, but delicious. It's out of my price range for making a frequent stop there, but it's a great treat."}
{"text":"What a fantastic meal, service and ambience! Truly spectacular with locally sourced veggies and beer and a personal visit from the chef- couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"I've heard it's permanently closed!  What a shame.  This was one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Another great meal from Chef.  Farmer inspired. Just come way out here and enjoy. A salad of mozzarella and more tiny tomato thingies except peeled not pickled with arugula and tasty drizzle stuff. A small plate of one scallop, truffle on corn with different tasty drizzle stuff. It was fantastic but I'm pescetarian. The other is a quail breast with quail confit sautéed okra, butterbeans and onion sticks thingies. Really good.   The staff are awesome and the place inside is very comfortable. Very good wine selection and a few beers and liquors."}
{"text":"Tonight, my first experience at Heritage was like watching The Matrix for the first time.  Ok, that might sound a bit strange but bear with me. Far away from the madness of Uptown, in the quaint, Conroy-esque setting of Waxhaw, sits this truly amazing and unique restaurant. I typically have the ability to read a menu and, based on the brief description given, visualize an assumption of what will be set before me as a final dish. At Heritage, every single time, I was so wrong - in a great way. Nowhere on the menu will you find the often intimidating terms foam, gel, reduction or sous vide. But you will find all of those elements on the beautifully built plates. Every dish was truly fun and unexpected. They were exciting and colorful. But at no point were taste or quality sacrificed for aesthetics. Every time a dish came to the table I happily reached for the menu to remind myself of its components, like reading a map of my plate. My wife and I ordered 4 of the Small Plates, 1 of the Salads and 2 of the Big Plates. Without taking up too much more of your attention span I will say that if I had to choose the highlights they would be the Watermelon Salad (favorite), the Quail Breast (close second) and the Deviled Eggs (even more close third). Actually, I will elaborate on the Deviled Eggs for just a moment. Most of the time when I see Deviled Eggs on a menu I am immediately excited but ultimately disappointed. So many times at restaurants all over Charlotte, and the Southeast for that matter, when deviled eggs arrive at the table they are far too reminiscent of the rubber balls dispensed from gum ball machines and are also sitting in a small puddle of water. The eggs at Heritage had a texture and temperature that made me believe they where shelled minutes prior. The Classic were just that, and could stand toe to toe with any at your favorite pot luck (where, in my life, I have always experienced the best of the best). In the Of the Day, with hot pepper, arugula and goat cheese on this particular day, they managed to incorporate all of those flavors in a way where I could taste and appreciate them but still know what I was eating - a deviled egg.  I remember walking out of the movie theater,  having just seen The Matrix, and wishing that I could see it all over again for the first time. I realised tonight, after we left Heritage, that I had the same feeling. I wished I could go back and order those dishes again for the first time, not knowing how they would look or taste when they came to the table. I guess the best part is that we did not order everything on the menu - so there are more surprises to be had. Hats off to the great group they have in the kitchen and out in front. We had excellent service and a great experience and will certainly be back soon - with friends."}
{"text":"Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 21 Stars, er, 10 Stars, er.....OK dangit - 5 FULL STARS!  First off, a HUGE shout out to my gal pal Tonya from Poprock Photography for making this all possible! She invited me and arranged this wonderful 8 course tasting meal for all 9 of us Yelpers! So Thank You Tonya!  So where do I begin? So far in my 4 years here in Charlotte, this was the most \"unique\" dinner I've had, and that is a huge homage to Chef Paul Verica, an obvious master of using molecular gastronomy in a thoughful, meaningful way!  This was a \"special tasting\" for us Yelpers, and Chef Verica DELIVERED in a big way!   Course Un - Deviled Egg with Piemento Cheese made with a sharp cheddar cheese served over an olive oil \"powder.\" For those of you NOT familiar with molecular gastronomy techniques, these special Chefs have to not only be great cooks, but also good chemists as they know how to use chemistry to manipulate ingredients into a simpler state or element, yet give the same or similar taste to your senses. In this case, Chef Verica turned Olive Oil into a fine powder to be used as a base garnish for this wonderful first course. Trust me folks, this is NOT your Grandma's Deviled Eggs! Great way to kick off our Alice in Wonderland meal!  Course Deux - Perhaps my favorite dish of the evening, a Turnip prepared as a PERFECT tempura dish with a sublime sweet heat chili sauce. It was almost evanescent as the second it hit your tongue it disappeared, yet left an incredibly savory taste profile. The chili sauce was subtle yet consisted of the perfect balance of sweet and heat. And I am missing SO many of the other descriptors.....Suffice it to say that tThis course can only be described as WOW!  Course Trois - Multi beet salad, prepared \"sous vide,\" foamed goat cheese with liquid beet sauce and 25 year old balsamic. I am normally NOT a beet fan, but again, Chef Verica turned something that I normally don't kick doors down for into something that was very delicious! He took FRESH farm beets and used all components into different textures and flavor profiles. The combination of beets (to me normally bitter - but he sous vide them!) and the foamed goat cheese, and a dab of that 25 year old balsamic vinegar was SUBLIME! Together the flavors all worked.  Course Quatre - Alabama oyster over black eyed peas and a surreal 10 pepper sauce. While oysters are normally not my \"go to\" seafood, this one was prepared deliciously by Chef Verica yet again. That 10 pepper sauce had good heat but not overly HOT. The only complaint our table had was that the oyster itself was a tad \"chewy\" in places. OK, mulligan! Overall this was delicious!  Course Cinq - Florida shrimp over black rice, shitake mushrooms, \"Kentuckyaki\" sauce (ponzu, bourbon, teryiyaki, star anise) and a few other cool things that I simply didn't catch! Let me just summarize - DELICIOUS! OK, so we all thought that the black rice was a TAD undercooked. Yup, it stuck to my teeth a litlle. But I manned up and snarfed down the utterly delicious shrimp and that \"Kentuckyaki\" sauce was unbelievable! Pure genius at work here. Not overpowering in any way as many Teriyaki based sauces CAN be. But Chef Verica showed restraint, as he did with the addition of his Bourbon, to create an elixer of Ambrosia. That more than made up for the undercooked rice in my book.  Course Six - Duck breast, sunchoke, rutabega, turnip, spinach and fig glaze. The duck breast was also sous vide (he seems to like this method, as do I at home!) as it was very moist, tender and flavorful! Adding anything sweet to a \"game\" meat always works, and this one did so in droves. That Sunchoke puree was phenomenal, and while I normally am not an artichoke fan, this was truly amazing. Yet another dish Chef Verica \"converted\" me to!  Course Sept - A 64%cocoa, peanut butter \"powder,\" dark chocolate powder on the side, with the cup \"glued\" to the plate with dark chocolate! More molecular gastronomy at work here with the peanut butter powder. This was basically a \"mousse\" times 100! Mixing the powder with the chocolate was incredible. What was MORE incredible to me was that they wanted you to discover that the glass cup was \"glued\" to the plate with a DARK chocolate, and that screamed for you to scrape it off and mix it with the dry dark chocolate powder on the plate. OMFG. Don't know what else to say. Heartburn be damned I'm snarfing this down!  Course Huit-Chocolate Explosion...a one bite wonder of all things chocolate! This is the ultimate in molecular gastronomy - a one bite of heaven!  It TRULY is amazing what an expert Chef can do to thing that we normally may not like and transform them into something we all of a sudden love. How does this happen? With skill, passion, dedication and LOVE of food and cooking. THAT is why I am a \"Foodie\" and that is why I LOVE the food scene here in Charlotte (now Waxhaw).   Easily the TOP 2 Restaurants so far I've eaten at in Charlotte! Only Barrington's can compare...so far! WOW!"}
{"text":"Yes... it is as good as it gets... so well prepared... interesting and just damn good tasting."}
{"text":"A very nice, quaint little upscale restaurant in cozy little Waxhaw.  Very surprised to find such a high end quality restaurant outside of a main city center, like Charlotte.  They specialize in farm fresh ingredients and highlight which farm is providing what on the menu.  Truly, their menu varies by the day depending on what they procure.  It is about as fresh as you can find.  The menu is not large.  A daily soup and a couple of appetizers head the offerings, followed by what they call small plates and snacks which are larger appetizers and could be make into a meal.  Their deviled eggs, one of my favorites, was not a choice of mine since they put smoked trout on them.  To others...they love them.  Pork belly, oysters, clams and chicken livers were part of the small plate offerings.  Each uniquely presented...hard to describe other than to say that they were \"fancy.\"  Main courses included duck, trout, pork, shrimp and chicken.  Again:  fancy.  I had the pork loin and my portion was just about the whole loin.  Very good that I even liked the braised cabbage served with it.    It is very small inside with only about 10 tables at best.  Please make a reservation to ensure that you will get in.  Turnover is slow as people chat and munch and sip, so waiting in not a very good option.  Unique to what was a rural farming area, The Heritage is definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Best place in Waxhaw and would easily hold its own Uptown.   Seasoned chef with some skills!   Menu changes quite often so it is great to be able to try all types of upscale food.   The place is small and cozy, so reservations would be recommended.  Sunday brunch is awesome!"}
{"text":"I found this place because of another app.  We decided to try it!  So glad we did.  The staff was super friendly.  The atmosphere very tasteful and clean!  Then the food!  Very delicious.  You have to try their donuts, lime pickles, and Chef Paul's home style sweet potatoes.  We were there early Sunday morning for breakfast...get there after 12:30 and you might want to make a reservation...fills up fast...ooohh...and so did my stomach! :)"}
{"text":"A bit of a haul from Charlotte, but well worth the trip. The restaurant is small, so the table spacing is tight.  The starters we selected Arancini, sunchoke chips,  and deviled eggs. The Arancini was phenomenal. Super savory and perfectly seasoned. The sunchoke chips with the aioli were a the best version of chips I've had. The aioli had a remarkable depth of flavor. Deviled eggs were delicious but paled in comparison to the other apps.  For the entree I got duck breast with winter vegetables. The duck was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy skin. The veggies had a nice acidity to balance the duck. The black rice provided a nice base.  Desert was dessert was a deconstructed smore, Which was glorius.  Service was top notch. Servers were very knowledgeable and the pace of the meal was perfect. Allowing for conversation but not too spread out. Plus our waiter handled a difficult table with grace.  Beer and wine selection. The keg ran out on my SO's choice and they comped a glass of similar beer."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've eaten at Heritage; I have one word: outstanding! Today I took friends visiting from RI, which has a very active restaurant scene and they were throughly impressed! My country ham, arugula, and goat cheese quiche, with delicious homemade pie crust was light and absolutely amazing! Country fried chicken and omelette was raved about, as was the pancakes my teen daughters thoroughly enjoyed. Wait staff is attentive, knowledgable, and friendly. Highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful service. We loved the fried cheese small plate and the Korean BBQ beef. Farm to table really sets it a notch above the rest too. To sum up: unique, eclectic, fresh, and yummy. We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after friends of ours raved about it - so glad we did!  It's right in downtown Waxhaw, and looks like just another storefront. However, it's quite cute inside with about ten tables and a small bar tucked away in back. Lighting is just about perfect and atmosphere is subdued but still casual.   Service was topnotch: we had three waiters who covered our table, including one who double as a sommelier with spot on wine recommendations. We never waited for anything and the timing was great. In fact, the owner and chef came by twice to check on us, which is a nice touch and shows he cares.  The menu is really interesting and ever-changing since the chef (Paul) is very true to farm-to-fork. On our night we had the sunchoke chips with buttermilk dip, a lovely sweet potato soup, the black bass and the scallop entree. All of them were GREAT - complex flavors, imaginative presentation, and served at the correct temp. In particular the Black bass is dynamite - the combo of collards, black-eyed pea's and fish are exceptional. Oh yes, try the deviled eggs to start: even if you aren't a fan you will like them.  Overall this was one of our best experiences in Charlotte, probably only behind Barringtons in service and food. I encourage you to make the drive and check it out."}
{"text":"First time dining here.  We were a party of four, greeted promptly and our table was ready within a very reasonable time based on our reservation.  Excellent choice of liquors, not a huge selection but well chosen options.   Crystal our server was knowledgeable about the menu items as well as the local sources of food. She was extremely pleasant and the reason for the five star vs. the four star on the rating. The scallops were excellent, the salads all very well done with an amazing local goat cheese.  We felt a wonderful fried green tomato was overshadowed by too much toppings.  Entrees were all well done despite some chewy beans.  (Not a chef issue, just the produce)  We enjoyed and will return again soon."}
{"text":"Consider me on the Heritage bandwagon! The fella and I made reservations a few weeks ahead of time for a Saturday evening at 6:30. We got there around 6:10 and only waited a few minutes to be seated.  Inside is fairly small - I think there was one room in the front, and then a bigger room down a few steps where the bar was. Even though the dress code says \"dressy,\" we decided to go with jeans and a sweater (me) and khaki shorts and a collared shirt (fella), and we were fine. Even the waiters were in jeans!  Service was top-notch, and our waiter went over a few of each item in the salads, starts, and entrees, and the ingredients were local and fresh. We started with the fried green tomatoes with pulled pork, pimento cheese, and fried onions ($10). There were two and they were HUGE. And yummy. After that, our waiter brought some bread with three dipping sauces - olive oil & balsamic vinegar, pimento cheese with cream, and a spinach something, which was my favorite.  For dinner, I went with the pork chop ($23) which came with cinnamony, pureed sweet potatoes, spinach, turnips, and apples, and the fella went with the trout ($23) which was fried and came with spicy grits, collards, and corn meal. I don't normally like grits or collards, but they were both pretty tasty. My only gripe was that I ordered my pork chop medium rare - which most chefs are scared to do - and it came medium, if not a little medium well.  We were stuffed, but I'll bet dessert was as tasty as everything else. Parking looks like it could be a little tricky if the lot out front is full, but Heritage is worth circling for a spot and worth heading to Waxhaw."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly however the entrees are overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. My daughter ordered the fish and chips and she said that was really good. I ordered the corned beef and cabbage. The corned beef was cooked nicely as was the cabbage. The mashed potatoes were seasoned well but very runny. Definitely not a $14 entree. My husband ordered the shepherds pie and again runny mashed potatoes on top of seasoned beef with frozen carrots and peas. I think it would have been okay if it was priced at $5.99. Maybe this is more of bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Sorry - but we don't get it?!  How do so many people rate this place so highly?  Was it just a bad night for the food...and service...and atmosphere...and they did not accept my AMEX card?  My review is simple - McDonald's quality-level ingredients that had been uncomfortably \"dressed up for a masquerade party\", and priced like Guy Savoy's.    Our appetizer and dinners were pretty to look at, but not to savor. Tempura Okra was actually not authentic tempura, duck was chewy, and fried trout was limp with oil...but...did I mention...the dishes were really pretty!  This is not a \"destination restaurant\" worthy of a special birthday experience. Very limited seating; our only choices were tables near the front door, the pathway to the bar, or near the toilet.  This is where the evening should have ended, but since we made the drive we decided to grin-and-bear-it.  We reserved an early table so we could have a leisurely experience. Unfortunately, once seated we were repeatedly nudged along by a waiter more eager to explain the menu and repeatedly prompt us to order than facilitate a nice dining experience.   The bread was GREAT!"}
{"text":"I enjoy great food. And after reading the Charlotte Magazine reviews of Heritage I went with high hopes of a \"knock it out of the park\" meal. I was completely under-whelmed. The food was too busy and seemed as if the chef was trying too hard to incorporate too much farm-to-table into each dish. The flavors weren't distinguishable. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to check this spot out for a while. Love the concept of farm to table.  Service was fantastic! Server went the extra mile to accommodate the kiddos and my ice coffee request.   We started our Sunday Brunch with chocolate and mochachino doughnuts. Both were good but we liked the mochachino best. Next up was the Heritages popular deviled eggs. Have to say we were a little disappointed. Tried both the original and pimento. In my opinion it was missing something. Needed a little kick.   Main course dishes we tried the buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup. Delish! Loved the light and airy texture with a nice crispy finish. House made jams and whipped butter served on the side. The Risotto+scallops with roasted veggie dish was also tasty. Enjoyed the fresh veggies and savory mix with the pecorino cheese. Two of the four in our group enjoyed the fish and chips. North Carolina trout served with a Siracha sauce drizzled on the top. The vinegar in the coleslaw was a perfect compliment with the fish. Nice way to round out the dish and balance out the flavors.   Although we were stuffed we couldn't pass up the dessert. We opted for the Chocolate Chess Pie. Lovely presentation served with little dollops of chocolate and caramel and topped with fresh whipped cream.   5 stars to Heritage - we walked away happy and full. Look forward to the next visit when I return to Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Great food, from an accomplished chef. The small plates are varied and subject to frequent change with market availability . It great to see a restaurant that is so focussed on farm-to-table, still be able to produce such a high quality menu.  I've been there twice in the past six weeks and can't wait to go back. Word of warning, you will need a reservation! This little gem has been discovered and  is deservedly popular.."}
{"text":"OMG.  I am a foodie - just moved to Waxhaw, and was so lucky to have my first meal at Heritage last night.  This chef, Paul- is truly a top chef.  Every single item we shared, from the Beet salad- to the dessert and dessert wine ( I had the Cloze 2013) was so 10 stars.  The Chef has a American/farm-to table theme, with twists of gastronomy and serious plating skill.  Most everything on menu is sourced locally.  Truly whom ever visits me will be going to Heritage.  Service was impeccable and since I live in walking distance I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"The scene: An intimate 8 course chef's tasting menu at Heritage Food & Drink.  A long table full of my Yelp friends. Sparkling glasses of water, craft beer and wine on a crisp white table cloth. The interior of the restaurant is warm, understated and cozy.  The courses: Deviled Egg with Pimento Cheese, Tempura Whole Baby Turnips with Sweet Chili Sauce, Beet Tartar with Beet Sponge Cake, Florida Shrimp with Black Rice, Baby Bok Choy, and Shitake Mushrooms, Gulf Oyster with Black Eyed Peas, Ham and Hot Sauce, Duck Breast with Sunchoke Puree, Brussel Sprouts and Fig Glaze.   Dessert courses: Chocolate Mousse Hybrid with powdered Peanut Butter, Chocolate Explosion Truffle layered with Powdered Cocoas.   Every course was delicious, well thought out and executed. The plating was the really exciting part. Each dish was like a beautiful painting. The Tempura, Seafood and Dessert courses especially stood out for me.  Our servers: Incredible.  Genuine. Knowledgeable. Highly attentive. Friendly. The sheer number of plates and silverware they turned over was impressive.  The ingredients: Locally sourced. Seasonal. Utilized in both a functional, \"dish constructing\" way while simultaneously highlighting each ingredient's flavor. The results are complex synergistic dishes.  The Chef: Chef Paul is just plain great! He is passionate about his ingredients and transforming them in distinct ways. A real artist with some amazing molecular gastronomy techniques.  The finale: Smiles all around. Warm hugs, handshakes and goodbyes.  The summary:  Worth the trip to Waxhaw. The real deal. Five star food and service. Experience it for yourself!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had one of the best dinners ever. Outstanding meal with great flare. Totally recommend and we will be back to do the brunch."}
{"text":"Heritage supports local farmers and provides frequent menu changes to pair with the seasonal produce. The service also deserves 5 stars. The staff made us felt very welcome and made our dining experience pleasant. We opt with choosing smaller plates as our appetizer and entree. I had the 36 hour short rib and the Korean BBQ beef. We lastly topped it all off with the apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream. We were both so happy and full by the end of the night. We didn't even had any wine but the food made us felt so giggly. This place definitely deserves more rave. Thanks to the chef and the wonderful staff for creating what a real dining experience should be!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.  We live near Waxhaw, but never knew this gem was here.  It's in a quaint space, with high ceilings, so it didn't seem cramped.  Our waiter, Jerry, was attentive and knowledgeable.  Hubs ordered the fried chicken dinner, and I had the NC shrimp with risotto.  This is not your grandmas cooking- it's better, however impossible that seems.  Hubs is also a dessert snob, nothing is ever 'great'.  Well, the dessert he chose, was a chocolate cake with nougat and a sauce that reminded me of a deconstructed snickers bar on steroids.  He proudly exclaimed, 'best dessert in Nc!'.  I got an asparagus flavored ice cream with rich ginger and lemon flavors that I cannot remember the name of.  I thought, something different, I'll try it.  Well, I could have licked the plate clean.  Who knew asparagus could be made into a dessert that would win over dessert snobs? I forgot to mention the appetizer of beef tartare, fried oysters, egg yolk shooter.  Again, you have to try it to realize how amazing the flavors and textures work together. We will be back again, since we share the zip code, but even if you aren't close- this place is worth any drive if you love good fresh food."}
{"text":"Heritage Food and Drink is our favorite restaurant!  Living in Ballantyne you would think we have access to countless restaurants with quality food, but there is no comparison to what Chef Paul puts on a plate for you.   How did we even find this restaurant?  We happened to see a chef purchasing vegetables and meat at the Waxhaw Farmers Market one Saturday and asked the vendor who he was.  That's the best part about Chef Paul!  He spends a lot of time traveling to more than one farmers market to find the freshest, highest quality produce and meat to serve his patrons.    The experience starts with friendly Sean taking your to your table with a smile.  If you go more than once you'll start to get to know Steve, Greg and Andy who make your dining experience relaxing, fun and a true pleasure.    What have we tried?  We have our favorites, but we also look forward to what Chef Paul comes up with!  The menu changes with what is freshest for the season.  This isn't just food, it's art on a plate and it's all created to titillate your taste buds.  Whether it's the most tender filet mignon on a blue cheese risotto or house pasta with shrimp, country ham, yolk and basil, they are ALL fantastic.  We went for Valentine's Day this year when it was a set menu and I can tell you it was the BEST meal of our lives.  This is from people who have to travel for work all over the world and have the benefit of trying all sorts of cuisine.  I struggle to even describe all the creations Chef Paul came up with.  Being a dessert nut, I still look at the picture of the large ceramic tile that had scoops of chocolate ice cream from the creamery next door, the chocolate meringue crumbles, truffles and a lot more.  I'm like a bragging mom when I show the picture to my friends.  I need to get better at taking pictures of all the food, but when you get it in front of you, taking those pictures is the last thing on your mind!  You just want to eat it!  On a normal night?  Goat cheese cheese cake...not too sweet, very subtle...delish.  Hubby loves the chocolate cremeux with peanut butter powder (yes, he dabbles in molecular gastronomy).  To end your evening?  Chef Paul always comes out and says hello, asks how your meal was.  We've even met his lovely wife who I KNOW has to be behind the beautiful fresh flowers that are always on the tables and in the restaurant.    And if that isn't good enough, we tried brunch on Sunday too!  Fresh made donuts with a twist along with more traditional ones...bourbon bacon?  YUM!  Rosemary lavender?  Seriously?  I took one home too!  And even if you're not hung over, the \"hangover\" is to die for.  Locally baked bread layered pimento spread, fried green tomatoes, pulled pork, topped with an egg, bacon strip and crispy onion rings.  Nirvana!  Let's sum it up, fantastic food, fantastic chef, fantastic staff.  We might be moving to Denver, NC and we would drive the 1  1/2 to come back to Heritage Food and Drink.  It's THAT good."}
{"text":"Wow!  The food is fab and the bartender,  Greg , can really shake things up!!!! He is like a poet with his liquid concoctions !!!! He defines the art of mixology.  Just ask him to get creative and you will be in awe of his talents!  thanks Greg!"}
{"text":"We came back, and couldn't be happier we did.  They have their act together now.  All the entrees in our party of six were excellent as were the appetizers, the service and the ambiance.  One of our favorite spots in Charlotte.  A little bummed that everyone else knows about them now - after a number of appearances in Charlotte mag (making last-minute reservations very tough to come by) - but happy chef Verica is getting his due!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all for my book club.  We have had our Christmas party there since it opened and many of our members have returned and recommended to others.  This time we were seated at two different tables even though there were long tables set up that were not used on this Tuesday night. But the food and service are what is important. We were encouraged to ask questions about the menu, which we did because descriptions are minimal.  When the small plate menu says \"chicken livers\", you don't expect a cold chicken liver mousse.  I was told I should have asked more questions.  Five people got the squash soup, which was much spicier than described, and asked for bread. We were served two personal sized rolls for each table.  Later, when we asked for more, they said their only bread was for the last seating.  A couple of the ladies have always taken a meal or a dessert to their husbands, but this time we were told that the chef doesn't think his food travels well.  We left there feeling like that was no longer a place that wanted our patronage."}
{"text":"first off, gotta love the fake one star review below... Heritage isn't open for lunch so nice try in bringing down this superb restaurant's rating.  This was by far the best meal we've had in metro Charlotte. I'd say all of North Carolina, but we've had some good ones in Asheville.  Get the jar... bbq pork, collards and cheese grits with fried onions on top. THE. BOMB. The NC shrimp on risotto OUTSTANDING. My daughter's pork loin was great. The desserts were phenomenal (chess pie and apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream). EDIT: The jar is no longer available!!! So sad... I asked Paul to make one special for my daughter this past weekend, but I don't think that will work for everyone.  Other items that made our table that were fabulous... duck confit, flounder, sunchoke chips and the soup of the day which was sweet potato soup.  Worth the drive to Waxhaw. If none of the desserts at Heritage float your boat, Waxhaw Creamery is right next door!"}
{"text":"Heritage is without a doubt the most innovative food adventure in Charlotte and beyond. The owner /chef really cares! The blending of flavors and ingredients can't be surpassed. There aren't enough stars to rate this gourmet experience. We have probably dined in over forty different restaurants in the Charlotte area.  Without a doubt the top of the list- finally something to get excited about."}
{"text":"Such a great experience with some of my favorite Yelpers doing a UYE here (Unofficial Yelp Event).  It was an 8-course meal of bite size tastings from the regular menu.  The courses included a pimento cheese deviled egg, tempura fried turnips, a beet salad, a fried oyster over black eyed peas, duck breast and two wonderful chocolate desserts.  Everything was delicious but the highlights for me were all the molecular gastronomy items that worked well with each meal especially the beet salad.  Also the 10 pepper hot sauce paired with the oyster that made me want to lick it off the plate.  And the chocolate desserts were just plain sinful.    The interior of the restaurant is simple with a bar in the back room and old church pews for seating against the walls.  The rooms are separated by an open book shelf featuring Chef Paul's personal cookbooks.    I missed so many details in this review but the other 5 star reviews speak for wonders for this restaurant and the staff. It is definitely worth the trip down to Waxhaw.  But keep in mind, this place is small.  Reservations are recommended on weekends."}
{"text":"Have lived in south charlotte my whole life I have eaten at every fine dining restaurant and heritage is in my top 5. People usually save such a special place like this for a birthday treat, but myself on the other hand constantly seeks fresh, farm to table food and that is RARE my friend. You will not be disappointed here. The price may be high but for the quality it sure is worth it. Very romantic- service impeccable, and have never been disappointed. With giving a try, + they were voted best restaurant in Charlotte recently."}
{"text":"Very good Scallop dish. Love the restaurant setting and food. I like the fact the owner gets his food from local farms."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5....  I was impressed by the space--It is nice and cozy/charming inside. It is walking distance to cute shops and is a nice getaway from Charlotte.  The service was friendly, and overall the pacing of the meal was nice in that it allowed for conversation. There were some kids running up and down the dining room at the end which I found a little annoying because it seems like a nicer place. It is a family-friendly neighborhood but of course that's on the parents and not the restaurant!   We ordered a bottle of bubbly with our brunch (served until 2pm on Sunday). I had the Southern Bennies which was fine. My breakfast potatoes were the highlight with fresh herbs and onions and the eggs were cooked nicely. The sausage sadly was bone- dry and overall the main dish needed seasoning. My friend ordered the omelet and said it was good.   I would like to go back but probably during dinner service. We dined closer to the 2pm mark so maybe the food was not as fresh as it would be if we arrived earlier?"}
{"text":"On a cold winter's night, a few hearty souls made the drive out to Waxhaw to visit Hearitage Food and Drink and were warmly welcomed by the staff. Perhaps this is normal, or perhaps there was just no one else because of the roads. Tough to say, as I hadn't been there previously, but they were definitely a great crew, and kept us happily fed with full glasses all evening.  Even better is because not many others were out and about because of the weather, the (typically) long drive to Waxhaw wasn't nearly as bad as it might be on a normal night. Sure, it was a ways out there, but it's just as bad going uptown some nights, so for such a meal, it's definitely worth the trip.  As to the meal itself: You are going to be hard-pressed to find anything like this in Charlotte. The vast majority of it is locally sourced (one such example that wasn't: unless someone is hiding in back with a Sharpie and loads of patience, that black rice probably isn't from this part of the world - but that's okay).  There are also only one or two places around Charlotte doing much of anything with molecular gastronomy, and I can't think of any with such a light touch. Most seem to use the technique for the sake of just showing that they can, rather than the ability to actually add something to the dish, and it's used nicely here.  We were treated to an excellent tasting menu from Chef Paul, courtesy of the planning of Tonya from Poprock, which means that we were able to sample dishes such as the pimento cheese deviled egg of the day, the amazing tempura turnip with sweet chili sauce, gulf oysters and shrimp, an incredible duck breast and sunchoke and not one, but two desserts!  Though the courses may have seemed small at first, after so many of them, the meal was portioned just right. I can't imagine going back and having to decide which of the dishes to order a la carte, even after having sampled them - the idea of a tasting menu should be an ongoing menu option (not just here, but everywhere)!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend Heritage Food & Drink, particularly if you enjoy seasonal dishes prepared with locally sourced ingredients. The service was very good and everything we ordered was excellent including: sweet potato butternut squash soup, duck confit with fresh gnocchi and pomegranate, Jerusalem artichoke three ways, steak tartar fried oyster surf and turf, pork tenderloin, and duck breast. Each dish highlighted the wonderful flavors of fall. Our meal ended on a high note with deserts as beautiful as they were decadent with flavors of butterscotch and chocolate complemented by thoughtful creations like pumpkin seed brittle. Can't wait to go back and experience the restaurant's take on spring and summer flavors!"}
{"text":"Fried Cheese was one of the best foods I've ever tasted! Deviled Eggs - I thought you couldn't do much with but I was WRONG! So good!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious...  Cute and cozy setting.  Prices are a bit high for what you get, even if farm to table.....  We sat near the bar, and had great service..  Would recommend definitely making reservations, many were getting turned away at the door.    For farm to table, for the price, I would probably opt another locale."}
{"text":"So I got a message from the chef today wondering how to render a pork (really) so here's how to render the fat off of pork belly, a piece of pork belly is usually 30 to 20% fat(Quality is key) so what you need to do is cook it low and slow to render the fat, cook it at about 2:25 in the oven for 3/5 hours, , fatty and not so fatty, your welcome, you can get  more information on  how to cook it at bon appette, good luck"}
{"text":"Note: 1/5 stars for a \"foodie\" and \"farm to table\" restaurant. Food was prepped hours in advance and no alterations were available for dietary needs. Steak was ordered rare warm, delivered medium/medium well. Saving grace were the duck and fritters. Just overall a waste of a trip unless it's within walking distance of where you are."}
{"text":"I was truly expecting to be blown away by the food here based on word of mouth, but that was not the case. Heritage espouses a farm to table ethos, with meat and vegetables coming from local farms throughout North Carolina. I appreciate the effort to provide customers with ethically raised food, but overall found the meal to be bland.   We had the deviled eggs (classic) and sweet potato chips to start. Deviled eggs were good but nothing to write home about. Sweet potato chips were the major stumble of the evening - they were chewy and hard to eat, w the \"foam\" wholly unsatisfying. Entrees were the sea bass, pasta minus short ribs as that had run out, and pork tenderloin. Sea bass was fresh and cooked well but sauce was too salty. Pork was also cooked well but came out lukewarm. This was a dish on the sweeter side w sweet potatoes and a sweet/sour sauce. Companion found the pasta to be bland but perhaps this could be remedied with short ribs included. We ended the meal with a lemon chess pie which came out cold. This again was good but not memorable. I would like to note that the service was fantastic and the ambience also wonderful - very homey and welcoming. This added a star to the overall experience.   To sum up - I would not make the hike out to waxhaw just for heritage. But if you are in the area and want to enjoy ethically raised food and a warm atmosphere, I'd stop by."}
{"text":"That was simply remarkable!  What an all-around treat and just what we were looking for.  Everything went so well that I just don't know where to start but I will give it a go.  Farm to Table - Fresh and Delicious!!  We would come back just for the food.  We will definitely come back to bring friends because of the whole experience!  Menu/Food: 10/10 --  Every Tuesday the Chef creates a new and innovative menu that makes you want to order 10+ dishes just so you can try everything.  It was tough making a decision because we didn't want to leave anything out.  If we had more than two people, we would have tried it all!  So, we ordered a bunch of \"small plates\" and we were so happy that we did.  We got the Squash Blossom - Perfectly \"tempura style\" battered squash with fluffy goat cheese accompanied by fresh veggies.  Fried Green Tomato - Large fried tomato smothered by Carolina style pulled pork.  Wow!  Scallops - cooked with a nice corn medley including pork belly deliciousness. And... Short Ribs - Perfectly slow cooked short ribs cut into tender slices with a nice homemade potato salad on the side.  Oh yeah, we also started with the classic and JALAPENO deviled eggs.  (Perfectly amount of kick with none of the burn - excellent!).  Then, we finished with a nice light goat cheese cheesecake and fruit.  Perfect light touch to end a big meal.  Luckily the small plates were so well portioned that we never felt too full.  We just happily savored every single bite.  It seemed like every dish had flavors/elements that elegantly complimented the main portion.  That is not very easy to do without losing focus on the prime course of the dish.  Kudos Chef!   Atmosphere:  9/10 --  Now, usually when I give a 5-star rating, everything is a 10/10.  This 9/10 comes from personal preference but would be fine for most (I think).  The restaurant is located nicely in the middle of downtown Waxhaw.  It is a really cool spot with a nice town-like railroad that goes through.  Yeah, I said railroad like it was 1850.  Lol.  Walking into the restaurant, everything flows and is so welcoming.  All of the tables are cozily close (to be expected in a nice family restaurant like this) and the interior design is so unique.  You can tell someone put in a lot of time and thought into it.  The only confusing thing to me is the bar spot in lower back of the restaurant.  Now, I love a place to sit up at a bar, get some food, have good conversation but.... but it just seems nestled away in the back and away from everything.  IMO, just throw in some more tables and keep rocking out with the kick a$$ food!  But what do I know about restauranting.  Ya know.    Service: 10/10 --  Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the entire menu.  That was really helpful for first time patrons and for people that really like to know what goes into making their food.  I think it makes for an all-around better experience.  Also, the staff really worked well as team.  That's usually a good formula for great service.    I'm actually really excited to bring some friends/family here to eat again!  We will be back very soon. You can count on that.  Give it a try as soon as you can.  You will not be disappointed!    Enjoy!   -Ian M."}
{"text":"Currently best place in Waxhaw to eat and if you want to take one step further...Charlotte. My wife and I went two weeks ago and I left thinking that may have been the best meal I've had in a while.   Not sure but I'm going out on a limb and say the chef has done a tour in Charleston, SC. If you've been to Charleston think Husk restaurant for a comparison.  We had the Quail, Rabbit and Pork Belly. Everything was spot on including presentation.   The seating area is small so make a reservation. We sat at the bar which doesn't bother us. The bartender was really cool and knew the menu well.   One mixed drink, one beer, appetizer and two entrees for $60 with tip. Worth the money and I'm looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"We got lucky and a table opened up on a Saturday night. Staff was very down to earth and helpful explaining all of the items on the menu. My wife and I split a salad, and the pork belly appetizer. The appetizer was unreal!  I had the duck and my wife had the shrimp entree. Both amazing. We will definitely be back again soon!  Be sure to make a reservation on weekends. There is a reason they had a write up in the Charlotte magazine....outstanding."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. If you live in and around Waxhaw, this is a must try."}
{"text":"Just mediocre, great donuts but these places are a dime a dozen.  Food is fair at best.  Family owned business so I hope it is successful but they need to change the menu.  Also got a bad health score"}
{"text":"The food was great, and the waiter was extremely accommodating... however there was some questionable behavior going on back of house. We sat in the back near the bar and about 10 min after sitting down a man walked behind the bar and poured a giant highball glass of wild turkey 101 and slammed it then walked away. Then about 20 min later he came back and did it again (keep in mind this is all before noon on a Sunday)! My husband was looking up the restaurant on his phone and realized it was the chef. Then several waiters were back there prepping bloody Mary's and one said to the other - make an extra for chef. I guess as long as he can still cook well hammered he will be okay but it sounds like a recipe for disaster!"}
{"text":"Top shelf ... upscale charlotte food in Waxhaw ... the deviled egg dish was off the chain good ... I'm very lucky to have this place close to home ... these guys hit a home run ... eat your heart out charlotte"}
{"text":"\"Farm to Table\" is a very trendy concept these days.  Heritage does it perfectly.   Very knowledgeable wait staff, a friendly intimate atmosphere and a great wine and bar list all combine to setup an amazing meal.  The food was innovative,  fresh and absolutely delicious.   Chef Paul was very gracious and welcoming.   Heritage is a gem and ranks as one of the best restaurants in the area."}
