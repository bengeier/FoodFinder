{"text":"We like the biryani, lamb buhna (sp?), tarka dahl, sag paneer, chicken tandoori, and Indian salad the best. When I was first introduced to this restaurant, I tried mild menu options like the tandoori, expecting they would be spicy -- they weren't at all. But the options on the menu that say they are spicy are incredibly so.  I haven't had any luck with their red wines, but Indian food and red wine don't really go together, anyway..."}
{"text":"The tandoori chicken was good but a bit expansive. It could have been a little more spicy though. The service was great and the place was clean overall."}
{"text":"Food was ok, less flavourful then I generally expect form Indian, but all good. Service was attentive enough given that the small resto was pretty much empty."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner with about 25 others. Having ordered from them before and not being very impressed I was hoping that they had improved. If anything they have gone downhill. The starters, onion bhaji and samosas, were the first tip off. If I wanted that much salt I'd swallow water while swimming in the ocean. Because we were a large group there was a fixed menu though a few people ordered a dish or two from the main menu. I cannot forgive the quality of the 2 fixed menu mains and the 1 off the regular menu as this party had been reserved well in advance. The butter chicken, as sebastien M. mentioned, was horrid. The lamb bhuna featured decent lamb but the sauce had obviously been burnt. When the sag paneer, one of my favorite Indian dishes, arrived, 3 of us commented how creamy it looked. That was because there was barely any spinach and even less cheese. Absolutely dreadful. The portion, even for an Indian restaurant, were minute and the prices ($13 for the lamb) completely unjustifiable. Never again."}
{"text":"If only yelp would allow me to put zero star, I WOULD ! Regarding this place : STAY AWAY ! we all got SICK !   it is terrible, the food that they call Indian is really not! They started with some kind of kebabs (?!) and then some butter chicken ... 2 ingredients were missing : butter and kitchen... And somehow they must have dropped 1 full cup of sugar in the pan... It was HORRIBLE !   The waiter improvised himself into a wine expert, and presented us their $5 worth wine (with a price tag of $50)! None of them were appropriate for Indian food, still we followed the waiter recommendation... We were only able to take one sip, and told them it was terrible. They never offered us reduce the bill or anything. The service itself was bareable... Anyhow, never again I will go there... Even when I walk by there, I change street side !   During that night me and my friends were all sick, with heartburns, vomit and diaria.   STAY AWAY - please !"}
