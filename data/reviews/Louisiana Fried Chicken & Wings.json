{"text":"Best fried chicken in Chandler area hands down !!! They have nice combo options with fish and shrimp as well. And it is always done fresh and they don't sit under the light for a long time like traditional fast food stores so the food is freshly fried!!!"}
{"text":"Just had this for the first time. The chicken is flavorful and juicy. Fries were seasoned with Old Bay, and it's all served with a Hawaiian roll. The wings were deep fried and crispy despite being drenched in Frank's Red Hot. 

They also have boba tea and smoothies, that's a nice treat!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today with the friend. The food is very good. It's nice and fresh. The service is exceptional. They are very nice and friendly. I would definitely come here again. The prices is good too."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have eaten here twice in one week. That should tell you something. 

After reading the Elite reviews and having it bookmarked for what seemed like months, we finally dropped by this week and were we in for a wonderful treat.

LFC is literally the best fried chicken place that we've eaten at in Arizona. 

There is no fast food chicken place like Cane's or Chick Fil A that can compete or come close, so move over because there's no comparison. 

This week we ordered both the tenders and chicken meals and everything was hot, lovingly prepared, fresh and juicy. Plus the sides of fried okra, mashed potatoes and the hot and soft Hawaiian style bread is to die for. The menu is huge and we still haven't tried the wings but it's next on our list and we're looking forward in working our way through the menu.

In short, the owners and staff are delightful, the place clean and the place is around the corner from our house.

It's now our go to place.

I don't think I'll ever eat at any other chicken place. Yes, it's that good."}
{"text":"At around 1:00 on a Sunday the place was hopping and I can see why. Huge portions of very fresh, hot food. Quite a wait for it, but worth it. I felt sorry for the behind the counter staff because they were slammed with orders, but they held their own. There was some angry looking corporate dude behind the counter as well - would have been nice to see him roll up his sleeves and help out his hard working staff, instead of standing around scowling. That, and the overheated building and long wait are the only reasons they lost a star, but if you're looking for a kinda divey place for good, super fresh chicken, I'd recommend it overall."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken and shrimp! Best red beans and rice I've ever had. They lost a star because there isn't enough seats, but that tells you how good the food is!!"}
{"text":"I tried LFC yesterday there was both pros and cons. The staff had great attitudes and nice. It was clean as well. The selection of food was good ranging from wings, salads, fries, red beans rice and if course Fried Chicken. I ordered little of everything. The chicken tenders and fried chicken was a little to spicy for my kiddos believe to much pepper, but I enjoyed it. They loved the chicken wings. I must say I really liked the fried rice. The coleslaw was alright. The red beans and rice was ok, it had little rice and beans to watery and to much pepper for my taste. I would recommend to try this place it has lots of potential to grow."}
{"text":"Small place that seats 14 total. We each had the leg and thigh combo. Her side was mashed potatoes and mine was red beans and rice, both also had a roll. The roll was like the Hawaiian sweet bread.
The chicken was right out of the fryer, excellent crunch outside, and juicy on the inside. The seasoning had too much black pepper for Melissa, but I thought it was great. I ate one of her pieces, so it worked out good for me. I did give her my roll.
The red beans and rice were tasty, but a little watery. Melissa ate all the mashed potatoes so they were good.
Overall the place was a great fit for me, but we need to explore the menu to find something else for Melissa."}
{"text":"We know the owners of this restaurant from their days at Rainbow Donuts on Thunderbird. They are very sweet people. 

The restaurant is very clean and cute. Their menu consisted of chicken combos, wings, boba, smoothies, lemonade, and other various American/Asian combination dishes. If you like chicken, this is the place to go. Always fresh, yummy, and fast. Give them a try and help a small family owned business out. :)"}
{"text":"There are more chickens on earth than people. 

So grab a fork and knife and let's eat!

We have had our eyes on this place for a while and when my wife got that crazed look in her eyes for some fried chicken, I caved in and we got some chicken. Chicken is the best. You can cook it in so many ways but one of my favorite preparation for the poultry is fried. 

This place does it great. The chicken is crispy and juicy and I can eat piece after piece of that bird here at Louisiana Fried Chicken & Wings. The mashed potatoes were nothing to write home about and the rolls they serve are straight out of the King's Hawaiian Rolls bag. Slap some Cholululululemon on and enjoy."}
{"text":"Imagine chicken so good you'd take an Uber for pick-up.???
Well that's what I saw last night while waiting for my husband.  
It was our first time and so he went inside to order, ending up with a combo of: chicken, beans and rice, okra, and rolls.

The chicken was fresh and flavorful, a little \"hot\" for those who don't like spicy food.  Beans and rice were a bit watery and seemed to lack seasoning.  The okra?  It was a no-show, we were mistakenly given fries - wasn't going back.  And the rolls were fresh and thereby good.

The staff was friendly, the place very clean, and the wait wasn't too long.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice clean place.  Friendly counter help.  Menu was a bit confusing but after using that high quality college education of mine, I figured it out.  My fellow diner tried the combo plate and was amazed at the large ant of food.  Fish was good, lightly breaded.  Same with the shrimp good stuff.  Chicken was good a bit greasy but likes it.  

I had their chicken wings and they were so good!  I had the honey hot which are my favorite!  So good good sauce but wing is crunchy not soggy.  

Def returning again - affordable too!  

PS - drive thru window!  YAY!"}
{"text":"Catfish and shrimp was great... Chicken was pretty good. It is a fusion type of establishment as the sell a number of Asian fusion type of foods. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"So I believe Louisiana Fried Chicken has opened a location here in AZ on a couple of occasions. I remember reviewing one awhile back in Phoenix during my Urbanspoon days and then it abruptly closed without any notice when I tried to return. So the Chandler area is now their newest experiment. Louisiana Chicken actually came out of LA in the 70's and has over a hundred locations in the US. The Louisiana name comes from how the chicken is cooked -  Cajun battered and deep fried. They also have fried shrimp, chicken tenders and fish. There are several entree combinations to choose from with or without sides and whatever quantity you want. Side items include mashed potatoes, okra, red beans & rice and coleslaw. There's a bit of an Asian influence with rice combinations and egg rolls. And they have gumbo too! The family pack combos must be popular because there were several people waiting in the lobby for large to-go orders. The restaurant itself isn't very large but pretty clean. I thought the chicken was pretty tasty with just a hint of spice and a nice soft crunch to it. They have bottles of hot sauce available that you can spice your chicken up with. Overall Louisiana Chicken is a nice fast casual chain if you are looking for a quick affordable bite of some Cajun chicken (a 3 piece combo will run you about $8). It will be interesting to see how they do in Chandler across from Food City. Btw... they have a couple different slices of pie for dessert and boba tea."}
{"text":"We just can't say enough good things about this place!!!  The owners are so sweet and super friendly.

We discovered LFC a few months ago in a building on AZ Ave and Ray Rd that had recently had a lot of restaurant turnover.  We passed it quite a few times before finally venturing in.  From the very first visit we were hooked, sometimes eating there for several dinners each week.

We even began spreading the love and getting our workplaces in on the action.  Now we have a standing office lunch order once a month.

And we have tried it all and literally can't say anything bad about a thing.  They know their fired rice just as well as they know their fried chicken.  You just can't go wrong.  The fish and shrimp are MUST TRY's!

We could rave all day long but its not worth the time you would waste reading it, just get on over to LFC!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but ordered a shrimp combo, chicken strip combo, side of slaw and order of mozzarella sticks...the shrimp was MISSING when we got home. Both sides for each combo were there, but literally no entree of shrimp/second bread roll. It was also dead and there and the service was still slow. We ordered to go and noticed the missing entree when we got home, so weren't going to drive all the way back and wait again for it."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open and it's finally opened!!! We had the 5 piece chicken tenders and they were huge!!! We both shared got a side of fries and extra side of mash potatoes. 

The tenders were juicy and not over cooked! Def well seasoned and packed a little heat. The mash potatoes were standard almost like church's mash potatoes but the gravy was terrific! The buns that came with the meal was the Hawaiian rolls you would see at the store ( saw the package on the counter) they do offer an Asian twist with some fried rice and spring rolls and other dishes etc. 

Place was def clean! And service was excellent! To early to say anything else but a very pleasant first experience! We will definitely be coming back for more updates!! 

Please check it out! It's def different from Popeyes!"}
{"text":"Was intrigued when I saw this new place open up where a Bosa Doughnuts used to be. I went in and immediately lost hope when I saw they sold boba... I still gave them a chance, I mean I was in the restaurant already and let me tell you that I'm glad I did. The chicken was on point the wings!!! Let me you about the wings man... I hope no one thinks I'm crazy but their honey hot and medium hot wings has kept me from going to ATL wings... I know right?? So I hope that says something about how good both their Chicken and wings are."}
{"text":"Really good fish and shrimp! Great flavor and crispy fish and shrimp! They have a huge variety of chicken wings and different combos to choose from. I tried the salt and jalapeño wings, very delicious! Staff was very nice and helpful! I like this place better Popeyes and Church's! Good eats!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken around, and I have looked everywhere in the east valley. Menu is diverse enough to always enjoy a great lunch. I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got two fried chicken breasts which were large, juicy and tasty. The breading was really good, but they add enough hot spice to the breading to make their fried chicken too spicy for those who shun it. My wife is such a person, and the chicken tenders she got were large, juicy and tasty, but too spicy for her. They should tell you this when you order. The french fries were very good, and not at all spicy. Service was fast and the prices quite reasonable. If they end up offering a non-spicy version of their food, we'll visit often!"}
{"text":"First time diner and the chicken was absolutely delicious. Perfectly fried hot juicy chicken. The spice was right on maybe a little spicy for kids but I loved it. My wife had the shrimp fried rice and said she would get this dish again. The staff was polite and friendly. Recommended to friends and family."}
{"text":"KFC or Popeyes has nothing on this place. Some of the best fried chicken I have had. Staff is very friendly and the cost is very reasonable. I will be back.

Try the chicken and shrimp, very satisfying"}
{"text":"A tiny place, bright, clean and basically a take-out operation.  They have only 6 tables, 3 for 2 people, and 3 for 4 people.  Business is brisk on a Monday evening, mostly for take-out.  Staff is friendly, smiling and helpful.
Their okra was top notch, fresh and crunchy and tasty!  The coleslaw was average.  No refills on drinks and a limited selection of sodas.  They know how to deep fry, that's for sure.  The chicken tenders were large juicy and delicious but a bit too spicy for my taste.  The wings had all 3 sections attached and were large and plump.  The sauce was on the side in a small cup.  We tried the spicy honey garlic, delicious and HOT!  Overall the heat was a bit too much for me, but my wife thought it was great. The bread was Hawaiian sweet rolls right out of the package, OK, I guess.  I would give them a 3.5 score if I could.  I doubt that I would return because of the hot spices used.  If you like spicy, this is your place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. This is the only fast food fried chicken I eat. They have everything you want from fried chicken to french fries and fried okra (makes me wanna take a tried down south to Memphis and New Orleans."}
{"text":"This place is a fried chicken gem!  Some of the most tender, juiciest, flavorful and non-greasy fried chicken I have ever tasted in my life...sorry Mom.   I've also had the gizzards and okra and it's off the hook!  The place is price worthy and affordable.  Definitely won't break the bank.  They have a wide menu of items to choose from.   It's going to be a tasty journey to try everything on it!  The place is clean and the staff is friendly.  They didn't judge me for coming in 3 times within a week.  The restaurant style is small.  Mostly a take-away joint.  That way you don't embarrass yourself while devouring your food.  When you have a craving for some fried chicken, make the drive, Uber, bike, walk, crawl, piggyback or however you commute, to this place!  You won't regret it.  I just want to say thank you Louisiana Fried Chicken and Wings.  Thank you for changing my life."}
{"text":"Here they cook the chicken until out is done.   The chicken is cooked fresh,  and yes that takes time.  They let you know the progress,  they also let you know you can call in your order if your in a hurry.  Myself I prefer cooked chicken and they provide that.  I drove 15 minutes home and my food was still hot and fresh.  CRISPY, LITTLE BIT OF SPICE (Not over bearing). Perfect fried chicken.  I'd say lolos has something to worry about.  The seasoning was PERFECT.  I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK TO TRY THE CATFISH! I'm hooked.  THE best chicken I have had in arizona!"}
{"text":"Came here on one of the opening days to get the \"free pieces of chicken\" like they had advertised on the window and flyers. I got there when they opened and the lady said that they already did that, the place was EMPTY. She ended up giving us one piece each free. It was okay, not spicy at all. Anyways I've never had somewhere false advertise like that just to get business, that is enough for me not to want to go back."}
{"text":"We went to this place last night after seeing reviews on Yelp. I got the three-piece fish combo and my hubby got medium-hot chicken wings. Both were delicious! The restaurant is located in a building that used to be Bosa Donuts, but it has been remodeled inside. There are only a few tables, so most folks do carry out. The food is cooked to order so is very hot and fresh. The place is spotless and the staff were so kind and accommodating that we really felt welcome. The fried catfish was very close to what I used to get in my hometown in East Texas, right on the Louisiana border. Be prepared to wait a few minutes as they cook it as you order. Next time we will do carry out. What a nice staff at this place!"}
{"text":"Over-fried, chewy, dried out chicken. I'm so disappointed. I love Cajun fried chicken. Shrimp is small. 20 pieces for $14 - definitely not worth it. Don't waste your money. Sides are smaller than the normal \"family\" size sides. Easily feeds 2 maybe 3. When I asked she said family size feeds 4 to 6. One star for order taker. She was nice and didn't charge me to switch cocktail sauce for ranch."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I ordered lemon pepper chicken wings and shrimp fried rice. I would not recommend the lemon pepper because they added wayyyyyyy too much seasoning that it was quite overwhelming. The shrimp fried rice was good. I'd say over all a 3.5 Star. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wooo lord I was craving chicken so bad. I came all the way from mesa for this chicken and boy o boy I should have just settled for churches. The batter taste weird and there was no spice/ flavor what so ever. I got a small Cole slaw (nasty), large red beans and rice (extra nasty and watery), large mashed potato and gravy (I guess u cant get that wrong)... the rolls on yelp look buttery and fresh (hawaiian rolls) I also got the fish (still no taste, but if u have louisiana hot sauce and wonder bread-you should be ok ). But this was my first and last time here. That food went right to the trash. Staff was nice and the facility was clean at least."}
{"text":"This review is based on the gizzards only, which is why I went here today. I hit 3 places today to try their gizzards.

The gizzards did not have the rock pouch lining removed. This caused them to have that extreme gristle chewiness in the center. Yes, that is what the hard gristle like substance you are eating is, the rock pouch lining that the stones and grime sit in... 
The gizzard portion meat had a medium chew factor. I am guessing it is because they weren't parboiled for at least 15 minutes before they were battered and fried. Restaurants just don't freaking get you must parboil these things or they are going to be chewy and hard. 

(In general, most people have never truly had a gizzard prepared properly, and are oblivious of what a properly prepared fried gizzard should taste like. If they did, they certainly wouldn't accept what most places pass off for gizzards. The rock pouch lining should be fully removed, the gizzard meat should be parboiled, soaked in buttermilk to remove some of the offal flavor and bitterness, breaded and fried. It should still have a medium offal flavor, which is the reason you are eating offal organ anyway. The meat should be so tender it can be pulled apart like a hamburger) 

The breading was perfect and the spice level I loved. Overall it was just another average experience for gizzards at the many many places I have had.

Staff was nice and efficient. Clean restaurant. Great selection of items."}
{"text":"Ommmggggg this is by far the BEST fried rice and fried shrimp I have ever had. Bye Popeyes, Church's and KFC lol. They can get my money any time.

As soon as my husband arrive in town I'm taking him. The food is seasoned and the customer service was wonderful. I hate that I'm moving to the West Valley but they are worth the travel lol."}
{"text":"Ever since Popeye's has been losing quality (IMHO), my partner and I have been craving some good fried food and wings. There's Buffalo Wild Wings and other chains like that, but we wanted to see what else was out there. A quick search brought this place up, we saw it was well-reviewed, and we tried it. 

We became committed patrons after the first bite. 

Oh, that fried chicken. Oh, them fried shrimp. Oh, that fried catfish. Oh, THEM WINGS!! The love put into that food is so real, you can taste it. It's a family-run joint and it tastes like Momma's home cooking. They've got some unique desserts and drinks, too! Still haven't tried the fried rice and can't wait to chow down on it. 

I have but one complaint, and it isn't really a complaint at all: this restaurant deserves a bigger place with more seats! They need to grow, and I'd be so delighted to see them succeed! 

One note about the family who owns and runs the place: they make me feel like a good friend of theirs. They're such nice people, and I adore their food! When I'm out and wanting to eat, Louisiana Fried Chicken and Wings is one of the first places that comes to mind, and I'll always try to find a way to get there regardless of whether it's on the way or far off in the distance. 

Another note: their prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality of food. I'm licking my fingers clean every time I'm there. You can bet I'm enjoying myself to the fullest. It's actually fast food, but you might not believe it at first since it's so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. I'm from California. When I moved to Arizona we didn't have a Louisiana fried chicken. Now that there here in chandler I go at least 3 times a week. The fried fish is my fav. My husband just loves the chicken. It's seasoned to perfection. Freshly made everytime. And the customer service gets 2 thumbs up. There awesome. They should know my husband Donald and I by now. I will never go to Kentucky, Church's or anywhere where else for chicken or fish."}
{"text":"Hubby and I finally stopped by and tried their chicken. We ordered the wings half spicy honey garlic and half salt & jalapeño with fries on the side and let me tell you it was O-mazing!!! The following week we decided to come back and try the fried chicken because we can't stop raving how great the wings were. Their fried chicken is just as amazing as the wings. Shrimp fried rice oh geezus so flavorful! So far everything we've tried are amazing. Staff are very friendly and will definitely be back to try others in their menu. FYI some are cooked to order so there's a wait, worth the wait though !"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The chicken strips and the fried shrimp are literally the best I've had in Arizona, especially from a place claiming anything \"Louisiana\" related in the restaurant name. 

It is on the spicy side, but that's something I don't mind. And I do like their red beans and rice. It is very tasty, and definitely a good side item.

Overall, I will definitely continue to eat here!"}
{"text":"Great chicken but the staff was overwhelmed and lacked organization. The place was super busy and there wasn't an empty seat in the place. I ordered the 4 piece combo, was informed they were out of breasts and were out of red beans and rice, still ordered it and got two thighs insteaf of a thigh and breast. Asked if I could get an upgrade on the soda to a thai iced tea and was informed only for an extra charge which I thought was lame since I was paying for a better piece of meat and not getting it or the side I wanted. Nevertheless it was still tasty and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Super good! Got 3 flavors but the best was the garlic honey. It was clean inside and although the fried chicken looked amazing I got wings and was very happy with my choice. The honey garlic were the best!"}
{"text":"Ok first time out to this place so we definitely where careful with the order. Mistake order a 8 piece and 2 sides and it was GONE ! Chicken was delicious with a hint of Cajun spice and the Breast was even juicy ! The sides red beans and rice nice and cole slaw was also homemade nice touch.  Definitely will be back for more but more pieces next time."}
{"text":"I just can't say enough good things about this place!!!  The owners are so sweet and super friendly.

{"text":"1st timer not a good experience.... really really tired just got  off work and was soooo ready for yummy dinner and got their hot chicken wing combo. Noticed a guy came after me that ordered a fried fish that order came out first ....how do u cook a fish faster than a chicken wing I don't know. then waited max like 15 mins in lobby by the way small lobby... then got my order for 6 wings and fries .... I'm pissed my wings were so over cooked!!! And the fries are probably cheaper than the ones that McDonald's orders themselves!!!! Their like the skinny skinny fries that you get from a freezer section at the grocery store and they had no seasoning . Plus.... you'll notice your fries are even hot because they have them sitting on a hot plate thing ... this place needs to improve quality in their food and their service... wish I could of took a pic of the food to warn you of this place I didn't even eat because I didn't want to poop rocks because the food was sooo over cooked. Wanted a refund but I live too far and bigger disappointment that I got home opened up the box and got a wack meal."}
{"text":"This place is great! Friendly service and a fantastic product. The chicken was juicy and the batter was seasoned perfectly for those that like a little zing in their wings. Ordered up a big batch for an Easter picnic and the adults all shared favorable comments. The children were not as impressed with chicken with a kickin, but hey, that's what chocolate bunnies are for."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fried okra was delicious. The 3 wings dinner was fried to perfection. They also serve fried rice options too which were delicious also. The staff was friendly and the menu items were definitely reasonably priced.  I've been twice this week lol"}
{"text":"Was so excited for this restaurants open. In side pretty small but cute little set up. Extremely clean. The young lady who took my order was supper sweet and friendly. She was very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the 5 piece chicken tender combo meal with mash potatos for my side. The size of what you get is really a bang for your buck and they were fast. However I was disappointed that you could not put any of there sauces on the  chicken tenders or order it on the side. Part of the breading on chicken was soft and not as spicy as I would have thought . I like my fryed chicken really really crispy lol. I would definitely come back a second time and try something diffrent."}
{"text":"ok, A couple of \"Louisiana\" Places in the mix now,, but Fried Chicken n Wings, had to try this place out.. Now, I have a goto for Wings already so this is gonna be tough to beat.. But all said and done, this is on the list.. 

Wife and I went her last week and I ordered 3 types of Wings.. Medium-Hot, Honey Garlic, and Salt and Jalapeno.. All 3 types were fried perfectly, so that being said.. The Medium Hot sauce was VERY potent vinegar based, which I am not a FAN of which is why i hate Tabasco.. My goto hot sauce is Cholula, Tapatio, or just some sriracha... Ok, The Honey Garlic, was super sticky and had good Flavors and you could taste the Garlic,, Kudos.. The Salt Jalapeno, was pretty good as well.. Had the same flavors that Mekong had in their Calamari(but they changed it) so, 2 of the 3 selections were great.. ok, also a Peeve is the Ranch sauce,,, only 2 places on my list have BOMB ranch sauce, Thick and super flavorful,, this place however wasn't in the top and was pretty watery,, No Bueno.. 

Saving grace, the wife ordered Fried Chicken, which was VERY good, and we will definitely be back just for the fried Chicken. the breading had great flavors as well, and they serve Hawaiian rolls with the meals,, YUMMY.. 

Not the top on my list for Hot Wings,,, but go try em out, and get the Fried Chicken,, they have a pretty extravagant menu, fried rice, etc,, 

STAFF are Very Very friendly,, they seem to LOVE what they do, another reason to go back !!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here for lunch a few days again. Food was amazing! Service was amazing as well. We agreed this will be our one stop place for lunch when we want some amazing fried food. On the spicy side but soooooo good."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS chicken! They're giving Popeye's a run for their money. I had chicken tenders and my husband had the regular bone-in chicken pieces. It was nice and fresh, and stayed warm all the way back to our place in Mesa. The chicken was juicy, spicy, and flavorful. Fries were pretty good; dinner rolls were nice and homey, a great complement to the chicken. The place is small and on the warm side, so may be better for takeout than for dine-in. We definitely plan to come back!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were wanting some good fried chicken and didn't want our usual drive thru go to.
First of all. The menu is huge! Try to look at it in advance. You'll see chicken strips, wings, mixed fried chicken, fish, and shrimp! It was hard to decide which one we wanted. But I knew I had to try the wings. 
We ordered a mixed 8 piece family meal with two orders of mashed potatoes. 8 wings. Half jalapeño garlic and half spicy honey garlic? 
The 8 pieces were huge pieces of chicken. Super crispy. Not greasy at all. And very juicy. I was impressed they gave us two large breasts in the mix. Typically you'll get one. The chicken had a nice spicy kick to it. So good! 
Chicken wings were tasty and large in size. 
Mashed potatoes was prob instapotatoes but they were creamy and buttery. Oh and don't forget the Hawaiian rolls. 
Definitely recommend. We ate there with plenty of leftovers and the first thing I noticed was how clean the place was. You know how fried chicken places get that greasy fryer smell? Not this one. So good."}
{"text":"Saw this place from the road and said that I would come back to try it one day  Decided to try it today and wow was I impressed! The customer service from the man at the counter was out standing! He was very courteous and welcoming to me. That's very important to me. Also I ordered the 3 piece chicken combo and a watermelon smoothie. It was all just wonderful.  I will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great!! Their chicken is so crispy!! Their wings are amazing!! They are saucy which is great. Their okra bites are really good too. Definitely going back again!!"}
{"text":"Who else eats fried chicken with some ketchup and Cholula? 

Just me? I'm weird? Yeah, okay. :'( 

You know what sounds good? Some squishy King's Hawaiian rolls, mashed potatoes with gravy, and some perfectly seasoned fried chicken.  Yas, mama.  Yaaas!  Give me that chaaacken!

This is seriously some tasty chicken.  It's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The flour itself is seasoned well so the flavor is proper, babie!  I really didn't need the ketchup and Cholula but I'm old and a creature of habit so I still dipped my chicken in it.  The size of the chicken is standard and the price point is decent.  I will be back.

It's some mother cluckin' good chicken."}
{"text":"I live in Gilbert and travel 14 miles (round trip) for this chicken. I'm addicted to fried chicken ... tried them all from KFC, Popeyes, Church's, Frys, Albertsons, my mom's ... you name it I've tried it. This is the BEST. O and by the way, the pieces are the biggest. It's 9:21 AM. I'm leaving to go there now!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The chicken is fried perfectly and the batter is deliciously spicy. I can't stop eating here."}
{"text":"Had a craving for fried chicken. Took my son, nephew, and mom.  They all loved it.  Chicken is a little bit spicy and worth the trip to this place.  Service to get food was prompt.  Will definitely come back to this place."}
