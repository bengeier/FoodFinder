{"text":"I like The Gem.  Definitely not trek across town to get there kind of like, but it's in my neighbourhood and it does just fine.  On tap selection is pretty limited, but they have lots in bottles and cans.  Food is decent, and some vegetarian and limited vegan options too.   The servers are always very nice."}
{"text":"First time here and not the last.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Gem, it was not what I was expecting in this area. It seems a little out of place given the neighbourhood, had it been down on Queen St w, it would definitely fit in. It is small inside but comfy and nice and relaxed, could see it being a little tight with a band in here as well!   The service was pleasant not overbearing, always nice.  I ordered a pint of Big Wheel because there really isn't much choice on tap. I've never had this beer before and really enjoyed it, I did notice and was happy to see they had StongBow cider. At least I know if I want a cider I can get one here.  We ordered a small nachos as a snack and they were quite good. I noticed many of the patrons coming and going were ordering a brunch which looked quite good.   I will definitely be back and because it is so close I am able to ride over on the bike. I hope their little patio is open in the summer as it may become a regular spot for a pint."}
{"text":"I went here the other day to sit on the patio and have some dinner and a couple drinks. So, it is absolutely adorable. I had the new amsterdam beer, I forget what it was called but I didn't even know it existed and it was wonderful!  I also had the veggie burger with chips and dip. I think the idea of having chips and dip was rather fun. I had never seen that before at a restaurant! Then again, maybe I just live under a rock!  The patio was wonderful, it was like sitting in a little garden. Which you were. It's a good sized patio as well, not too small, could probably host a good amount of people outside if you get there early enough!  So overall.. a great patio place, a great jukebox place. Just lovely overall!"}
{"text":"Consistently bad food. Unfortunate because it is such a nice, warm feeling pub. Decent drinks and service."}
{"text":"With a consistently great laid-back atmosphere, this self proclaimed neighborhood rock' n roll bar has my vote.    My latest visit to The Gem featured an involved run-around: we arrived to a packed pub at about 10 pm on a Friday night.  Stranded in the middle of the crowded, small space, we  were shortly visited by a friendly and unharried waitress who informed us that she expected two tables to open up soon.  At no point was there any pressure to buy drinks while in the cumbersome glory of standing-in-a-crowd, a la some places where the dime maintains 'most important' status*; and so my companion and I waited.  When one table came open, a growing party expressed need for additional space, and my companion and I were moved to another table.  Later, about half a pitcher through (only Tankhouse and a Stout on tap...and it has happened that there is nothing on tap...), we were asked to move yet again for the still-expanding party.    This seems annoying, but the musical chairs play of the evening  just enhanced the experience:  the staff were easy, friendly, and confident throughout; they even bought us shots for helping to accommodate the larger group.  The expanding group was equally generous and friendly, and our continuous moves led to the kind of  funny, friendly interactions, that typify The Gem experience.    In short, the people and atmosphere are cozy and friendly.  I have never been disappointed by The Gem.   of note: The Gem also serves decent quality pub fare, as well as daily specials, and has notably served me some particularly delicious French Toast.   Mind the autumn wasps.     *with apologies to Insomania"}
{"text":"The bathrooms in this place will haunt you! The smell is horrible and I felt like I was being swarmed by fruit flies every time I used the restroom. They have no normal beer to choose from no Canadian, no blue, and no Budweiser. The waitresses here do not make you feel welcome and make no effort to start a conversation with you! Needles to say in my opinion this bar is not worth your time or your money. Hope this helps have a good one!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go again for the food (had roti, it was fine) but if you're looking for a drink the ambiance is amazing! Great decor and server outfits. Perfect spot for a date or to catch up with a really good friend."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pulled pork in the city. Seriously. And an ENORMOUS portion for the price.  Love the atmosphere, love the food, love the drinks, it's directly across the street from my girlfriend's house... what more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"Let's begin....the lighting, decor, and atmosphere is absolutely incredible. I walked in and immediately felt relaxed, chill, and warm. There's a lot going on, and some tables have I. D cards, poems, drawings, business cards, it's all so delicious when in a cozy corner listening to Johnny cash or Marvin Gaye and sipping a delicious cocktail or beer.  I did not eat here so I cannot comment on it.  I think if you are looking for a warm, inviting night away from downtown Toronto than you should Def check It out.   Also had great service, contrary to what others posted and it was busy the night I was there.   A true Gem in the city...see what I did there...oh I'm amazing...ha"}
{"text":"I like the Gem.  Very nice people.  Cold beer.  Strange, weed-enclosed patio.  I don't love the bathrooms, but I live within walking distance so I can usually hold it.  If you are very lucky, and see a listing for any band playing here, they are likely very good."}
{"text":"Solid place. Have been going there for a few years.  People have complained about the food, but in the last year or so, I've noticed a marked improvement in everything coming out of the kitchen.  The place has a lovely unpretentious vibe and the music they play is usually top-notch. The only reason I can't give it four stars is because the service can often be indifferent.  Still a good place to enjoy a few drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I was sitting at a coffee shop when a girl said she saw my GEMS videos and told me I should come to check out her place of work...The GEM! :P When I arrived at the neighborhood I didn't expect to find such an amazing place...  The GEM was packed with great people and an amazing super retro colorful design. One of my favorite parts was that they had a book on display called the HOGTOWN Project written by friends of theirs. BTW Hogtown is the nickname for Toronto. This book is full of all the GEMS of Toronto with great photos of all the places you wouldn't know unless you lived here a while. Definitely a GEM :)"}
{"text":"There is nothing good about the food at this place unless your looking for frozen pizza and warm beer then this is the place you wanna be."}
{"text":"I lived a block away from this place for a year and walked passed all the time. It was so unassuming and well...closed whenever I walked by so I missed out on it's goodness till a friend of mine asked me to meet her there. Turns out it's a fantastic little spot.  It's small as small can be with a Tex Mex/Rock-a-billy thing going on. All of the tables I looked at had business cards, coasters or fliers jammed between the glass top covering and the actual table. I'm always mesmerized by things like that. Who were these people? Can you still reach them at that number? What drove them to leave their calling card?  Bathrooms are tiny and hidden at the bottom of a thin steep staircase so be careful if you've had a few and succumb to wobbly leg syndrome.  We showed up fairly late so they weren't offering much for food outside of hummus dips and the like, but they were good, cheap and came fast.  Drinks were reasonably priced and they have a fully stocked bar. The bar tenders were friendly and attentive both when ordering and chatting with them on their break.  I haven't been since the summer so it's probably well passed time to go back."}
{"text":"My  local haunt for my entire life - affordable beer (though the owner tends to put weird flavoured beers or PBR on tap a little too often!), the best nachos in Toronto (the bean dip: PERFECTION.), and the coolest vibe. I come here two or three times a week, usually just for a beer or two, to sit with my friends and read all the great things people have left under the glass of the tables. I love the rockabilly vibe, and that it manages to be a total hipster hangout without always being full of hipsters. Eddie (the owner) has great taste in music, so there's always something nice (usually actual records) playing. Just don't touch the jukebox. It's purely for show these days.  Straddles the line between \"place to go for a quiet beer\" and \"place to go to get totally drunk\" perfectly. I do both, all the time.  Every once in a while they'll have a new server who doesn't quite get that they don't have to be aloof, or you'll get something not great coming out of the kitchen (the most likely culprit: stale bread on your sandwich), but the great times absolutely make up for it. And hey, if there's something wrong with your food, they're usually more than happy to make the whole thing again for you.  Also: Yelp says it is moderately priced, but that seems a bit unfair - sandwiches and a lot of other food is under 11 bucks - its just the big dishes, the carbonara (which is amazing, by the way), Gembalaya, etc. that are priced a bit higher."}
{"text":"Love the vibe and decor and juke box at the Gem and especially love the fact that it's in a neighbourhood generally devoid of good establishments.  But...I have to say that the heavily-tattooed bartender/manager/proprietor has to be one of the most unfriendly service personnel in all of Toronto. He micromanages every aspect of this place like a prison guard. Don't stand next to tables! Don't play too much music on the juke box! Don't dare ask him what the beer selection is. Remember the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld? I think he works at the Gem now.  I wish so badly that this place was more friendly and welcoming. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Cool place, gd food but o man the waitress had some attitude. Probably won't go back because the unfriendly services."}
{"text":"Note that my star rating is based mostly on what this place USED to be like because a few things have gone downhill over the years. Here's what I mean: * Their oven is always \"not working properly\" or \"not working at all\" (how the apologetic wait staff describe why there's an obscenely limited menu these days * Their patio, which used to be lovely and lush with greenery, was renovated and is now bare, open and feels like sitting in a parking lot * They used to have live music but that seems to have disappeared in recent years * They used to serve brunch, and promised it would return but....  Don't get me wrong - I have always love the Gem - the decor, the music, the drinks, the wait staff and especially their nachos. But lately, me and my party have left on numerous occasions after we've sat down and been told the oven is broken.... AGAIN.  I can forgive the other slippages, but PLEASE BUY A NEW OVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff can be very rude.  There is often a large dog walking around the restaurant.  My friend ate the chicken wings and got food poisoning.  The food quality overall is not great.  ok for a late night drink.  not much more than that though."}
{"text":"Hmmm.....I don't like moldy potatoes with my eggs!  Great neighbourhood location. Decent pub and nice service. The food is just Okay at best but often disappointing. I do go on occasion because of the convenience but I can't recommend it above utilitarian.  On the plus side, it has a kinda funky vibe !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I moved to the neighborhood a few months ago & have been looking for a new local hangout. He runs by this place daily & wanted to give it a shot for his birthday party. We were not expecting what we walked into (even after reading the Yelp reviews). It's true what others have said, this bar feels like it was transported from the downtown core & plopped down in this neighborhood. Love the decor & quaintness. More people arrived for our party than expected but the waitress & bartender were quick to find us extra chairs. Despite that, we did find the service a little slow at first. However, when the bar started getting full, she seemed to come by to check on us more often. We didn't try the food this time around but we plan on going tonight to try the nachos everyone keeps writing about. Looking forward to that bean dip!"}
{"text":"It smells odd and no air-conditioning so it's hot. Yeah, it's a tiny place but there's still no reason to have minuscule, uncomfortable tables and booths. Maybe we were there on an off day, after reading other food reviews and hearing about their \"great nachos\", but we thought the food was awful. Burgers were dry, tasteless and almost inedible - we left half of each. The nachos were small, and very plain jane. We left annoyed, hungry and feeling ripped off.  If it were just the food, we'd give it another shot, restos have off days, but there was nothing about this place that appealed to us, so we won't be back. There were regulars there that seemed to be having a good time. More power to them, but we didn't see the charm."}
{"text":"The Gem is a small watering-hole/pub in a residential area of Toronto.  It primarily serves the locals who live in the area.  The Gem is cozy and warm - even on the coldest winter days; very homey feeling.  For me - it is more of a casual drink spot on the odd evening local friends wants to meet up.  I've not had the food - but the daily special always looks intriguing and people are always eating there (so the food must be reasonably good)."}
{"text":"Have been to this place on a couple of occasions now, and I gotta admit as a local dive bar, it is tops in my books! The eclectic design, the jukebox full of good tunes, surely staff and some pretty decent prices on booze. Basically checks the boxes on all the important points.  A must-do when you visit the gem is bring something with you: a ticket stub, a business card, expired TTC card, something, and add it to the growing collection of mementos left by patrons over the years. Don't have something, then doodle something inappropriate on a piece of paper or cocktail napkin and add that to the tables instead... don't worry - everyone's doing it!  The gaff here IMO is the service, I think they might be under staffed, because on both occasions that I've visited the first round comes out... eventually, and then you'll be hard-pressed to catch a servers attention to order another round (or pay your tab) pretty much from then on... save for actually walking to the bar to flag someone down. Pro-Tip:  to overcome the service issue, I'd recommend ordering a large volume of beer or booze upfront (2 doubles, a pitcher, a tray of shots... or all of the above).  Decent spot and I'd come back"}
{"text":"I have lived in the neighbourhood about 14 years, and have walked by the Gem many times, it always seemed to have some clients, so one day I decided to give it a try. The interior is pleasant decorated in late 1950s early sixties music memorabilia. I read some reviews which criticized the wait staff I had no problem with the server, she seemed friendly enough. I ordered the burrito, my son order the wings, and my daughter the pizza. The burrito was not great, it was okay, the wings were baked as they do not have a deep fryer, my 12 year old son thought that they were the worst wings he ever had! They were kind of disgusting when I tried one, and the pizza my daughter had was horrible, it tasted like frozen crust pizza, she couldn't even finish it.  One more thing the beer was warm, yuk. I read some positive reviews on Yelp about this place in regards to the food, quite honestly the food was really bad, probably the worst pub food I have ever had. I really wanted to like this place because it's close to home."}
{"text":"I love the Gem. The atmosphere is perfect. They serve interesting flavours of beer (ex. raspberry wheat!). It's a gem of a place. It plays nice music, it's so warm and cozy in the winter and in the summer the patio is great too. The food is okay, not the best but not the worst. If you want ATMOSPHERE, the gem is the place to go."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed our quick stop at The Gem when I was in town for miss Evelyn's awesome Yelp events. There's something magical about this place. It could be the random mannequins and other somewhat creepy, somewhat whimsical decor, the awesome music, or the hole in the wall vibe, but I'm pretty sure part of it is the bean dip.  Quite small, and definitely charming, I think this would be a wonderful place for a first (for 20th) date. The business cards and photos shoved under the tabletops make for excellent conversation, and the incense in the bathroom remind me of summers gone by. I devoured their nachos (...and bean dip), and thought the other offerings looked pretty tasty too. This is definitely a great late night munchies spot, and I can't wait to pop by on my next visit to T.O."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to have The Gem as my local. The service is good and it's easy to strike up a conversation with anyone sitting at the bar. It's the only game in town on this stretch of Davenport, but the owner and servers still go out of their way to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Oh wow.   This is going to be the Hubster and my new, go-to spot. It's a short bus ride away for us, and about a 30-40 minute walk home. Service is friendly, and they carry Strongbow (not the night I was there, though). They have a jukebox and also play some pretty neat records. The crowd is sort of hipster 30s, with no rowdies.   My only issue is that I wish their kitchen was open later, but that's more my problem, not their's.  It's a small space, keep that in mind if you're with a crowd!"}
{"text":"The stars are for authenticity.  You need balls, ovaries, and way too much experience to proudly stand like a recognized dive bar in this area.  Ppl. I follow on Yelp were here before, and they gave kinky cool reviews. So, I knew I wanted to experience it on my own flesh.  I loved it: the details on their decoration spoke by themselves.   We people can leave messages, pictures, tickets, or whatever we feel meaningful inside the glass of the tables ( TTC tickets, parents pics, group's hang out's... you name it, and put it...)  The crew is cosmopolitan. In my point of view: They don't care who you are... Have fun!!!!!!   Enjoy.  Thank you Yelp, because you show me \"The Gem\" and I think it's awesome."}
{"text":"My FAVOURITE bar in the city!!  It's true that it's a little out of the way for most, but for me, it's my local.  It's a great little hole in the wall: dark, small, cool records always playing, a juke box, sometimes a live band. They have some crazy décor going on including an Elvis bust, and interesting mementos from past customers slid under the glass table tops. The patio in the summer is strange little oasis that feels like you're in a friends slightly weedy backyard.   The beer on tap is only Mill Street, but the rotating selections are always good. They've updated a few of the things on the menu recently, which is nice to see because the food has never been their strong point. I always get the veggie burrito and the new version is FANTASTIC. I hear their GEMbalaya is quite stellar as well- '20 years and going strong' the server told us.  The crowd is a mix- if not a little on the hipster side- but always cool, always relaxed. Perfect spot for an after work pint or a weekend catch up with good friends."}
{"text":"If not for the terrible service, The Gem would be a gem. Really. Great selection of craft beers, reasonably priced drinks, and good bar food including some delicious smoked wings. The kitschy decor could make for interesting conversation if you're bored and the lighting is just right. BUT, the servers are far too busy talking to one another and their friends to even notice that you're there. How does one go about placing an order here? If you motion at the server, she will be offended and pretend not to see you. If you walk over to talk to her, she will be too busy chatting with her co-worker to addresses you. Finally, when you get the bill and place your card on the tray, you will not know that you need to walk up to the bar to use the machine unless you ask why its taking so long for them to swipe your card. What happened to customer service? Why are the (angry hipster) servers SO rude?! The Gem needs to step up its game and live up to its name.   Consumer Advocacy!"}
{"text":"Love the Gem. It's a home away from home. Atmosphere is great, food is decent and cheap (my favourite order: nachos with pulled pork. Not listed on the menu, but so good), small but good revolving selection of beers on tap, larger selection of everything in bottles or tallboys. Staff are friendly. Jukebox is awesome. Eddy is the best!  Just adding an update because I noticed another person complaining about \"rude hipster servers.\" I have never experienced rude hipster servers in the 5 years I've been going there, up to including the night before last. Maybe that's because we are exceptionally charming people, and they give as good as they get!"}
{"text":"I've always heard of the Gem but never had a chance to check it out. And the crazy thing is that it's right around the corner from where I live, but I never think to go north to Davenport for anything.  Finally checked it out for a bit last night and it didn't look like anything I had pictured. I thought maybe it would be a relatively bland decor but it's very bright and tacky -- in a good way. Lots of rock-a-billy type stuff on the walls and behind the bar. On the tables they have what appears to be lost articles left behind. I saw things like passport photos, student ID cards, personal notes, ticket stubs, etc.  The pint I ordered was warm, so that wasn't very good. Still, knowing this place is so close to my house gives me hope it will slowly become my new local."}
{"text":"great place to drink. The food is not worth the trip though. So if you're up for a pint and not too particular about the food stuff you put in your mouth with it then it's a grand place to imbibe."}
{"text":"the NACHOS are 5 stars   This little corner joint has tons of potential.  What's unfortunate is the lack of quality service.  To be fair, I've only ever gone once... I was very turned off after my first and only experience.   My date and I walked in to find one party of 4 people seated in the back area, and a bartender/server who was reading something off his phone.  We stood in the entry way waiting to be greeted, before finally just deciding to eat ourselves.  It was cold, and so we chose to sit a few tables away from the door, at a table for 4. I did not think this would be an issue...   When we were finally brought menus, our server awkwardly told us that if the bar began to fill up, that he'd have to ask us to move to a table for 2.  I can understand why he might feel the need to tell us this... however it was 6pm and the place was pretty dead.  We assured him we wouldn't stay long (a little turned off by his demeanour)   We only stayed as long as we did because it took forever to get our drink and food orders in! This is a small place, definitely small enough to have one person serving and bar tending.  Whatever was on this man's phone took total priority over customer service.   Before finishing up, I heard the bar tender once again tell a patron that if the place filled up, she would have to move her seat.  She seemed just as perplexed as we were (kind of looking around like... \"OK, but don't hold your breath about this place getting that busy\").  I think he just lacked a certain tact and table side manner."}
{"text":"This place is, in a nutshell, awful.  The food is less than mediocre and extremely over priced.  The nachos are ok and the only edible thing on the menu - but are priced at a premium.  The owner is extremely sexist and we have overheard him on several occasions making disgusting comments about both female customers and his female staff.  A dog wanders around the restaurant when that is clearly a violation of health code.  The patio is nice.  But the beer selection is terrible.  Not worth it even when you live around the corner."}
{"text":"Great local bar in a neighborhood that could use more places like this. Cold beer, awesome environment, small patio, small inside, decent menu. Pretty low key. Definitely worth repeated visits if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The Gem is currently my local watering hole.  Too bad.  The food is mediocre.  Pabst is the only beer that is fresh.  The tables are entertaining, lots of random pictures, IDs, bussiness cards.   Look, if you wanted a beer but didn't make in time to the LCBO you can choose to go here. But if you walked just further down to bloor or further north to St.Clair you would find more choices and better food choices.   The vibe is great when it isn't way too crowded, it should be crowded enough that you don't smell that smell.   Sorry, Gem."}
{"text":"Had some afterwork drinks with a couple of friends. Had some outstanding chicken wings as well. Eclectic interior with a good selection of Hipstery beers. Server was friendly. She was playing some surprisingly good music on the stereo. Helmet, Soundgarden, Faith No More. Will return before Christmas for a proper night there. Last visit was 10 years ago !"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of couples and treated like we were not welcome. The food was average, the service was terrible and the place is rundown!  This is nothing more than a glorified local watering hole.  I wouldn't be back if someone else was picking up the tab!"}
{"text":"It is no secret I am a huge fan of their bean dip. I'll pretty much tell anyone who will listen: get whatever you want from the menu... and ask for some bean dip. Just this past Monday I enjoyed their quesadillas... with a side of bean dip.   They have a great raspberry wheat ale on draft, and their mixed cocktails are below-average price for Toronto. And Lest We Forget the lovely literature that lies beneath the glass tops of their tables - I love reading business cards and ticket stubs from days gone by. Who doesn't?   Their old vinyl collection that that they play every evening will warm even the coldest heart. Basically, if you haven't already, please visit my friend Gem. She is truly outrageous.   PEPPER'S PISSED: Some lovely jerk is making their life difficult, and currently their patio is closed. I hate when this happens to neighbourhood bars. I'm certain The Gem's patio (which really isn't a romping affair) was there before you paid waaaaay too much for your semi-detached stucco house. The Gem adds value of your crap-box, it doesn't diminish its worth."}
