{"text":"This place has been undergoing changes in the last while so I was unsure about how it would be but gave it a shot and I'm glad I did!  Lots of flavour in their naan rolls and Really great vegetarian options here too! Best part is the $4 mill st organic!!"}
{"text":"I want to like The Street because the concept of the best of world street food served up in one spot is appealing.  The selection of dishes was good, and we had a hard time picking just two: the Po'boy and the bibimbap. The Po'boy was okay. With decent crispy shrimp, a passable remoulade, and a very nice (non-traditional) brioche bun. The bibimbap was disappointing, served on a regular plate rather than in a hot stone bowl, it lacked the crispy bits the thermal vessel gives you, and the provided sauce lacked punch. There is an evening discount on diahes as this is primarily a lunch spot I suppose. Unlike many previous reviewers, the service we got was good, but the execution of the dishes means it only merits 3 stars."}
{"text":"We waited for two burgers for 15 minutes and then they were served cold. Service was slow and slumpy. Interior is trendy and welcoming but everything else was disappointing."}
{"text":"Finally dropped into this little Downtown West/Eau-Claire spot for an impromptu lunch.  Tried the stone bowl w Tofu and hubs had the classic burger.  My stone bowl was good but the real star was the burger.  Should have paid a little extra and gotten the second party.  Fries were perfect and the burger was excellent! By far the best burger in Calgary.  It must be the best kept secret!  You should definitely try their burger if you are into burgers.  Menu is a little confusing if you aren't familiar with the various foods, bim bap, tortas, naan, etc.., like moi, but don't be afraid to ask  questions, they are happy to explain things."}
{"text":"Great stop to try street food favourites from around the world. I stopped in last night and had the Korean stone bowl and a side order of fries.   What a great spot with food to please every pallet. I'll be back soon to try the famous 'beyond burger'.   Thanks again to the friendly staff for the great meal!!"}
{"text":"Came here last week for lunch and has the king toastada.  Very expensive for what you get.  Good flavour.  They forgot my fries, my avocado and my extra sauce. So pretty disappointed service wise."}
{"text":"$4 beer everyday and food are interesting, good portion, very flavorful and i found very indian inspired despite the menu is international street food. Good and fast service i would recommend for doing lunches"}
{"text":"I am a well travelled 60 year old.  Had a beautiful sandwich.  Fresh ingredients, properly spiced, fresh bun, etc.  The corn garnish needed some work.  Good value!  Will be returning regularly."}
{"text":"I love the variety and the fact that they have vegan/vegetarian options. Friendly staff and good vibes makes this a new favourite :)"}
{"text":"This is the slowest place I have been to.  Three people were working, I was the only person waiting and it took forever!!! I almost left without my meal.  Such a waste of time.. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My first time in today. The place wasn't busy but the menu looks phenomenal and the butter chicken I ordered was really good. I'll be back to try some more soon."}
{"text":"Review edited for second experience:  Ordered vegan wings again and there was barely any sauce on the Thai chili flavor. We can barely tell the difference between the two flavors due to the lack of sauce. The wings were definitely different than the first time we had them. If this was the first time we had the vegan wings I doubt we would be back.   Original review  Excellent vegan options! Friendly and quick service. We tried the vegan masala and the vegan wings. The ranch sauce was to die for. Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Our party ordered 6 dishes: tempura shrimp po boy, Korean lettuce wraps, beef satay salad, pouring, chicken naan roll up and chicken fingers for the kid. We were all pretty disappointed with the food and the value. The fried food was over cooked. The roll up has about a cup of liquid come out the end. The lettuce roll filling was an indistinguishable melange of stuff. The pouting was weird."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this restaurant: a variety of street foods from around the world, served casually (order at the counter then take a seat or get take out) in a funky little spot. However, I think this new restaurant has some kinks to work out if they are going to be successful.  I visited the Street Eatery on their grand opening as they had been advertising 1/2 off entrees for the entire day. From my understanding the restaurant had been open for a few days or a week at this point. At 50% off, the meals were certainly a fantastic deal.   I ordered the Korean lettuce wraps with chicken added. Normal menu price: $10. Half off special: $5.   Positives: - Flavorful pickled veggies and dipping sauce - At five wraps, the portion size is decent - Fresh ingredients - Lots of healthy options on the menu with gluten free and vegetarian offerings noted as such on the menu  Negatives: - The addition of chicken was a $3 upcharge (no meat by default, $3 for chicken or shrimp, $4 for beef) but only one small cube of chicken was added to each of the five wraps. Because of this, you only get chicken in one bite of each wrap. - The rice was left off my wrap. I didn't realize this until I re-checked the menu after eating. - At my table of three diners, one person received their food almost ten minutes before the other two - One of my dining companions ordered a hot dish that came out cold"}
{"text":"Waited 25 mins for cold tostadas with only 6 people in the restaurant. The staff didn't seem to be on top of things. Poor training perhaps? Don't think I will be going back..."}
{"text":"It's like a vegan Boston Pizza.  Hits the spot but everything is bland and tastes the same.   For example I am pretty sure they use the same guacamole as BPs.  Popcorn chicken wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the Korean Stone Bowl, the perfect mix of sweet and spice! Looking forward to going back and trying some of the Butter Chicken and Naan Rola.."}
{"text":"Came here for my 8 year old son's birthday in July, and this place did not disappoint.  He wanted rice for his bday dinner-hello stone bowl with chicken-which wasn't much of a serving for the price, but I'll forgive the portion size for the awesome flavours. The rice at the bottom of the bowl cold have been crispier, but I wasn't at a Korean restaurant- I was okay with that.  My older son had a chicken burger with fries- also smaller in size but he ate it all with no complaints, he loves any fried chicken.  We also enjoyed the butter chicken rice bowl-who doesn't love butter chicken??  And I had a salad, in anticipation of everyone's dishes I was sampling.   For the birthday boy's treat, he got the berry milkshake and it was pretty crazy with all the candies decorating the glass- perfect for an 8 year boy who loves loves sugar in the form of candy. Overall a fun place for the creative dishes but a bit pricy for the portions.  None of us left very stuffed."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday, around 2. It wasn't busy, my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant besides a few take out orders. It took almost 40 minutes for our food to come out and it wasn't that good. We got an appetizer of the Korean fried chicken and there was a little feather like thing under the piece of lettuce. It was very unappetizing and just didn't make me want to eat anymore. I also got a burger and asked for no pickled onions on it, but they were on there. The chips that came with the burger were okay, nothing special, just average. A few chips were soggy and unsalted.  In the next few hours after coming here, my stomach hurt and I didn't feel well at all. I don't know if it was food poisoning or just the food was unsettled in my stomach.  Overall, not a good experience and would not recommend coming."}
{"text":"If you don't have anything nice to say.... Don't say anything at all right?!? But if you want a meal ... Maybe go somewhere else until these guys get their stuff sorted out... Too many mistakes, \"tempura shrimp\" which does not even begin to resemble shrimp like the other poster had mentioned about the chicken - totally a rip off better off getting vegetarian unless you want a deep fried tasteless \"crumb\" of a shrimp (think popcorn shrimp NOT tempura) , after asking for no cilantro a cilantro filled meal (what if that was an allergy!) .... $4 \"Lobster\" addition  which is not even recognizable by sight or flavour  ... \"Cajun\" fries which are inconsistently cooked and barely seasoned... Wrong items coming to the table for other tables? Being placed down and then taken away and brought to other tables.... Nothing \"fresh\" about the food - frozen corn - way better options around...l"}
{"text":"I am not sure if its what I ordered (by luck) or just so happens everything on menu is so delicious. So I ordered the Tikka love - Naan Rola. I was amazed at the flavor in that Naan wrap.  The Tikka love had a good portion of chicken. It was messy though. The chicken was not dry (somewhat had that donair flavor or grilled flavor to it). The mint chutney was served on the side. So I added the entire thing into the meal. The wrap can be a bit messy so  you really have to tilt your head when eating it. I loved it. Also the pink color from the pickled onions added a very good presentation to it. The meal cost $12 and it came with a very tiny salad.  My colleagues ordered the stone bowl. It looked good. Definitely not the traditional Korean style kind. Its fusion style. According to them it was pretty good.   How this place works is you first order and then you get a number and they bring over the food. It does take about 5 to 10 mins for them to prep it. Seating is limited but I came during lunch time and the place was not completely full. There are a few seats outside (three tables). Inside was somewhat hot (might need to turn on the AC).  I think the location plays a big role on how busy this place can get. It's not in the very center center of downtown. So foot traffic isn't very busy here. Next door is the firehall and across is a parking lot. Further down is the bridge to exit downtown. That tells you something about how busy this restaurant can get. Maybe they get quite a bit of neighboring businesses.  Service was good. Overall I liked the food a lot. Highly giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Flavoursome Korean and Indian inspired street food with some burgers thrown in for good measure. Nice little outside area to sit. Kid friendly. Friendly helpful staff. This time was the braised short rib poutine and Korean lettuce wraps with some milkshakes to drink. Will probably be back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a little date night tonight. I was really excited to try the Beyond Burger, however ended up a bit disappointed. I think the patty itself has potential - though it seemed to be a tad over cooked as it wasn't pink at all, or maybe we are not able to access the real Beyond Burgers that you see on videos from the States? I also had to have a lettuce wrap as a bun as they do not offer GF buns (found that a bit odd for a place promoting a vegan menu - a lot of ppl into this have allergies, no?). Not a big deal as it was healthier anyways, plus I had fries lol. So the fries... They were obviously sitting somewhere for a while - had a microwaved texture unfortunately, but still edible. Flavours all around were nice, just the execution was the issue. My husband had a beef burger that he enjoyed though the egg that was on it didn't even run (another over cooking issue). He also had a side salad instead of fries and it was literally three bites in a little dipping sauce bowl. We found it very funny, but in reality the value for money was a bit off.  We did enjoy our time out, but the only reason I would ever return is because I want to try the Beyond Chicken and I do not know of anywhere else I can buy it...  Lovely service though - 5/5 for an amazing server!"}
{"text":"I love love love their shrimp tempura burger.. this place is 2mins walk from us.. we love to grab a quick bit if one of us dont feel like cooking.. my husband likes their butter chicken.. its his go to quick indian fix for a rainyday"}
{"text":"Great Food and Atmosphere. I love this place! A unique menu with prompt service. The milkshakes are insane, and its the best fake meet ive found in Calgary."}
{"text":"Came back recently and I have to say that I am more impressed than the last time. Came in with a large group (about 6) so that we could try all of the different dishes. We got the food REALLY quick and I was beyond happy it - all of the flavours were just so unique and tasty, there just wasn't a bad dish. Even the vegetarian dishes were fantastic (and I love my proteins!). Overall 5 star and everything in my previous review still holds true. Definitely, definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things from friends about The street Eatery and thought I should try it out too.  My fiance, lil brother, and I went there on a Friday and we were the only ones there. We ordered bibimbap, korean chicken,  one of their burgers, and a KFC chicken bowl. The orders came in quickly and the servings were large.   The food was okay. The bibimbap didn't taste remotely what a dolsot bibimbap should even though it was in a stone bowl. The korean chicken and KFC chicken bowl was super salty! And the burger my fiance ordered was just mediocre.   We might come back to try the milkshakes, but not in a rush to come back at all.  Overall, we were super disappointed with our food and would probably only recommend The Street Eatery for their milkshakes - since you can't really mess up a milkshake."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant during our visit in Calgary. It's hard to describe the cuisine; we ordered bibimbap, lettuce wrap, chickpea curry bowl and butter chicken. Fusion Indian and Korean? All tasted really good and the portions very enough.   Try the milkshake. You will have your mind blown.  There are no high chairs available so be ware if you are coming to with a kid!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place out through a Facebook ad. We went in on a Friday afternoon, just post lunch hour. The location is amazing! Right on corner of 8th street and 4th avenue, the place is full of sun shine and hip decor. Being vegetarians , we ordered King Tostadas and Delhi Hawker Klassik burger.  The food was so fresh and delicious! It was served on a wooden chop board and presented beautifully yet in a simple way. It was cheap, and satisfying . Just the Delhi Hawker Klassik lacked one more piece of tiny burger ;) I would definitely recommend it to everyone looking for a quick bite or a Saturday afternoon late lunch or an after work quick bite. Unfortunately didn't check out their drink section, but the menu looked intriguing  I so look forward to going back there soon !"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience today. We drove out of our way to come here and try out the food. We waited for 30 minutes and then they delivered my sister the wrong bowl (steak instead of chicken) and then I had to wait another 15 minutes for my sandwich and fries. I asked for extra cilantro and the sandwich had none on it. My fries had been sitting for a long time and our milkshake came close to the end of our meal.   I get that it was probably a one off but there was no offer of money back or anything to save our experience. The server barely apologized and just said it was busy. So disappointing!!!!!!"}
