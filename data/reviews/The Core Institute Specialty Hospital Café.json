{"text":"Yes, it's a hospital cafeteria. BUT ITS NOT JUST A HOSPITAL CAFETERIA.  There is nothing on the menu that isn't restaurant level good. Why? Because of Haili and the staff around her. She needs to have her own restaurant! Every day there are varieties of soup and main entrees, whether pork belly sliders and homemade kettle chips or beautiful salads and sandwiches made JUST RIGHT.  But do NOT leave without trying one of her from-scratch desserts. That's where she is off the charts good! There is always a variety, and everything is fantastic. Even if you're just driving by, the Core Institute Specialty Hospital is the place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"The chef here is amazing. Don't underestimate the quality of the cuisine at this hospital!  He continues to provide satisfying and filling meal choices for all patrons. Having worked for Morton's steakhouse in the past, this chef is very well trained for any kitchen!"}
{"text":"Such yummy food every day! Steve is always so sweet and willing to help feed me and my pickiness."}
