{"text":"Went here for dinner with a group of 3. Waited for 30 mins for our drinks, over an hour for our appetizers, then gave up and went to the Harveys next door. Upon paying for our drinks, the server proceeded to ask me what we ate and how much the drinks were - as she really did not know what we were served and the cost of their own menu.  There seemed to be so much confusion between the servers and kitchen staff. I noticed they brought out duplicate entree`s for other tables out of confusion, and our appetizers were always \"coming in 5 minutes\" according to our server for about an hour."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service. We had lamb rogan josh, beef Korma, eggplant bharta & palak paneer, they were all delicious. And don't miss their garlic. It is to die for!  We'll be back for buffet spread soon & of course for more ala carte  Ambience is modern & immaculately clean  The owners were so gracious with the nicest staff. We had a slight miscommunication on the order & they fixed it immediately without any fuss.  These small gestures goes a long way.  We will be going there despite the long drive. Will be worth it."}
{"text":"This place is like an oasis in a food desert. The buffet is incredible and the staff are super friendly. My favourite dish was the lamb curry :)  There actually wasn't a weak dish in the whole tray. A hidden gem in the outskirts of to."}
{"text":"We were just passing by and saw this restaurant and went in to have some south Indian food. While we were sitting the waitress came and took the order. I started checking reviews of this restaurant all were saying how late the service was. So we ordered few dishes that were chefs special believe it or not within 10 mins everything came fresh food delicious dosa and there dahi vada amazing a must have dish if you go there. We had some good food and amazing time."}
{"text":"-1 star, I went with my friend. Food wasn't worth money. Waited too long for appetizers and drink.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Saw ads passing by the area for a grand opening, decided to check it out...2 items we requested for was 'sold out'. Their complimentary drink for the evening time celebrate was Mango Lassi - also sold out. The waitress offered us two free pops instead. We waited for 45 minutes for two appetizers....which were decent but certainly not worth the wait. There seemed to be too much chaos and pandemonium between the host, kitchen and servers for no apparent reason since the place was only moderately packed. The owner I believe, since he was dressed in a business suit only approached a few tables, seemed like he was appeasing and catering relatives/family friends more than regular customers or patrons there was distasteful especially given there were a few tables waiting on their orders for a while, he should've been concentrating on damage control but he was busy clicking pictures instead.  I give this one star as opposed to zero for the servers who were doing their best to keep things in some sort of order for the customers."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. I don't think they read any of the reviews or want to read them because they have definitely not tried to change their tack tics !  We came last night and half of the restaurants lights were turned off and it felt like their was no heat on. The waitress was somewhere outside and we had to wait for her to get back from doing what ever she was doing .. The food is always good but the servers are slow!!! Another couple came in just after we got our food and there was nobody around to greet them for about 10 minutes ..I'm surprised they sat down and waited!! If that was me I would have walked out. Every time I want to come here for a special occasion the \"chef always wants to go home early\" so we never get to come!! Not that its fancy enough for a special occasion.. I just think the chicken is worth it!"}
