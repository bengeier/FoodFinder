{"text":"I had 2 slices. One Roman with meat and the other chicken pesto. The crust was firm but easy to fold for the chicken pesto but because of the meats on the Roman, it made the crust limp and a bit soggy. I would suggest getting the veggie style on this one. It is open until 3am and they will deliver to your room. The price for one slice will run bt 5.25-6.50."}
{"text":"Rip off 100%.  No mention that they are inside Sunset Station.  Ordered 2 pizzas and it came to 55.00.   Not happy with tgem. Nor YELP"}
{"text":"Amazing New York style pizza! I wish I had one closer to my neighborhood, but I will definitely go out of my way to eat here because this place serves one of my favorite pizzas in Vegas. The staff is super friendly too! Great service and atmosphere. Love their veal hot dogs as well. Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob, and Pizza Forte is fantastic! I ate here 3 times yesterday. Highly recommend the pesto chicken pizza and the classic cheese and pepperoni."}
{"text":"Toppings where awesome. Gluten Free crust was good, but it was cooked with the normal pizzas."}
{"text":"This place saved the day with a very nice large pepperoni pizza and we just moved in to my new home putting together furniture and it was juicy very very hot and fresh from the oven  too. T people are very nice friendly courteous definitely a must go to place late late at night too will be seeing them again soon thanks very much for having a clean business also"}
{"text":"I love pizza. I have never thrown away pizza until i ate here. I got 2 slices and a drink for $8.50. Ate one slice and started on the second, but couldnt get it down. The bottom was completely burnt. Would not try again"}
{"text":"I work near by so I have lunch there probably more than I should haha. Everyone there is really nice, and most importantly, the pizza is delicious. They sell it by the slice so it's nice and quick. They have several options ready to put in the oven. For those watching their diet they also have quick chicken salad options. The salads are simple and healthy. If u wanna be kind of bad they do offer house made croutons! So good. They're also open pretty late on weekends so that's awesome! My company has ordered full pizza pies as well and it's always quick and fresh. Try them out for yourself!! You'll love it."}
{"text":"The must rude and nasty service I have ever experienced, the cashier was extremely rude to my wife and my family.  I am outraged Hard Rock Hotels has a person like this hired.  She had no clue how to deliver our order when we asked for what we PAID she started to neglect us and took other people's orders, when my wife asked for her beer she denied the service and when my sister in law asked for her beer suddenly there were no more beers with a fridge packed with all the beer in the world.  This is unacceptable!!! I use to recommend this place.  WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK to either Pizza Forte or HRH!!!"}
{"text":"I love pizza! Having this place in the hotel was a great convenience for us! Open till about 3am, was a great late night place for a pizza lover like me. I would rate it more like a 3.5 but due to poor customer service, rounded down. The pizza itself was just like a typical new york style pizza, get what I expect. Nothing wrong with that at all, I love when food tastes just the way I want it to! We ordered a whole pizza just to take up to our room. Was made fresh. The only problem was when the pizza was finished, none of the 3 people said anything to us. We were the only ones in the restaurant waiting and another table eating. Just a little rude from my perspective, especially when the 3 people were just talking and standing around while our pizza sat there. Only waited about 3 minutes, but still a long time considering how hungry I was. Still, a good place for your pizza needs!"}
{"text":"What can I say it was love at first sight... Working at the salon I'm always limited on time to go out get lunch, Pizza Forte always saves the day (plus I love pizza). Everyone here is helpful and friendly, I love coming down to pick up some lunch and just enjoy the crew."}
{"text":"I should have worn my reading glasses and not pointed to a Hawaiian pizza instead of a plain cheese pizza. The pineapple pieces were sliced thin and looked like cheese. What I got was a waterlogged piece of pizza at $3.75 a slice with virtually no cheese on it. Not the worst pizza I ever had and that would be Little Ceasars. When I folded the pizza in half it dripped red water all over the plate."}
{"text":"Really good pizza hidden in the back of Sunset Station by Kid's Quest.  Their New York style was fantastic, I'm looking forward to trying the Roman style next time I'm in the area.  This is my go-to spot on the Eastside of town."}
{"text":"The meat combo pizza was not so great. For starters, the crust was to soggy and would fold over as you're holding it to eat. The cheese would slide off the top easily. Now I just got one slice as I was passing through. The service was good and friendly, though."}
{"text":"Nice little place to stop in for a quick bite or to grab something to go. They serve more than just pizza but since Pizza Forte is the name had to have pizza. My husband & I ordered 1 thin New York slice & 1 thick Roman slice to go. Literally the slices were so big they filled up most of the pizza box. Definitely worth the price ($10 for both)! Plus both were really good. Great addition to the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"A welcome pizza stand in the Hard Rock Casino for those who to go to Joe's Pizza by the Slice across the street. It's not better than Joe's but you are still paying for the casino markup. Slices are large and of course reheated. What is jarring is that they have pizzas already premade (not cooked) on columns of trays sitting for no one knows how long before they are baked.  They have daily specials involving 2 slices with one topping but didn't have any vegetarian 1-topping slices available when I went.  They were even confused when I asked them to add a topping to my two cheese slices.  If you ask for water, insist on tap water through the machine because the smart water they drop on you is 5 dollars."}
{"text":"Highly recommend giving Pizza Forte a try. Authentic NY Style and Roman style pizza. Simple menu but lots of flavor. You HAVE to give the hot dogs a try too! Many condiments to add to hot dogs available. Just try everything on the menu, good food overall!! Don't forget to pick up a filled-to-order Canoli for desert,  you won't regret it ;)"}
{"text":"Sorry if your selling a 9 dollar slice of pizza with a small drink it better be good. This was not flavorless bland slice that you can find anywhere for half the price. I'm a pizza nut too it's a shame this place will never see a dime from me again and I visit the Hard Rock casino frequently. ."}
{"text":"The best pizza we ever had along with the customer service was great. This pizza is as close as Massachusetts Pizza I ever had which is the best"}
{"text":"Living in NYC I kinda know good pizza so I know that this pizza is great. It's a little pricey though. 5 bucks a slice and 5 bucks for a beer was ridiculous but that's my only gripe."}
{"text":"I've eaten this pizza about a dozen times.The price is right...It's sold by the slice for about $5  So won't hurt the wallet and it's away from the Strip...If you're looking to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the Las vegas Strip..Then this is the place to visit...You get a huge slice of pizza  (it's like eating two big pieces for the price of one)..I love that they put it in the oven...So it's nice and hot everytime you get it...I have to say this pizza is pretty good!! I love the crunchy crust and delicious sauce and toppings...It smells and taste just like old world Italian pizza is suppose to taste like. This isn't your healthy variety...It's your yummy greasy variety... ( Not super greasy..Just the right amount of olive oil ) But it's exactly what I want and I don't think it would taste the same if it weren't a little greasy! It's located in the Sunset Casino in the back...right pass the burger place...I'm totally sure you won't be disappointed. If hunger is on your mind Pizza Forte will satisfy the little monsters in your stomach! Works for me everytime...Ohh and the employees actually remember me... everytime they see me and the young lady automatically gives me the cheese packet...Five stars because it's so good!!"}
{"text":"It tastes amazing, until you find the cooked bug on your pizza. Then you spend the entire night in the restroom. I would never eat here again this is the only bad review I have ever wrote."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pizza in Henderson.  The Roman Pizza is the bomb!  Baked to perfection.  Super friendly employees"}
{"text":"Delicious when it's fresh. When I walk past this place and see a fresh pizza, I have to grab a slice or two. Not sure if they are still doing this but Monday - Thursday it was Buy 1 Slice Get 1 Free. Now that's a deal. The pieces are big, so 2 would definitely fill you up. I do pass them by if nothing is fresh but I also stop and ask if anyone else is coming out soon. Don't mind waiting for really good, fresh pizza.   I really think it has something to do with the sauce. The sauce is fantastic. It's not bold & robust but not bland either. Must have some good spices in there.   Stop by and grab a fresh slice, you won't be disappointed.   I worry this place will go out of business because it is CLEARRRR back in Sunset Station and unless one is specifically looking for it, you probably won't pass it."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and welcoming! They have a variety of pizzas, thin crust with tons of toppings! Also salads, calzone, and hot dogs. Ready in minutes which is nice for a quick bite. My favorite is the veggie or the spinach and ricotta both covered with toppings and flavor!"}
{"text":"Pizza here is actually really good! If your at the Hardrock and just want a slice of pizza then stop here and get one. They have about 4 kinds that they will heat up when you order it. Also can order a whole pizza. They even have sausages and salads.  Yum making me want a slice!"}
{"text":"A-OK! 3.5 stars! The fact that I could get pizza at a late hour without having to leave my hotel made me extremely happy! It's a small restaurant inside the Hard Rock Hotel so there wasn't much room to sit in and eat it, but they had small Togo boxes to take your pizza slice with you.  I got the Ham and Pineapple and although it was a little greasy, it was pretty good! Not bad for a small pizza joint! The slices were of good size but only wished they were a little bigger. I wasn't quite full from one slice but I know 2 would've been a little too much.   So even though I've had better pizza, this isn't a bad choice!! The price wasn't too crazy (for Vegas) so that made it more enjoyable as well :P"}
{"text":"As a huge pizza fan, my standards for pizza are high. Having never been to the hard Rock or this place before, I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed.  Prices are very reasonable for what they offer and taste is excellent. I got a couple of large slices of new York cheese pizza and devoured them within minutes! Great flavor . Sauce was just the right amount, where some places can put too much sauce on, here they put a minimal amount but the sauce tastes Excellent.  I'll definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My husband stopped by yesterday to grab some dinner to bring home.  Ordered one large pizza a bunch of hot dogs and one gluten free pizza (I have Celiacs Disease).  He waited for the food.  They bring out his \"order\".  Sorry sir we are out of Gluten Free Crust, but here have an extra regular pizza.   This is like going to a restaurant waiting for the plates to come out and they bring me nothing and the rest of the table their food.  Next time, maybe notify your customer prior to their order being ready that you won't be able to accommodate."}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza joint with gluten-free pizza!!! I always order my pie maxed out with topping! The crust is always crisp and delicious! The crew is quick and thorough! Thanks for creating awesome pizza for this gluten-free girl!"}
{"text":"It's ok. We got 2 slices, a soda, & a bottle of beer- it cost $21.  It's NY style pizza. It will hit the spot when you're hungry!"}
{"text":"You know those places you don't review because you don't want them blown up? Well I'm telling everyone about Pizza Forte in the Sunset Station - so it never goes out of business. YUM.  Pro tip - park in the covered garage off Warm Springs, elevator to 'Casino' and the slices are right in front of you.   Pepperoni - classic. Keep it real."}
{"text":"For late night snack...this place had large slices of pizza that were hot. It was tasty too. Not too greasy or soggy which was great. It was excellent pizza. Would definitely go back for another slice."}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR PIZZA!!!!! Their customer service is quick and friendly. They have a great variety of different sides. I always get the beef and mushroom it's my favorite! :)"}
{"text":"Buyer beware...roll the dice!     It looks like a cool place and it's nice to have options inside a hotel....but the food prep might not be all up to par and the customer service skills are poor at best - even from the owner!   Check out the type of demerits they got from the LV Health Inspection -- its all about food prep and temperature.  http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php    Unfortunately for us, we found this only after our son got sick...here's our experience....  We ordered 2 slices of cheese pizza for my son, who didn't want to eat same dinner as us.   After eating only one of the two pieces of pizza, and a couple hours later, he got violently ill.   Ahead of the pizza, our group of 7 all ate the same things and places all day long with no illness.   SO, it was pretty easy to narrow it down to the pizza.     When we called to report the issue, we experienced similar customer service issues as the other ratings have stated.  Our son got very sick that night and the owner, Nikki, was not all that compassionate or customer focused but rather defensive.    SO, maybe the employees take after the owners on this front.   This is not a hotel owned establishment - they only lease the space to the franchise.    Nikki started with \"well what did he eat the rest of the day\" NOT \"sorry or how is he feeling now?\"    When we tried to explain to Nikki (owner) that it wasn't very busy last night, yet the staff seemed to have prepped a bunch of dough and sauce on trays, which were all sitting out in the open, she continued to defend that they had to prep a bunch of pizzas for the next day because there was a big order of 200 pizzas that they needed to cook.    First lesson in customer service.....LISTEN to the customer fully before thinking about your defensive reply.     While waiting our turn we saw the food prep handler take one of the trays that had been sitting out in the open for some time (the sauce was all dried out), started to prepare it with cheese and other toppings its a clear sign that the night crew might not be following the proper process....but who are we to inform you as an owner of our experience, right?!?!?!  After several minutes on the phone with her, and the fact that she didn't want to hear what I had to say, I told her my husband would come down to talk to her in person.   Only then did she start asking what I wanted her to do?   REALLY?  Wow, you don't have any customer service skills!   She kept trying to insist that they did everything right and what did we want from her and that she wouldn't be there very long as she had to go to her other restaurant.   Again, I told her that we were in the towers and he would be right down to show her what he saw.   Only then did the first apology about our son getting sick come out, then she hung up without even saying \"good-bye\".      I sent my husband down to talk to her in person, she continued to defend her process and never offered anything up only asking my husband what we wanted her to do -- he finally explained to her that the first thing she should have offered is at least a refund.   She agreed to refund us, but said that we would have to come back cause her cash drawer was not ready.    It is only $12 refund, but cost us a whole night of a kid throwing up and miserable with no compassion at all --- SO Nikki -- keep your $12 cause I can win that back on the high roller tables that I am playing this entire week.     In light of all the food quality issues in the news lately, like Chipotle, you would think owners of food establishments would be a bit more savvy about how to handle these types of issues.   We were hotel guests, not just random off the street trying to scam a refund.   Nikki was told that we were guests here and you would think that might make a credible difference to listening to us.    NOPE!    Good luck with your franchise and hope you learn to become more customer focused, cause it is a consumer focused world these days!   Take a look around... you aren't the only pizza joint in Vegas!!   I'm sure Hard Rock management will be interested to read this review as it affects their brand as well."}
{"text":"Had an ok experience here.  The pizza by the slice was a little dry because it had been sitting for a while.  Wasn't crazy about the sausage but the roni was ok.  The crust is nice.  It may be a lot better if you get a whole pie made fresh.  Diet Pepsi had a strange aftertaste."}
{"text":"My brother and I were looking for a place to grab a quick bite after drinking and attending a concert at Vinyl (another awesome venue within the Hard Rock). Luckily for us we were able to find Pizza Forte. Now we didn't get there til about 11:40 so the pizza that they had readily available was slim however we just needed a couple slices of cheese.  Upon going up to pay we were informed that they were doing a buy one get one promotion so we ended up getting 4 slices for $14. Knowing we would be near the strip we anticipated paying quite a bit for the night out so this was a pleasant surprise.  The pizza itself was very good and the people working were the evening were extremely pleasant. From order to receiving our pizza couldn't have been more than 5 minutes which was also nice after a night of being in crowds and lines.  If you're looking to get your pizza fix near the Hard Rock, then Pizza Forte is your go to."}
{"text":"Marginal. One slice is the equivalent of two. It's thin crust, cheese and sauce was average. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Decent pizza spot in the food court area of Sunset Station.  I've grabbed a slice when my husband has bowling league.  They have a special that's 2 slices and a soda.  Slices are huge so I only get 1 slice.   It is way better than anything in the bowling area snack bar.  They have NY and Sicilian slices and many topping combinations.  I would pick this over the other fast options in Sunset Station."}
{"text":"Decent late night pizza! Similar to the secret pizza at cosmo. They crisp the slice in the oven. Ingredients seem fresh. Can't really complain when the munchies strike at 2am but this would actually be good anytime. Don't know what it is about this hotel but no draft beer again. Bottles only. They probably want you to get the crappy goose island beer around the corner. Anyways, their pizza is pretty good and they're open late."}
{"text":"Small place but hey, they have pizza  My first time here it was pass midnight and the pizza tasted A M A Z I N G.  I couldn't wait to return to Vegas to try it again. This time it was sober and around lunch time. Pizza was still good but not as I remembered it.  I got 2 slices but one would have been just fine."}
{"text":"Came here the day of warped tour on the 8th. Their slices were huge and really filling! They have decent beer there as well. For two slices and one drink is about $12. It looks pricey but it's worth it! It didn't have that many tables to sit. I liked the pizza but it got a little hard after it was a little colder."}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEats, afte an increasing \"estimated delivery time\" we finall got the WRONG PIZZA.  Called, they said \"manager is no here right now, but you get a free pizza.\" Uber does'nt care, (takes 24 hours to investigate) and they don't care and we are left paying $30 for a cheese pizza. Also, they did not send the plates, napkins, or condiments. Literally a $30 box of dough and cheese. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE.   Thanks but NO THANKS."}
{"text":"I was in the area for lunch and remember hearing about this place on eater. I am glad I came in. The service was great and fast. The daily lunch special was a good deal and the slices were very good"}
{"text":"Pretty fucking awesome....and ruined my December diet lol. So this place is located in the Hard Rock toward the casino elevators. I had some teens visit me, feed them a sandwich. I grabbed pizza a couple times late night. Great prices and quality.   My fave was the spinach ricotta, chicken pesto and the coke machine with all the flavors. It's a busy joint so the pizza is fresh or warmed ( but not gross)   Price was right like $5 or so big slice. Best Buy."}
{"text":"THE PIZZA GODS delivered.  Great pizza place for the tired and hungry after a show or gambling. The Hard Rock needed this place bad and PIZZA FORTE delivered big time.  Let me say they serve an entire pizza or by the slice so all your needs are satisfied. Slices very but you'll have a half dozen to choose from when the need is there. Keep in mind the slices are rather large so you may only need one. Also they serve hotdogs and tasty beverages. Limited menu so if your brain is detoxing or just not functioning you won't have to have to many choices to think about. And as for prices well 2 slices and a Coke was $13 so compared to what you blew in the casino, snorted up your nose or drank in the bar it's a cheap affair.  The Frank B thumbs up award for taste and simplicity."}
{"text":"I've gone a handful of times and always had friendly service. I always get the Mediterranean salad with the pesto chicken added. Can't wait to try the gluten free pizza one of these times!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in Hard Rock casino and want a great quick slice you have to stop by!  Service was fantastic!  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Not only do they have amazing food they have amazing people! The entire staff from the chefs to the girls checking guest out they are so friendly! Do yourself a favor and go check them out!"}
{"text":"Pizza is decent...not stellar like Secret Pizza in Cosmo.  Would be way overpriced in real world. But, given it's in casino, it is acceptable."}
{"text":"Best Pizza In Vegas with 2 negative - they almost never have ice. As locals we come enjoy the pizza regularly because it is spectacular, but they never have ice so the drinks are always warm. A warm drink in Las Vegas is the last thing you want.  Learn to carry ice and your reviews will increase drastically."}
{"text":"This was located in the hard rock hotel. The food was fresh and delicious! The slice was huge!!! The place was a little small but we'll put together for the size. The employees were not unfriendly they just were not overly friendly. Overall I would come back"}
{"text":"Looking at all the wonderful reviews made my jaw drop in disbelief!!  My husband and I went there for lunch today for a couple of slices.  They must've dumped an entire salt shaker in the sauce because this pizza was SO salty it was disgusting.   If it wasn't for the salt-overload, the pizza would've been very good.  We normally only go to Sunset Pizza on Boulder Hwy which is the BEST but we were in the area today running errands and decided to try out this new place...Lose the salt guys--or you will lose business.  The servers were friendly so no complaints there."}
{"text":"Yes, I love pizza.  So, I'm not very biased. This was incredible pizza. Had a slice of Roman mushroom spinach-crazy crispy awesome!  My other option is Joes. No walkie for me."}
{"text":"I did not like this place. I just left the spa and I just wanted to grab something quick. I figure how can anyone mess up pizza. And I was wrong, the it was not cooked well at all. Won't go there again"}
{"text":"Perfect place to go for a quick inexpensive snack especially after you've been drinking all day at the pool and don't feel like sitting down at a restaurant. Got the basic pepperoni and sausage!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. It's in the Hard Rock casino, tucked in between some other businesses. The pizza slices are huge! If you are hungry, this is the place to be. It's really small with only a few tables, but it's easy to grab a slice to go.   They have some pizzas out that you can choose from. You tell them what you want and they put it in the oven to crisp it up. When it comes out, it is very fresh and delicious. It's a New York style thin crust pizza. We just had a couple of slices from the pizzas that were already made, but I'm sure they can accommodate and make a pizza to your liking if you don't see what you want.   The price isn't too bad, about what you would expect to pay for a place in a major casino/hotel.   I will come back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick bite without having to wait. Figured pizza is always an easy choice while on the go in a casino when having some drinks.   The restaurant is small like a hallway but again I just needed a grab n go meal. Saw the pizzas under the heat lamps. There were several choices like classic cheese, pepperoni, meats, veggie, Hawaiian etc. The slices are big with a decent crust, not chewy but thin enough to fold over.  Light sauce and lots of toppings. I do really wish it was a lot warmer though. Even throwing it in the oven for a few minutes would have made a big difference for me. Generous toppings compensated for lack of heat - but it needed to be hotter to at least mask the illusion of being fresh.  For about $6 it's an easy quickie or possibly a meal if you aren't too hungry. Staff was polite and speedy."}
{"text":"AWESOME new little pizza joint in the Hard Rock. It's open late, the Italian sausage with peppers and pizza were both awesome! The service was quick and everyone was super friendly. Not to mention the prices were fair considering we were in a casino. I spend so much at the Hard Rock so I will definitely be stopping in here regularly. I am only giving 4 stars because I wish it was opened later than 1 AM."}
{"text":"Good prices by the slice ($5-6.25). New York styled pies with lots of flavor. Go easy on the jalapeños. They're the spicy kind!"}
{"text":"Please clean out your oven!!!!! Whatever your employees burned in there was under my slice of pizza. Like little pieces of charcoal. It made the whole slice smell and taste a bit like it was burnt. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"I love pizza and I love these guys!  They saved us last saturday, we had 20 extra crew show up at the salon last minute and I thought of Pizza Forte first.  We gotta feed everyone, they were super quick to put together 4 pizzas all different flavors and everyone was happy. My favorite is the cheese and they have desert too. The staff is friendly and quick. Thank you Pizza Forte :)"}
{"text":"Dear sweet baby Jesus!!! I mean wow, really good pie. I mean I've had good pizza but this is a place that you should give a chance. Its tucked away in the Sunset Station Casino and totally worth driving across the city for. I have to rank this in my top 3 places in Las Vegas along side Pizza Rock and  Brooklyn Pizzeria. Seriously do yourself a favor and get a slice or an entire pizza cause its out of this world. Make sure you get a fresh piece cause its crazy good!!! If I could give them 10 stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Forte opened just over a week ago in a small spot in the Hard Rock Hotel.  Owned by Mimmo Ferraro, It's obvious that their forte is pizza--New York Style sold by the slice or one can order a custom 14\" or 18\" pizza.  They also sell hot dogs, meatballs, and cannoli, filled when ordered and not pre-filled like most places.  Four of us had dinner at Ferraro's Italian across Paradise from the Hard Rock and after stuffing ourselves silly there, we decided to walk over to the HRH and try the new pizza place.  Not being a large consumer of pizza, I do know good pizza when I have it.  I've had enough life experience in New York and Las Vegas to have tried a lot of different pizzas.  I had a slice with sausage and pepperoni.  The toppings were just the right amount, the cheese was quite good, and the crust was browned just right.  I somewhat folded the large slice and scarfed it down in a short time.   Excellent!  While I usually don't get NY style pizza often, I know that they're doing a great product.  The dining room is shaped like a small L.  Entering from the casino, you walk past some tables here and there and reach the counter with a large Order Here sign and you can see the pre-made pies under heat lamps.  Then pay at the cashier and you're all set to try some of  the best pizza in Las Vegas.  If Pizza Forte was closer to where I lived, I'd be there more often.  At it is, the few times I'm at the Hard Rock, this is a very enticing option for quick, solid food."}
{"text":"Pizza Forte. The name sounds like it's directly challenging Secret Pizza. Pizza FORTE!  It's not really competing. This is the greasy pizza place you stumble to during a show break at the Vinyl. That's exactly what I did, minus the stumblings. I started my drinking at PIzza Forte. Hard Rock has Goose IPA everywhere and this place was no exception. Beer will cost you around $7 bucks. Hey, at least it isn't the $10 inside the Vinyl. I only figured out the price when I gave the bartender a ten and never got change back...  Which pizza did I get? Greasy and meaty. Perfectly hits that carb spot. It's also the easiest to order when you only hear ringing in your ear. MEEEEEAT PIZZA! I'm sure there will be many more encounters with ol Pizza Forte."}
{"text":"The pizza at Pizza Forte is so good!!  I've said it on every review of a pizza place I've done: I'm a huge pizza lover so pizza has to be incredible for me to like it! Pizza Forte has very delicious pizza. It's some of my favorite pizza in Las Vegas.  My faves are pepperoni & ricotta and the spinach white pizza they do. The environment is a small cafe inside a casino so it's not the most pleasant dining experience, but it's the Hard Rock hotel - put your pizza on a paper plate and go walk around!"}
{"text":"Parents, put your kids to bed.  Its about to get nasty up in here.  I came to Pizza Forte for lunch after seeing a movie one holiday Monday.  I had passed by ealier in the day but it was too early and Pizza Forte wasn't open yet but I could smell the pizza baking. And it was good. A couple of hours later it was open and lunch was on.  I went with the daily special of two slices of one topping pie and a soda for $8.50.  These slices of pepperoni were each big enough to qualify as two slices.  That gave me the equivilant of four slices of pizza.  I was over the moon when I saw the delicious New York Style pieces completely covering my plate.  It was thin, crispy, chewy, cheesy and greasy.  I folded my slices in half and watched that red sexy grease drip between my fingers, down my wrist and nearly to my elbow.  Then I got down and dirty.  I wrapped my mouth around this newly formed pizza taco and felt my teeth sink into the mozzarella.  I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on the pizza and plate.  It soaked up the grease on the plate which made it perfect to sop up with the remaining bites of crust.  It felt so wrong yet so right.  I was almost embarassed to be seen in public.  Was it healthy?  Hell no.  One does not eat sexy greasy pizza for their health.  One eats this pizza for the sinful indulgence."}
{"text":"Pretty standard pizza with steep prices.  It's a decent option at the Hard Rock and also offers room service.  My mushroom and sausage slice satisfied a craving with a thin but not NY thin crust and a pretty thin spread of sauce.  Not bad but definitely not something I wold go out of the way for.  A pie will run about $24+ and a slice about $5."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Not cheap alot of different slices to choose from. A walk up and grab a slice type of place, which is cool when just want to grab some food and go back to your room."}
{"text":"Pizza Forte, the perfect open-late lobby restaurant for the intoxicated ones that are searching for something greasy to soak up the alcohol. Pizza Forte is simply a reheat in the oven type restaurant. You go in, pick the slice of pizza you desire and they'll warm it up in the oven for you. I'm sure the pizza is made fresh that day, I just don't know when. I ordered the Hawaiian slice and it was somewhat acceptable after a few Gin & Tonics at the bar. The crust was a bit tougher than I would like but like I said, it's the best option in the hotel after 12:00am. Perhaps the more you drink the better it'll taste. The price is around $6-7 dollars per slice depending on the amount of toppings. This price point is pretty common for a slice in Las Vegas. I might revisit Pizza Forte depending on how desperate I am next time. It's definitely not my first option if other restaurants are still open."}
{"text":"Wow, I haven't tasted a pie like that since I lived in Brooklyn. Hats off . When I come back to Vegas I defiantly stop here again for Pizza."}
{"text":"After drinking some cocktails it was time for some pizza. You walk in stand in line, order the pizza slices you want, pay and find a seat. Small place with. It much seating but good pizza. They also deliver to your room if you would like.   Pepperoni - straight out the oven. Very good and cheesy. Can you really go wrong with a classic.   Veggiterian - all the veggies on bread with cheese all over it. How can you not eat your veggies. Good and tasty.   Spinach & Ricotta - now this was amazing. Great tasting pizza with the spinach cooked in to the pizza and the fresh ricotta cheese just oozing at every bite. Definitely a must try and would get it again.   For a late night snack/meal give this place a try. Pizza is always a good thing."}
{"text":"It was worst service I ever experienced in a restaurant.  The staff was rude and not helpful at all.  We went to the place where it said \"Order Here\" and said we wanted to order a pizza to go.  The guy pointed to the cashier and said go over there in a rude tone.  The cashier was no friendlier.  We were told 10 minutes for the pizza and it took 25 minutes.  We live in Las Vegas and go to the Hard Rock every weekend.  We will never to to Pizza Forte again!!"}
{"text":"I love love love pizza but I do not recommend wasting your money here. The pizza is super thin, extremely salty and expensive for what you're getting. I will be skipping this place next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Well I have to say, we ended up here late at night, very hungry and not expecting much.  I'd already hit a more popular pizza spot nearby ( way earlier in the day) and honestly I wouldn't even compare the two.   They have the big slices here; but we decided to order a whole pizza and everyone just split it.  It was piping hot and delicious, great chewy crust, not overly cheesy or greasy... and the sauce was very nicely spiced.   Probably was my favorite thing I'd eaten on this whole trip, and the fact it was in the hotel lobby where we stayed was really convenient.  Next time instead of the hassle of finding parking on the strip for pizza not nearly as good, we'll be coming here for sure.   Only problem is, it's a tiny little spot with not much seating so you either have to hope to be quick to get a table or take it up to your room.  Luckily we got a table right before the place filled up to capacity and then some."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but if I can't have a cup of water with a $5 slice than your policies suck."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is located inside Sunset Casino not too far from the movie theater. I wanted a quick bite to eat before the movie, but didn't want popcorn or hot dogs. There was a daily special for 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $8.99. Not bad. So I picked 2 pepperoni slices and a Pepsi. There's a decent seating area and a condiment section with jalepenos, onions, banana peppers, ketchup, relish, tomatoes, mayo, and mustard. I'm sure it's because the Pizza Forte place has hot dogs too. Service was fast and the pizza is ok, but at least the slice was big and hot. Keep in mind, it's more of a food court style pizza shop than a fancy sit down spot. Just a quick grab and go pizza place."}
{"text":"Wow - wasn't expecting to find one of the most delicious pizzas I've had in a long time inside the Sunset Station casino!  Impressed.  Prices aren't too bad for what you get.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for the first time in search of great pizza and I wasn't disappointed! The pizza was very very greasy but that's a given with cheese- I give it three stars because the employees were horrifically ignorant and rude(and really young). I walked up and was not greeted nor asked what I had wanted. When I told them what I wanted, the teenage girl put the slice in the oven without saying a word to me and continued talking to her male coworker. When the pizza was done the male worker boxed it up and told me my total(kind of pricey for just a slice) and that was the only thing that was said to me. Even after he handed me the pizza I tried telling him to have a good day and he proceeded to turn around and talk to the female coworker. This company definitely needs new and more respectful workers."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for a quick snack while in the Hard Rock Casino. Though the pizza is a little overpriced, it is very delicious. The slice size is decent and the dough is very crispy. They have a variety of toppings and a wide selection available by the slice."}
{"text":"This pizza place is so yummy! New York style, fancy soda machines, homemade desserts. Salad is really good.   Their hot dogs are also famous here & they have a little bar to stash some peppers, pickles, sauces, you name it. I'm a freak over pickles so I got a cup just a la carte for myself lol  Also the very thing I'm obsessed over in this place is the pistachio dessert. It's like a more firm pudding pie adorned with an almond crust & topping, it was delicious. I actually had it for breakfast & it was just perfect.   I would give this place 5 stars but the only thing was that the pizza has to be eaten fresh. If it is, great. I brought it up to my hotel, did a few things, & it was cold even in a covered box. It was great reheated but the thin crust can't last too long. Also the entire place ran out of forks so I had to go next door to find one & I was so tired, lol. Here I thought pizza would be the lesser chore.   But the food was good & in a place full of metropolitan blitz it's really nice to have a Mom n Pop feel to the casino. What a great night in."}
{"text":"I come to the Hard Rock twice a week for work and I can't stay away from this place. Their pizza is reminiscent of classic NY style. Extra large slices with thin, perfectly done crust. I love the variety they offer and their service is always friendly and fast! If you're ever anywhere near the Hard Rock and crazing pizza this is your place!"}
{"text":"Eu não sou muito fã de pizza aqui nos Estados Unidos, mas esta pizzaria é muito boa! Eu experimentei uns 4 diferentes sabores e não posso reclamar de nada... é muito muito bom mesmo! Eu estou viciada nestas pizzas!"}
{"text":"Place sucks. Only person working was the guy running the oven. The manager was over in the sport bet room. I can get pizza cheaper and better else where."}
{"text":"Such a great hidden gem here.   Pizza, drinks and service are all good.   If you want some pizza that's very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I love pizza here, thin crust and heavy on the toping, I love the one that is like Hawaiian with jalapeño, every time we came here at Hardrock, I gotta have it."}
{"text":"My husband and I were running late for a Megadeth concert at The Joint and needed food fast. Pizza Forte was really the only option that fit the bill on the premises of the Hard Rock. It's a small restaurant with a cramped layout and filled with all the carbs you could dream of. I went with a square Sicilian piece and my dude chose a caprese wrap. The tab came to the extremely reasonably price of $14  (considering it's inside a casino and all).   The staff warmed up my pizza in the oven, but when I received my pizza it just looked like a brick of old dried out pizza. It was mediocre in every sense of the word. My husband was happier with his wrap. Pizza Forte definitely wasn't our first choice, but it got the job done and didn't break the bank. Affordability and convenience are key here.

{"text":"Items Selected: Pepperoni Slice Roman Slice All Beef Hotdog Cannoli  Recently opened in Henderson, but already spawning a second location much closer to the family's eponymous home base, it was at the recommendation of father Gino that our party of four jogged across Paradise to visit Mimmo at Pizza Forte in the Hard Rock Hotel, and with Pantera playing loudly as we walked through the lobby it would not be long before the younger Ferraro greeted us warmly, every seat in the house filled as a steady stream of clubbers and concert goers filtered through for fresh slices from the electric oven and hotdogs the team will tell you are the best in town.  Already a hot-spot just six days into operation, the team turning out hand-tossed pies as needed into the wee hours of the night, Pizza Forte inhabits a shotgun space adjacent Nobu near the entrance to Rehab and with a short menu of Americana classics at expected Strip prices the effect of top-tier ingredients is immediately evident even before sinking teeth into the product, each slice glistening atop white marble while dogs, kielbasa, and sausages from Hofmann are presented on grilled rolls with a variety of condiments offered self-serve.  Opting for two slices of pie, plus an all-beef dog that was snappy and slightly smoky even as a naked frank, Forte quickly enters discussion as the city's best 'slice,' for although a touch oily as compared to that at Pop-Up at the Plaza the semolina infused crust is substantially more crispy without the slightest bit of charring, a remarkable feat that only serves to bolster the acid from a hand-crushed tomato sauce.  Equally impressed by a puffy Roman slice, the mozzarella's creaminess far more notable without pepperoni as diced tomatoes and shredded basil added  texture plus a mellow herbal tinge, it was with a single cannoli that a favorable opinion of Forte was further cemented, the crisp shell filled to order with airy ricotta straight from the refrigerator with a steep price of $5.00 similar to that of Buddy's version at Carlo's Bakery, but without all the pre-filled sog and hour-plus wait.  Obviously expensive compared to the slice shops sprinkled around Manhattan, but featuring a much higher quality product that most, Pizza Forte seems poised to mint money given its fanciful location - particularly considering the late night concert crowd and lack of other grab n' go options within the Hard Rock Hotel."}
{"text":"Ran into this stop while waiting to go to a concert at the Vinyl space.    Walked in a seemed like a cute hole in the wall spot at the Hard Rock. I didn't know what to order from reading the menu, but when I saw the veggie pizza laying out, I had to get it.   They popped it right in the brick oven then waited for it to be ready. I payed then asked the lady for the water cup. She then forgot after I paid. It wasn't a big deal so then my friend asked and got me a water instead.   The pizza tasted ok. Not too fresh, wish they had more of a hot sauce option besides chili flakes. It's an okay option, but not my first option while thinking of places to eat at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but very greasy. The customer service was super friendly. I got half pepperoni and half pineapple. It was delicious but too much grease."}
{"text":"They honestly cant get phone orders correctly.  If you're gunna order room service just order somewhere else. Little Caesars has more of their sh*t together then these guys do.    *Thanks for the free ranch Rosie *Poor customer service."}
{"text":"After a crazy night on the Vegas crawl, I went and got a sliced of bacon pepperoni pizza from here. Sadly I regretted in the morning  I don't know what happened but my stomach was like \"hellllllll nahhhh girl what you doing\" I'm not sure but it looked so good!"}
{"text":"Wanted lunch and hubs wanted a meatball sandwich. You can't take the Italian out of him. I called the Pizza Forte in the Sunset Hotel where we were staying and, luckily, they had one. I've never heard of Pizza Forte but we decided to give it a try. Easier to not get the car out of valet and leave the hotel and the hotel offers so many different restaurant choices.   You smell the pizza sauce and feel the heat coming around the corner before you see the restaurant. We were feeling more hopeful. They have a big pizza oven that blasts out hot air (warming the over air conditioned food court nicely) for Napoleon thin crust pizzas that you can order a whole pizza made of different toppings! Nice touch.   The funny thing is they also have Hoffmann sausages and hot dogs which looked good when others came by with them. They say they are \"hand-crafted\" hot dogs in natural casings\" and were popular in New York City and made in Syracuse but now made in Wisconsin (I guess, is a big deal to those who love the brand).   We both ordered the meatball sub. Hubs got a root beer and I just filled my water bottle. We were shocked to see them come out. They were huge! I didn't measure but it was well over 7 inches with 4 meatballs. Mine had the standard mozzarella cheeses but my husband chose no cheese (he hates melted cheese??)  There is a topping bar with jalapeño and pepperoncini slices, the whole friggitelli peppers. They also had the onions, sauerkraut and relish for the hot dogs.   The roll of the sub had a nice crust with tender inside. The sauce was nice. The meatballs were nice and soft as well. The flavor was nice-not great or a lot of flavor-but hubs finishes his and I ate a bit over half-so, obviously, we liked it enough. I did put pepperoncini on mine to kick up the spice. They had crushed red peppers also on the topping bar that we saw some diners use.   We would definitely return if we stayed here again. I may try the pizza slice as they looked good too. Definitely try Pizza Forte when you come to the Sunset Hotel and Casino."}
{"text":"We ordered their pizza after watching a concert on the premises. We were starving and wanted something quick. They closed at 10pm on a Sunday night, so we actually rushed out ahead of time to make it there before closing. We ordered a whole 18\" pepperoni and sausage pizza. There were two workers; a young guy and girl. The guy originally told us that it would be 30 minutes for the pizza, but the girl told us 15 minutes, which it actually was.   We were right about the crowd... As we waited for our pizza, more and more people showed up with the same idea. Some people ordered ahead with an app or online. Others just got slices or ordered whole pizzas like we did. If you order a slice, they pop it into the oven for a bit to warm it, even though ready-made pizzas sit under the heat lamps.   Customer service was pretty good. No complaints, there. This was our first time eating here and the pizza was good. It was hot, the slices were big; when you order, you can choose if you want 6, 8, or 12 slices. It wasn't the best pizza in the world, but it was good and it definitely hit the spot late at night."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza! I work inside the Hard Rock, so I eat at Pizza Forte pretty often and it's consistently fast and delicious. The staff is really friendly and accommodating. I usually order plain cheese but my favorite is the one with spinach and ricotta. Also, their slices are huge!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. We were staying at the Hard Rock and wanted a late night bite to eat without having to get dressed up. Pizza Forte was the perfect fix! We ordered a slice of pepperoni, a slice of pepperoni + mushroom, and a slice of spinach ricotta. I'm a huge dessert person, so of course I had to try the pistachio pudding. It was good, but not amazing. Daniella and Mariana were the girls who helped us - both were awesome! Great personalities and very helpful (I asked their names so that I could Yelp about them)! Check this place out if you want some great service and delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 1/2. How do you not have any chicken for the chicken salad? Lol. Other than that, I thought that the selections of pizza that they had were awesome! And to top it off they are gluten free! Although the prices are not too bad, they do run a little on the higher side of the $ zone. Out of all the places inside the Hardrock Hotel, this was the only place that we found that was kid friendly and on the cheap side. Thanks for the great pizza though!"}
{"text":"Really new at hard rock so i expect high quality.  Nope, walked in and saw the most disgusting dried out pizza ive ever seen. Asked the guy how long it had been out, and he just chuckled . So on the way out the classy young lady at the register yells out \"you dont have to eat here\". No kidding, Einstein,  thats why im walking out. Ive seen fresher meat in a morgue. Stay away, food is old and nasty by 10pm."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza I've ever eaten, twice. I had a slice a few months ago that was also terrible, but I thought it may have been a bad day for them.  I got another slice that looked so yummy that I brought it home, even though I had eaten an hour earlier.  I threw half of the pizza in the trash and I will never recommend it. I thought Domino's was bad..."}
{"text":"Love the pizza but they need to get the ice in the soda machine under control. In the past 3 months we've come here after a concert (so after 10pm) the soda machine NEVER and I mean NEVER has ice!!"}
{"text":"Soggy pizza and the guy at the counter tried to keep my change. We would not go back nor suggest to anyone.   Man at the counter put my change in his tip bowl and as I held my hand out asks you wanted your change? Um, YES! What would make anyone just assume he can tip himself with my money? Unforgivable. Since the food wasn't good at all, we don't have to worry about going back here"}
{"text":"Great tasting slices for a reasonable price in a resort. I recommend the spinach ricotta. Staff could be nicer."}
{"text":"`A nice quick serve option if you need a bite before heading to Center Bar.  There is an Everything slice on the menu which they didn't have so that was disappointing! I had to settle for a Sicilian slice with a few toppings and then dump some extras on it from the toppings bar (which is for hot dogs I think) but that didn't stop me! I added bacon & tomatoes and who remembers what else from that bar and made my own Everything slice. The pizza was pretty tasty and if you're impatient like me, offers instant gratification! Isn't that fitting for the Hard Rock??"}
{"text":"The pizza I had was a bit below average, hence the 2 star rating.  It was not fresh, the grease was too heavy on top, and the toppings were just not up to par.  Maybe I got a bad selection but I wish I had only taken 1 cheese slice instead of 2 with toppings so I could be done sooner.  If you're a big fan of pizza like I am, you will want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pizza here is AMAZING, Rosie took incredible care of me while I was there and she kept me laughing the whole time! Highly recommend!!!"}
