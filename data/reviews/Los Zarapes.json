{"text":"I just love this place!  It's tucked away at the Eastwood Shopping Center off of Rt. 47 (it recently moved from its original location to a few storefronts down.) I've rarely had such warm, prompt, friendly service or such good food.    I always order the veggie fajitas, and they arrive sizzling and delicious. They include not only the usual onions and peppers, but broccoli,  cauliflower, and other sauteed veggies, with a bean, guacamole and tomato side.  They also have my favorite Jarritto's Mexican soda in every flavor-perfect to wash it all down with. I'm a larger woman so I appreciate the roomy and comfortable booths.  The only item on the menu I'm a bit less enthusiastic about is their guacamole-it's made perfectly but it always tastes like they used avocodos that aren't quite ripe.  Other than that, I'd have to give this great little restaurant a 10!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Ice cold beer in frozen mugs was awesome. Food was delicious too. Wide variety on the menu and warm, fresh chips with your salsa. I think Yelp has the wrong address. It's in the Eastwood Plaza just off I-74, not on Eastwood Drive."}
{"text":"Family owned business, excellent customer service and delicious food at a reasonable price!  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant. Can't believe we waited so long.  This was not your cookie cutter Mexican restaurant.  I had a chicken dish that was excellent.  Light and flavorful.   My husband had the chimichanga and enjoyed it also commenting that the rice was very good.  The prices were very reasonable. Can't wait to come back and try their margaritas   This looks nothing like the family restaurant there before.  Very nice decor"}
{"text":"Last month while visiting my daughter and her family, we went to this restaurant. The food was wonderful, priced very good and the service was top notch. I can hardly wait to go again this weekend when I go to visit my daughter again!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here since they first opened. It has been an absolute delight. The food is delicious, always served piping hot very quickly. The staff is wonderful, very friendly. They've become like a second family to us. The interior recently had an update and looks very nice. Give this place a shot; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OK - we did not challenge the culinary capabilities of this restaurant.  We were on a quick run to Bloomington airport from Champaign.  BUT a quick enchilada and beans was everything it was supposed to be.  Service was functional, but we were only there for fifteen minutes tops.  I'd like to go back sometime and try some of the entrees."}
{"text":"We are regulars in this place now. Before we hit the point of our family being recognized by the amazing staff, we were always treated extremely friendly, fast service, accurate orders and extremely fresh food. Example of service: we had a to go order one night 5 minutes from closing and they ran out of lettuce. Despite being the last customer in there, they ran next door to IGA and got lettuce and threw in an extra giant bag of chips for the bit of extra wait time. 

Chips are almost always fresh, occasionally overdone but that is few and far between. The food is always superb and my favorite dish to get is the Molcajete. So much food, incredibly tasty sauce, presentation is a real WOW. 

Overall, their dishes seem a less \"Americanized\" than some of the other Mexican places in CU, with the fact that not everything is smothered in 2 inches of cheese or drowned in salt. 

Definite little gem here in Mahomet and worth the trip out."}
{"text":"Yes! I have finally found a Mexican restaurant that is comparable to back home. Chips and salsa were good. The chips were fresh. The queso dip was good as well. For my lunch I ordered a chicken chimichanga which came with rice, beans and pico de gallo which was nice because around here I have found that most places do not serve rice with your meal. The servers were friendly and attentive. The place was clean. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Greeter could care less. I think she was 12. Margaritas were hot and tasted like there was no tequila in it. And apparently it takes 30 minutes to make one cheese quesadilla. Not impressed at all. Waiter was nice I guess."}
