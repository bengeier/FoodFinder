{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place for lunch. We visited the nearby EggSmart too many times whenever we came to this neighbourhood, and know what to expect. This one was a very pleasant surprise. Food was 4/5, typical diner food, I'd say above average execution. But everything supposed to be hot is super hot, included heated plate, which was a nice touch. Service was very attentive, 5/5, given the place was only half full, so it might have helped. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My son was nagging me to eat ASAP. The other reviews were of the extreme (either very good or very bad).   Since we were in a rush, and the place wasn't busy (11am) we decided  to give it a try. We all ordered from the breakfast menu.   Pros: 1) friendly and tentative waitress (but place was not very busy).  2) coffee is decent 3) good parking options available (for the area)   Cons: 1) limited options. No poached eggs, no turkey sausages and turkey bacon, no apple juice. Only the basic offerings.  2) torn seats and a general feel of neglect.  3) \"home fries\" not typical. More like bland slices of potatoes.   Synopsis: Food quality and taste was okay. However I would never intentionally return."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here since I was under age and we used to pop by for a few drinks and Karaoke....a long long time ago. Now, I feel as though I've been transported to Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmare's, I can't shake the English accent and the only thing keeping me laughing is the stories my son is telling us about his outdoor camp he's returned from. We ordered as described on the menu...  1. French fries 2. Mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce. 3. 28 oven baked wings, medium.  French fries arrived and they looked like shards of cardboard with some ugly and discustingly tasting garnish on them. The Heinz ketchup wasn't Heinz at all but some topped up crap, and the malt vinegar tasted like shit.  Mozzarella sticks came, all 5 of them for $10.95, kids bit into them and said they had a strange taste, I suggested they try the marinara even though it looked chunky, my kids kept trying to dip them but the mozzarella sticks kept bouncing off the top, I place my fork in only to find it was a small container of FROZEN salsa, discusting.  Now, the piece de la resistance...WINGS. They arrived, big, very big in fact, however something looked wrong as a clear juice collected on the plate, they had grill mark's but noting to indicate Medium wings at all. My wife was the first to take a bite and the look on her face said it all, I looked at my son and burst out laughing thinking about the terrible food he had while camping and this was suppose to be\"The good meal\" upon his return. I ate one, then another and fought to eat one last one before tapping out, thank god for alcohol. From what I could see that had been boiled in water and thown on a grill, no taste what so ever, well in fact whatever taste there was was very displeasing to the pallet. Even the waitress kept walking by and looking at the table, but at the end wouldn't even ask if we enjoyed the meal...NOT! I really wanted to say something but my wife asked that I not, pay the bill and go home for leftovers.   Well in fact, this is the longest review I have ever done, but this is more a warning to others not to eat hear unless you are training for Fear Factor.  Bill with tip came to around $90. With tip, wasn't her fault, but wouldn't return. I'm also being forced to give a star when in fact there shouldn't be one at all."}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience. Visited with my two children before a hockey game. Food was terribly slow (while the regulars that came later are almost half finished) and nothing special (we ordered breakfast). So, no tip - it happens when you don't deliver.  Blonde server proceeds to bad mouth me to the \"regulars\" who are now engaged in name calling me on the other table.   Wolf down our food as we have to leave. \"Regulars\" wait for us and confront me calling me names (as my children looked on) and actively being encouraged by the server - who is looking for some type of twisted revenge (aka a real fight).    No excuse for a server providing this kind of \"service\".  A drinking hole, yes. Family place, absolutely not."}
{"text":"Came strictly here for the Friday karaoke and was not disappointed. The place filled up quite fast after 10 (which is when karaoke starts) and the regulars were killing it with the song choices. Most songs were from the 70s or 80s as the group was an older crowd. But man was it hilarious. Love it!   Can't say much about the food, but I'd come back just for the karaoke! Gotta love the crazy people at this place -- a bunch of characters that's for sure."}
