{"text":"This shit looks Nasty. I will never ever eat at this place .. I didn't know Japanese restaurants serve pizza and Texas toast along with Mexican foods..smh"}
{"text":"The interior was nice.  Lots of people but no wait. Plenty of sitting.  I felt the buffet was average. I was disappointed with the steam fish with soy sauce it was dry and rubbery.  But the person who prepared my vegetables did a good job.  

The server and price was good.  ."}
{"text":"This is my go to buffet in Charlotte. Well that and it's ten minutes away. Many food selection here, waitstaff is nice and clean up quickly so that plates don't pile up. The food tastes better than most buffets I've been to. The sushi is good; no fresh seafood in Charlotte and I'm from Hawaii but it was pretty good quality. I LOVE their green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Very fresh.......however the customer service and cleanliness was awful. The price is inflated and the add gratuity plus tax to every bill. I reserved the party room which is not private but was very crowded and noisey. There was a $40 charge to hold the room and it is required for large parties over 10. Kun the manager seemed unable to control the large environment. I will not return.....and while several others (whom were not with my party) complained as well........so I know it wasn't just me and my high standards!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Chinese buffet I've been to.  If you're doubting me, then take a look at my profile picture.  The ingredients are better quality that most buffets and there is a large variety.  Their sushi is amazing (I was expecting buffet quality) and their hibachi grill is pretty good too."}
{"text":"First time at this buffet and was pleasantly surprised at the huge selection of food available. I don't think I've ever seen a buffet so big with as much variety. We were a party of 8 and although they were really busy, we were sat right away and everyone was able to find plenty to eat. The lunch price was unbelievable especially considering the amount of choices of food. The servers were very attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and decent service. However, 10 minutes after leaving the restaurant my fianc√©e realized she forgot her fleece Columbia jacket in her chair. I called the restaurant back to please ask the waitress if she picked it up. I could hear the waitress acting like she didn't know what a jacket was. Good food, but not really a fan of dishonest people. $10 tip and a new fleece Columbia jacket? She must be happy. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Worst place ever for food service don't waste your time or money.The staff does not understand when you want something specific. The food was horrible main dishes were cold and sushi was hard and old. Hibachi grill wasn't very clean and the bathrooms smelled like hard urine. Please don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese buffet, although this is currently my parent's favorite place to go. They do have a lot of selections, but I feel its just mediocre. The place is huge and the parking lot is always pack. I feel this place is a little dirty and the sushi is just okay. The only thing I like from here is the fried crab and coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"This buffet is as good as it gets for the money.  Is it a 5 star restaurant?  No... but for a $10 all inclusive dinner or $7 lunch it is hard to beat.  The sushi selection is better at night although they rarely change the items.  I tried this place after Fuse closed (which had started more expensive but much better and slowly lowered prices and quality).

The staff is extremely attentive, and the hibachi is top notch (for a buffet), even has raw eggs you can add.

So all in all it is exactly what I expected.  I great BUFFET for your money.  IMO it is even better then the new one by concord mills. (cannot remember the name)

If you are expecting the higher quality food of a true sushi restaurant or Japanese steakhouse this is not the place, but I think it would be hard to find a better price/quality buffet."}
{"text":"My experience here with Tokyo Buffet has been all positive. Especially their selection of sushi available at this price point of restaurant. Yes, I'm sure there's a bigger and better sushi buffet available in Charlotte. But one gets typically what they pay for and this is certainly a bargain.

The typical Chinese / Asian food items were are just that - typical. Nothing outstanding, but certainly still good. Like many other reviews here, I did not try the American food items offered. Does not make sense to me to eat these while in a Oriental food place."}
{"text":"We just ate here tonight. The sushi buffet was great with an ample selection of raw, cooked, and non-fish rolls.  The salad bar was great with mixed greens, eggs, fruit, etc.  My favorite had to be the choice of various seafood dishes. I only wish there was a greater vegetable dish selection on the buffet--broccoli mix, green beans, and mushrooms only. 

The dinner price is excellent and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, they have ten tables of food to choose from and hibachi and sushi on top of that!"}
{"text":"Food be bomb, but gaaaaahhh damn it put me on the toilet my G . I almost died in that b*tch."}
{"text":"i love this place really good, really clean,not to expensive,and food taste great .come here all the time."}
{"text":"3 stars at best. Average chinese + honky food with some sushi thrown in. The food is your very typical buffet fare. Unfortunately to get my moneys worth i tried eating a bunch of their sashimi (tuna and salmon) and cherries to get my moneys worth. No oysters or crab legs. The cold shrimp looked pale and dead. The mussels were disgusting- dethawed watery mess. This place doesnt pop. I do admire the workers- at closing time they go full blown worker bee mode cleaning the restaurant- floors, windows, etc then they all (literally every single worker 15 or so) cram into this van that comes by to take em to a group home im guessing. Im assuming its some work for your visa deal. They work hard for the money so tip em well. This place is in the ghetttooo and food is not memorable in the least so i dont think im coming back."}
{"text":"Tokyo Grill is our go to restaurant. This is a huge restaurant. They offer a huge variety of food. Love the sushi! The service is excellent. The quality of the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"This is my new sushi spot!!!!! Great place for the entire family. We Had a great time. Very large selection on the buffet bar, salad bar, sushi bar and desert bar. Fresh sushi mouth watering good!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The food and service it's great,I enjoyed my self nice atmosphere I recommend anyone to check it out. If you go before 3:00pm the rates are lower!!!"}
{"text":"I went once a few weeks ago and it was some of the worst food ever. I tried everything but the habatchi station. The only thing I liked was the dumplings and they were just okay"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great variety and it is very fresh since they have incredible volume. But the place is clean and seats hundreds...usually no wait timw. They have a hibachi grill and sushi too. I love this joint!"}
{"text":"This is far from being authentic Chinese food. It's just ok for a buffet.
I went with friends - I will never go again for the taste and price to me not worth it. But they were friendly and took good care of us. The taste of the food was just not that great."}
{"text":"I love chinese food and buffets...this place is not bad, but not great either...the good: pepper steak, hot and sour soup, sushi, bbq ribs, fried sauteed shrimp, fried squid...they may have the best carbonated drinks of all chinese buffets (enough fizz and mix of syrup)...the bad: the fried rice (absolutely no or bland taste)...how hard can it be to get this right...fried crab (just too small, isn't it illegal to catch and sell miniture crabs...doesn't it have to be a certain size...where is PETA on this)...the crawfish (its the sauce that's the problem, too thick, slimey)...the fried chicken was too fried (wasn't moist, just dry)...the servers (some male servers somewhat arrogant)...I must've been there at most five times since it opened...haven't been there in a while...just better choices out there...up the block :)"}
{"text":"I must admit buffets are usually not my first pick. The atmosphere is not the best. The food is, as expected, not the freshest. The restaurant is very crowded and sometimes little kids may not understand sanitary expectations and pick stuff up with their hands and other little things like that. The dessert section is a hotspot for little kids, so personally I avoid it. A lot of the food in itself isn't my favorite. The service is good for a buffet though. Overall it's a good place to take the family on a budget but, not the first pick."}
{"text":"Nothing short of an amazing experience. Amazing food with a wide variety, fresh sushi, and friendly staff. You won't find a better meal for $9!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  Great food, great people!  Keep up the good work and promise to not to eventually lower the food quality like a lot of buffets do.  I would much rather pay a few dollars more and keep the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Tokyo grill and buffet for 3 months now. Mostly salad and salmon but the juicy roast beef and the sushi will keep me coming back. Every kind of shrimp dish, Bubba and Forrest Gump would be proud. Believe it or not with all that the people are relaxed, friendly and the waitresses are great too. I will try the hibachi grill made to order next."}
{"text":"Fatal, i had another perspective about buffets, grease meats, old and raw fishes... and it wasn't sushi.. and if we talk about the sushi no taste at all..I decided to go this place cause was close to my hotel, but definitively I should effort myself better looking for a place  to eat...now I understand why is so cheap!!!! But I think for the quality of food this restaurant is really expensive. Never again  ( go to a buffet restaurant)"}
{"text":"This place has so much selection it would be hard for even someone picky to not find something. Good price and you definitely get plenty to eat! Everything I tried was good and fresh And hot! Sushi bar is amazing I've never seen such a section! Will be coming back soon. Good sweet tea too:)"}
{"text":"So I was in Charlotte over the weekend and before heading back to Atlanta, my brother's family and my family decided on Asian buffet. It's cheaper, more variety, and kid friendly. My niece really wanted sushi so I looked around and found Tokyo Grill & Buffet. A few years ago, we went to another buffet in Charlotte but it has closed since then. There was another buffet closer to the hotel but we opted for Tokyo Grill & Buffet instead. 

Restaurant opens at 11 am but we arrived earlier and already saw people walking in. We were able to walk in and get seated at 10:45 am. Service was fast and prompt. The food is really good. Flavors are on point. For a buffet, I really like it. Desserts included ice cream too. I was surprised to see green tea flavor.

Our waiter is amazing. He refilled our drinks without us asking. Our dirty plates did not pile up, he came by and picked them up every time. We were all impress with his service. Next time, we're in town again, will stop and dine in again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I work close to it and love going for lunch. Great selection and I house 2-3 plates every time I go. Their sushi is awesome and the rest of the buffet includes hibachi, Chinese, some American, a salad bar and desserts."}
{"text":"Omg.... so good!! The best I've been to thus far. So many choices and all are so delicious. So many vegetables and meats. Even the American food is good. So many desserts.

It is packed in there and for a good reason. It's worth the scramble for the food."}
{"text":"Oh man I hate to knock off 3 stars when I truly did love this place but I discovered they changed the name because they got shut down for fixing the food out back on the ground by the dumpster. I never once had a bad experience here. But man I don't even know if we can ever go back knowing this happened and It sucks because their food really is good, see old review below. 

THIS PLACE DID NOT CLOSE DOWN THEY JUST CHANGED THE NAME TO THE RIVER BUFFET. Everything is exactly the same except the sign out front has a new name. See my original review below:


Don't waste your time or $$ going to any other Asian buffets in the Charlotte area. Tokyo Buffet blows them all to smithereens. I've been to sushi only buffets that didn't have the selection this place has. Seriously it is head & shoulders above buffet sushi pretty much anywhere I've ever been aside from perhaps RuSan's (in Atlanta, have never tried RuSan's in Charlotte but I hear they also do sushi buffet lunch). They also have a really big (and separate from the sushi thank God) hibachi build it yourself grill. The actual \"regular\" buffet itself is like 3x bigger than anywhere else. The food is always fresh and turning over because this place is always busy. We went here right before closing one night and it was still packed. Nothing but fresh. It's clean for a buffet, I don't feel sketched out about the quality or origin of what they serve like some places. It is also blessedly not full of MSG. I couldn't eat here if it was. They always have a huge variety of stuff. My husband and I live 45 minutes away but we still would rather go here than anywhere near us because those places suck so much and cost the same or more, we don't want to be disappointed. I wish I could get this place to open another location near us, but it's ok. Be warned though: once you try Tokyo Buffet, everyone else will just be too lame to bother with."}
{"text":"If you are craving for some shrimps and crabs...this is the place to go. I go here all the time with my family and the place has all the chinese menu you can think of. The salad is great and the fruits. Very tasty pineapples on the side. For all the food you will be eating...it's worth the price.
That only thing I noticed is that the floor is kinda needs some attention. Like...vacuum or sweep it up..."}
{"text":"A gentleman was dining here and had a medical emergency requiring 911.   He was unconscious.  911 was called and the man was taken outside to the ambulance. 

The ambulance got ready to leave and the staff ran over to the table that the guy had eaten at, grabbed the bill and ran out the door after the ambulance because the bill wasn't paid.  

Really???!!!!    What's wrong with people. Not empathy at all.  It was a lunch $6 lunch bill.    pATHETIC!!!!!!!!!      Another family paid the bill and walked out!!!!   They actually took the money!!!       Merry Christmas to your pathetic restaurant!!!!!!!     No one in our section left a tip."}
{"text":"There comes a point in every man's (or women's) life when they need to branch out and really test the bounds of eating crappy. Enter these crazy lavish buffets. 

I'll be honest, I do have a weak spot for these places when I'm really hungry. As I found myself in this predicament the other night, and I had to follow up with the fancy Yelp app to see what was avail. Tokyo was an interesting find. 

Ultimately, I'd give a 4-star rating based on their selection, and a 2-star on their quality, meeting in the middle at a 3. Walking in I was pretty impressed by how the buffet is set-up and the amount of different items through-out the place. It got me fairly stoked about the meal.

Well, that's where the excitement ended. I just couldn't not find much of anything to my liking. I will admit, there were some items that were just mediocre, the rest were just felt loaded with MSG and generally not appetizing. The mac n cheese was like the sorriest excuse for mac n cheese on the face of the planet. It was literally so watered down I could probably call it noodle soup. Even my kid wouldn't eat it.

A few other pro's are that there is more than adequate seating, it does have a good layout, and generally pretty clean considering how some people eat here:-/

If you happen to frequent Tokyo, do yourself a favor and go either fresh hibachi or straight to their sushi section."}
{"text":"As usual the buffet is always well stocked and everything is fresh and hot. The servers are very attentive and keep your drink full. No complaints from me at all."}
{"text":"I would rather eat anywhere else other than a buffet. If i had the choice of buffets though, I would come here. My family has been coming here since they have opened because it's spacious enough to accompany my huge family and has a wide selection of food. 

The best thing about this buffet is the amounts of seafood they have. Many Chinese buffets have started to charge extra for crab and I can see why, but it steers people away. They don't have crab legs here, which kinda sucks, but imagine how much profit they could make off of that. I love the chicken wings they have here! It's so succulent and the flavor is so different than other wings at other buffets. The sushi isn't half that bad for buffets either. Some things though I think could be a little more fresh. It wouldn't hurt to have different choices of fruit or putting out a little less gruesome looking oysters. No matter what though, Tokyo will still be my family's one stop buffet until a better one opens up around the area."}
{"text":"My friends (3) and I (which makes 4) decided to go here for their 350+ item buffet. Of course, since it's Sunday, all of the local overweight \"Christian\"/church going 'folks' attend after their weekly worship, so there was a brief 10-15 minute wait.

Decor: It's Asian-esk with their Asian shrines, \"KOI\" pond, etc. The place has enough seating and was fairly well-maintained. 

Food: The food wasn't actually bad for buffet. It was pretty good for it to be so many items. The seafood seemed fresh enough (there's no really fresh seafood in Charlotte being that I'm from the DMV - land of blue crabs). The hibachi station has several options to choose from and they make it for you right on the spot, which is amazing! The American items I did not try because who wants Asian-ized American food (I don't), so I mainly stuck to the seafood and hibachi. I had about 2-3 plates, which was more than enough. 

Service: It was pretty good, but they should ask if you're done with your plate especially if it's food still on it! I'm not too keen on wasting food. 

Overall: I would go back for lunch, when it's cheaper, but you can't beat that broad of a food menu @ that low of a price. 

Regards,

TrizzyO_o"}
{"text":"This place is your typical asian buffet. I've passed by here many times but I've never been inside. It's sort of tucked away in the shopping center with Big Lots, I think it's in the same place where the old Party City use to be. This restaurant is pretty huge inside. 
They have everything on their buffet. From traditional chinese dishes like seasme chicken and general tso's chicken, dumplings, seafood to make your own hibachi to sushi. They have something for everyone. Their hibachi station was pretty good. A variety of meat and seafood options with rice and noodles and as assortment of veggies. If I come back, my first stop will definitely be the hibachi station."}
{"text":"This place is really bomb, lots of options and the price is great! Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow

I'm sure $10 is an opening price because it's so amazing. The food is incredible quality- the sushi by far is so good. I wish I had more to say but just GO here to eat and see."}
{"text":"This is a REAL Hibachi Buffet! I mean what! Really??? Okay, so think about the best Chinese buffet you've ever been to.... & now think about any Japanese Hibachi place....& fuse them together! So those were the PROS! Now 4 the CONS... they don't cook the food in front of you at your table while you sit. No fire tricks or tossing food into your mouth. However the food is cooked in front of you at a grill station. He may do a fire trick if there's a crowd around & he wants you to put a tip in the tip jar. He also may walk away & go into the back. Loll. The food is amazing at the buffet. However the Hibachi food...beef, chicken, & shrimp.... looks iffy. Its not moist or mouth watering & juicy. Its thin sliced & dry. The idea is great, but its no Kabuto! The lunch prices are very reasonable & hostess & servers are very nice & friendly. You don't have 2 wait for your drink to be Almost empty or worry about them rushing you by giving you your ticket/check too soon. The buffet options are endless & always fresh. Enjoy! Look up Frenchi' J. On YouTube to see my Birthday experience here. Where I show the food & the establishment!"}
{"text":"Great buffet.   The food was awesome.   I loved it.  The seafood was delicious.   The staff was kind and real nice.  AWESOME

{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese buffets that I have ever been to. The selection was amazing and no matter the style of food I chose it was all fresh and delicious. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Last year, I was dining here and a rat ran out across the dining room floor. All of the customers were in an uproar and yelling. The managers tried to act like it was an Oreo and like we had not seen it. They also still made people pay for their food even if they left. I used to love this place until them. Today I viewed a news article about them violating health standards by preparing food outside on the filthy ground. DON'T EAT HERE. Find another Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"You would think I learned my lesson a long time ago. Buffets are a no no, unless its $40 pp.
I'm not a germaphobe but fahgetaboutit.
1- The carpet is disgusting.
2- The patrons are all sneezing and coughing into their hands and using the serving utensils.
The chicken dishes i.e. Sesame- General Tao's all breading.
The food was just not what one would call good. If your not fussy about quality the huge variety is there to stuff yourself.
I say- \"nay-nay\"!"}
{"text":"Best buffett I have been to, bar none.

Huge place for big groups.

Now, not everything is awesome but with the Hibachi and Sushi bars, you can't go wrong.  I get those every time plus the fried dumplings and salt and pepper chicken.  The ice cream is good, too.  All for $8.22 at lunch as of the date of this review.  I always head back to work super stuffed.  Only thing I wish they had was low-sodium soy sauce (picky, I know).

Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Now I'm not too keen on Chinese buffets, but when you're a broke college student this will suffice. Great lunch deal with student discount (I think it's $8?) and dinner's deal isn't bad either ($11 if I'm not mistaken). they have a full range of foods from sushi to hibachi and all the other Chinese goodness in between. Fast service, cleanliness and a full belly is what you'll find at this establishment."}
{"text":"They have sashimi and nigiri style sushi.  You can get salmon (sake), tuna (maguro), and yellowtail (hamachi) in either style.  The bad news is that they are chronically slow at putting this food out, especially the sashimi.  I put up a picture illustrating the problem, I visited the sashimi section twice over the course of 20 minutes and that picture represents what it looked like the entire time.

Another problem is that this is the worst yellowtail I have had anywhere in Charlotte.  It is tough - a hybrid between eating a raw potato and eating actual yellowtail.  The color and flavor are both off as well, the yellowtail is opaque and not a hint of pink.  There are plenty of pieces with bright read streaks are far thicker than they should be because they are cutting the fish to maximize the volume and they overdo it.  I suspect they are using leaner yellowtail caught in the US instead of the heavier fish raised in Japan.

With all those negatives you are in for a treat if you like salmon and you can find any.  They don't mess up he salmon, and the tuna is alright.

All the other items are typical of a Chinese/Mongolian/Japanese buffet (not the three separately, it is typical of any place that offers all three).  You have the ubiquitous and over doughy dumplings and won-ton, multiple varieties of heavily breaded and deep fat fried chicken (pepper, Tso's, sesame), chicken wings, pizza, overcooked prime rib (calling it prime rib is misleading).

This place can probably pass for a 3 or 4 star when they have the good stuff on display but as is typical for these types of places they open strong and then reduce the quality hoping you will keep coming and strapping on the feedbag.

Tokyo Grill & Buffet suffers from the same problem as all its counterparts: it looks the same, it tastes the same, and the flavor / quality is lower on any dish than if you ordered the individual dish at a normal restaurant.

I usually enjoy the variety of a buffet but at this buffet the food all tastes so similar that there is little variety.  Unless you want to indiscriminately shovel food into your face I would skip this place.  In the alternative you could buy 1lbs to go of the sashimi for $4.50 and stick to the salmon and tuna - this way you could make yourself a boat load of sushi at home for very cheap.  I doubt they will keep letting people buy 'sashimi' grade sushi for $4.50/lbs so get it if they have it while they allow it."}
{"text":"The food is cheap for a buffet. My kids like this place. I'm not a fan! Walking in is nice and gave you that Asian feel and look. Decor is nice and they have a fountain with water and fish. To me the place could be a little more cleaner

The food: 
The have a wide selection of from seafood to meat to Sushi and more. Here one reason why I'm not a fan.... some of the food is old (for the food items that a lot of people don't get) and cold. Instead of them throwing the food away when it's old they just add the fresh and hot food and Mixed it with the old food."}
{"text":"Our favorite buffet to go to. Went for Mother's Day and was not disappointed, thy handle large crowds well and never ran out of food."}
{"text":"I took my kids here on Saturday night. The buffet was delicious. Of course at a buffet there will be hits and misses but I would say 90% of the dishes the kids and I tried we liked. The hibachi was very yummy with a great selection of items. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Quality Asain food. The lobster is a hit or miss. Somtimes they serve unfresh lobsters.  Probably cheap black market lobsters that has been dead too long before being cooked."}
{"text":"WOW! Visiting from out of town and so glad we stopped! 

This place was extremely clean first off, and the food was outstanding. It has an amazing selection of seafood, which I was told by a reliable source was amazing! ( I can't stand seafood, but my mother, whom was with me, would sell her children in a heartbeat if it meant she could eat seafood.)

The sushi and Hibatchi bar had lines, but worth the wait. 

It was PACKED! Keep that in mind if you are nervous in crowds. We went on a Saturday, so I'm sure that had something to do with it. There were several large groups of people there celebrating one thing or another and several small parties (2-4) waiting to be seated. Some waited 20+ minutes to get a seat, a testimony to the deliciousness of the food. PLUS several Asian families were dining there as well. As with any foreign food place, if the people of that culture eat there, you know it's good.

Excellent place!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a great buffet. I have try many buffets in Charlotte, this is by far the best buffet in town. They have most varieties. And the food is always fresh and hot. This place is eater's heaven. I get them two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of buffets, but this is by far the best buffet I've been too. Still not my to go restaurant but my family loves this place! It's pretty clean for a buffet & cheap too! But the quality is the food is good, just needs to be heated more and it's not that greasy either. But the options are big!"}
{"text":"Good Asian food for a great price! The seaweed salad is pretty good and they have a wide variety of sushi too"}
{"text":"I have to say, this is probably one of the best buffet in Charlotte. Possibly in NC. Of course, I am referring as an Asian buffet. Their sushi are excellent but I do wish they use less white fish inside of their rolls. One great thing is they offered small portion steak at their hibachi so that's a bonus. Great choice of food and plenty amount so above average. The place also looks nice with good amount of seating. Another great thing is their lunch buffet is fairly cheap and they are a little cheaper when it comes to dinner and weekend buffet compared to other Asian buffet. One thing I dislike most about this buffet is every single time I eat there, I end up stinking like buffet food. They need to do something about that; probably the fan isn't enough to filter the air and environment or their hibachi grill is just stinking up too much. Reason why they deserve a 5 star is because they were such a huge hit in a short period of time upon opening, within the year 2015."}
{"text":"Large buffet selection, but food is only okay. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive, helpful with refilling drinks & clearing dishes from the table. The buffet is inexpensive, but the food is just so-so. This might be a good option if you are very hungry & on a budget. I'm not a big buffet person, my husband is, however, & agreed with my assessment."}
{"text":"Huge selection of food my god , there's literally everything here . I wouldn't say it's the best quality food we've had but for $10 you can't get much better. It was so busy , but I'm presuming it's always like that . If you're in the area and hungry give it a try."}
{"text":"Amending this due to both my moms boyfriend and I getting food poisoning that I'm still dealing with 36 hrs later :( Will definitely not be back. Didn't notice until I was leaving sanitation score was 90, not saying that is why the food poisoning occurred but generally I dont eat at places below a 93."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and really enjoyed it. Huge buffet and good sushi too. Place is always packed so I must not be the only one who agrees. However I went tonight with a group of my friends and someone puked right beside our table. She couldn't even make it to the bathroom. So gross. Staff was apologetic and asked if we would like to move tables but we all decided to leave the restaurant right then and there. Id like to hope that the girl wasn't sick from the food, but not sure what else to think. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I am blown away by this place-
Nothing like any other spot in the area. The food on the bars was fresh, which is a surprise in and of itself being a buffet, they have the normal fare for a chinese buffet with several japanese items as well, a decent American section too. I don't eat buffet pizza, because I am a snob, but I have to say the pizza they offered actually looked tempting, which is a huge compliment from me.

Not only do they have the staples you expect (seseme and gen. Tso chicken, cheese wantons, egg and spring rolls, etc)
For i went for lunch on a tuesday (not a special day in my mind) and they had pot roast, ham roast, several fishes and more premium items, for no additional charge, as well as a sushi bar that rivals the better sushi buffet lunches in town, and a lovely hibachi.
All this for $7 at lunch, no drink. I feel like I robbed the place it was so cheap, i wouldve paid $10 for that lunch and still felt it was a superb deal.
I give four stars because thats the highest a non-Vegas buffet gets from me, they are top tier at what they do.
Kudos!"}
{"text":"This buffet just opened at University Blvd. It is next to Big Lots and there is a Home Dept inside the shopping center. I took my parents there to eat during lunch time. I am impressed how good the food were. They do have sushi there but it is gone very fast.My suggestion is to go early like 11:00 am. They have good Habachi place and all sort of foods there. Dad likes the chicken wings there. For 6.99 it is cheap and you do get the quality of the food. Inside of the restaurant is very pretty and clean. For dinner is 9.99. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets, however, if you are with a  family or group and on a budget, this is great value for your money! 
There was a short wait to be seated, but once taken to your seat, let the games begin!!!! 
There is something for everyone, starting with the hibachi grill, fixed your way! They also have a nice sushi selection if you're into that. Chicken prepared in a variety of ways, steak, ham fish and even octopus... Options are endless and the food stayed fresh as they were constantly switching it out, it was a busy Sunday. Plus the staff was friendly..."}
{"text":"The past 2 times I've eaten here I've gotten sick. When they first opened, they were on point but that went downhill very quickly. The sushi is always warm and I used the term \"sushi\" lightly. It's mostly fried with creamy stuff squirted on top. Either way, should be served cold in order to not spoil. The service is ok but the experience is miserable. It's always loud with screaming kids running around. I wouldn't mind paying a premium to keep the riff raff out and improve the quality of food but as is, I won't be back."}
{"text":"so so food is ok . This is my second time to feel the first time is better than this. The inside of the health environment so-so."}
{"text":"Reminds you of buffets when food was good and inexpensive! Service is great as well. They have a regular buffet but also have a sushi bar and hibachi grill as well!"}
{"text":"They have a variety of items, sushi and a hibachi grill. I wanted to love this place but the buffet items were always cold....meaning they can do better to make sure the food is at least warm. The fish was so rubbery! The egg drop soup was thick and looked like the egg yolk hadn't cooked in it....I swear I hope no one gets sick eating raw eggs.  It's big and clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I'm always impressed by the variety and selection. Last time we went we fasted all day in preparation because the food is too amazing to not try one of everything. The sushi bar has every sushi roll you could dream of and it all tastes great. I'm usually pretty hesitant to eat raw fish from a buffet (seems like a bad combination) but I haven't had any negative effects here. The hibachi grill is also something you should save room for. The only complaint I had was that they have fried crab instead of the steamed crab legs I love. But that can be overlooked since the food quality is excellent. The lower than average buffet price is a plus too. We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We eat here once a week to feed our giant kid.  He eats vegetables and eats healthy.  Love the sushi and my son loves the hibachi which is cook to order.  My husband loves the fresh fruit and seafood.  The food is delicious!!!!! I am a regular!  The price is very reasonable which keeps us coming back often."}
{"text":"This place could be a 4 star experience if you like sushi and catch them on the right day.

It has the usual grub (I call it grub because it is quantity of mediocre mainstream Chinese food), also the fried chicken, french fries, and pizza.

What makes this place stand out is that they have a decent variety of seafood, especially the sashimi and sushi.  Warning: I have been twice and the quality and quantity of the sushi has varied immensely.  On the weekend you can find sashimi if you are lucky - I never saw any sashimi during the lunch on a weekday.

I agree with the other review on Yelp that your best bet is to buy sashimi by the pound and go home and make sushi.  That is a bit too intense for most people but my real point is that this place doesn't beat RuSan's when it comes to sushi, but RuSan's has no sashimi offered on the buffet.  You also rarely get yellowtail at RuSan's on the buffet.  Here the yellowtail can very widely in quality - one day I went and it was awful.  Another day I went and it was better than ok.

My review is so low for two reasons:
1) Inconsistency of quality of the food;
2) Inconsistency of availability of the food;

If you want to eat a lot of food and aren't picky then this place is fine, but you probably just want the absolute cheapest place to go.  I prefer the flavor of Indian buffet and mainly eat sushi at Chinese/Japanese/Random buffets.

I never tried the pizza and I never intend to.  I did make a concession and try the garlic toast - ok flavor but mushy and gross on the inside and dried hard on the edges.  It was cooked like a hot pocket: all wrong."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, helpful and friendly staff.  I have enjoyed everything I have had here, and am particularly happy that they have sashimi!  I have not seen that at other buffets.  It's an enjoyable experience overall, but first and foremost is the delicious food."}
{"text":"Horrible food. I'm not quite sure what taste buds would suggest this was a great place to eat. My entire party was dissatisfied with the overall flavor of the food. It was very much least desirable.
Fried soft shell crab tasted like catfish. The jello had an almost rubbery texture. Ever had sushi that had too much sauce? Hibachi plate was overcooked. Children running around without supervision. Adults not saying \"excuse me\" while serving themselves and bumping into people.

All around an experience that won't be repeated."}
{"text":"For the longest time, I ignored this place thinking it's just another Asian buffet. Then I read the reviews on Yelp and the photos made me want to try this place \"right now!\"
So husband and I went here for dinner that night. We were amazed at how much seating and food choices they have in here! We were promptly seated, and the server took our drinks order. Husband headed to the sushi bar (it was surprisingly good!) and I loaded my plate up with crawfish and stuffed crab and frog legs and shrimp and what-not. It was ALL delicious! Husband loved the sushi. Soups are good too.
The very uncommon (in a good way) thing I noticed was that they have a wide selection for every palate. Lots of Chinese, Thai, Japanese (Hibachi too) choices, but also have pizzas and American fare for the non-Asian palate. They also have a huuuuge number of dessert offerings and fruit and salads. 6-8 different flavors of ice cream too. I only wish that they would label their desserts better for people with allergies/sensitivities.
Even if you find yourself here on a day when it's super busy and they tell you you have to wait, go ahead and wait. The restaurant is very efficiently managed and usually your wait time will be much shorter than what they tell you. On Valentine's Day they told us the wait was 20 min, but we got seated in under 10."}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I went to a Chinese buffet but it's been years. We came with some friends for lunch. Let me warn you, this buffet is huge and there are a wide array of options on the menu. It was a decent buffet and rather clean. There is a hibachi section and a sushi section. There is a lot of seating and this would be a good place for groups. Prices are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"The sanitation rating has been creeping closer and closer to the 90 mark and it's pretty easy to see why.  The food has gone from consistently good to very much hit or miss. It is a buffet and I understand the struggles but I always looked forward to trips here and that just isn't the case anymore."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent buffet, as far as buffets go. They just opened, so the place is new and sparkling clean. It gets busy FAST, so make sure you come just before lunch/dinner, or be prepared to wait a few, even with as many tables as they have.

The staff is pretty nice, and service is really good. They whisk away your old plates very quickly and courteously check in on you a lot.

There seem to be a lot of food options, but really only a few items for vegetarians. What they do have is pretty good. The food that I tried was decent and didn't seem to be overly laden with sugar, salt, or MSG. The corn on the cob, however, seemed like it'd either been steamed for about 5 days, or it was really old corn. Ick.

People seemed to go nuts over the frog legs and the sushi. I recommend the broccoli dishes and the hot and sour soup. I'm so picky about my soup. This soup, with a ton of pepper added, probably is a 3/5 in terms of restaurant soup. That's more than 2 points over what I give the usual suspects. The egg rolls were pretty good. My companions said the crab was hit or miss.

I'm not big on buffets, but I hang out with people who are. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"It was ok. Service was nice. Some food was phenomenal, some was less than stellar (enter sushi.) Sushi guy was mean. Best hot and sour soup I've ever had. I'd pay just to sit there and eat nothing but that all day. Coconut shrimp was awesome. Octopus was overcooked and tough. Mac and cheese tasted sweet... couldn't eat it. Overall, was average. I'd go back."}
{"text":"My family and I come here often when I don't feel like cooking. There's a large selection of food that pleases everyone in my family. My daughter gorges on sushi, my son eats up the appetizers and my husband eats everything in sight. Me? I prefer the hibachi. We've been coming here since it opened and it's the same guy doing hibachi by himself EVERY SINGLE TIME! The hibachi line gets super long but he never gets any help. I've heard people make stupid remarks to him and about him. Some complain about the wait time or there's not enough seasoning or whatever it is that stupid entitled people complain about. But the guy always smiles and continues on with his job. Maybe one day he'll get someone to help him. In the meantime, I make it a point to always tip him well (there's a cash tip jar) and talk to him if it's not too busy. He's not the only hard worker - the waiters are all super attentive as well. But the hibachi guy is the man! He's the main reason this mama picks this place for dinner cause let's face it - mama always gets what she wants!"}
{"text":"Took my kids here today for a late lunch and it was worth it!! This may be the best Chinese buffet I have had in a very long time! The place was clean, the staff was attentive and the food was VERY FRESH! They have a large selection to chose from and everything was hot and delicious(I tried it all lol) The hibachi grill cook was great and fast. The fruit was sweet and juicy and they even have Texas Pete hot sauce my daughters go to sauce for everything(I always have it in my purse when we eat out)  lunch buffet was $7.29 for me and the girls and 4.79 for my son. I will definitely be returning in the near future..this is not your typical Chinese buffet!!"}
{"text":"This is really a mixed restaurant with Japanese name but Chinese boss and Chinese waiters. Food is mostly Chinese and some American, Mexican. The only Japanese food might be the Sushi which is average level at most. Anyway this is really a cheap bufet and you can even get a discount if you bring a student ID with you"}
{"text":"We ventured in because of the sushi selection reviews. There is a huge selection off rolls/makis (they on working on labeling selections) and pretty respectable nigiri (salmon, tuna, yellowtail). Clean, our attendant is very nice and pleasant. Great meat selection and seafood selection. They have the hibachi grill.  overall better than rest i have been in."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed a nice dinner here after a day of moving family members to Charlotte. It is an incredibly expansive selection, including numerous sushi choices. The staff is very efficient and keeps everything filled at all times. I could've eaten 20 plates of the green beans alone. Delicious and not your normal Chinese buffet fare. The one complaint is that there are not many dessert choices and the ice cream area is difficult to navigate"}
{"text":"I always eat from the hibachi grill, it's always super yummy! I don't generally eat foods from a buffet but the food is good and the staff is always super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Have been waiting for them to open! Went tonight. Place is beautiful, clean, well lit, the staff is super friendly, even stopped to play with my 18 month old son and gave him a balloon, so hes a customer forever. The food selection is astounding! Many chinese, american and japanese dishes, ALL delicious. I had 2 very well stacked plates and never got to try everything that looked good. Huge sushi and hibachi stations, both very well stocked, and they even have an ICE CREAM SUNDAE station! All for $9.99 dinner and $6.99 lunch, which includes EVERYTHING! I have found our new go-to chinese place!"}
{"text":"After craving Chinese buffet for a while, I finally made a trip to Tokyo Grill. This place is pretty good buffet joint by far. I may have found a new favorite buffet! There are plenty of seats, good, and clean food. A lot of selections, the best hibachi, and the best sushi buffet I've ever had with inexpensive price. Sashimi is very huge compared to other sushi places. My favorite part is fried blue crabs. Hands down!
They have a lot of ice cream selections, plus they offer oreo cookies and whip cream, just wow.
4 stars for some menus that too sweet. 
Staffs are also very friendly and attentive.
I recommend this place if you are not picky and have very high expectations for a buffet place."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I understand that it is a buffet and buffets tend to lack quality but if the food is this nasty then the prices should be dropped a bit. ALL of the desserts taste dry. The waiter was nice and checked up on my table several times. I don't recommend coming here if you want quality. 
   When my table recieved our checks we had to walk to the front area to pay for it. One of the nimrods at the register couldn't do math so my buddy ended up paying an extra $5 because the worker was in denial and had a powerful belief that the $5 bill my friend had already handed him was nonexistent. Luckily my friend didn't really argue because it seemed futileso he gave the guy an extra 5 ."}
{"text":"Obviously trying to judge a restaurant is a very subjective thing to do. What I think is good, or great for that matter, you may think is terrible! In my 50+ years of life I've had the opportunity to eat at many so called 'Chinese buffets' from the left coast to the right coast and even one in Pittsburgh.

I was very excited when Tokyo Grill opened in the University City area and the first couple of times I ate there I was very pleased, especially with the sushi bar - and I'm picky about my sushi.

On a scale from 1 to 10 as restaurants go, in my mind most Chinese buffets fall somewhere between a 4, 5, or 6, and basically have the same menu items - give or take a few oddball items. Maybe only one or two I can remember in the past would I rate higher, Chen's Bistro when they first opened up was excellent, and Ding Hall back in the 70's (any native Charlotteans left out there remember that one?).

Because of the sushi bar this one always rated a solid 6 or 6.5 in my opinion. Today, after stopping by Tokyo at about 12:45 to eat lunch, I would have to say it has slipped back to a 4. I didn't have the sushi today, but if the overall cleanliness of the restaurant is any indication of the sushi bar I'm glad I passed. And whatever possessed the owners to put carpet in a high traffic flow/high turnover restaurant like this I'll never know. It looks like they haven't bothered to clean it since they opened - yuck! 

This restaurant in my mind is now nothing more than a 'stuff-n-puke', a good place to stuff your pumpkin with mediocre food and leave miserable!

I'm not here to recommend another Chinese buffet, but without mentioning a name there's another one right up the road across the street from the Hilton that is much better, at least for now. But who knows, a year from now it'll probably suck too!"}
{"text":"Dinner Buffett is only 9.99$ . It was very busy and food was coming out  quite often . My waiter was pleasant and kept our waters filled consistently .  They have a great variety of food  options to choose from . I'm personally in love with the salt and pepper crabs , I just love the seasoning on them and they are  quite meaty too . My only gripe with this place is the hibachi grill, this guy CAN NOT cook  that well . My food is always burned and just doesn't taste that great .  I try to just stay close and alert him when it's ready to my liking but yea.. Doesn't work that well . So now I just avoid it altogether .  Otherwise it's a good place to eat for a relatively low cost . It's not the BEST Chinese style food but it's filled with many options,low cost and quick."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm a regular and a huge fan! Hibachi Place and regular buffet bars all have great options and hibachi is included! Sushi selections are great too with sashimi! So many types of fresh fruits in the desert bar! All for a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the fact this a buffet, so expectations were based upon that. I went with a party of 7 and we were seated right away. The food was good. I went for the sushi and was not disappointed. It was fresh and tasty. The other seafood was good as well. My family enjoyed the other foods. Everything was hot and tasted good. Only negative thing was the people that were next to us, but you can not control who comes to the business. I will eat here again. You can not go wrong for $10.00."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon Tokyo Grill & Buffet because another buffet restaurant that we were going to go to was closed for remodeling. We actually ended up here after searching for another one on yelp. Thank you fellow yelpies! 

This place opened up in a strip mall that is close to UNCC next to Big Lots. If anyone has been in this strip lately they know that a lot of the businesses have moved out and it is looking a little rundown. Even as we pulled up, my friend and I kind of gave each other a look like \"are we sure about this?\" But do not let the outside discourage you! 

This place is AWESOME!! The buffet has everything you could ever want! There are Chinese, Japanese, and American options. They have sushi and hibachi stations. The buffet has tons of seafood options. 

The price for the buffet is steal. It is only $6.99 for lunch and $9.99 for dinner. With all of the amazing options on the buffet it would be hard to leave this place and not feel like you got your money's worth. In fact, you are going to leave this place feeling like you stole from them! That's how good it is for such an amazing price! 

Lots of businesses in the University area seem like they struggle to stay in business. My hope is that place will be able to survive."}
