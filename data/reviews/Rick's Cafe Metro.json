{"text":"Have stopped in for lunch at least twice this year whilst in town for training nearby.  Both times well pleased with the sandwich and found the service friendly and efficient. They even have outdoor seating if it's not too flipping hot."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a couple of times for specialty coffees and a protein smoothie. The staff is personable and the drinks are delightful. There is indoor and outdoor seating to suit your fancy. I don't know if there is wifi, but you can certainly spend time there as well as get a caffeine boost. I'd award five stars for more hours!"}
{"text":"This cafe is excellent! The young man working there is very friendly and kind which made our short visit very pleasant. The spicy pozole is amazing and if your looking for an iced coffee I definitely recommend a caramel iced latte."}
{"text":"As an occupant in the building I have come to rely on Rick's for breakfast and lunch on many occasions.  Great staff and great food.  If you have an office in the complex you cab get your food delivered.....   p.s. they make the best Posole"}
{"text":"Wanted coffee on my way to work. Just picked this spot because it was on my way. I'm so glad I did! They made my coffee just the way I wanted it! Didn't eat, but it sure spelt good! Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Great service and very clean!  I was Impressed to find a great Resturant in Phoenix near metro center mall! Great sandwich and breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"Dope little chill spot ... spinach breakfast burrito w chipotle was bomb.  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"So glad this cafe is so close to my job. The food and the service is great.  One really big plus, THEY DELIVER!! Yes they take cash or card.  There is a great young man who works there, his name escapes me. But, he is super friendly always has a smile on his face."}
{"text":"Cute lil spot ! Staff was super friendly ! Thanks guys for my coffee before I hit my 5 hour drive home! See ya next time I'm in AZ !"}
{"text":"I stopped by just before closing time, 4:00 p.m.  I was met by a very happy and sanguine young man, who explained all the options he had to offer; however, all I wanted was a cookie and latte as I was finishing up a nice bike ride.  The latte was great, as was Grandma's Chocolate Chip Cookies.  I plan to return earlier in the day next time to sample more of his wares.  And the prices seemed reasonable."}
{"text":"Really cheap decent coffee ($1.60 per 16 oz, $1 if you bring your own cup) and free refills in this hole-in-the-wall, but nice, place. Clean space, friendly service...and the soup of the week, spicy pozole, was to die for. Highly recommend this unexpected treat."}
