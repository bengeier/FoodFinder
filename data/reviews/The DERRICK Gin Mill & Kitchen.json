{"text":"I've been to the The DERRICK twice and both times the food was really disappointing.

The first time I ate here, I had the smoked meat sandwich which was nothing remotely close to traditional smoked meat and had an odd taste that I questioned with every bite.

The burger I had at a later visit was dry as hell and tasted like one of its main ingredients were cigarette butts.

Never again.  Gross"}
{"text":"I went to the Derrick for a few drinks on a Friday evening and have to say it's a great spot to really chill out, have a few cocktails and catch up with a friend. 

I tried the Payday cocktail and loved it! It was the perfect drink for my taste, not too sweet but went down super smooth. The bartender was friendly and created my cocktail super quickly.

The decor of the Derrick seemed like they were going for a rustic cabin in the woods feel. Not sure how I personally felt about the cow and buffalo heads mounted on the wall but I suppose it adds \"character\". 

I would recommend the Derrick to a friend and I would also like to come back to try the food sometime. I'll update my review later, but so far so good!"}
{"text":"I loved every aspect. The server, (Meg I think?)  was so sweet and fast and helpful and gave us the best service! The cocktails were so incredible and so creative!! I've had a lot of cocktails in my life, so I'm amazed that they had so many flavour combinations that I've never seen before. The ingredients were all of the highest quality and I will go back there again and again and again for them! The food was excellent too! The whole menu was right up my alley and the food came out in a timely manner and was fresh and beautiful. But again, it was the excellent service that really set them apart! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful rustic brick atmosphere.  Bison and longhorn mounts.  Meals were unique and excellent around $20 each but portions are small so some people were still hungry (note to staff: a way to ameliorate this is to provide complementary bread).  Had to order a couple sides of fries to fill the gap.  Turnips, pickled zucchini, barley in beet sauce were all tasty.  Chateau Briand was very good.  Beers on tap.  Cocktails.  They have one TV screen for the Flames fans.  Server was excellent and wearing a classy black dress.  Only complaint was that the piped in music was too loud forcing patrons to talk over the music (as such, not the best for a date)."}
{"text":"Went for a couple of gin cocktails and ended up getting the large charcuterie platter too.

Loved the variety of gins, plus the option to pick your tonic. Great to be able to go somewhere that has all these options for you to play with.

Large charcuterie platter was indeed large and more than any of us were expecting. Great cheese options and all very tasty. 

Have been when they have a band on and it can be exceptionally loud. Not sure why anyone feels the need to turn it up that much in a small venue. We could hardly hear each other talk that night. Will be back, just not when they have music."}
{"text":"Great little spot with amazing albeit expensive drinks. If premium cocktails are what you are after, this is the spot. Enough unusual and rare spirits to make your head spin. Of note; they have one of the best smoked meat sandwiches in the city in my opinion. It's very undersold on the menu but features some killer brisket. Really tasty. Despite being a gin bar they also have a great beer selection of local and western Canadian varieties. Good service. Great decor. On a personal note, they really need to partner with Big Rig Distillery out of Nisku, AB.  Fits the MO."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent drink presentation. Some highballs came with a straw or no straw. Side of tonic first round next round they just poured it in my drink. Level of side tonic 3/4 full or full.  Hendricks gin first round with lime next one with cucumber! Not sure what the hell they're doing but this is supposed to be a bar the \"specializes\" in  high end cocktails/ drinks. WTH very disappointing. Probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Such a great place for our first meal at the Big Taste Yyc. We had both tasting menus and they blew my mind. The mushrooms on toast are a must, just like everything else we had. The prices are great and the gin is unreal. I would go back again any time. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Part hipster cocktail joint, part fine dining, part rigger bar. I'm as confused as a roughneck's sleep schedule by you in some ways, but in other ways I quite like you. One thing's for sure, your gin cocktails are a damn fine way to celebrate some time away from the oil patch.

Let's go with \"hipster cocktail bar with the intent of attracting oil and gas workers.\" A few years ago? Brilliant. With today's oil prices... Well, let's just hope everyone is still at the bar for happy reasons.

It's an upscale casual joint that you would feel comfortable hitting up after work while still rocking the suit. But let's face it if you're an oil & gas exec you probably live in that thing.
It also seems like a lot of guys are comfortable hanging out here in their Carharts too. But let's face it, if you're on the operations side you probably live in those too.

Slogan -  DERRICK Gin Mill: The OGs of O&G. That's for you. You can have it.

Drinks - Kickass cocktail creation with a heavy gin influence. I was really infatuated with a liquorice Negroni. Sweet, with a bunch of liquorice bitter and some nice gin bite. If you like your classic cocktails, go here. 

I also wrapped my lips around \"The Roughneck's Old Lady\". Shh, don't tell. She's topped with a cointreau foam. Fluffy orange deliciousness.

The beer selection is more what I'd suspect for an oil and gas bar. Craft cocktails, sure, but nothing but the big name beers. Maybe for that one guy in your group who just won't jive with the adventurous cocktail scene? If you won't order gin at a gin mill, you're probably just going to order a Budweiser anyway. It makes sense to me.

Their menu throws yet another curve ball. It's traditional Alberta in some ways but with a healthy dose of unexpected. They don't follow in the Gastropub ways that Calgary has become accustomed to, but instead looks to be a little more... fine dining? Yeah, fine dining. Like a mix of Alberta roots and fine french cuisine. I'd like to go back and see what it tastes like. You've piqued and puzzled my interest, DERRICK. I'll see you again."}
{"text":"First word I would use to describe the Derrick is #wow.  I have been taking clients to the Derrick for lunch and cocktails over the last few months. Some weeks I've been there everyday. My clients are thrilled with the entire experience. The food is like none other I've come across in Calgary. The prices are entirely reasonable. The staff are incredible and always dressed to the nines. The cocktails are outstanding and the entire bar staff are extremely passionate about the creations  they make. They create all there syrups from scratch.  My most favourite menu item is the beef tar tar. Absolutely the best I've ever had. The chicken cordon blu is simply delicious. It's served with asparagus and mushrooms and a cauliflower compote. The portions are exactly perfect. My other fav is for sure the Montreal meat sandwich.  They smoke it for 12 hours and it melts in your mouth. I often order just a side of the meat. This is the place to be if you are in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"We love this Bar!  Staff are friendly and service is wonderful..  The menu is unlike any other I have come across in Calgary.   The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.

{"text":"Loved girl at front, and bartenders they were so nice! Loved my gin cocktails tried 2 different kinds, but thought they were $9.00 on happy hour, but not!! 3.00 off and it costed $11.30 each! Yikes!! Ordered steak frites and got a small portion of flat iron steak with thin fries and arugula salad, it was okay but bartender forgot to order it, and it was nothing special for $ 24 !!

It was loud, and young yuppie, and business crowd so I felt out of place!! 2 guys recommended the burger, but I had already ordered!! I was not overly excited about visiting here, but do love the cocktails, and good selection! 
Bartenders were young but very good at making drinks! Gotta try something else!!"}
{"text":"I came here for drinks after work twice and I have to say that food was better than I expected both times!! I had the beet salad and the salmon carpaccio and both things were really good!! The chicken as a main dish also exceeded my expectations as it's way better than a normal bar food ... wine is also not bad ... and service was good .. in general, nothing to complain .. I would go back there!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab drinks after work with coworkers. Quiet, friendly service, and great ambiance! I can't believe I hadn't heard of this place before a coworker suggested it. Wide drink selection and good food."}
{"text":"Such a strange concept - Oil and Gas bar with high priced food but decent drink prices.
It somehow worked though.  I had a great time even despite how busy and loud this place was on a Friday night.
I had the burger and it was delicious - peppered really well and great toppings.   I didn't order any cocktails here, but the people I came with really enjoyed the wide variety of gins.  
Will definitely have to come back when I can drink and try their gin and tonics.
Service was great, and although the prices for food were quite high, I would definitely go back."}
