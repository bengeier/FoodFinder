{"text":"Yo, ho, yo, ho a greasy life for me!

Pirate's Fish (ampersand) Chips was my first experience into the ever so popular UK \"Fish (ampersand) Chips\" lifestyle. As a matter of fact I don't really even enjoy seafood to begin with....that must be why I liked the food here the first time I visited it. I went with my totally cool Yelper buddy \"Fatso\" (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TQo2DFe6O6LWALv_awgcCQ) and have been back a few times since our initial visit. We actually have not visited the Chandler establishment, we go to the Gilbert one (Warner and Gilbert Rd area).

The Ambiance: OK well ambiance is a bit of an excessive word in this case, but it is a room with windows a place to sit. To me this is BY FAR the worst part about this place. I honestly feel like I'm sitting in an ER waiting room, wondering if I'm going to see a doctor in the next 4 hours. The tables are made of the same material my kids \"little tykes\" outdoor picnic table is made of and they feel very grimy and in need of a serious power wash. There is no pirate paraphernalia nor any background music reminiscent of the high seas. The closest they come is when the 42\" Westinghouse LCD is set to ESPN and they have a special on either the Pittsburgh Pirates or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The Staff/Service: I would probably say that the the Staff and Service are right around \"par\" but they are real close to dropping to a quick \"bogey\" (sorry, got stuck on the ESPN reference there). The wait time for your food once you order it is probably 4x longer than McDonald's however the food seems a lot less complicated to make. There isn't an item on the menu that's not dropped into a fryer basket then removed after the timer sounds. I'm sure it's just the amount of time that God requires a frozen hunk of sub zero seafood to thaw in boiling hot grease but I WANT IT FASTER! For the most part the 2 employees that I have ever seen there are amiable, however you don't want to ask too many questions or get into heavy conversation. That would most likely prove hazardous to your health as the wrong spoken word or impatient glance would most likely push them over the edge of  complacency, to postal. Just smile and nod, smile and nod. :)

The Food: Since I didn't know what I would like decided to go with the phrase \"I'll take one of everything\". Fortunately they had a combo meal that gave you a nice sample of all the different \"fish type\" products. Not being a fan of seafood turned out to be a GREAT thing at this restaurant because I was served a huge basket of sizzling hot french fries topped with pounds of batter dipped.......batter! I found out that somewhere in the middle of the batter dipped batter there was in fact a small portion of \"fish type\" product. It's kind of like eating a \"tootsie pop\"except the other way around.....the batter is the best part, as opposed to the crappy hard candy you have to get through to eat the tootsie roll. 

The Price: The bright spot here is that the pricing is rather inexpensive however if you stop and think about what your eating it kind of makes sense. Most everything is frozen, processed and covered in batter. Everything on the menu can be ordered as a meal with fries and a drink for around $5 - $6. If you'd like to \"super size\" your meal you can actually throw in pieces of fish, shrimp, scallops or crab \"A la Carte\" to meet your stomachs needs. 

All in All: All in all I CANNOT figure out why the hell I keep going back to Pirates Fish (ampersand) Chips!!!! I HATE the atmosphere, I don't care for the employees, the tables irritate the heck our of me and the food is unhealthy, deep fried and CHEAP! The food is unhealthy, deep fried and cheap. REDRUM REDRUM REDRUM The food is unhealthy, deep fried and cheap. The food is unhealthy, deep fried and cheap.  

.......oh yea, thats why.....yum!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like Pirates but had to mark it down.  Got the fried shrimp, chicken nuggets, fries and onion rings.  Shrimp was fantastic, however, the fries had an awful aftertaste like they were cooked in old oil.  The chicken nuggets were processed chicken and mediocre at best.  The onion rings looked like they were going to rock but ended up being bland with zero flavor.  Really, really disappointed.  We'll drive to Tempe or Mesa and hit up Petes instead."}
{"text":"Not unredeemable. Service is horrible. Offers call ahead ordering, but nobody answers the phone. Sat behind 2 cars in drive-thru for 15 minutes. When I got to the window, I saw 3 teenage workers doing pretty much nothing. Shrimp is done in a funky style - not very tasty though. While the fish is obviously a pre-frozen thing, it's actually pretty good. Burgers are somewhere between McD's and a gas station hamburger. Fried chilies were pretty tasty & the fries were good."}
{"text":"This was our first visit there and I must say it was decent.  Not spectacular food, but good.  Great prices and not overly greasy.  The fries were not very good, soggy and limp, but we didn't go for the fries anyway.  Super fast service. Cash only though. Will definitely return to try other items."}
{"text":"This place is a sorry knock off of the original petes fish and chips. Don't waste your time or money you will be very disappointed.  Poor quality food!   Pirates has NO affiliation with petes fish and chips like it says in the bio."}
{"text":"I'd never eat here again, even if they paid me to.

Being a born-and-raised Mainah, I was really craving some fish and chips. My brother was in town and we went together. When we received the food we were appalled. The \"fish\" was literally just a thin, overcooked patty that was quite obviously a pre-made frozen food. 

The fries, scallops and shrimp were the same. Factory-made frozen food that they heat and serve. 

Literally, that's it. They just open a bag, heat it up, and serve it. They don't prepare anything here. 

Oh, and if you want sauce? They charge extra."}
{"text":"This place sucks I waited 15min and I was the only car just so I could get tasteless. an they only take cash. And the food made me sick as a dog. Where is PETE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with pirates! Priced nice and the food is good. And it's been around forever."}
{"text":"Cash only. Drive-through isn't big enough for you to pull out so when you can't pay in their desired method you'll have to wait for the whole drive through to clear out. Then the guy on the intercom gets snippy with you. This was my first time trying the place I didn't even get to try the food I won't attempt it again. I had enough time to write this entire review while waiting in the drive-through..."}
{"text":"Pregnancy cravings!  They say your body knows when it needs nutrients, and there's time when I just need to eat liver or oysters (I'm guessing iron right?).  Liver is rare and out of fashion, so I precall my order in to avoid the wait... and then crunch down on the 10 or 15 pc oysters ALL BY MY LONESOME.  nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Went here one time and it was horrible \"heat it and eat it\" food.  Took forever and it was not worth the wait.  Never again."}
{"text":"FIVE STARS!

This place is a hole in the wall restaurant. Takes 5-15 minutes to get your order after paying. But I eat here all the time and you should too.
The customer service here? FANTASTIC. Always smiling, always polite.
The food quality? FANTASTIC. Yes, the food is frozen and probably not purchased locally, but it always tastes delicious and is aways crispy and hot.
Their prices? CHEAP!!!

Check this place out for lunch or on the way home, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Walk down the freezer isle at your local grocery store, grab the cheapest frozen fish that you can find, bring it home and cook it. Boom, now you have better food than this dump. Pirate's is absolutely disgusting... I can't believe that it is still in Downtown Chandler, especially with all the great options that are offered.

Save your money. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just no. You'd be better off buying a box of fish sticks. Fish and shrimp were all breading, completely processed, and the fries were soggy and inedible."}
{"text":"Getting cash is a pain in the arse!! Get square trade or visa! Geezus. Other than finding atm for cash. I love this grease bucket. It's great. Only had the shrimp and chips but I love it. Serious though they only accept cash."}
{"text":"This place is a bad copy of petes fish and chips. I figured I'd give it a try being I live a couple miles away bad decision I should have just drove the 7miles to Pete's Fish and Chips Mesa. The fish was real firm maybe it was over cooked maybe it's been frozen for a while I'm not sure. The fries just like other people have said was soggy. How do you make soggy fries isn't it deep fried.  I won't bother trying this place again"}
{"text":"Definitely get what you pay for. The food is extremely inexpensive but definitely not \"good eats\". This is our second time here and its only because we are waiting for our vehicle to be fixed in a nearby shop basically just last resort when we need a quick bite to hold us over The place is clean enough bit the food is not quality nore delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. I would only recommend to someone who's had too much to drink and needs something too absorb the alcohol. And even then, pay for plenty of extra sauce to make it palatable. I had the #1combo: fish, shrimp and fries. Gag!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were driving along deciding what to have for our dinner that night. As we were stopped at a light, I first saw Pirates Fish & Chips then smelled it. It SMELLED so GOOD, that we decided to pull in and get a sampling of their menu. 

While the aroma was intoxicatingly good, the items we ordered didn't deliver at all! We got, an order of the following menu items, their fish, crabettes, scallops, and chicken nuggets.

* The fish was in a square patty and smelled as 'fishie' as it tasted (not good at all). 
* The scallops weren't real scallops - but skate (a kind of inexpensive fish that tastes bitter & fishie). Scallops should be slightly sweet in flavor - not bitter. 
* The crabettes were made of breaded fried fake crab - EWWW! 
* Now you would think that chicken nuggets would be 'ok' but these were cheap and nasty as well.

All of the above was served was a loose (almost watery) sweet cocktail sauce - which I thought was gross & a side of fries. Now I liked the fries - but I like my fries to be on the slightly oily side and soft. My boyfriend as well as most people tend to like their French fries to be more on the crispy side.

We were both so very disappointed with the meal it got thrown away and my boyfriend went to Arby's. Much better!"}
{"text":"---- Update ----
Okay so me and a buddy went back to Pirate's yesterday and I have to say, I am saddened.  They have changed suppliers, and now the versions of their items are horrible.  The shrimp are just regular frozen jumbo shrimp, not the big globs of battered goodness as before.  Their scallops are about as big as my thumbnail and they looked horrible.  The fish is a square processed patty and the fries are skinny and cheap.
They even hired a second employee.  A lady who is not only rude, but smug while she is laying into you about how the tartar sauce doesn't come with your fish.  NO TARTAR SAUCE?!?!?! Its a fish and chips place!!!! In the end, we had to 'trade' (YES I SAID TRADE!) our Pete's, oops i mean Pirate's sauce for tartar sauce!  WHAT A JIP!

I am removing a star for this horrendous \"make over\". Because hey, if you're gonna change something, change the damn tables!

---- First Review ----
What can I say about Pirates Fish and Chips?  Well there are some good things and bad things (mostly good).  You could EASILY compare this to any number of fish and chip 'shacks' around the Phoenix valley, but this one definitely stands out.  

It stands out mostly because of its cleanliness (compared to other shacks) and the food itself.  I have been to the location on Warner and Gilbert twice now and both times it was clean, and the service was fast.  Everything on the menu is frozen, mind you, but it comes in large portions.  The service is great, they will actually bring it out to you even if you are sitting outside!  The food has been super hot (almost too hot) both times, so be careful when biting into those delicious crabby patties!

On the downside, the plastic tables are an eyesore, and should be wiped down more often.  They really don't fit well with the decor (Mural, flatscreens, etc..) and I wouldn't bring anyone to this place to impress them (solely because of the tables)"}
{"text":"I was nervous to try this place based on the reviews, but it's one of those places where you either love it or you hate it. Yes the sauce seems like watered down ketchup, and maybe it it's.. But it works with the food! It's not a gourmet fish and chips place but I actually liked the fish a lot better then I do at most Restraunts. It had enough seasoning and salt. The only down side was the fries.. They were just soggy . But overall satisfied."}
{"text":"This place isnt as bad as all these reviews make it out to be. I have come to this little drive thru ever since I was a kid with my parents. And we have had the food at various times where they more than likely changed suppliers.. With that being said, I am talking about the length of time this place has been here, the shrimp being cut, different size, but same breading. Which to me when a place is there for so long, and the food and the Shrimp and Chips (Which i have to say is the best thing to get here) goes along way showing that they are a good restruant with a huge customer base.

I did recently try the Crab and Chips.. I tasted just like I expected all this  time, no good....  (oh well, lifes a risk sometimes). 

Overall, Just stick to the shrimp and chips and the secret sauce is the best... Which is actual El Pato and Ketchup mixed together.."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Valley eating at Pete's Fish n Chips. This place has many similarities to Pete's. They even have their own little secret sauce for your fries like they do. But after eating here, it isn't quite the same. The menu consists of basically over-battered fried food - fish, shrimp, chicken tenders and burgers. The food wasn't bad but the service was. The lady at the window botched my order and blamed me when I returned it to her. I had to laugh because she was watching TV as she was taking orders and I observed most of the staff on their phones while cooking. Oh well. I live in Chandler and was hoping for a version of Pete's close by to occasionally eat at, but it looks like I'll have to drive out to the real one in Phoenix when I have a craving. btw.. they have a drive thru and are cash only."}
{"text":"This is kinduva wierd review for me to write as I am only giving Pirate's 3 stars but I love going there and will continue to. Sure the food is not great quality but there is a place in my heart and gut for cheap greasy fast food like the treats served up here. The fish and chips are exactlywhat you should expect for $4. Sure I would love to go down to Murphy's Law and get $15 fish and chips but sometimes I want to stop and just get a gut bomb instead. I look forward to touring the rest of the menu through the years."}
{"text":"Really ? Frozen fish patties ?  You'd expect more from an eating place so close to downtown chandler.  The wait tine was horrendous.  Squawk box really sucks.  My bad for going there."}
{"text":"Great fast food fish & chips joint!  We agree ,  either  you  love  it  or  hate it. If you want  something  to  remind you of going eat after a HS game with friends ,  this is it. If you want restaurant  quality  food ,  don't go to Pirates ,  go to Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack ."}
{"text":"I don't understand the 1 star reviews. The place gives you a lot of food for great prices. It's a heck of a lot better than Long John Silver. The fries could use some salt though. The shrimp is great.

It's cash only. That kind of sucks. But, I'm going again this weekend."}
{"text":"Been wanting to eat here for a while now and finally stopped by for lunch. I was expecting more. We tried the fish, shrimp, crab, fries. Seafood had zero flavor, fries were soggy and the \"pirates sauce\" was watered down hot sauce. Long john silvers is wayyyyyy better. I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Sorry I had this the other day had the shrimp and I got an upset stomach!! 
My mom threw it away, it's all pre-made and square like really!! 
But apparently it's a staple here sorry but ewww!! 

I could have gone to the market and bought Gorton's frozen fish better tasting!!"}
{"text":"They get one star for not fucking up my fried shrimp (And I'm being nice, it doesn't take a genius to know how to fry shrimp). Now, as for the other items, Fries were soggy (definitely not cooked 100%), fish filet had hair on it, crab is imitation crab. Sure, some may argue the chicken tenders are good but lets be realistic, they're chicken tenders. You want real chicken tenders? Go to Cane's or Slim's Chicken. Otherwise, you might as well just purchase the tenders from the deli at your local grocery store. At least there you get fully cooked potato wedges and other possible sides."}
{"text":"Lived in Chandler for 10 years and have just not gone here before this week.  Wow were our instincts spot on this time.
The deep fried \"fish\"-thing was tough and dried out clearly straight out of the bag from Costco.  
We didn't expect English pub level fish and chips but didn't expect how bad this was.
Next time we'll just call Perch or Fibber McGees for some to-go fish and chips or make them at home I guess."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and see a good number of people eating there. Finally I go. yuck! It was the worst fried food I ever tasted. Everything was fresh from the freezer,square fish, and you could see the salt lying on the batter. My husband and I threw the food out and went to Santan."}
{"text":"I had been to the location on University in Mesa and one other but today was my first time at this one that I can remember.  I got the oysters and \"chips\", only 4 for $6.50 with a ton of fries.  The flavor was good and they were moist and not too oily, just not very big.  I should have just asked if I could get only oysters and no fries as my daughter got enough with her chicken tenders to supply both of us.  

Her tenders were surprisingly good!  She got four large ones with the fries and a drink for $5.50.  I got a piece of fish on the side for a buck fifty that looked unappealing but was very good, moist and flaky not too greasy, good flavor.  I was expecting worse.  The fries were likely from frozen but I wouldn't expect much more from a place like this.  

The downside was no tartar sauce, no cocktail sauce, no malt vinegar, nothing to embellish either the fish or chips to make them a little more special.  But the place is cheap ad there was a steady stream of cars and people the whole time we were there.

The misting was helpful since there is no indoor seating and we had to sit at the table outside.  It was 110 or so.

Oh, and bring cash--no cards!

7110"}
{"text":"Arrived at the drive thru on 7-31-17 at 8:45 with 4 cars in front of me. They close at 9:00pm. I sat in line until I reached the window at 9:25. I was upset at the long wait and asked the man working the drive thru if a 45 minute wait was an acceptable wait time. He told me it was and if I didn't like it, walk up to the window to order next time. Horrible attitude and then flipped me off as I left. Food was ok, but not worth the wait. Never returning. If they really want to rip off Pete's Fish n Chips, they should at least work on matching their service. Good luck! I would leave 0 stars if allowed."}
{"text":"Nasty!  Fish is square like overstock freezer patties.  Shrimp was flat discs of ???  I do not think it was real shrimp.  French fries were barely cooked dripping with oil and soggy.  Had we not gone through drive through I would not have accepted the food.  We will not ever go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is in business. The food is worse than you find in the freezer section at Walmart."}
{"text":"Best food ever quick and fast best hamburger ever and fish and chips I like where it is walking distance and good price"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The fish was definitely fresh and fried to perfection. It's super good. The fries were also delicious with enough crunch. The sauce is fantastic. It's kind of like a spicy sweet and sour sauce. Price isn't too bad either. We got a 4 piece fish and chip with a small drink and it was barely under 10 dollars. Will come again whenever we crave fish and chip!"}
{"text":"We love this place!! I don't know why they have bad reviews but the chicken tenders are amazing and the #4 fills up my boyfriend and I for a good price! I will continue to come eat here! :)"}
{"text":"It's alright.  Walk up window and a drive through.  Improvements are being made to the sidewalk or patio area.  
I had the Shrimp and French fries after seeing the fish was a thin, square patty.  Shrimp was okay and the fries were good too.  Wish their Pirate sauce had a bit more substance so it could hold up to catsup cuz the flavor was good.  BTW, their Pirate sauce is their cocktail sauce.  
I might go back.  It's not bad at all.
Probably most disappointed that I couldn't get a small soda refill without chucking over more than half the price of a small soda."}
{"text":"It's great for what it is. Cash only seafood and sides. When you want to get away from the everyday and treat yourself to something you know you shouldn't have...deep fried everything and burgers. It's satisfying and fixes cravings to get you back on track.  Go for the fried shrimp or fish pieces. The burgers are pretty good too. The fries are bomb. 

Go ahead and go...you deserve it. 

EDIT:  It's my guilt pleasure."}
{"text":"Always a line to the street so I thought I would give them a shot. First thing to know is they ONLY TAKE CASH. Got the fish and chips and the fish was square patties that looked like ones you could get at the grocery freezer. Sadly the fries weren't much better as they were soggy. And if you are like a lot of fish eaters who like to dip their fish in tartar sauce, that's gonna cost you extra. 
Pass on this place and go down the street to Murphy's Law Pub and get theirs to go!"}
{"text":"I had the Fish and chips for approximately $8.50. Fish fillets are decent nothing spectacular about the taste or seasoning, it appeared that the fillets were store bought pre breaded fillets that were just fried to order. I would say long john silvers had better flavor. Size of fish fillets are nicely portioned. The French fries were not fresh and could use an over haul completely. The cocktail sauce was watery as soup. The line is normally wrapped around the block which captivated me to want to try the place out. Unfortunately the food is uneventful."}
{"text":"This place was damned fine. A small little joint that's been here for eons, they serve up tasty fried seafood and extremely tasty burgers. We stopped by here for an unhealthy lunch and we were extremely happy with everything- their fish and shrimp are fried to perfection, and their burgers have that 50's-style that nothing else can scratch the itch for. All in all, this is a great place to swing by and have a tasty bite to eat!!"}
{"text":"Yep never again.  

I came here with a friend of mine cause he was certain this was a Petes FishnChips.  I tried telling him it wasn't, but he was certain it was.  Once we got here and realized it wasn't it was too late.  Came during our lunch break so didn't have much time and figured why not.   

Well there's a reason this isn't Petes.  First I guess it is pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for.  I ordered a two piece combo.  Which is two pieces of fish with fries.  The fish was terrible.  Fist clue should have been that the fish was in a perfect square! (Processed all the way).  These literately seemed like they took fish sticks out of box from the grocery store. 

Everything was bland and fries were undercooked."}
{"text":"Not too bad, good prices, food was quick fish and chips. I've had better, I've a lot worse too..so middle of the road for me..but I left full :-)"}
{"text":"The worst fish & chips ever!!!! Do not eat at this place. For the quality of the food, it's way over priced. I won't even eat there for free. Everything taste frozen and nasty. It's better to buy the frozen fish sticks and fries at your local grocery store and just fry them up yourself and it'll still taste better than this place. Arghhh!"}
{"text":"I love the simple fast food here. The cashier is always nice and they never mess up my order. I love the sauce and it could be eaten with anything. My favorites items are: fried shrimp, fried fish, hot dog and the cheeseburger. Again, I love the sauce as it makes everything way better!"}
{"text":"Just like pete's fish and chips, french fries are a limp but fish is great"}
{"text":"Gross. Just skip it.

It's basically like eating 2 giant square fish sticks.

We also tried their cheeseburgers which tasted like they were grilled hours ago and super well done. Completely unedible."}
{"text":"Nice food for a Saturday night this place is been here for years and is continued to be part of downtown Chandler here is a glimpse of the City Hall building"}
{"text":"Best food ever!! Ignore those other nasty reviews about this place, it's above my expectations every day when I come here! Friendly customer service while enjoying a very satisying meal."}
{"text":"Grease galore!  This place is a fantastic stop for a snack.  They've got several locations, and it's easy to miss if you don't realize you're looking for a small, free-standing restaurant on the west side of Arizona Avenue in Chandler.  I had the crab sticks (imitation crab covered in batter and fried) and fish.  It was less greasy than Long John Silver's, and the price was about the same."}
{"text":"So many reasons not to eat here.
Cash only.
The shrimp are some kind of shrimplike substance in a crunchy batter. Not bad, but definitely not fried shrimps.
The fish patties are kind of like fish, but in a Square Bob format.
Fries are pretty good!
Service was ehhh. I just don't understand why they are still here?"}
